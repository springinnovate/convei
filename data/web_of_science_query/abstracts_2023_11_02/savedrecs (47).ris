TI  - Detection Threshold Estimates for InSAR Time Series: A Simulation of Tropospheric Delay Approach
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method for estimating the detection threshold of InSAR time-series products that relies on simulations of both vertical stratification and turbulence mixing components of tropospheric delay. Our simulations take into account case-specific parameters, such as topography and wet delay. We generate the time series of simulated data with given intervals (e.g., 12 and 35 days) for temporal coverages varying between 3 and 10 years. Each simulated acquisition presents the apparent noise due to tropospheric delay, which is constrained by case-specific parameters. As the calculation parameters are randomized, we carry out a large number of simulations and analyze the results statistically and we see that, as temporal coverage increases, the amount of propagated error decreases, presenting an inverse correlation. We validate our method by comparing our results with ERS and Envisat results over Socorro Magma Body, New Mexico. Our case study results indicate that Sentinel-1 can achieve approximate to 1 mm/yr detection level with regularly sampled data sets that have temporal coverage longer than 5 years.

TI  - Crop Biomass Mapping Based on Ecosystem Modeling at Regional Scale Using High Resolution Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the potential of using a process-based ecosystem model (BEPS) for crop biomass mapping at 20 m resolution over the research site in Manitoba, western Canada driven by spatially explicit leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance throughout the entire growing season. We find that overall, the BEPS-simulated crop gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and LAI time-series can explain 82%, 83%, and 85%, respectively, of the variation in the above-ground biomass (AGB) for six selected annual crops, while an application of individual crop LAI explains only 50% of the variation in AGB. The linear relationships between the AGB and these three indicators (GPP, NPP and LAI time-series) are rather high for the six crops, while the slopes of the regression models vary for individual crop type, indicating the need for calibration of key photosynthetic parameters and carbon allocation coefficients. This study demonstrates that accumulated GPP and NPP derived from an ecosystem model, driven by Sentinel-2 LAI data and abiotic data, can be effectively used for crop AGB mapping; the temporal information from LAI is also effective in AGB mapping for some crop types.

TI  - Trends and Source Contribution Characteristics of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>X</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> Emissions in Sichuan Province from 2013 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most populated regions in China, Sichuan province had been suffering from deteriorated air quality due to the dramatic growth of economy and vehicles in recent years. To deal with the increasingly serious air quality problem, Sichuan government agencies had made great efforts to formulate various control measures and policies during the past decade. In order to better understand the emission control progress in recent years and to guide further control policy formulation, the emission trends and source contribution characteristics of SO2, NOX, PM10 and PM2.5 from 2013 to 2017 were characterized by using emission factor approach in this study. The results indicated that SO2 emission decreased rapidly during 2013-2017 with total emission decreased by 52%. NOX emission decreased during 2013-2015 but started to increase slightly afterward. PM10 and PM2.5 emissions went down consistently during the study period, decreased by 26% and 25%, respectively. In summary, the contribution of power plants kept decreasing, while contribution of industrial combustion remained steady in the past 5 years. The contribution of industrial processes increased for SO2 emission, and decreased slightly for NOX, PM10 and PM2.5 emissions. The on-road mobile sources were the largest emission contributor for NOX, accounting for about 32-40%, and its contribution increased during 2013-2015 and then decreased. It was worth mentioning that nonroad mobile sources and natural gas fired boilers were becoming important NOX contributors in Sichuan. Fugitive dust were the key emission sources for PM10 and PM2.5, and the contribution kept increasing in the study period. Comparison results with other inventories, satellite data and ground observations indicated that emission trends developed in this research were relatively credible.

TI  - Observations and Simulations of Meteorological Conditions over Arctic Thick Sea Ice in Late Winter during the Transarktika 2019 Expedition
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The parameterization of ocean/sea-ice/atmosphere interaction processes is a challenge for regional climate models (RCMs) of the Arctic, particularly for wintertime conditions, when small fractions of thin ice or open water cause strong modifications of the boundary layer. Thus, the treatment of sea ice and sub-grid flux parameterizations in RCMs is of crucial importance. However, verification data sets over sea ice for wintertime conditions are rare. In the present paper, data of the ship-based experiment Transarktika 2019 during the end of the Arctic winter for thick one-year ice conditions are presented. The data are used for the verification of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM). In addition, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used for the comparison of ice surface temperature (IST) simulations of the CCLM sea ice model. CCLM is used in a forecast mode (nested in ERA5) for the Norwegian and Barents Seas with 5 km resolution and is run with different configurations of the sea ice model and sub-grid flux parameterizations. The use of a new set of parameterizations yields improved results for the comparisons with in-situ data. Comparisons with MODIS IST allow for a verification over large areas and show also a good performance of CCLM. The comparison with twice-daily radiosonde ascents during Transarktika 2019, hourly microwave water vapor measurements of first 5 km in the atmosphere and hourly temperature profiler data show a very good representation of the temperature, humidity and wind structure of the whole troposphere for CCLM.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Patterns and Interrelationships of Snow Cover and Climate Change in Tianshan Mountains
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of the asymmetry in the Tianshan mountains' climatic warming, in this study, we analyzed climate and MODIS snow cover data (2001-2019). The change trends of asymmetrical warming, snow depth (SD), snow coverage percentage (SCP), snow cover days (SCD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Tianshan mountains were quantitatively determined, and the influence of asymmetrical warming on the snow cover activity of the Tianshan mountains were discussed. The results showed that the nighttime warming rate (0.10 degrees C per decade) was greater than the daytime, and that the asymmetrical warming trend may accelerate in the future. The SCP of Tianshan mountain has reduced by 0.9%. This means that for each 0.1 degrees C increase in temperature, the area of snow cover will reduce by 5.9 km(2). About 60% of the region's daytime warming was positively related to SD and SWE, and about 48% of the region's nighttime warming was negatively related to SD and SWE. Temperature increases were concentrated mainly in the Pamir Plateau southwest of Tianshan at high altitudes and in the Turpan and Hami basins in the east. In the future, the western and eastern mountainous areas of the Tianshan will continue to show a warming trend, while the central mountainous areas of the Tianshan mountains will mainly show a cooling trend.

TI  - Reinventing Extremity Amputation in the Era of Functional Limb Restoration
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent progress in biomechatronics and vascularized composite allotransplantation have occurred in the absence of congruent advancements in the surgical approaches generally utilized for limb amputation. Consideration of these advances, as well as of both novel and time-honored reconstructive surgical techniques, argues for a fundamental reframing of the way in which amputation procedures should be performed. Methods: We review sentinel developments in external prosthetic limb technology and limb transplantation, in addition to standard and emerging reconstructive surgical techniques relevant to limb modification, and then propose a new paradigm for limb amputation. Results: An approach to limb amputation based on the availability of native tissues is proposed, with the intent of maximizing limb function, limiting neuropathic pain, restoring limb perception/proprioception and mitigating limb atrophy. Conclusions: We propose a reinvention of the manner in which limb amputations are performed, framed in the context of time-tested reconstructive techniques, as well as novel, state-of-the-art surgical procedures. Implementation of the proposed techniques in the acute setting has the potential to elevate advanced limb replacement strategies to a clinical solution that perhaps exceeds what is possible through traditional surgical approaches to limb salvage. We therefore argue that amputation, performed with the intent of optimizing the residuum for interaction with either a bionic or a transplanted limb, should be viewed not as a surgical failure, but as an alternative form of limb reconstruction.

TI  - Embedding Chemistry Education into Environmental and Sustainability Education: Development of a Didaktik Model Based on an Eco-Reflexive Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this theoretical paper is to develop and present a didaktik model that embeds chemistry education into Environmental and Sustainability Education (ESE) using an eco-reflexive approach. A didaktik model is a tool to help educators make decisions and reflect on why, what, how, and/or when to teach. The model presented here is a revised version of the Jegstad and Sinnes model from 2015. It was systematically developed based on a critical analysis of the previous ESD (Education for Sustainable Development)-based model. This process is part of what is called didactic modeling. The revised model consists of the following six categories: (i) socio-philosophical framing; (ii) sustainable schooling and living; (iii) critical views on chemistry's distinctiveness and methodological character; (iv) powerful chemical content knowledge; (v) critical views of chemistry in society; and (vi) eco-reflexivity through environmental and sustainability education. As in the model by Jegstad and Sinnes, the eco-reflexive didaktik model seeks to support chemistry educators in their sustainability-oriented educational planning and analysis, but from a more critical perspective. Based on an eco-reflexive Bildung approach, one additional category-socio-philosophical framing-was added to the revised model. This is because the previous model does not take sufficient account of worldview perspectives, cultural values, and educational philosophy. The eco-reflexive didaktik model is illustrated with boxes, and it is suggested that all categories in these boxes should be considered in holistic and eco-reflexive chemistry education. The purpose of such education is to develop students' ChemoKnowings.

TI  - Optimizing Dose and Timing in Magnetic Tracer Techniques for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Early Breast Cancers: The Prospective Multicenter SentiDose Trial
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummarySuperparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles have comparable performance to the combination of radioisotope and blue dye (RI + BD) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. In this multicenter prospective study, lower SPIO doses (undiluted 1.5 vs. 1.0 mL) in different timeframes (perioperative vs. 1-7 days preoperative) and injection sites (subareolar vs. peritumoral) were compared to the previous standard (diluted 2.0 mL perioperatively) from the earlier Nordic trial. RI + BD were co-administered as background. In total, 534 patients were analyzed. SPIO SLN detection rates were similar (97.5% vs. 100% vs. 97.6%, p = 0.11) and respectively non-inferior to the dual technique. Significantly more SLNs were retrieved in the preoperative 1.0 mL cohort compared with 1.5 mL and the Nordic cohorts (2.18 vs. 1.85 vs. 1.83, p = 0.003). Thus, SPIO at 1.5 and 1.0 mL was non-inferior to both Sienna+(R) and the dual technique for SLN detection.Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) are non-inferior to radioisotope and blue dye (RI + BD) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection. Previously, 2 mL SPIO (Sienna+(R)) in 3 mL NaCl was used. In this dose-optimizing study, lower doses of a new refined SPIO solution (Magtrace(R)) (1.5 vs. 1.0 mL) were tested in different timeframes (0-24 h perioperative vs. 1-7 days preoperative) and injections sites (subareolar vs. peritumoral). Two consecutive breast cancer cohorts (n = 328) scheduled for SLN-biopsy were included from 2017 to 2019. All patients received isotope +/- blue dye as back-up. SLNs were identified primarily with the SentiMag(R) probe and thereafter a gamma-probe. The primary endpoint was SLN detection rate with SPIO. Analyses were performed as a one-step individual patient-level meta-analysis using patient-level data from the previously published Nordic Trial (n = 206) as a third, reference cohort. In 534 patients, the SPIO SLN detection rates were similar (97.5% vs. 100% vs. 97.6%, p = 0.11) and non-inferior to the dual technique. Significantly more SLNs were retrieved in the preoperative 1.0 mL cohort compared with 1.5 and the 2.0 mL cohorts (2.18 vs. 1.85 vs. 1.83, p = 0.003). Lower SPIO volumes injected up to 7 days before the operation have comparable efficacy to standard SPIO dose and RI + BD for SLN detection.

TI  - Pan-European Mapping of Underutilized Land for Bioenergy Production
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at identifying underutilized land potentially suitable for bioenergy production in Europe by means of remote sensing time series analysis. The background is the Revised Renewable Energy Directive (REDII) requesting that 32% of Europe's energy production shall come from renewable energy sources until 2030. In order to avoid the food versus fuel debate, we only considered land that has not been used in the previous five years. Satellite remote sensing is the only technique that allows for the assessment of the usage of land for such a long time span at the pan-European scale with reasonable efforts. We used Landsat 8 (L8) data for the full five year time period 2015-2019 and included additional Sentinel-2 (S2) data for 2018 and 2019. The analysis was based on a stratified approach for biogeographical regions and countries using Google Earth Engine. To our knowledge, this is the first work that employs high resolution time series data for pan-European mapping of underutilized land. The average patch size of underutilized land was found to be between 23.2 ha and 49.6 ha, depending on the biogeographical region. The results show an overall accuracy of more than 85% with a confidence interval (CI) of 1.55% at the 95% confidence level (CL). The classification suggests that at total of 5.3 million ha of underutilized land in Europe is potentially available for agricultural bioenergy production.

TI  - Potential of P-Band SAR Tomography in Forest Type Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest type classification using spaceborne remote sensing is a challenge. Low-frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals (i.e., P-band, similar to 0.69 m wavelength) are needed to penetrate a thick vegetation layer. However, this measurement alone does not guarantee a good performance in forest classification tasks. SAR tomography, a technique employing multiple acquisitions over the same areas to form a three-dimensional image, has been demonstrated to improve SAR's capability in many applications. Our study shows the potential value of SAR tomography acquisitions to improve forest classification. By using P-band tomographic SAR data from the German Aerospace Center F-SAR sensor during the AfriSAR campaign in February 2016, the vertical profiles of five different forest types at a tropical forest site in Mondah, Gabon (South Africa) were analyzed and exploited for the classification task. We demonstrated that the high sensitivity of SAR tomography to forest vertical structure enables the improvement of classification performance by up to 33%. Interestingly, by using the standard Random Forest technique, we found that the ground (i.e., at 5-10 m) and volume layers (i.e., 20-40 m) play an important role in identifying the forest type. Together, these results suggested the promise of the TomoSAR technique for mapping forest types with high accuracy in tropical areas and could provide strong support for the next Earth Explorer BIOMASS spaceborne mission which will collect P-band tomographic SAR data.

TI  - Estimating groundwater resource and understanding recharge processes in the rapidly urbanizing Dhaka City, Bangladesh
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation in Dhaka (Bangladesh) with high dependency on the groundwater have recently raised concern over the sustainability of the aquifers. The present study focusses on quantifying the dynamic groundwater resource vis-a-vis the status of groundwater development and understanding the different recharge processes in the Dhaka City, using the water balance based lumped and distributed approaches. In the lumped approach, the groundwater assessment is carried out using groundwater balance method following the methodology and norms recommended by the Groundwater Estimation Committee-2015 (referred hereafter as GEC). In the distributed approach, a physics-based hydrological model (Variable Infiltration Capacity, VIC) is utilised to model the baseflow (i.e., potential recharge). Then, an attempt is made to establish the relation between VIC-based baseflow and actual (GEC-based) groundwater recharge from rainfall. Remote sensing data derived spatio-temporal information along with field-based observations have been used in the process. Dhaka City is divided into 10 zones and the groundwater assessment is made individually in these zones as well as for the entire city during 2001-2015 period. The total annual recharge is estimated as 635.35 million m(3) (or similar to 2065 mm/year per unit area). Lateral and unaccounted recharge is found to be the dominant (51.8%) process in the study area, followed by recharge from urban return flow (35.5%), rainfall (7.1%), and surface water bodies/wetlands (5.6%). The study underscores that the lateral and unaccounted recharge must not be ignored in the urban landscape underlain by alluvial aquifers and with non-hydrologic unit boundaries. The stage of groundwater development is found to vary from 117 to 320%, thus indicating overexploitation of aquifers in all the zones. The higher groundwater abstraction as compared to recharge in all the zones has led to consistent decline in groundwater level by 2-3.2 m/year across the study area. The VIC model, on the other hand, depicted that nearly 17.2% of the annual rainfall contributes towards baseflow. Further, it is observed that similar to 31% of baseflow contributes to groundwater recharge due to rainfall. Researchers can use this relationship for quick assessment of the groundwater recharge from rainfall in Dhaka, based on hydrological models with varying meteorological and land cover scenarios, especially in the light of climate change and rapid urbanisation.

TI  - Impact of Microphysical Parameterizations on Simulated Hurricanes-Using Multi-Parameter Satellite Data to Determine the Particle Size Distributions that Produce Most Realistic Storms
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and forecasting hurricanes remains a challenge for the operational and research communities. To accurately predict the Tropical Cyclone (TC) evolution requires properly reflecting the storm's inner core dynamics by using: (i) high-resolution models; (ii) realistic physical parameterizations. The microphysical processes and their representation in cloud-permitting models are of crucial importance. In particular, the assumed Particle Size Distribution (PSD) functions affect nearly all formulated microphysical processes and are among the most fundamental assumptions in the bulk microphysics schemes. This paper analyzes the impact of the PSD assumptions on simulated hurricanes and their synthetic radiometric signatures. It determines the most realistic, among the available set of assumptions, based on comparison to multi-parameter satellite observations. Here we simulated 2005 ' s category-5 Hurricane Rita using the cloud-permitting community Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) with two different microphysical schemes and with seven different modifications of the parametrized hydrometeor properties within one of the two schemes. We then used instrument simulators to produce satellite-like observations. The study consisted in evaluating the structure of the different simulated storms by comparing, for each storm, the calculated microwave signatures with actual satellite observations made by (a) the passive microwave radiometer that was carried by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite-the TRMM microwave imager TMI, (b) TRMM's precipitation radar (PR) and (c) the ocean-wind-vector scatterometer carried by the QuikSCAT satellite. The analysis reveals that the different choices of microphysical parameters do produce significantly different microwave signatures, allowing an objective determination of a "best" parameter combination whose resulting signatures are collectively most consistent with the wind and precipitation observations obtained from the satellites. In particular, we find that assuming PSDs with larger number of smaller hydrometeors produces storms that compare best to observations.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of phytoplankton absorption associated with size classes in coastal waters
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - As a second-order expression of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(ph)(lambda)), the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(ph)*(lambda)) is an essential optical parameter that refines the a(ph)(lambda) normalized by phytoplankton pigment concentration. Based on the in-situ samples collected in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea, this study presents a combined approach to determine the specific absorption coefficients of micro- (a(m)(lambda)), nano- (a(n)*(lambda)), and picophytoplankton (a(p)*(lambda)). Together with a(m)*(lambda) estimated by the two-component assumption model, our method effectively extracted a(n)*(lambda) and a(p)*(lambda) through the least square method. Independent in-situ validation datasets tested the performances of the proposed a(m)*(lambda), a(n)*(lambda), and a(p)*(lambda) by modeling a(ph)(lambda), and generated encouraging and acceptable predictive errors. The derived mean absolute percentage errors ranged from approximately 35%-55% for several typical wavebands (namely, 412, 443, 490, 555, 660, and 680 nm). Validation by using satellite-ground synchronization samples also produced comparative predictive errors. The spatial distribution of a(ph)(lambda) and the absorption of micro-, nano-, and picophytoplankton were mapped through applying the proposed specific absorption coefficients to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images. This showed a spatial rule that pico- and nanophytoplankton dominate the total absorption, rather than microphytoplankton. The annual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) a(ph)(443) product from 2002 to 2019 was used to assess the transferability of those specific absorption coefficients and showed a good performance. The accurate acquirement of a(ph)(lambda) can provide basical datasets for further environment research, such as estimating primary ocean productivity.

TI  - An Improved Method Combining ANN and 1D-Var for the Retrieval of Atmospheric Temperature Profiles from FY-4A/GIIRS Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In our study, a retrieval method of temperature profiles is proposed which combines an improved one-dimensional variational algorithm (1D-Var) and artificial neural network algorithm (ANN), using FY-4A/GIIRS (Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder) infrared hyperspectral data. First, according to the characteristics of the FY-4A/GIIRS observation data using the conventional 1D-Var, we introduced channel blacklists and discarded the channels that have a large negative impact on retrieval, then used the information capacity method for channel selection and introduced a neural network to correct the satellite observation data. The improved 1D-Var effectively used the observation information of 1415 channels, reducing the impact of the error of the satellite observation and radiative transfer model, and realizing the improvement of retrieval accuracy. We subsequently used the improved 1D-Var and ANN algorithms to retrieve the temperature profiles, respectively, from the GIIRS data. The results showed that the accuracy when using ANN is better than using improved 1D-Var in situations where the pressure ranges from 800 hPa to 1000 hPa. Therefore, we combined the improved 1D-Var and ANN method to retrieve temperature profiles for different pressure levels, calculating the error by taking sounding data published by the University of Wyoming as the true values. The results show that the average error of the retrieved temperature profiles is smaller than 2 K when using our method, this method makes the accuracy of the retrieved temperature profiles superior to the accuracy of the GIIRS products from 10 hPa to 575 hPa. All in all, through the combination of the physical retrieval method and the machine learning retrieval method, this paper can certainly provide a reference for improving the accuracy of products.

TI  - An integrated assessment of surface water dynamics in the Irtysh River Basin during 1990-2019 and exploratory factor analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and urbanization are jointly impacting on the open surface water area of the Irtysh River in the Arctic Circle. This will affect the economic development and ecology of the countries in the Irtysh River basin and the hydrological cycle of the Arctic Circle. However, the long-term changes of open surface water bodies in the Irtysh River Basin have not been well quantified. To address this, 89,000 Landsat 4,5,7 and 8 images from 1990 to 2019 were used to extract the surface water body area of the Irtysh River Basin and integrated the assessment of open surface water area dynamics. The geographical detector model was used to quantify the factors that affect the area of open surface water bodies. The results show that the total open surface water area of the Irtysh River Basin is an increasing trend over the past 30 years, with a total increase of 88,790 km(2), of which the permanent water body area decreased by 20,800 km(2) and the seasonal water body area increased by 109,590 km(2). In addition, the factors that contributed the most to the dynamics of the surface water area in the Irtysh River Basin were evapotranspiration, precipitation and snow water equivalent, whose contribution rates could reach 72%, 66% and 61%, respectively, with important interactions between factors. This suggests that monitoring dynamics in surface water area requires comprehensive consideration of all factors. Results obtained from this study offer the latest information for fully understanding the spatio-temporal variation of surface water body area and its driving factors in this basin, which could be used to effectively manage water resources for possibly reducing international water disputes and protecting the fragile ecology in the Arctic.

TI  - Magnetic Anomaly Map of Shatsky Rise and Its Implications for Oceanic Plateau Formation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shatsky Rise oceanic plateau was emplaced during a period of frequent geomagnetic polarity reversals, allowing reconstruction of its tectonic evolution using magnetic anomalies. Prior studies mainly focused on identifying magnetic isochrons and encountered difficulties in tracing magnetic lineations over high relief. We complied a large magnetic data set over Shatsky Rise and its environs, using 5.5 x 10(6) data points from 96 geophysical cruises spanning 54 years. The long-time span and heterogeneity of component data sets made data merger a challenge. Contributions of internal and external fields, and spurious readings were removed during processing. A "backbone" method, using recent GPS-navigated data as a foundation, was developed to improve the coherency of the data set. The singular characteristic of the new magnetic anomaly map is that linear magnetic anomalies are ubiquitous. In nearly every place where data are dense enough to delineate anomaly trends, the plateau and surrounding crust are characterized by linear anomalies. Discordant anomalies in some areas imply complex tectonics related to triple junction migration and ridge reorientation. Tamu Massif apparently formed along a segment of Pacific-Farallon spreading ridge that rotated by 90 degrees as a triple junction migrated through the edifice. Ori Massif appears to have formed on the Pacific-Izanagi ridge between triple junctions. Shirshov Massif contains discordant lineations that may indicate a microplate. The pervasive occurrence of linear magnetic anomalies within Shatsky Rise implies that these volcanic edifices must have formed by spreading analogous to mid-ocean ridges that formed anomalously thick crust.

TI  - Glacier and lake level change from TOPEX-series and Cryosat-2 altimeters in Tanggula: Comparison with satellite imagery
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We detect long-term elevation changes near a glacier terminus and an icefield in Tanggula Mountains from altimeter data from the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P), Jason-1 (J1), Jason-2 (J2), and Jason-3 (J3) altimeters. An altimeter processing technique is developed for the detection, including waveform retracking, quality data selection, and elevation adjustment. The altimeter-observed glacier thinning is confirmed by the direct elevation differences between the digital elevation models from the satellite missions TanDEM-X and SRTM, and by the glacier area losses from Landsat images. At the two glacier sites, the altimeter-derived elevations show seasonal oscillations, with mean rates of -3.71 +/- 0.3 and -3.08 +/- 0.20 m year(-1) over 1993-2002 (T/P only), and -1.88 +/- 0.06 and -1.46 +/- 0.07 m year(-1) over 1993-2020 (T/P-Jason altimeters), with abnormal changes around the 1997-1998 El Nino. The declining rates suggest that the persistent losses of glaciers in Tanggula Mountains can no longer sustain the large thinning rates. The glacier feeds the nearby Chibuzhang Co lake, and lake level and glacier level changes from Cryosat-2 are consistent with those from the T/P-Jason altimeters. The glacier meltwater contributed to the accelerated rise of the glacier-fed Chibuzhang Co, at a rate of 0.15 +/- 0.05 m year(-1) over 1993-2002, increasing to 0.42 +/- 0.01 m year(-1) over 2003-2020. The lake levels of Chibuzhang Co experienced notable drops after the 1997-1998 and 2014-2016 El Nino. The Cryosat-2 result shows the altitude effect of glacier change: the higher the glacier, the less it melts. A repeat altimeter can provide time-lapsed elevation measurements as a virtual glacier station to monitor glacier melt caused by climate change.

TI  - Cloud and Cloud-Shadow Detection for Applications in Mapping Small-Scale Mining in Colombia Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale placer mining in Colombia takes place in rural areas and involves excavations resulting in large footprints of bare soil and water ponds. Such excavated areas comprise a mosaic of challenging terrains for cloud and cloud-shadow detection of Sentinel-2 (S2A and S2B) data used to identify, map, and monitor these highly dynamic activities. This paper uses an efficient two-step machine-learning approach using freely available tools to detect clouds and shadows in the context of mapping small-scale mining areas, one which places an emphasis on the reduction of misclassification of mining sites as clouds or shadows. The first step is comprised of a supervised support-vector-machine classification identifying clouds, cloud shadows, and clear pixels. The second step is a geometry-based improvement of cloud-shadow detection where solar-cloud-shadow-sensor geometry is used to exclude commission errors in cloud shadows. The geometry-based approach makes use of sun angles and sensor view angles available in Sentinel-2 metadata to identify potential directions of cloud shadow for each cloud projection. The approach does not require supplementary data on cloud-top or bottom heights nor cloud-top ruggedness. It assumes that the location of dense clouds is mainly impacted by meteorological conditions and that cloud-top and cloud-base heights vary in a predefined manner. The methodology has been tested over an intensively excavated and well-studied pilot site and shows 50% more detection of clouds and shadows than Sen2Cor. Furthermore, it has reached a Specificity of 1 in the correct detection of mining sites and water ponds, proving itself to be a reliable approach for further related studies on the mapping of small-scale mining in the area. Although the methodology was tailored to the context of small-scale mining in the region of Antioquia, it is a scalable approach and can be adapted to other areas and conditions.

TI  - Preoperative Screening CT and PET/CT Scanning for Acral Melanoma: Is it Necessary?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of preoperative imaging for acral melanoma (AM) has not been fully evaluated. We examined the accuracy of imaging modalities in the detection of nodal and distant metastases in patients with AM. A retrospective review of 109 patients with AM was performed. All patients had no clinical signs suggestive of distant metastases, and underwent preoperative screening computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans. Of 100 patients without lymphadenopathy, 17 patients were suspected of having nodal metastasis in CT and PET/CT, but only two of them were confirmed on histopathological analysis. On the other hand, 12 out of 83 negatively imaged patients showed histopathological signs of nodal metastasis; thus, the sensitivity and specificity of nodal detection were 14.3% and 82.6%, respectively. Regard to the detection of distant metastases, four patients were suspected of having metastasis, but this was later ruled out. The remaining 96 negatively imaged patients were confirmed to have no metastasis at the time of CT and PET/CT by the follow-up. In contrast, distant metastases were found by CT and PET/CT in four of nine patients (44.4%) with lymphadenopathy. Routine preoperative CT and PET/CT for AM patients without lymphadenopathy may not be warranted because of low sensitivity and specificity, but it can be considered for those with lymphadenopathy.

TI  - Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer with Osteoclast-Like Giant Cells: A Case Report Based on the Gene Expression Profile for Changes in Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the case of a 49-year-old woman diagnosed with a rare histotype of early breast cancer (BC), invasive ductal carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs), from the perspective of gene profile analysis tests. The patient underwent a quadrantectomy of the right breast with removal of 2 cm neoplastic nodule and three ipsilateral sentinel lymph nodes. The Oncotype Dx gave a recurrence score (RS) of 23, and taking into account the patient's age, an RS of 23 corresponds to a chemotherapy benefit of 6.5%. After a multidisciplinary collegial discussion, and in consideration of the patient's age, the absence of comorbidity, the premenopausal state, the rare histotype and the Oncotype Dx report, the patient was offered adjuvant chemotherapy treatment followed by hormone therapy. This case may be an example of the utility of integrating gene expression profiling tests into clinical practice in the adjuvant treatment decision of a rare histotype BC. The Oncotype Dx test required to supplement the histological examination made us opt for the proposal of a combined treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant hormone therapy. It demonstrates the importance of considering molecular tests and, in particular, the Oncotype Dx, in estimating the risk of disease recovery at 10 years in order to identify patients who benefit from hormone therapy alone versus those who benefit from the addition of chemotherapy, all with a view toward patient-centered oncology. Here, we discuss the possible validity and limitations of the Oncotype Dx in a rare luminal A-like histotype with high infiltrate of stromal/inflammatory cells.

TI  - Comparison of EEJ Longitudinal Variation from Satellite and Ground Measurements over Different Solar Activity Levels
T2  - UNIVERSE
M3  - Article
AB  - The longitudinal variability and local time of equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current using simultaneous data recorded by ground and satellite magnetometers at different levels of solar activity were investigated. In this study, we used data from the CHAMP and Swarm satellites to obtain EEJ current measurements around the globe. The ground data were provided by the MAGDAS, INTERMAGNET, and IIG networks. The ground observation was carried out by analyzing magnetometer data in four different sectors: the South American, Indian, African, and Southeast Asian sectors. These ground data were normalized to the dip equator to overcome the latitudinal variation of each station. The analysis for both measurements was performed using quiet day data. Both the ground and satellite data were categorized according to solar activity level; low, moderate, and high. The results revealed that, during the low solar activity, there was a good agreement between the longitudinal profiles of the EEJ measured using the satellite and the ground data. In general, strong correlations were obtained in most of the sectors where ground data were available between 11 and 13 local time (LT). Besides that, our analysis revealed that the different times of maximum EEJ appearances were seasonally dependent only at certain longitude sectors.

TI  - GYMEE: A Global Field-Scale Crop Yield and ET Mapper in Google Earth Engine Based on Landsat, Weather, and Soil Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used Landsat Earth observations and gridded weather data along with global soil datasets available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to estimate crop yield at 30 m resolution. We implemented a remote sensing and evapotranspiration-based light use efficiency model globally and integrated abiotic environmental stressors (temperature, soil moisture, and vapor deficit stressors). The operational model (Global Yield Mapper in Earth Engine (GYMEE)) was validated against actual yield data for three agricultural schemes with different climatic, soil, and management conditions located in Lebanon, Brazil, and Spain. Field-level crop yield data on wheat, potato, and corn for 2015-2020 were used for assessment. The performance of GYMEE was statistically evaluated through root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), relative error (RE), and index of agreement (d). The results showed that the absolute difference between the modeled and predicted field-level yield was within +/- 16% for the analyzed crops in both Brazil and Lebanon study sites and within +/- 15% in the Spain site (except for two fields). GYMEE performed best for wheat crop in Lebanon with a low RMSE (0.6 t/ha), MAE (0.5 t/ha), MBE (-0.06 t/ha), and RE (0.83%). A very good agreement was observed for all analyzed crop yields, with an index of agreement (d) averaging at 0.8 in all studied sites. GYMEE shows potential in providing yield estimates for potato, wheat, and corn yields at a relative error of +/- 6%. We also quantified and spatialized the soil moisture stress constraint and its impact on reducing biomass production. A showcasing of moisture stress impact on two emphasized fields from the Lebanon site revealed that a 12% difference in soil moisture stress can decrease yield by 17%. A comparison between the 2017 and 2018 seasons for the potato culture of Lebanon showed that the 2017 season with lower abiotic stresses had higher light use efficiency, above-ground biomass, and yield by 5%, 10%, and 9%, respectively. The results show that the model is of high value for assessing global food production.

TI  - Assessment of impact of cyclone hazard on social vulnerability of Bhadrak District of Odisha State during Phailin Cyclone in 2013 and Titli Cyclone in 2018 using multi-criteria analysis and geospatial techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, Cyclone is considered as the most catastrophic natural hazard in the eastern coastal states. Multi -criteria analysis (MCA) technique is carried out to describe the effective utilization of geospatial techniques for assessment of impact of cyclone hazard at village level at Bhadrak district of Odisha State. Bhadrak district is severely affected by many cyclones during the period of 1999-2018. Among them Phailin Cyclone in 2013 and Titli Cyclone in the recent year 2018 has been taken to assess the social vulnerability of Bhadrak district. Based on Multi-criteria analysis technique, cyclone hazard map derived from the spatio-multi-temporal satellite data sets like RADARSAT SAR and Sentinel-1A SAR. Using microwave satellite imagery, flood hazard layers are created to show differential social vulnerability of Phailin and Titli cyclone in Bhadrak district. Study reveals that during Phailin cyclone(2013) 32% of areas of Bhadrak district across 82 villages fall under very high risk zone, 125 villages come under high risk zone, 336 villages come under moderate risk zone and 554 villages fall under low risk zone. On the other side during the cyclone Titli (2018) 19% areas were affected and around 64 villages come under very high risk zone, 110 villages fall under high risk zone, 480 villages come under low risk zone and 620 villages are less affected. The present study will be helpful for decision makers to make disaster management plan and mitigation measure to lessen the effect of cyclone in other areas also.

AB  - Surgical treatment is the most important part of therapy for endometrial cancer. The aim of the study was to define factors having the most significant impact on surgical treatment of endometrial cancer when using traditional and laparoscopic methods. In the study, we evaluated 75 females who were treated for endometrial cancer via laparoscopic surgery in 2019 and used a historical control of 70 patients treated by laparotomy in 2011. The evaluated risk factors included the method of surgery, type of lymphadenectomy, patient's age, various obesity parameters, histological grading, cancer clinical staging, pelvic dimensions, previous abdominal surgeries, comorbidities, and number of deliveries. The duration of hospitalization, operation time, loss of hemoglobin, and procedure-related complications were used as parameters of perioperative outcomes. Multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed the following factors as being predictors of worse perioperative outcomes: laparotomy, abdominal obesity (waist circumstance and waist-to-hip ratio), range of lymphadenectomy, prior abdominal surgeries, and larger pelvic dimensions. Abdominal obesity is a significant risk factor in the treatment of endometrial cancer. Laparotomy continues to be utilized frequently in the management of endometrial cancer in Poland as well as elsewhere, and adopting a minimally invasive approach is likely to be beneficial for patient outcome.

TI  - Habitat Mosaics of Sand Steppes and Forest-Steppes in the Ipoly Valley in Hungary
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the mosaic-like occurrences of patches of steppes and fore-steppes in the Pannonian forest-steppe zone. We present the current vegetation, which is maintained including by human landscape use, i.e., grazing and mowing. The area is complex and for this reason it shows the changes in the landscape and differences in the vegetation more diversely. We wanted to answer the questions: Do sand steppes and forest-steppes occur in the Ipoly Valley and what location? What kind of environmental effects influence the species composition on these areas? Besides classic habitat mapping, are the satellite data from Sentinel-2A useful for distinction of different areas? Comparison of vegetation patches was based on the Hungarian habitat classification system (aNeR). Based on satellite images, quantile data of the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for comparison. Based on the result, water bodies and urban areas are clearly distinguishable from other natural habitats. In some natural vegetation types, we found visible differences, such as grasslands, i.e., sandy steppe meadows and shrubby, woody vegetation patches. Sandy vegetation mainly grows on calcareous soils, which appear to be mosaic-like in the landscape on raised alluvials on the patches of past islands and reefs. From open to continuous closed grasslands, these vegetation types mainly grow on lithosoils. New occurrences of Pannonian sandy vegetation were discovered. In the sandy areas along the Ipoly Valley, open sandy grasslands were found, which is where the northernmost known occurrences of this vegetation type are. Besides common sandy grassland species, the vegetation also contains herbs that are typical in loess-grasslands and it is maintained by grazing, similarly to the eastern Pannonian area. This type of grazing can be useful when maintaining the mosaic-like appearance and diversity of the vegetation.

TI  - Hydrological modeling to simulate stream flow under changing climate conditions in Jhelum catchment, western Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in maximum and minimum temperature, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation of future bi-decades, i.e., 2020-2040, 2040-2060, 2060-2080 and 2080-2100 with the corresponding observed baseline datasets (1991-2016) were analyzed for the Jhelum catchment, western Himalayas, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 of Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4). Maximum and minimum temperature projections indicated a rise of 1.18 degrees C to 3.29 degrees C and 1.30 degrees C to 2.92 degrees C under RCP 4.5, and 3.58 degrees C to 7.22 degrees C and 3.38 degrees C to 6.92 degrees C under RCP 8.5, respectively, relative to the baseline period. Precipitation shows a decline of 14.34 mm, 9.60 mm, 4.19 mm and 15.62 mm under RCP 4.5, whereas RCP 8.5 shows an incline of 7.45 mm, 12.37 mm, 22.19 mm, and 6.86 mm during 2040s, 2060s, 2080s and 2100s, respectively, as compared to the baseline period. For the months of May to September, both the RCPs indicated a decrease in PET values. Snow cover area (SCA) computed from MODIS Snow Cover 8-Day L3 Global 500 m Grid (MOD10A2) datasets over a period of 2002 to 2016, depicted a negative relationship with river runoff, with strong negative coefficient of -0.88 for the year 2012.The impact of these climate change projections were computed on the hydrology of Jhelum catchment using Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Comparison among the future bi-decades, show increasing trend of precipitation under both the RCPs from 2020 to 2080, then slightly decreases during 2080-2100. Similar trend was exhibited by runoff projections, viz. runoff increases till 2080 and decreases afterwards under both the RCP emission scenarios. Temperature and runoff shows relatively higher values under RCP 8.5, than RCP 4.5. Overall, results indicated a strong influence of precipitation projections on runoff of Jhelum catchment.

TI  - Less Axillary Lymphadenectomy is More Beneficial: 27-Year Follow-up of Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: One of the most important alterations in breast cancer treatment is the change of view in axillary lymph node management. At the moment, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard care in axillary lymph node management. However, in patients with clinically positive lymph nodes or in patients, who have no willingness to receive radioactive drugs, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) must be done. To the best of our knowledge, there is no overall survival (OS) benefit in ALND, especially at the early stage of breast cancer, during which this procedure is not justified.Objectives: Herein, we have reported the results of 27 years of experiments in limited axillary lymph node dissection (LALND) in comparison to ALND as well as the relationship among the number of removed lymph nodes, OS, and disease-free survival (DFS) at the early stage of breast cancer.Methods: OS and DFS for 588 cases, who were at the early stage of breast cancer and treated by LALND between 1984 and 2019, were compared with1026 patients, who were treated byALND during the same interval in this study. Notably, SLNB cases were excluded.Results: The results revealed no significant difference among the groups in terms of DFS (P = 0.268, 0.123, and 0.333). Also, there was no difference in terms of OS between the LALND group (1- 4 nodes, 5 - 6 nodes, and 7 - 8 nodes) and ALND group (>= 9 nodes) in patients without lymph node involvement (AHR less than 2). However, in the patients with axillary lymph node metastasis (N-1, N-2), similar results were obtained. Correspondingly, in this group, the best results were observed in those patients, whose 7 - 8 lymph nodes were removed.Conclusions: Regarding the results of the current study; it can be concluded that performing the LALND in the defined anatomic range and removing 78 lymph nodes instead of removing 10 lymph nodes are not inferior when it is not possible to do SLNB (there is no access to it) and/or being a contraindication to do it for evaluating the status of axillary lymph nodes in the patients at the early stage of breast cancer.

TI  - Child health services during a COVID-19 outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Current evidence indicates that children are relatively spared from direct COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, but that the indirect effects of the pandemic pose significant risks to their health and wellbeing.Objectives. To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services.Methods. The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed.Results. During April June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged <5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for inand out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources.Conclusions. Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing. Further studies are needed to establish the intermediateand long-term impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on child health, as well as strategies to mitigate these.

TI  - Prediction of Crop Yield Using Phenological Information Extracted from Remote Sensing Vegetation Index
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is an indicator of crop growth conditions, and is correlated with crop yields. In this study, a phenological approach based on a remote sensing vegetation index was explored to predict the yield in 314 counties within the US Corn Belt, divided into semi-arid and non-semi-arid regions. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data product MOD09Q1 was used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. According to the NDVI time series, we divided the corn growing season into four growth phases, calculated phenological information metrics (duration and rate) for each growth phase, and obtained the maximum correlation NDVI (Max-R-2). Duration and rate represent crop growth days and rate, respectively. Max-R-2 is the NDVI value with the most significant correlation with corn yield in the NDVI time series. We built three groups of yield regression models, including univariate models using phenological metrics and Max-R-2, and multivariate models using phenological metrics, and multivariate models using phenological metrics combined with Max-R-2 in the whole, semi-arid, and non-semi-arid regions, respectively, and compared the performance of these models. The results show that most phenological metrics had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship with corn yield (maximum R-2 = 0.44). Models established with phenological metrics realized yield prediction before harvest in the three regions with R-2 = 0.64, 0.67, and 0.72. Compared with the univariate Max-R-2 models, the accuracy of models built with Max-R-2 and phenology metrics improved. Thus, the phenology metrics obtained from MODIS-NDVI accurately reflect the corn characteristics and can be used for large-scale yield prediction. Overall, this study showed that phenology metrics derived from remote sensing vegetation indexes could be used as crop yield prediction variables and provide a reference for data organization and yield prediction with physical crop significance.

TI  - Estimations of Global Horizontal Irradiance and Direct Normal Irradiance by Using Fengyun-4A Satellite Data in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate solar radiation estimation is very important for solar energy systems and is a precondition of solar energy utilization. Due to the rapid development of new energy sources, the demand for surface solar radiation estimation and observation has grown. Due to the scarcity of surface radiation observations, high-precision remote sensing data are trying to fill this gap. In this paper, a global solar irradiance estimation method (in different months, seasons, and weather conditions), using data from the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI) sensor onboard the FengYun-4A satellite with cloud index methodology (CSD-SI), was tested. It was found that the FengYun-4A satellite data could be used to calculate the clear sky index through the Heliosat-2 method. Combined with McClear, the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and the direct normal irradiance (DNI) in northeast China could be accurately obtained. The estimated GHI accuracy under clear sky was slightly affected by the seasons and the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values (in four sites) were higher in summer and autumn (including all weather conditions). Compared to the estimated GHI, the estimated DNI was less accurate. It was found that the estimated DNI in October had the best performance. In the meantime, the nRMSE, the normalized mean absolute error (nMAE), and the normalized mean bias error (nMBE) of Zhangbei were 35.152%, 27.145%, and -8.283%, while for Chengde, they were 43.150%, 28.822%, and -13.017%, respectively. In addition, the estimated DNI at ground level was significantly higher than the actual observed value in autumn and winter. Considering that the error mainly came from the overestimation of McClear, a new DNI radiation algorithm during autumn and winter is proposed for northern China. After applying the new algorithm, the nRMSE decreased from 49.324% to 48.226% for Chengde and from 48.342% to 41.631% for Zhangbei. Similarly, the nMBE decreased from -32.351% to -18.823% for Zhangbei and from -26.211% to -9.107% for Chengde.

TI  - A Hybrid Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Method for Combining Satellite Images with Different Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is considered a feasible and cost-effective way to deal with the trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite sensors, and to generate satellite images with high spatial and high temporal resolutions. This is achieved by fusing two types of satellite images, i.e., images with fine temporal but rough spatial resolution, and images with fine spatial but rough temporal resolution. Numerous STF methods have been proposed, however, it is still a challenge to predict both abrupt landcover change, and phenological change, accurately. Meanwhile, robustness to radiation differences between multi-source satellite images is crucial for the effective application of STF methods. Aiming to solve the abovementioned problems, in this paper we propose a hybrid deep learning-based STF method (HDLSFM). The method formulates a hybrid framework for robust fusion with phenological and landcover change information with minimal input requirements, and in which a nonlinear deep learning-based relative radiometric normalization, a deep learning-based superresolution, and a linear-based fusion are combined to address radiation differences between different types of satellite images, landcover, and phenological change prediction. Four comparative experiments using three popular STF methods, i.e., spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), and Fit-FC, as benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of the HDLSFM in predicting phenological and landcover change. Meanwhile, HDLSFM is robust for radiation differences between different types of satellite images and the time interval between the prediction and base dates, which ensures its effectiveness in the generation of fused time-series data.

TI  - Multiple Kernel Graph Cut for SAR Image Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Complementary information between two difference images (DI's) has great contribution to improve change detection performances. Based on the effectiveness and flexibility of the multiple kernel learning (MKL) in information fusion, we develop a multiple kernel graph cut (MKGC) algorithm for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection. An energy function containing a weighted summation kernel is proposed for fusing the complementary information between the subtraction image and the ratio image. By iteratively minimizing the energy function, the kernel weights, region parameters and region labels are estimated automatically and optimally. Besides of it avoids modeling, MKGC also has a complete description of the changed areas and the strong noise immunity. Experiments on real GaoFen-3 SAR data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the MKGC algorithm, and illustrate that it is a good candidate for SAR image change detection.

TI  - Multiple Feature-Based Superpixel-Level Decision Fusion for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in the number of remote sensing sensors makes it possible to develop multisource feature extraction and fusion techniques to improve the classification accuracy of surface materials. It has been reported that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can contribute complementary information to hyperspectral images (HSIs). In this article, a multiple feature-based superpixel-level decision fusion (MFSuDF) method is proposed for HSIs and LiDAR data classification. Specifically, superpixel-guided kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is first designed and applied to HSIs to both reduce the dimensions and compress the noise impact. Next, 2-D and 3-D Gabor filters are, respectively, employed on the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data to obtain discriminative Gabor features, and the magnitude and phase information are both taken into account. Three different modules, including the raw data-based feature cube (concatenated KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), the Gabor magnitude feature cube, and the Gabor phase feature cube (concatenation of the corresponding Gabor features extracted from the KPCA-reduced HSIs and LiDAR data), can be, thus, achieved. After that, random forest (RF) classifier and quadrant bit coding (QBC) are introduced to separately accomplish the classification task on the aforementioned three extracted feature cubes. Alternatively, two superpixel maps are generated by utilizing the multichannel simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) and entropy rate superpixel segmentation (ERS) algorithms on the combined HSIs and LiDAR data, which are then used to regularize the three classification maps. Finally, a weighted majority voting-based decision fusion strategy is incorporated to effectively enhance the joint use of the multisource data. The proposed approach is, thus, named MFSuDF. A series of experiments are conducted on three real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFSuDF approach. The experimental results show that our MFSuDF can achieve the overall accuracy of 73.64, 93.88, and 74.11 for Houston, Trento, and Missouri University and University of Florida (MUUFL) Gulport data sets, respectively, when there are only three samples per class for training.

TI  - A New Method to Predict Gully Head Erosion in the Loess Plateau of China Based on SBAS-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully head erosion causes serious land degradation in semiarid regions. The existing studies on gully head erosion are mainly based on measuring the gully volume in small-scale catchments, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming approach. Therefore, it is necessary to explore an accurate method quantitatively over large areas and long periods. The objective of this study was to develop a model to assess gully head erosion in the Loess Plateau of China using a method based on the SBAS-InSAR technique. The gully heads were extracted from the digital elevation model and validated by field investigation and aerial images. The surface deformation was estimated with SBAS-InSAR and 22 descending ALOS PALSAR datasets from 2007 to 2011. A gully head erosion model was developed; this model can incorporate terrain factors and soil types, as well as provides erosion rate predictions consistent with the SBAS-InSAR measurements (R-2 = 0.889). The results show that gully head erosion significantly depends on the slope angle above the gully head, slope length, topographic wetness index, and catchment area. The relationship between these factors and the gully head erosion rate is a power function, and the average rate of gully head erosion is 7.5 m(3)/m(2)/year, indicating the high erosional vulnerability of the area. The accuracy of the model can be further improved by considering other factors, such as the stream power factor, curvature, and slope aspect. This study indicates that the erosion rate of gully heads is almost unaffected by soil type in the research area. An advantage of this model is that the gully head area and surface deformation can be easily extracted and measured from satellite images, which is effective for assessing gully head erosion at a large scale in combination with SBAS-InSAR results and terrain attributes.

TI  - Coherence-guided InSAR deformation analysis in the presence of ongoing land surface changes in the Imperial Valley, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While the quality and availability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data has dramatically improved in recent years, InSAR analysis and interpretation remain challenging in actively deforming regions with extensive agricultural activities, where vegetation changes and soil moisture variability can degrade data quality or introduce confounding signals. Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015-2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time intervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, interpolation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recovered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to similar to 3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.

TI  - Automatic High-Accuracy Sea Ice Mapping in the Arctic Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea ice cover is changing rapidly in polar regions, and sea ice products with high temporal and spatial resolution are of great importance in studying global climate change and navigation. In this paper, an ice map generation model based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance bands is constructed to obtain sea ice data with a high temporal and spatial resolution. By constructing a training sample library and using a multi-feature fusion machine learning algorithm for model classification, the high-accuracy recognition of ice and cloud regions is achieved. The first product provided by this algorithm is a near real-time single-scene sea ice presence map. Compared with the photo-interpreted ground truth, the verification shows that the algorithm can obtain a higher recognition accuracy for ice, clouds, and water, and the accuracy exceeds 98%. The second product is a daily and weekly clear sky map, which provides synthetic ice presence maps for one day or seven consecutive days. A filtering method based on cloud motion is used to make the product more accurate. The third product is a weekly fusion of clear sky optical images. In a comparison with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sea ice concentration products performed in August 2019 and September 2020, these composite images showed spatial consistency over time, suggesting that they can be used in many scientific and practical applications in the future.

TI  - Robust Feature Matching for Remote Sensing Image Registration via Linear Adaptive Filtering
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a fundamental and critical task in feature-based remote sensing image registration, feature matching refers to establishing reliable point correspondences from two images of the same scene. In this article, we propose a simple yet efficient method termed linear adaptive filtering (LAF) for both rigid and nonrigid feature matching of remote sensing images and apply it to the image registration task. Our algorithm starts with establishing putative feature correspondences based on local descriptors and then focuses on removing outliers using geometrical consistency priori together with filtering and denoising theory. Specifically, we first grid the correspondence space into several nonoverlapping cells and calculate a typical motion vector for each one. Subsequently, we remove false matches by checking the consistency between each putative match and the typical motion vector in the corresponding cell, which is achieved by a Gaussian kernel convolution operation. By refining the typical motion vector in an iterative manner, we further introduce a progressive strategy based on the coarse-to-fine theory to promote the matching accuracy gradually. In addition, an adaptive parameter setting strategy and posterior probability estimation based on the expectationmaximization algorithm enhance the robustness of our method to different data. Most importantly, our method is quite efficient where the gridding strategy enables it to achieve linear time complexity. Consequently, some sparse point-based tasks may inspire from our method when they are achieved by deep learning techniques. Extensive feature matching and image registration experiments on several remote sensing data sets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state of the art.

TI  - A New Combined Adjustment Model for Geolocation Accuracy Improvement of Multiple Sources Optical and SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous earth observation data obtained from different platforms have been widely used in various fields, and geometric calibration is a fundamental step for these applications. Traditional calibration methods are developed based on the rational function model (RFM), which is produced by image vendors as a substitution of the rigorous sensor model (RSM). Generally, the fitting accuracy of the RFM is much higher than 1 pixel, whereas the result decreases to several pixels in mountainous areas, especially for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Therefore, this paper proposes a new combined adjustment for geolocation accuracy improvement of multiple sources satellite SAR and optical imagery. Tie points are extracted based on a robust image matching algorithm, and relationships between the parameters of the range-doppler (RD) model and the RFM are developed by transformed into the same Geodetic Coordinate systems. At the same time, a heterogeneous weight strategy is designed for better convergence. Experimental results indicate that our proposed model can achieve much higher geolocation accuracy with approximately 2.60 pixels in the X direction and 3.50 pixels in the Y direction. Compared with traditional methods developed based on RFM, our proposed model provides a new way for synergistic use of multiple sources remote sensing data.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Statistical Modeling to Retrieve the Cloud Base Height from Geostationary Satellites: Applications to the ABI Sensor on Board of the GOES-R Satellite Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although cloud base height is a relevant variable for many applications, including aviation, it is not routinely monitored by current geostationary satellites. This is probably a consequence of the difficulty of providing reliable estimations of the cloud base height from visible and infrared radiances from current imagers. We hypothesize that existing algorithms suffer from the accumulation of errors from upstream retrievals necessary to estimate the cloud base height, and that this hampers higher predictability in the retrievals to be achieved. To test this hypothesis, we trained a statistical model based on the random forest algorithm to retrieve the cloud base height, using as predictors the radiances from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-16) and variables from a numerical weather prediction model. The predictand data consisted of cloud base height observations recorded at meteorological aerodrome report (METAR) stations over an extended region covering the contiguous USA. Our results indicate the potential of the proposed methodology. In particular, the performance of the cloud base height retrievals appears to be superior to the state-of-the-science algorithms, which suffer from the accumulation of errors from upstream retrievals. We also find a direct relationship between the errors and the mean cloud base height predicted over the region, which allowed us to obtain estimations of both the cloud base height and its error.

TI  - The Assessment of Cross Calibration/Validation Accuracy for KOMPSAT-3 Using Landsat 8 and 6S
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we performed cross calibration of KOMPSAT-3 AEISS imaging sensor with reference to normalized pixels in the Landsat 8 OLI scenes of homogenous ROI recorded by both sensors between January 2014 and December 2019 at the Libya 4 PICS. Cross calibration is using images from a stable and well-calibrated satellite sensor as references to harmonize measurements from other sensors and/or characterize other sensors. But cross calibration has two problems; RSR and temporal difference. The RSR of KOMPSAT-3 and Landsat 8 are similar at the blue and green bands. But the red and NIR bands have a large difference. So we calculate SBAF of each sensor. We compared the SBAF estimated from the TOA Radiance simulation with KOMPSAT-3 and Landsat 8, the results displayed a difference of about 2.07 similar to 2.92% and 0.96 similar to 1.21% in the VIS and NIR bands. Before SBAF, Reflectance and Radiance difference was 0.42 similar to 23.23%. Case of difference temporal, we simulated by 6S and Landsat 8 for alignment the same acquisition time. The SBAF-corrected cross calibration coefficients using KOMPSAT-3, 6S and simulated Landsat 8 compared to the initial cross calibration without correction demonstrated a percentage difference in the spectral bands of about 0.866 similar to 1.192%. KOMPSAT-3 maximum uncertainty was estimated at 3.26 similar to 3.89%; errors due to atmospheric condition minimized to less than 1% (via 6S); Maximum deviation of KOMPSAT-3 DN was less than 1%. As the result, the results affirm that SBAF and 6s simulation enhanced cross-calibration accuracy.

TI  - Effect of Nano-Tracer on Identification of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Pelvic Cavity and Postoperative Complications in Patients with Cervical Cancer.
T2  - Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Cervical cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system. Its incidence rate ranks first among female malignant tumors in China and has been increasing in recent years. However, pelvic lymph node metastasis is an important factor affecting the prognosis of cervical cancer, because pelvic lymph node metastasis determines the scope of surgery, it is also an important basis for postoperative adjuvant treatment. Therefore, an accurate and effective method is needed to detect the presence of lymphatic metastases in time to guide the need for systematic pelvic lymph node dissection. This article explores the clinical application of nano-tracer in the surgical treatment of cervical cancer patients and the impact of postoperative complications on patients with pelvic sentinel lymph nodes. The results show that the success rate of sentinel lymph node tracing in cervical cancer surgery is high, and it is a safe and efficient lymph tracer, which can provide an effective way to study cervical micro metastasis and lymphatic chemotherapy.

TI  - Retrieval of Urban Aerosol Optical Depth from Landsat 8 OLI in Nanjing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol is an essential parameter for assessing the atmospheric environmental quality, and accurate monitoring of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is of great significance in climate research and environmental protection. Based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and MODIS09A1 surface reflectance products under clear skies with limited cloud cover, we retrieved the AODs in Nanjing City from 2017 to 2018 using the combined Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) methods. The retrieval accuracy was validated by in-situ CE-318 measurements and MOD04_3K aerosol products. Furthermore, we analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of the AODs and discussed a case of high AOD distribution. The results showed that: (1) Validated by CE-318 and MOD04_3K data, the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the retrieved AODs were 0.874 and 0.802, 0.134 and 0.188, and 0.099 and 0.138, respectively. Hence, the combined DT and DB algorithms used in this study exhibited a higher performance than the MOD04_3K-obtained aerosol products. (2) Under static and stable meteorological conditions, the average annual AOD in Nanjing was 0.47. At the spatial scale, the AODs showed relatively high values in the north and west, low in the south, and the lowest in the center. At the seasonal scale, the AODs were highest in the summer, followed by spring, winter, and autumn. Moreover, changes were significantly higher in the summer than in the other three seasons, with little differences among spring, autumn, and winter. (3) Based on the spatial and seasonal characteristics of the AOD distribution in Nanjing, a case of high AOD distribution caused by a large area of external pollution and local meteorological conditions was discussed, indicating that it could provide extra details of the AOD distribution to analyze air pollution sources using fine spatial resolution like in the Landsat 8 OLI.

TI  - Upscaling Northern Peatland CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle as they contain a large soil carbon stock. However, current climate change could potentially shift peatlands from being carbon sinks to carbon sources. Remote sensing methods provide an opportunity to monitor carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange in peatland ecosystems at large scales under these changing conditions. In this study, we developed empirical models of the CO2 balance (net ecosystem exchange, NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (ER) that could be used for upscaling CO2 fluxes with remotely sensed data. Two to three years of eddy covariance (EC) data from five peatlands in Sweden and Finland were compared to modelled NEE, GPP and ER based on vegetation indices from 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI and land surface temperature from 1 km resolution MODIS data. To ensure a precise match between the EC data and the Sentinel-2 observations, a footprint model was applied to derive footprint-weighted daily means of the vegetation indices. Average model parameters for all sites were acquired with a leave-one-out-cross-validation procedure. Both the GPP and the ER models gave high agreement with the EC-derived fluxes (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.56, NRMSE = 14% and 15%, respectively). The performance of the NEE model was weaker (average R-2 = 0.36 and NRMSE = 13%). Our findings demonstrate that using optical and thermal satellite sensor data is a feasible method for upscaling the GPP and ER of northern boreal peatlands, although further studies are needed to investigate the sources of the unexplained spatial and temporal variation of the CO2 fluxes.

TI  - Evidence of urban heat island impacts on the vegetation growing season length in a tropical city
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the impacts of urban heat islands (UHI) and associated thermal gradients on vegetation seasonality (i.e. phenology) is vital for understanding spatial patterns in vegetation ecosystem functions. However, in contrast to temperate cites, there is little evidence to show how UHI influences landscape phenological processes in the tropics. In this study, we examined vegetation phenological responses to urban form, distance from the city centre and surface temperatures, in the tropical city of Kampala, Uganda. Estimates of vegetation growing season length and land surface temperature were derived from MODIS satellite imagery for multiple years (2013-2015) and urban form was characterised using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification. We showed that growing season length increased along the urban-rural gradient (p < 0.001) and was longest in the least built-up LCZ class (p < 0.001). Growing season length was significantly reduced as land surface temperature increased (p < 0.001). These findings contrast with results reported for temperate cities, where higher temperatures are often associated with longer vegetation growing seasons. Our findings suggest that enhanced surface temperatures associated with UHI are a limiting factor to season length in the urban tropics. Urban planners in tropical cities should therefore account for vegetation sensitivity to UHI when developing targeted management strategies aiming to optimise the benefits accrued from vegetation.

TI  - The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer: Contributing to Earth Observations for over 40 Years
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR), which have been flying on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) polar-orbiting weather satellites since 1978, provide the longest global record of Earth observations from a visible-infrared imager. Experience gained through AVHRRs has been integral to the development of the new-generation sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and associated data processing algorithms in the United States, as well as a similar class of sensor by space agencies around the world. Over four decades of data have been vital for studying Earth and its change. The MetOp-C satellite that was successfully launched in 2018 carries the last AVHRR. This article reviews the contributions of AVHRR in building a continuous global data record over the last 40 years on the occasion of its last launch.

TI  - A multicenter non-randomized phase III study of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This prospective multicenter non-randomized phase III study aims to evaluate the long-term outcome of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer compared with conventional distal or total gastrectomy. Clinically diagnosed primary T1N0M0 gastric cancer patients with a single lesion (<= 40 mm) and without previous endoscopic treatment will be enrolled in this study. Sentinel nodes are identified by dye and radioisotope tracers and are subjected to intraoperative rapid pathology. For patients with negative sentinel node metastasis, individualized surgery consisting of limited stomach resection and sentinel node basin dissection is performed, while standard gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection is employed for the positive sentinel node patients. A total of 225 patients will be accrued from 13 hospitals that have experience in sentinel node mapping. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, sentinel node detection rate, diagnostic accuracy for sentinel node, distribution of sentinel nodes and metastatic sentinel node/non-sentinel node, and postoperative quality of life.

TI  - Learning Convolutional Sparse Coding on Complex Domain for Interferometric Phase Restoration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric phase restoration has been investigated for decades and most of the state-of-the-art methods have achieved promising performances for InSAR phase restoration. These methods generally follow the nonlocal filtering processing chain, aiming at circumventing the staircase effect and preserving the details of phase variations. In this article, we propose an alternative approach for InSAR phase restoration, that is, Complex Convolutional Sparse Coding (ComCSC) and its gradient regularized version. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that we solve the InSAR phase restoration problem in a deconvolutional fashion. The proposed methods can not only suppress interferometric phase noise, but also avoid the staircase effect and preserve the details. Furthermore, they provide an insight into the elementary phase components for the interferometric phases. The experimental results on synthetic and realistic high- and medium-resolution data sets from TerraSAR-X StripMap and Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath mode, respectively, show that our method outperforms those previous state-of-the-art methods based on nonlocal InSAR filters, particularly the state-of-the-art method: InSAR-BM3D. The source code of this article will be made publicly available for reproducible research inside the community.

TI  - An Assessment of the Filling Process of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and Its Impact on the Downstream Countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as the Millennium Dam, has been filling at a fast rate. This project has created issues for the Nile Basin countries of Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. The filling of GERD has an impact on the Nile Basin hydrology and specifically the water storages (lakes/reservoirs) and flow downstream. In this study, through the analysis of multi-source satellite imagery, we study the filling of the GERD reservoir. The time-series generated using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery displays the number of classified water pixels in the dam from early June 2017 to September 2020, indicating a contrasting trend in August and September 2020 for the upstream/downstream water bodies: upstream of the dam rises steeply, while downstream decreases. Our time-series analysis also shows the average monthly precipitation (derived using IMERG) in the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia has received an abnormally high amount of rainfall as well as a high amount of runoff (analyzed using GLDAS output). Simultaneously, the study also demonstrates the drying trend downstream at Lake Nasser in Southern Egypt before December 2020. From our results, we estimate that the volume of water at GERD has already increased by 3.584 billion cubic meters, which accounts for about 5.3% of its planned capacity (67.37 billion cubic meters) from 9 July-30 November 2020. Finally, we observed an increasing trend in GRACE anomalies for GERD, whereas, for the Lake Nasser, we observed a decreasing trend. In addition, our study discusses potential interactions between GERD and the rainfall and resulting flood in Sudan. Our study suggests that attention should be drawn to the connection between the GERD filling and potential drought in the downstream countries during the upcoming dry spells in the Blue Nile River Basin. This study provides an open-source technique using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor the changes in water level during the filling of the GERD reservoir. GEE proves to be a powerful as well as an efficient way of analyzing computationally intensive SAR images.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastectomy and lumpectomy are well-established surgical methods for the surgical treatment of breast cancer. The comparison of these methods within the 30-year period in terms of clinicopathological characteristics, recurrence, and survival patterns is required in order to provide aid in clinical decision-making. A total of 2531 women who underwent mastectomy or lumpectomy between 1982 and 2012 for primary invasive breast tumors were compared. Starting from 2003, similar variables for patients with primary invasive breast tumors who underwent sentinel node biopsy (SNB) were presented. Mastectomy was performed in 1870 patients and lumpectomy in 661. The median follow-up was 38 months for all patients. The ratio of mastectomy was lower for the patients who underwent SNB. There was no significant difference in breast cancer-related survival or disease-free survival between lumpectomy and mastectomy even after adjusting for the clinicopathological variables. Lumpectomy and mastectomy demonstrate similar survival rates for patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Tumor grade, stage, hormone receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, and distant recurrence have an impact on breast cancer-related survival.

TI  - Deconstructing landscape pattern: applications of remote sensing to physiognomic landscape mapping
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1939, Carl Troll pointed out that "air photo interpretation is to a large extent landscape ecology". From that time forward, remote sensing has been applied across different disciplines to comprehend the holistic and dynamic spatial layout of the visual Earth environment. However, its applicability in the domain of landscape character assessment, landscape design and planning is still questionable. The purpose of this paper was to synthesise some historical and current applications of remote sensing for the decomposition of the continual visual landscape from a bird's eye perspective and to explore the potential for bridging geographic processes with visual perception and an appreciation of the landscape pattern. From the point of view of landscape ecology, the organisation of the landscape pattern [namely, the size, shape (form), number, density and diversity, the complexity of landscape elements, and colours and textures of the land cover] is crucial for the cognition of both the visual landscape experience and the geographic processes. There are numerous pieces of evidence from the literature that remote sensing data are widely implemented in the modelling of physiognomic landscape. The synthesis of the literature concludes with perspective directions of remote sensing applications, such as mapping the status of the ecosystem (landscape) services provision, the delineation of the boundaries of the protected areas based on the quality of the visual environment, and the assessment of the sustainability of the land use practices, regarding their impact on landscape aesthetics extent.

TI  - Monitoring Wet Snow Over an Alpine Region Using Sentinel-1 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to monitor wet snow conditions from Sentinel-1 over a season, to examine its variation over time by cross-checking wet snow with independent snow and weather estimates, and to study its distribution taking into account terrain characteristics such as elevation, orientation, and slope. One of our motivations was to derive useful representations of daily or seasonal snow changes that would help to easily identify wet snow elevations and determine melt-out days in an area of interest. In this work, a well-known approach in the literature is used to estimate the extent of wet snow cover continuously over a season and an analysis of the influence of complex mountain topography on snow distribution is proposed taking into account altitude, slope, and aspect of the terrain. The Sentinel-1 wet snow extent product was compared with Sentinel-2 snow products for cloud free scenes. We show that while there are good agreements between the two satellite products, differences exist, especially in areas of forests and glaciers where snow is underestimated. This underestimation must be considered alongside the areas of geometric distortion that were excluded from our study. We analysed retrievals at the scale of our study area by examining wet snow Altitude-Orientation diagrams for different classes of slopes and also wet snow Altitude-Time diagrams for different classes of orientations. We have shown that this type of representation is very useful to get an overview of the snow distribution as it allows to identify very easily wet snow lines for different orientations. For an orientation of interest, the Altitude-Time diagrams can be used to track the evolution of snow to locate altitudes and dates of snow loss. We also show that ascending/descending Sentinel-1 image time series are complementary to monitor wet snow over the French alpine areas to highlight wet snow altitude ranges and identify melt-out days. Links have also been made between Sentinel-1 responses (wet snow) and snow/meteorological events carefully listed over the entire 2017-2018 season.

TI  - Long-Term Changes of Aquatic Invasive Plants and Implications for Future Distribution: A Case Study Using a Tank Cascade System in Sri Lanka
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability can influence the dynamics of aquatic invasive alien plants (AIAPs) that exert tremendous pressure on aquatic systems, leading to loss of biodiversity, agricultural wealth, and ecosystem services. However, the magnitude of these impacts remains poorly known. The current study aims to analyse the long-term changes in the spatio-temporal distribution of AIAPs under the influence of climate variability in a heavily infested tank cascade system (TCS) in Sri Lanka. The changes in coverage of various features in the TCS were analysed using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of ten Landsat images over a 27-year period, from 1992 to 2019 using ENVI remote sensing software. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimate were used to analyse the trend of annual rainfall and temperature. We observed a positive trend of temperature that was statistically significant (p value < 0.05) and a positive trend of rainfall that was not statistically significant (p values > 0.05) over the time period. Our results showed fluctuations in the distribution of AIAPs in the short term; however, the coverage of AIAPs showed an increasing trend in the study area over the longer term. Thus, this study suggests that the AIAPs are likely to increase under climate variability in the study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of an empirical study on the opportunities of introducing virtual reality technologies into social services for the elderly conducted by the authors in 2019-2020. The authors indicate that the need to implement VR technology is determined by the changes in the worldview, lifestyle, and the role of elderly people in modern society. The authors conducted an observation and subsequent interviewing of social service clients who attended the "Virtual Tourism" classes. The study demonstrates a positive impact on the psycho-emotional state and physical wellbeing of the elderly. However, the authors also indicate possible risks to vision associated with heavy eye strain in the process of using VR glasses.

TI  - Evaluating Warfare Myths about Science and Christianity and How These Myths Promote Scientism
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many people assume that there has been ceaseless conflict between science and Christianity. I argue that the real conflict has been between scientism and religion. Scientism is the view that only the sciences generate knowledge or rational belief. Scientism, as typically articulated, entails the opinion that reliable belief about divinity (theological realism) is impossible. I debunk four historic science-Christianity conflict myths and show how they have promoted scientism. These four science-religion myths function as part of a larger warfare narrative about science and Christianity. This misleading warfare thesis often comes packaged with an alternative anti-theistic "myth" in the anthropological sense-in this case, a worldview-shaping narrative that awakens the imagination to interpret the world in scientistic and non-theistic ways. I call this the scientistic warfare myth and explore its major flaws.

TI  - Mapping Allochemical Limestone Formations in Hazara, Pakistan Using Google Cloud Architecture: Application of Machine-Learning Algorithms on Multispectral Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-resolution Geological Survey of Pakistan (GSP) maps surrounding the region of interest show oolitic and fossiliferous limestone occurrences correspondingly in Samanasuk, Lockhart, and Margalla hill formations in the Hazara division, Pakistan. Machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) have been rarely applied to multispectral remote sensing data for differentiating between limestone formations formed due to different depositional environments, such as oolitic or fossiliferous. Unlike the previous studies that mostly report lithological classification of rock types having different chemical compositions by the MLAs, this paper aimed to investigate MLAs' potential for mapping subclasses within the same lithology, i.e., limestone. Additionally, selecting appropriate data labels, training algorithms, hyperparameters, and remote sensing data sources were also investigated while applying these MLAs. In this paper, first, oolitic (Samanasuk), fossiliferous (Lockhart and Margalla) limestone-bearing formations along with the adjoining Hazara formation were mapped using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and naive Bayes (NB) MLAs. The RF algorithm reported the best accuracy of 83.28% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.78. To further improve the targeted allochemical limestone formation map, annotation labels were generated by the fusion of maps obtained from principal component analysis (PCA), decorrelation stretching (DS), X-means clustering applied to ASTER-L1T, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 datasets. These labels were used to train and validate SVM, CART, NB, and RF MLAs to obtain a binary classification map of limestone occurrences in the Hazara division, Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The classification of Landsat-8 data by CART reported 99.63% accuracy, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.99, and was in good agreement with the field validation. This binary limestone map was further classified into oolitic (Samanasuk) and fossiliferous (Lockhart and Margalla) formations by all the four MLAs; in this case, RF surpassed all the other algorithms with an improved accuracy of 96.36%. This improvement can be attributed to better annotation, resulting in a binary limestone classification map, which formed a mask for improved classification of oolitic and fossiliferous limestone in the area.

TI  - Interdecadal Changes in Aerosol Optical Depth over Pakistan Based on the MERRA-2 Reanalysis Data during 1980-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal evolution and trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over environmentally distinct regions in Pakistan are investigated for the period 1980-2018. The AOD data for this period was obtained from the Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis atmospheric products, together with the Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals. The climatology of AOD(MERRA-2) is analyzed in three different contexts: the entire study domain (Pakistan), six regions within the domain, and 12 cities chosen from the entire study domain. The time-series analysis of the MODIS and MERRA-2 AOD data shows similar patterns in individual cities. The AOD and its seasonality vary strongly across Pakistan, with the lowest (0.05 +/- 0.04) and highest (0.40 +/- 0.06) in the autumn and summer seasons over the desert and the coastal regions, respectively. During the study period, the annual AOD trend increased between 0.002 and 0.012 year(-1). The increase of AOD is attributed to an increase in population and emissions from natural and/or anthropogenic sources. A general increase in the annual AOD over the central to lower Indus Basin is ascribed to the large contribution of dust particles from the desert. During winter and spring, a significant decrease in the AOD was observed in the northern regions of Pakistan. The MERRA-2 and MODIS trends (2002-2018) were compared, and the results show visible differences between the AOD datasets due to theuseof different versions and collection methods. Overall, the present study provides insight into the regional differences of AOD and its trends with the pronounced seasonal behavior across Pakistan.

TI  - Ocean Swell Comparisons Between Sentinel-1 and WAVEWATCH III Around Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - An intercomparison between directional wave spectra derived from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites and a WAVEWATCH III model hindcast in the wider Australian region is presented. The coastal buoy network around Australia is considerably sparse, and only a handful of buoy measurements exist in deeper oceans. National and regional scale wave models require validation and verification through intercomparisons with available observations to be confidently adopted and improved. In the absence of dense in-situ measurements, satellite-derived surface wave data provide an invaluable and independent source of observations. Satellite altimeters provide well-calibrated significant wave height data, but do not resolve wave directions, and are also not the platform of choice for resolving wave periods. SAR satellites that routinely map ocean surface waves fill this gap as they are able to measure directional wind-wave spectra of long period waves. This constitutes an important satellite data stream for better understanding the propagation of swell waves across ocean basins, and for comparisons with national and down-scaled wave models. However, both SAR wave measurements as well as wave models do not represent the truth and need qualification before regarding them as reliable data sets. The aim of this article is to perform an intercomparison of a wave model hindcast with SAR-derived wave information in the wider Australian region. The comparisons are done in the context of mean wave climate and its seasonal variability, and demonstrate good agreement for wave heights and periods. Valuable insights into possible sources of disagreement are given.

TI  - A 15-year spatio-temporal analysis of plant β-diversity using Landsat time series derived Rao's Q index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding temporal dynamics of plant biodiversity is crucial for conservation strategies at regional and local levels. The mostly applied hitherto methods are based on field observations of the plant communities and the related taxa. Satellite earth observation time series offer continuous and wider coverage for the assessment of plant diversity, especially in remote areas. Theoretical basis and large-scale solutions for assessing beta-diversity have been recently presented. Yet landscape-scale and context-based analysis are missing. We assessed temporal beta-diversity using Raas Q diversity derived from Landsat-based vegetation indices by considering the effect of ERA-5 monthly aggregates environmental factors (temperature and precipitation) extracted using Google Earth Engine (GEE), land use classes, and two common vegetation indices. We derived 15-year Rao's Q diversity using Landsat-7 based normalized difference vegetation index (NDV1) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI). We evaluated the temporal turnover in Rao's Q on multiple land use classes, including agriculture, intact forest and areas affected by and invasive species. Vegetation index and Rao's Q diverged between pre- and post- monsoon seasons. Rao's Q had higher temporal turnover with NDVI than MSAVI for all vegetation dasses, however the latter showed higher sensitivity towards temperature and precipitation. Moreover, agriculture generally showed higher variability than forest and invasive species. The temporal turnover was correlated between NDVI and MSAVI for all vegetation classes, which indicated that the variability among vegetation types was directly related to spectral heterogeneity. Furthermore, MSAVI was less sensitive to the effect of soil in assessing the vegetation indices, which resulted in higher global sensitivity of Q(MSAVI). Near infrared and red spectra used in vegetation indices are able to capture a small variation in leaf traits reflectance for vegetation types. Here, the beta-diversities and their temporal dynamics derived from the vegetation indices differed based on their sensitivity to soil, vegetation density and seasonality. This approach and its open source implementation can be tested for different forest ecosystems at varying spatial scales.

TI  - Validation and Performance of Satellite Meteorological Dataset MERRA-2 for Solar and Wind Applications
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast-growing energy demand of the world makes the researchers focus on finding new energy sources or optimizing already-developed approaches. For an efficient use of solar and wind energy in an energy system, correct design and sizing of a power system is of high importance and improving or optimizing the process of data obtaining for this purpose leads to higher performance and lower cost per unit of energy. It is essential to have the most precise possible estimation of solar and wind energy potential and other local weather parameters in order to fully feed the demand and avoid extra costs. There are various methods for obtaining local data, such as local measurements, official organizational data, satellite obtained, and reanalysis data. In this paper, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications dataset version 2 (MERRA-2) dataset provided by NASA is introduced and its performance is evaluated by comparison to various locally measured datasets offered by meteorological institutions such as Meteonorm and Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD, or Germany's National Meteorological Service) around the world. After comparison, correlation coefficients from 0.95 to 0.99 are observed for monthly global horizontal irradiance values. In the case of air temperature, correlation coefficients of 0.99 and for wind speed from 0.81 to 0.99 are observed. High correlation with ground measurements and relatively low errors are confirmed, especially for irradiance and temperature values, that makes MERRA-2 a valuable dataset, considering its world coverage and availability.

TI  - A GIS-Based Artificial Neural Network Model for Flood Susceptibility Assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a geographic information system (GIS)-based artificial neural network (GANN) model for flood susceptibility assessment of Keelung City, Taiwan. Various factors, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, flow accumulation, flow direction, topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, rainfall, and normalized difference vegetation index, were generated using a digital elevation model and LANDSAT 8 imagery. Historical flood data from 2015 to 2019, including 307 flood events, were adopted for a comparison of flood susceptibility. Using these factors, the GANN model, based on the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), was employed to provide flood susceptibility. The validation results indicate that a satisfactory result, with a correlation coefficient of 0.814, was obtained. A comparison of the GANN model with those from the SOBEK model was conducted. The comparative results demonstrated that the proposed method can provide good accuracy in predicting flood susceptibility. The results of flood susceptibility are categorized into five classes: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, with coverage areas of 60.5%, 27.4%, 8.6%, 2.5%, and 1%, respectively. The results demonstrate that nearly 3.5% of the study area, including the core district of the city and an exceedingly populated area including the financial center of the city, can be categorized as high to very high flood susceptibility zones.

TI  - Association between Number of Retrieved Sentinel Lymph Nodes and Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a standard axillary staging surgery for early breast cancer, and the proportion of patients requiring axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is decreasing. We aimed to evaluate the association between the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) retrieved and the risk of lymphedema of the ipsilateral arm.Methods: Prospectively collected medical records of 910 patients were reviewed. Lymphedema was defined as a difference in circumference > 2 cm compared to the contralateral arm and/or having clinical records of lymphedema treatment in the rehabilitation clinic.Results: Together with an objective and subjective assessment of lymphedema, 36 patients (6.1%) had lymphedema in the SLNB group and 85 patients (27.0%) had lymphedema in the ALND group (p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis of the whole cohort, risk factors significantly associated risk with the development of lymphedema were body mass index, mastectomy (vs. breast-conserving surgery), ALND, and radiation therapy. In logistic regression models in the SLNB group only, there was no correlation between the number of retrieved SLNs and the incidence of lymphedema. In addition, in the Pearson correlation analysis, no correlation was observed between the number of retrieved SLNs and the difference in circumference between the ipsilateral and contralateral upper extremities (correlation coefficients = 0.067, p= 0.111).Conclusion: The risk of lymphedema in breast cancer surgery and adjuvant treatments is multifactorial. The number of retrieved lymph nodes during sentinel biopsy was not associated with the incidence of lymphedema.

TI  - Assessment and Combination of SMAP and Sentinel-1A/B-Derived Soil Moisture Estimates With Land Surface Model Outputs in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, USA
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of large-scale water-related natural disasters such as droughts, floods, wildfires, landslides, and dust outbreaks can benefit from the high spatial resolution soil moisture (SM) data of satellite and modeled products because antecedent SM conditions in the topsoil layer govern the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and runoff. SM data retrieved from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) have proved to be an effective method of monitoring SM content at different spatial resolutions: 1) radiometer-based product gridded at 36 km; 2) radiometer-only enhanced posting product gridded at 9 km; and 3) SMAP/Sentinel-1A/B products at 3 and 1 km. In this article, we focused on 9-, 3-, and 1-km SM products: three products were validated against <italic>in situ</italic> data using conventional and triple collocation analysis (TCA) statistics and were then merged with a Noah-Multiparameterization version-3.6 (NoahMP36) land surface model (LSM). An exponential filter and a cumulative density function (CDF) were applied for further evaluation of the three SM products, and the maximize-$R$ method was applied to combine SMAP and NoahMP36 SM data. CDF-matched 9-, 3-, and 1-km SMAP SM data showed reliable performance: $R$ and ubRMSD values of the CDF-matched SMAP products were 0.658, 0.626, and 0.570 and 0.049, 0.053, and 0.055 m(3)/m(3), respectively. When SMAP and NoahMP36 were combined, the $R$ -values for the 9-, 3-, and 1-km SMAP SM data were greatly improved: $R$ -values were 0.825, 0.804, and 0.795, and ubRMSDs were 0.034, 0.036, and 0.037 m(3)/m(3), respectively. These results indicate the potential uses of SMAP/Sentinel data for improving regional-scale SM estimates and for creating further applications of LSMs with improved accuracy.

TI  - Association between Long-Term Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Lung Imaging Phenotype in CODA Cohort
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Ambient particulate matter (PM) is causing respiratory symptoms of individuals at all ages and reducing their lung functions. These individuals could develop chronic pulmonary disease. Recent studies have shown that short-term exposure to PM affects acute exacerbation of respiratory disease. However, evidence about the association between long-term exposure and progression of respiratory diseases remains insufficient. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between long-term exposure of air pollution (PM2.5) and the effect on lung imaging phenotype in dust-exposed Korean adults living near cement factories. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Dusty Areas (CODA) cohort, which was recruited from 2012 to 2014. Emphysema index and mean wall area were measured using an in-house software program developed by the Korean obstructive lung disease study group based on chest CT scan. A satellite-based model was used to estimate the long-term PM2.5 concentration at each participant's address. Results: Of 504 eligible participants, 400 participants were analyzed. Their mean age was 71.7 years. Most participants were men (N = 301, 75.3%). The emphysema index of the whole group was 6.63 +/- 0.70, and the mean wall area was 68.8 +/- 5.2. Image measurement and PM2.5 concentration showed no significant difference in the whole group; however, in the group of subjects with normal lung function, there were significant associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and emphysema index measurement: 1-year (ss = 0.758, p = 0.021), 3-year (ss = 0.629, p = 0.038), and 5-year (ss = 0.544, p = 0.045). There was no significant association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mean wall area measurement: 1-year (ss = -0.389, p = 0.832), 3-year (ss = -3.677, p = 0.170), and 5-year (ss = -3.769, p = 0.124). Conclusions: This study suggests that long-term exposure of PM2.5 may affect the emphysematous change in patients with normal lung functions.

TI  - Magnetic Field Generation System of the Magnetic Probe With Diamond Quantum Sensor and Ferromagnetic Materials for the Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes With Magnetic Nanoparticles
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed the magnetic probe with a diamond quantum sensor and electromagnetic coils to detect sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), as the medical application of diamond quantum sensing. The probe magnetizes magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) accumulated in SLNs and detect the magnetic fields of magnetized MNPs. In this study, we designed a ferromagnetic core that has a unique shape and optimized the magnetic field generation system for improving the detection performance such as the magnetic sensitivity and detectable distance. The proposed magnetic core enhances an excitation magnetic field strength at a longer distance and suppresses a bias field strength at a location of the diamond quantum sensor. The increment of the excitation field is approximately 370% and the decrement of the bias field is approximately 45%. In addition to the proposed magnetic core, even applying a cancellation coil, the excitation field strength is tenfold compared with the coil only structure, suggesting the larger magnetization of MNPs generates the large magnetic field for longer detectable distance.

TI  - Water and hydropower reservoirs: High temporal resolution time series derived from MODIS data to characterize seasonality and variability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing time series offer the possibility to monitor surface water at dense temporal intervals. Open data archives as well as developments in cloud computing are the main drivers towards and increased availability of raw data allowing for the extraction of detailed information on water bodies such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs. At the same time, changes in precipitation patterns, increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, intensification of human water use, and regulatory upstream measurements affect water resources around the world today. With regard to water availability and supply-demand balance, artificial water reservoirs have become most important elements e.g. for hydropower, irrigated agriculture, flood control, as well as for domestic and industrial water use. Nevertheless, publicly accessible information on reservoirs is still not harmonized and available at global scale. Therefore, it is more essential than ever to acquire detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of water resources - especially reservoirs - and the drivers of their dynamics. In this study, we analyze daily water extent time series of the 1267 largest reservoirs worldwide based on the existing DLR-DFD Global WaterPack product derived from MODIS data (Klein et al., 2017). The study aims to present an experimental way of spatio-temporal variability analysis by implementing the TIMESAT software which is usually used for vegetation analyses. In our experimental approach we derive information on the timing when the open surface water areas of reservoirs increase and decrease by identifying start date, end date and duration of such reservoir cycles as well as timing of maximum surface water extent (hydro-metrics). For four selected reservoirs, these hydro-metrics derived from surface water extent are compared with hydro-metrics derived from in-situ water level measurements or altimetry datasets and are discussed in more detail. Based on the presented examples we demonstrate the potential of high temporal resolution surface water extent data and spatio-temporal variability analyses with TIMESAT for future applications supporting the understanding of reservoir variability as a result of water management and hydroclimatic variability.

TI  - Ecological Monitoring with Spy Satellite Images-The Case of Red Wood Ants in Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of habitat conditions drive important changes in distribution and abundance of animal species making monitoring an important but also a challenging task when data from the past are scarce. We compared the distribution of ant mounds in the 1960s with recent inventories (2018), looking at changes in canopy cover over time, in a managed forest. Both historical and recent sources of information were used. Habitat suitability at present was determined using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image as a proxy for stand canopy cover. The NDVI product was obtained using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel 2 repository. For past conditions (no spectral information available), presence of edges and more open canopies was assessed on a Corona spy-satellite image and based on information from old forest management plans. A threshold distance of 30 m was used to assess location of ant nests compared to favorable habitats. Both old and new information sources showed that ants prefer intermediate canopy cover conditions in their vicinity. Nests remained clustered because of the heterogeneous habitat conditions, but spatial distribution has changed due to canopy alteration along time. The analysis on the NDVI was effective for 82% of cases (i.e., nests occurred within 30 m from favorable habitats). For all the remaining nests (18%), the Google Earth high resolution satellite image revealed in their vicinity the presence of small canopy gaps (undetected by the NDVI). These results show that historical satellite images are very useful for explaining the long-term dynamics of ant colonies. In addition, the use of modern remote sensing techniques provides a reliable and expedite method in determining the presence of favorable small-scale habitat, offering a very useful tool for ecological monitoring across large landscapes and in very different areas, especially in the context of ecosystem dynamics driven and exacerbated by climate change.

TI  - Mapping ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers using multispectral satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cliffs play a key role in the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers, but assessing their importance is limited by a lack of datasets on their distribution and evolution at scales larger than an individual glacier. These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pleiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pleaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pleiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.

TI  - Exploring the potential of land surface phenology and seasonal cloud free composites of one year of Sentinel-2 imagery for tree species mapping in a mountainous region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite imagery with high temporal and spatial resolution, such as acquired by Sentinel-2, is increasingly becoming available and is used to derive maps of tree species. Such mapping products are required in the scope of operational and sustainable forest management. Existing studies that employ Sentinel-2 imagery have already evaluated different classification algorithms but are often confined to areas smaller than a single Sentinel-2 scene. In this study, the area of interest (a large part of the Province of Tyrol (Austria)) is covered by two Sentinel-2 tiles, of which approximately 5000 km(2) are forested. In order to deal with seasonal metrics under recurrent cloud cover conditions, we exploit one year of Sentinel-2 imagery by using land surface phenology (LSP) and seasonal cloud-free composites for mapping five different tree species groups (Broadleaved-, Larch(Larix), Pine- (Pinus), Dwarf Pine- (Pinus mugo) and Spruce/Fir (Abies alba/Picea abies) stands). Although a regular multitemporal classification setup based on three cloud-free images reached an overall accuracy of around 84.4 % and outperformed monotemporal setups by around 10 % points, the availability of single cloud-free images was limited in the mountainous region. Thus, alternative approaches, using combined measures for the entire time series of Sentinel-2 imagery, i.e. three-monthly temporal reflectance composites and phenological metrics, were tested and could even improve overall accuracy by 1-2 % points. As a conclusion, we agree with previous studies that multitemporal imagery can help improving the mapping accuracy. However, leveraging satellite image time series for large-scale mapping of tree species should not only rely on high-quality cloud-free single images and should strongly be supported by i.e. seasonal composites or multi-image metrics. Therefore, development and provisioning of such datasets should be fostered.

TI  - A neural network approach for deriving absorption coefficients of ocean water constituents from total light absorption and particulate absorption coefficients
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) of oceanic and coastal waters provide useful information for studying light availability in various ocean layers, primary productivity, particulate matter, and aquatic photochemistry. The total spectral absorption coefficient, a(lambda) and spectral particulate absorption coefficient, a(p)(lambda) are the IOPs that are some of the extensively measured IOPs with the existing absorption instruments. The total spectral absorption coefficient is often expressed as the sum of subcomponent IOPs, phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)), combined absorption due gelbstoff and detritus (a(dg)(lambda)) and the water itself. Similarly, a(p) can be subdivided into a(ph)(lambda) and a(d)(lambda), the detrital absorption coefficients. The existing models partition these IOPs into subcomponent IOPs by assuming spectral shapes for subcomponent IOPs and are computationally intensive. Hence, in this study, we implemented Neural Networks to derive the subcomponent IOPs due to their lower computational time requirement and their capability to model complex relationships. We trained and validated four Neural Networks (NN) for retrieval of IOPs from a(lambda) and a(p)(lambda). NNs - I & II are used to retrieve a(ph) and a(dg) at 443 nm from a(lambda). Similarly, NNs - III & IV are used to derive a(ph)(443) and a(d)(443) from a(p)(lambda). The four NNs are trained and tested using synthetic data created encompassing a wide range of optical properties observed in natural waters. For validation of the four NNs, the International Ocean Color Coordinating Group (IOCCG) simulated dataset, NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD) and global bio-optical insitu dataset (GBI) are used. The R-2 values obtained for GBI in the retrieval of a(ph)(443) and a(dg)(443) using NNs - I & II are 0.95 and 0.97, respectively. Similarly, a(ph) and a(d) retrieved using NN-III & IV resulted in R-2 values of 0.94 and 0.94 for the NOMAD dataset. Upon comparing the performance NNs - I & II with Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) in retrieving IOPs using the IOCCG dataset, the NNs exhibited lower errors. We also developed a hybrid algorithm, QAANN, to demonstrate the capability of NNs - I & II for remote sensing applications. QAANN resulted in 11-43% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to QAA, Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) models for a(ph)(443) retrieval using remote sensing reflectance from IOCCG simulated dataset. In the case of a(dg)(443), QAANN resulted in 5-10% less MAPE compared to other models for the same dataset. These results suggest that the developed NNs can be applied to satellite remote sensing data to retrieve subcomponent IOPs with improved accuracy.

TI  - Ice Concentration From Dual-Polarization SAR Images Using Ice and Water Retrievals at Multiple Spatial Scales
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new technique for automated retrieval of ice concentration from RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization HH-HV ScanSAR Wide images for subsequent assimilation in ice numerical models is presented. First, we extended our previously introduced ice and water detection approach operating at a 2.05 km $\times2.05$ km spatial scale to a set of 19 different spatial scales ranging from 2.05 km (41 pixels) down to 0.25 km (5 pixels). As the spatial resolution was increased, the overall accuracy of ice and water detection stayed at a very high level across all scales (between 99.5 and 99.8), but the number of water retrievals substantially dropped. Second, we designed an approach for estimating ice concentration in a 2 km $\times 2$ km ($40\times40$ pixels) area consisting of $64\,\,5 \times 5$ pixel blocks. The $5\times 5$ pixel blocks which are initially classified as unknowns are iteratively combined in clusters with effective spatial scales larger than 5 pixels. The clusters are further classified as ice or water using the ice probability model corresponding to the effective spatial scale. The $40\times40$ pixel area becomes populated with high-resolution ($5\times 5$ pixels) ice and water retrievals, and the ice concentration is estimated based on the number of ice and water retrievals. The proposed approach produces a much better agreement with the Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis ice concentrations (root-mean-square error (RMSE) 2.2) compared to the original 2-km ice/water detection approach (RMSE 19.9). The developed technique will be adapted to the RADARSAT Constellation Mission data for data assimilation in Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System.

TI  - Towards a regional dust modeling system in the central Middle East: Evaluation, uncertainties and recommendations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims towards an accurate regional dust modeling system in the central Middle East area (CME), through the implementation of the state-of-art dust parameterizations. The modeling system consists of the natural emission model NEMO, the meteorological model WRF and the chemistry transport model CAMx. An extensive evaluation of 16 different configurations has been realized, incorporating all the combinations of the components utilized in the state-of-art dust modeling approaches, namely the drag partition, the sandblasting efficiency, the horizontal mass flux, as well two commonly used soil particle size distributions. Daily mean PM10 measurements in Doha, as well the satellite AOD products of MODIS have been used for the quantitative and the qualitative assessment of the simulations. Noteworthy, each of these assessments did not yield to the exact same ranking of the configurations (e.g. best five) but they assisted on identifying clear patterns. For example, a consistent overestimation of the daily mean PM10, when the MacKinnon's drag partition scheme is utilized, was found. On the other hand, the assessments led to best three performing configurations, with common components the Raupach's drag partition scheme and Alfaro and Gomes sandblasting efficiency. Although their overall performance is good, several issues were found i.e. on individual dust events and a mean underestimation during the studied period, ranging from -49 to -75 mu g/m(3). One cause of this underestimation could be the aerodynamic entrainment, a mechanism usually neglected from the dust modeling approaches. Another cause could be missed regional and/or local sources or underestimation of their emission rates.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep space climate observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft drifts about the Lagrangian point approximate to 1.4-1.6 x 10(6) km from Earth, where its Earth polychromatic imaging camera (EPIC) observes the sun-lit face of the Earth every 1 to 2 hours. At any instance, there is a preferred (specular) spot on the globe, where a glint may be observed by EPIC. While monitoring reflectance at these spots (terrestrial glitter), we observe occasional intense glints originating from neither ocean surface nor cloud ice and we argue that mountain lakes high in the Andes are among the causes. We also examine time-averaged reflectance at the spots and find it exceeding that of neighbors, with the excess monotonically increasing with separation distance. This specular excess is found in all channels and is more pronounced in the latest and best-calibrated version of EPIC data, thus opening the possibility of testing geometric calibration by monitoring distant glitter.Plain Language Summary We find that bright reflections of sunlight (glints) observed by a satellite camera, a million miles away can help with accurately determining location of each image pixel. In addition to previously observed glints from the ocean surface and clouds, we detect overwhelmingly bright glints off high mountains in the Andes, likely caused by calm small lakes.

TI  - Earth Observation-Informed Risk Maps of the Lyme Disease Vector <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> in Central and Eastern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is facilitating the geographic range expansion of populations of the tick vector of Lyme disease Ixodes scapularis in Canada. Here, we characterize and map the spatio-temporal variability of environments suitable for I. scapularis using Earth observation (EO) data. A simple algorithm for I. scapularis occurrence (cumulative degree-days and forest: CSDF) was developed by combining cumulative annual surface degree-days above 0 degrees C and forest cover. To map the environmental risk of I. scapularis (risk of I. scapularis: RIS) in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015, CSDF was adjusted using data from an I. scapularis population model. CSDF was validated using cumulative annual degree days >0 degrees C (CADD) from meteorological stations, and CSDF was strongly associated with CADD (n = 52, R-2 > 0.86, p < 0.001). Data on field surveillance for I. scapularis ticks (2008 to 2018) were used to validate the risk maps. The presence of I. scapularis ticks was significantly associated with CSDF, and at a limit of 2800, sensitivity approached 100%. RIS increased over the study period, with the highest values in 2012 and the lowest in 2000. The RIS was on average higher in Ontario and Quebec compared to other provinces, and it was higher in the southern parts of the provinces. The proportion of the populated areas with a positive RIS increased on average in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015. Predicted I. scapularis occurrence identifies areas with a more probable risk of tick bites, Lyme disease, and other I. scapularis-borne diseases, which can help guide targeted surveillance, prevention, and control interventions.

With improvement in satellite technology and image processing techniques, there is a potential for integrating data from sensors with different spectral characteristics and temporal resolutions to effectively map crop types and land cover. In our Malawi study area, it is common that there are no cloud-free images available for the entire crop growth season. The goal of this experiment is to produce detailed crop type and land cover maps in agricultural landscapes using the Sentinel-1 (S-1) radar data, Sentinel-2 (S-2) optical data, S-2 and PlanetScope data fusion, and S-1 C-2 matrix and S-1 H/alpha polarimetric decomposition. We evaluated the ability to combine these data to map crop types and land cover in two smallholder farming locations. The random forest algorithm, trained with crop and land cover type data collected in the field, complemented with samples digitized from Google Earth Pro and DigitalGlobe, was used for the classification experiments. The results show that the S-2 and PlanetScope fused image + S-1 covariance (C-2) matrix + H/alpha polarimetric decomposition (an entropy-based decomposition method) fusion outperformed all other image combinations, producing higher overall accuracies (OAs) (>85%) and Kappa coefficients (>0.80). These OAs represent a 13.53% and 11.7% improvement on the Sentinel-2-only (OAs < 80%) experiment for Thimalala and Edundu, respectively. The experiment also provided accurate insights into the distribution of crop and land cover types in the area. The findings suggest that in cloud-dense and resource-poor locations, fusing high temporal resolution radar data with available optical data presents an opportunity for operational mapping of crop types and land cover to support food security and environmental management decision-making.

TI  - Comparison between Dense L-Band and C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Time Series for Crop Area Mapping over a NISAR Calibration-Validation Site
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop area mapping is important for tracking agricultural production and supporting food security. Spaceborne approaches using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) now allow for mapping crop area at moderate spatial and temporal resolutions. Multi-frequency SAR data is highly useful for crop monitoring because backscatter response from vegetation canopies is wavelength dependent. This study evaluates the utility of C-band Sentinel-1B (Sentinel-1) and L-band ALOS-2 (PALSAR) data, collected during the 2019 growing season, for generating accurate active crop extent (crop vs. non-crop) classifications over an agricultural region in western Canada. Evaluations were performed against the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada satellite-based Annual Cropland Inventory (ACI), an open data product that maps land cover across the extent of Canada's agricultural land. Classifications were performed using the temporal coefficient of variation (CV) approach, where an optimal crop/non-crop delineating CV threshold (CVthr) is selected according to Youden's J-statistic. Results show that crop area mapping agreed better with the ACI when using Sentinel-1 data (83.5%) compared to PALSAR (73.2%). Analysis of performance by crop reveals that PALSAR's poorer performance can be attributed to soybean, urban, grassland, and pasture ACI classes. This study also compared CV values to in situ wet biomass data for canola and soybeans, showing that crops with lower biomass (soybean) had correspondingly lower CV values.

TI  - Integrating mooring and ship-based data for improved validation of OLCI chlorophyll-<i>a</i> products in the Baltic Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A Water Quality Monitor (WQM) equipped with a range of oceanographic sensors was deployed from April 2017 to October 2017 in the North Western (NW) Baltic Sea. We assessed here if the data from a moored chlorophyll-a fluorometer can be used to improve satellite validation in coastal waters. Calibrated mooring data and ship-based chlorophyll-a concentrations from 2017 and 2018 were matched with OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) data to validate the C2RCC (Case-2 Regional Coast Colour) processor, a locally-adapted version of C2RCC (LA-C2RCC), as well as the POLYMER processor. Using additional mooring data resulted in a substantial increase in paired observations compared to using ship-based data alone (C2RCC; N = 41-63, LA-C2RCC; N = 37-59, POLYMER; N = 108-166). However, the addition of mooring data only reduced the error and bias of the LA-C2RCC (MNB: from 24 % to 22 %, RMSE: from 60 % to 57 %, APD: both 47 %). In contrast, the statistical errors increased with the addition of mooring data both for C2RCC (MNB: -26 % to -33 %, RMSE: 50 %-51 %, APD 84 %-96 %) and for POLYMER (MNB: 26 %-36 %, RMSE: 79 % to 79 %, APD 64 %-64 %). The results indicate that the locally-adapted version of the C2RCC should be used for the area of investigation. These results are most likely also related to the effect of the System Vicarious Calibration (SVC). As opposed to C2RCC, the locally-adapted version had not been vicariously calibrated. The results indicate that SVC is not beneficial for Baltic Sea data and that more work needs to be done to improve SVC for Baltic Sea waters or for other waters with high CDOM absorption. In order to improve the validation capabilities of moored fluorometers in general, they should be strategically placed in waters with representative ranges of chl-a concentrations for the area of research in question.

M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating and understanding bio-environmental relationships at different spatial and temporal scales is important for accurately assessing marine productivity in relation to oceanographic conditions in changing Arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we compare four different bio-environmental datasets, in order to shed new light on the complex marine ecosystem of the Baffin Bay-Labrador Sea region, as well as the historical links between environmental changes and the ecosystem. Satellite dataset was used to describe the regional distribution of chlorophyll a, sea ice concentration (SIC), sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). Chlorophyll a data were also analysed together with shrimp assessment dataset to examine the relationship between marine pelagic productivity and bottom feeders off the Greenland coast. A microfossil dataset (diatom valves) from 57 surface sediment stations was used to describe diatom concentration and diversity across the study region. It was also used in combination with satellite data from the same sites to analyse species-environment relationships and develop a diatom-based transfer function for reconstructing past changes in SIC, SST and SSS. Subsequently, we applied the diatom transfer function on three short sediment cores from off SW and W Greenland spanning the last few centuries. A monitoring dataset of sea ice observations and instrumental measurements of water temperature and salinity, together with atmospheric data (air temperature and wind conditions) from Greenland, were used to develop a more complete picture of 20th and 21st century changes in ocean-climate conditions. Our comparative analyses show clear spatial distribution patterns of marine phytoplankton and identify key ecological groups linked to oceanic conditions. In addition, we find a significant correlation between the different trophic levels, culminating in a 'productivity boom' in 2001 CE. On a longer temporal scale, the transfer function reconstructions reveal a good correlation with the satellite, monitoring and observational trends, as well as a consistent, long-term decrease in sea ice linked to ocean-climate variability.

TI  - Heterogeneity of debris captured by cerebral embolic protection filters during TAVI
T2  - EUROINTERVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the total amount, size and heterogeneity of debris captured among different transcatheter valve types and while repositioning.Methods and results: A total of 328 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with the SENTINEL cerebral embolic protection (CEP) at our centre were eligible. Histopathological and semiquantitative analysis of captured debris was performed and data were entered into our prospective database. TAVI was performed with either the Evolut R/PRO (N=123), SAPIEN 3 (N=113) or Lotus valve (N=92). Capture of debris occurred in 98% of patients. Lotus TAVI resulted in more frequent foreign body material (62% vs 40% vs 47%, p=0.006), endothelium (49% vs 30% vs 16%, p<0.0005), calcified material (33% vs 12% vs 24%, p=0.001) and myocardial tissue (19% vs 11% vs 2%, p<0.0005) compared to SAPIEN 3 or Evolut R/PRO. Native (functional) bicuspid valves (OR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.20-7.03, p=0.02) and Lotus (OR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.14-5.24, p=0.02) were associated with the highest risk for dislodging particles >= 1,000 um. Valve repositioning was independently associated with larger amounts of debris (OR 2.96, 95% CI: 1.42-6.16, p=0.004).Conclusions: All THV platforms had similar amounts of captured debris. THV repositioning seemed to be associated with a higher risk for dislodging greater amounts of debris to the brain.

TI  - Rapid freshwater discharge on the coastal ocean as a mean of long distance spreading of an unprecedented toxic cyanobacteria bloom
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial toxic blooms are a worldwide problem. The Rio de la Plata (RdlP) basin makes up about one fourth of South America areal surface, second only to the Amazonian. Intensive agro-industrial land use and the construction of dams have led to generalized eutrophication of main tributaries and increased the intensity and duration of cyanobacteria blooms. Here we analyse the evolution of an exceptional bloom at the low RdlP basin and Atlantic coast during the summer of 2019. A large array of biological, genetic, meteorological, oceanographic and satellite data is combined to discuss the driving mechanisms. The bloom covered the whole stripe of the RdlP estuary and the Uruguayan Atlantic coasts (around 500 km) for approximately 4 months. It was caused by the Microcystis aeruginosa complex (MAC), which produces hepatotoxins (microcystin). Extreme precipitation in the upstream regions of Uruguay and Negro rivers' basins caused high water flows and discharges. The evolution of meteorological and oceanographic conditions as well as the similarity of organisms' traits in the affected area suggest that the bloom originated in eutrophic reservoirs at the lower RdlP basin, Salto Grande in the Uruguay river, and Negro river reservoirs. High temperatures and weak Eastern winds prompted the rapid dispersion of the bloom over the freshwater plume along the RdlP northern and Atlantic coasts. The long-distance rapid drift allowed active MAC organisms to inoculate freshwater bodies from the Atlantic basin, impacting environments relevant for biodiversity conservation. Climate projections for the RdlP basin suggest an increase in precipitation and river water flux, which, in conjunction with agriculture intensification and dams' construction, might turn this extraordinary event into an ordinary situation.

TI  - Study of internal solitary wave packets in the northeastern South China Sea based on seismic oceanography and remote sensing
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) have been observed and reported around the Dongsha Atoll in the northeastern South China Sea. The propagation and evolution processes of ISWs in this area remain debated. Here, a marine seismic exploration line carried out near the Dongsha Atoll in July 2009 is reprocessed by an advanced method of seismic oceanography. After seismic data processing, an internal solitary wave packet containing 8 well-shaped first-mode depression ISWs is identified in the water below depth 50 m. On the same day of seismic exploration, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image captured the same ISW packet. After processing of this MODIS image, the first 5 of the ISWs packet were clearly identified. Two methods are used to calculate ISWs phase speeds. According to the first method, the ISWs apparent phase speeds are estimated by pre-stack migration profiles using the Common Offset Gather (COG) , then the apparent phase speeds are adjusted in terms of ISWs propagation direction on the MODIS image. While the second method can directly obtain the first 5 ISWs phase speeds by locations and times revealed by seismic data and the MODIS image. The results of these two methods consistent well accordingly. Three waveform characteristic parameters, i. e. amplitude, apparent full width of the trough at half amplitude and apparent wave length, can be directly revealed by the seismic oceanography image. The internal solitary wave packet maximum amplitude is 117 m, maximum apparent full width of the trough at half amplitude is 1020 m, and maximum apparent wave interval is 4100 m. Because of the Doppler-like effect and the angle between ISWs propagation and direction of ship travel, horizontal information provided by the MODIS image and phase speeds calculated by the second method should be considered to correct the last two parameters. The ratio of the first ISW wave maximum full width of the trough at half amplitude to the full width half maximum (estimated by remote sensing) is 1. 75, which is close to the theoretical ratio 1. 763; the true wave intervals are consistent with the wave intervals estimated by the MODIS image. Finally, MODIS images and tide data gathered before and after seismic observation permit to infer the ISW pocket is Type-b. The results show that the combination of seismic oceanography and remote sensing can help better characterize ISWs.

M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for retrieving the fraction of the sea surface covered by whitecaps (W) from Landsat-8 satellite optical reflectance measurements in the near-infrared channel is described. The distribution of W derived from approximately 100 Landsat-8 scenes was compared with quasi-synchronous scatterometer measurements of wind speed (u10), which allowed us to obtain the W(u10) relation for large whitecaps from high-resolution satellite optical measurements. Further, we demonstrate the impact of various phenomena, includinginternal waves, river plumes, bottom topography, atmospheric stability, ocean fronts, and mesoscale currents on whitecap coverage and its spatial variation in different areas of the ocean. These data are analysed using theoretical models, suggesting that whitecap coverage is a proxy of wave energy dissipation and reflects disturbances in the wind-wave energy balance caused by wave-current interactions and variable wind forcing due to changes in atmospheric stratification over ocean temperature fronts and the movement of wind-waves by surface currents relative to the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB  - The primary objectives of this study are to identify glacier cover, detect changes of glacier from 1978 to 2017 in Bhutan, and identification of vulnerable zone based on glacier changes. Landsat images and remote sensing (RS) techniques, Maximum Likelihood Classification approach of Supervised Learning of image processing has been utilized to detect and monitor the glacier cover changes of Bhutan over the years (1978-2017). The study results revealed that total area of the glacier changes in 1978 and 2017 has decreased by 2.54%. Most of the glacier zones are found in the northern part of the country, basically near the Greater Himalayan Mountain Range. Gasa, Bamthung and Lhuentse districts of Bhutan were found to have more glacier changes area than the other districts, that the areas experienced more changes of glacier cover over 40 years. Where more changes in the glacier are detected, the area should be more vulnerable in terms of both landslide, unreliability in growing useful land covers and Glacier Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFS) in downstream area.

AB  - To minimize the invasiveness and improve the patient's quality of life, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) containing superparamagnetic iron oxide is performed on breast cancer patients. Identifying the first SLN by quantification of the amount of MNPs can help to investigate the cancer metastasis. We developed the device for performing iron quantification during surgery. The compact desktop-size device can be easily introduced into operation rooms, and simple system of the device enables identification of the first SLN. We investigated the optimum nonlinear magnetic responses that are attributed to magnetic relaxations under moderate small ac and de magnetic fields (similar to 1 mT) and found that ac magnetic fields with <5 kHz are effective in the detection of MNPs. In addition, our clinical trials revealed more iron (40 mu g) in the first lymph node than in the second lymph node (10 mu g), clearly indicating intraoperative quantification in the first node.

TI  - Meteorological controls on daily variations of nighttime surface urban heat islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most previous studies of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have focused solely on their controlling factors on a seasonal/annual timescale, while the controls on daily variations are largely unknown. By extracting the daily variations of nighttime SUHI features using the Gaussian model and investigating their correlations with various explanatory factors, we have attempted to determine the controls on SUHIs on a daily-basis over Chinese cities. Specific controls of weather conditions on the intensity, extent, shape, and centroid of the SUHIs were identified. Our results show that: (1) SUHI intensity (SUHII) was considerably more sensitive to weather conditions than the SUHI footprint (i.e., extent, shape, and centroid). (2) Meteorological variables including relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, and aerosol optical depth, had the greatest impact on SUHI intensity; whereas factors related to temperature fluctuations (day-to-day fluctuations of surface and air temperature) were the main factors influencing SUHI extent, shape, and the direction in which SUHI centroid varies. (3) Antecedent precipitation substantially impacted the subsequent SUHIs under clear-skies, changing both the SUHI itself and its sensitivity to other factors. Typically, the clear-sky SUHIs directly following rainfall showed a higher dependence on the relative humidity, soil moisture and aerosol, but were less affected by wind. (4) The meteorological contributions to the daily nighttime SUHIIs varied among Chinese cities with different bioclimatic conditions. In general, they were stronger in temperate zones than in subtropical zones. Our results provide an improved understanding of the controls on SUHIs on a daily timescale, as well as a foundation for predicting daily SUHIs based on the influencing meteorological variables.

TI  - The panpulmonate limpet <i>Siphonaria lessonii</i> Blainville, 1827 as a sentinel of contamination in coastal areas of Argentina
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although some studies have evaluated the use of Siphonaria lessonii as a bioindicator of pollution, no study has identified the effects of human activities on the digestive gland, which is the main centre of detoxification of xenobiotics and a target organ in contamination studies. Thus, the present work aims to evaluate the use of this species as a suitable sentinel of contamination by analysing the digestive gland and shell alterations. The study was carried out in three populations exposed to different degrees of anthropogenic impact in the coast of Buenos Aires: a reference site (VG), a mid-impacted site (MPL) and a highly-impacted site (MPP). A histological analysis of the digestive gland was performed, as well as an assessment of the geometric morphometry, thickness, density and microstructure of the shell. Our results indicated that the individuals from the impacted sites present several histological alterations in the tubules of the digestive gland. These included hypertrophy and hyperplasia of different cell types (MPP), alterations of the digestive tube morphology (MPL and MPP), the presence of lipofuscin-like substances (MPL) and a high inflammatory response (MPP). In the shells, neither microstructural malformations nor changes in the elemental composition were found. However, shell morphometric variations and a decrease in shell hardness (thickness and density) were observed in the impacted sites. In conclusion, our results indicate that S. lessonii is a well-suited sentinel of contamination since the effects of anthropogenic impact may be reflected in both soft and hard structures. Although further investigations are necessary to identify the relationship between these effects and their potential causing agents, these simple and low-cost methodological approaches could be used to diagnose disturbance in the ecosystem health status where this species inhabits.

M3  - Article
AB  - The main challenge encountered by Mediterranean winegrowers is water management. Indeed, with climate change, drought events are becoming more intense each year, dragging the yield down. Moreover, the quality of the vineyards is affected and the level of alcohol increases. Remote sensing data are a potential solution to measure water status in vineyards. However, important questions are still open such as which spectral, spatial, and temporal scales are adapted to achieve the latter. This study aims at using hyperspectral measurements to investigate the spectral scale adapted to measure their water status. The final objective is to find out whether it would be possible to monitor the vine water status with the spectral bands available in multispectral satellites such as Sentinel-2. Four Mediterranean vine plots with three grape varieties and different water status management systems are considered for the analysis. Results show the main significant domains related to vine water status (Short Wave Infrared, Near Infrared, and Red-Edge) and the best vegetation indices that combine these domains. These results give some promising perspectives to monitor vine water status.

TI  - DSM Generation from Single and Cross-Sensor Multi-View Satellite Images Using the New Agisoft Metashape: The Case Studies of Trento and Matera (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - DSM generation from satellite imagery is a long-lasting issue and it has been addressed in several ways over the years; however, expert and users are continuously searching for simpler but accurate and reliable software solutions. One of the latest ones is provided by the commercial software Agisoft Metashape (since version 1.6), previously known as Photoscan, which joins other already available open-source and commercial software tools. The present work aims to quantify the potential of the new Agisoft Metashape satellite processing module, considering that to the best knowledge of the authors, only two papers have been published, but none considering cross-sensor imagery. Here we investigated two different case studies to evaluate the accuracy of the generated DSMs. The first dataset consists of a triplet of Pleiades images acquired over the area of Trento and the Adige valley (Northern Italy), which is characterized by a great variety in terms of geomorphology, land uses and land covers. The second consists of a triplet composed of a WorldView-3 stereo pair and a GeoEye-1 image, acquired over the city of Matera (Southern Italy), one of the oldest settlements in the world, with the worldwide famous area of Sassi and a very rugged morphology in the surroundings. First, we carried out the accuracy assessment using the RPCs supplied by the satellite companies as part of the image metadata. Then, we refined the RPCs with an original independent terrain technique able to supply a new set of RPCs, using a set of GCPs adequately distributed across the regions of interest. The DSMs were generated both in a stereo and multi-view (triplet) configuration. We assessed the accuracy and completeness of these DSMs through a comparison with proper references, i.e., DSMs obtained through LiDAR technology. The impact of the RPC refinement on the DSM accuracy is high, ranging from 20 to 40% in terms of LE90. After the RPC refinement, we achieved an average overall LE90 <5.0 m (Trento) and <4.0 m (Matera) for the stereo configuration, and <5.5 m (Trento) and <4.5 m (Matera) for the multi-view (triplet) configuration, with an increase of completeness in the range 5-15% with respect to stereo pairs. Finally, we analyzed the impact of land cover on the accuracy of the generated DSMs; results for three classes (urban, agricultural, forest and semi-natural areas) are also supplied.

TI  - Land Cover Effects on Selected Nutrient Compounds in Small Lowland Agricultural Catchments
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of landscape on nutrient dynamics in rivers constitutes an important research issue because of its significance with regard to water and land management. In the current study spatial and temporal variability of N-NO3 and P-PO4 concentrations and their landscape dependence was documented in the Swider River catchment in central Poland. From April 2019 to March 2020, water samples were collected from fourteen streams in the monthly timescale and the concentrations of N-NO3 and P-PO4 were correlated with land cover metrics based on the Corine Land Cover 2018 and Sentinel 2 Global Land Cover datasets. It was documented that agricultural lands and forests have a clear seasonal impact on N-NO3 concentrations, whereas the effect of meadows was weak and its direction was dependent on the dataset. The application of buffer zones metrics increased the correlation performance, whereas Euclidean distance scaling improved correlation mainly for forest datasets. The concentration of P-PO4 was not significantly related with land cover metrics, as their dynamics were driven mainly by hydrological conditions. The obtained results provided a new insight into landscape-water quality relationships in lowland agricultural landscape, with a special focus on evaluating the predictive performance of different land cover metrics and datasets.

TI  - Mapping and Characterization of Phenological Changes over Various Farming Systems in an Arid and Semi-Arid Region Using Multitemporal Moderate Spatial Resolution Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing land use patterns is of great importance in environmental studies and critical for land use management decision making over farming systems in arid and semi-arid regions. Unfortunately, ground data scarcity or inadequacy in many regions can cause large uncertainties in the characterization of phenological changes in arid and semi-arid regions, which can hamper tailored decision making towards best agricultural management practices. Alternatively, state-of-the-art methods for phenological metrics' extraction and long time-series analysis techniques of multispectral remote sensing imagery provide a viable solution. In this context, this study aims to characterize the changes over farming systems through trend analysis. To this end, four farming systems (fallow, rainfed, irrigated annual, and irrigated perennial) in arid areas of Morocco were studied based on four phenological metrics (PhM) (i.e., great integral, start, end, and length of the season). These were derived from large Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series using both a machine learning algorithm and a pixel-based change analysis method. Results showed that during the last twenty-year period (i.e., 2000-2019), a significant dynamism of the plant cover was linked to the behavior of farmers who tend to cultivate intensively and to invest in high-income crops. More specifically, a relevant variability in fallow and rainfed areas, closely linked to the weather conditions, was found. In addition, significant lag trends of the start (-6 days) and end (+3 days) were found, which indicate that the length of the season was related to the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. This study has also highlighted the potential of multitemporal moderate spatial resolution data to accurately monitor agriculture and better manage land resources. In the meantime, for operationally implementing the use of such work in the field, we believe that it is essential consider the perceptions, opinions, and mutual benefits of farmers and stakeholders to improve strategies and synergies whilst ensuring food, welfare, and sustainability.

TI  - Generation of Modern Satellite Data from Galileo Sunspot Drawings in 1612 by Deep Learning
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical sunspot drawings are very important resources for understanding past solar activity. We generate solar magnetograms and EUV images from Galileo sunspot drawings using a deep learning model based on conditional generative adversarial networks. We train the model using pairs of sunspot drawings from the Mount Wilson Observatory and their corresponding magnetograms (or UV/EUV images) from 2011 to 2015 except for every June and December by the Solar Dynamic Observatory satellite. We evaluate the model by comparing pairs of actual magnetograms (or UV/EUV images) and the corresponding AI-generated ones in June and December. Our results show that bipolar structures of the AI-generated magnetograms are consistent with those of the original ones and their unsigned magnetic fluxes (or intensities) are consistent with those of the original ones. Applying this model to the Galileo sunspot drawings in 1612, we generate Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager-like magnetograms and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly-like EUV images of the sunspots. We hope that the EUV intensities can be used for estimating solar EUV irradiance at long-term historical times.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Algorithms for Global Dust Aerosol Detection from Satellite Images: Inter-Comparisons and Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying dust aerosols from passive satellite images is of great interest for many applications. In this study, we developed five different machine-learning (ML) based algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify dust aerosols in the daytime satellite images from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) under cloud-free conditions on a global scale. In order to train the ML algorithms, we collocated the state-of-the-art dust detection product from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) with the VIIRS observations along the CALIOP track. The 16 VIIRS M-band observations with the center wavelength ranging from deep blue to thermal infrared, together with solar-viewing geometries and pixel time and locations, are used as the predictor variables. Four different sets of training input data are constructed based on different combinations of VIIRS pixel and predictor variables. The validation and comparison results based on the collocated CALIOP data indicate that the FFNN method based on all available predictor variables is the best performing one among all methods. It has an averaged dust detection accuracy of about 81%, 89%, and 85% over land, ocean and whole globe, respectively, compared with collocated CALIOP. When applied to off-track VIIRS pixels, the FFNN method retrieves geographical distributions of dust that are in good agreement with on-track results as well as CALIOP statistics. For further evaluation, we compared our results based on the ML algorithms to NOAA's Aerosol Detection Product (ADP), which is a product that classifies dust, smoke, and ash using physical-based methods. The comparison reveals both similarity and differences. Overall, this study demonstrates the great potential of ML methods for dust detection and proves that these methods can be trained on the CALIOP track and then applied to the whole granule of VIIRS granule.

TI  - Utility of Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration Products to Assess an Improved Model Structure
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a certain level of predictive uncertainty when hydrologic models are applied for operational purposes. Whether structural improvements address uncertainty has not well been evaluated due to the lack of observational data. This study investigated the utility of remotely sensed evapotranspiration (RS-ET) products to quantitatively represent improvements in model predictions owing to structural improvements. Two versions of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), representative of original and improved versions, were calibrated against streamflow and RS-ET. The latter version contains a new soil moisture module, referred to as RSWAT. We compared outputs from these two versions with the best performance metrics (Kling-Gupta Efficiency [KGE], Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency [NSE] and Percent-bias [P-bias]). Comparisons were conducted at two spatial scales by partitioning the RS-ET into two scales, while streamflow comparisons were only conducted at one scale. At the watershed level, SWAT and RSWAT produced similar metrics for daily streamflow (NSE of 0.29 and 0.37, P-bias of 1.7 and 15.9, and KGE of 0.47 and 0.49, respectively) and ET (KGE of 0.48 and 0.52, respectively). At the subwatershed level, the KGE of RSWAT (0.53) for daily ET was greater than that of SWAT (0.47). These findings demonstrated that RS-ET has the potential to increase prediction accuracy from model structural improvements and highlighted the utility of remotely sensed data in hydrologic modeling.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Accuracy of Shallow Snow Depth Measured Using UAV-Based Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Factors influencing the accuracy of UAV-photogrammetry-based snow depth distribution maps were investigated. First, UAV-based surveys were performed on the 0.04 km(2) snow-covered study site in South Korea for 37 times over the period of 13 days under 16 prescribed conditions composed of various photographing times, flight altitudes, and photograph overlap ratios. Then, multi-temporal Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the study area covered with shallow snow were obtained using digital photogrammetric techniques. Next, the multi-temporal snow depth distribution maps were created by subtracting the snow-free DSM from the multi-temporal DSMs of the study area. Then, snow depth in these UAV-Photogrammetry-based snow maps were compared to the in situ measurements at 21 locations. The accuracy of each of the multi-temporal snow maps were quantified in terms of bias (median of residuals, Q Delta D) and precision (the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation, NMAD). Lastly, various factors influencing these performance metrics were investigated. The results are as follows: (1) the Q Delta D and NMAD of the eight surveys performed at the optimal condition (50 m flight altitude and 80% overlap ratio) ranged from -2.30 cm to 5.90 cm and from 1.78 cm to 4.89 cm, respectively. The best survey case had -2.30 cm of Q Delta D and 1.78 cm of NMAD; (2) Lower UAV flight altitude and greater photograph overlap lower the NMAD and Q Delta D; (3) Greater number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) lowers the NMAD and Q Delta D; (4) Spatial configuration and accuracy of GCP coordinates influenced the accuracy of the snow depth distribution map; (5) Greater number of tie-points leads to higher accuracy; (6) Smooth fresh snow cover did not provide many tie-points, either resulting in a significant error or making the entire photogrammetry process impossible.

TI  - Autonomous Repeat Image Feature Tracking (autoRIFT) and Its Application for Tracking Ice Displacement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we build on past efforts with regard to the implementation of an efficient feature tracking algorithm for the mass processing of satellite images. This generic open-source feature tracking routine can be applied to any type of imagery to measure sub-pixel displacements between images. The routine consists of a feature tracking module (autoRIFT) that enhances computational efficiency and a geocoding module (Geogrid) that mitigates problems found in existing geocoding algorithms. When applied to satellite imagery, autoRIFT can run on a grid in the native image coordinates (such as radar or map) and, when used in conjunction with the Geogrid module, on a user-defined grid in geographic Cartesian coordinates such as Universal Transverse Mercator or Polar Stereographic. To validate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach, we demonstrate its use for tracking ice motion by using ESA's Sentinel-1A/B radar data (seven pairs) and NASA's Landsat-8 optical data (seven pairs) collected over Greenland's Jakobshavn Isbr AE glacier in 2017. Feature-tracked velocity errors are characterized over stable surfaces, where the best Sentinel-1A/B pair with a 6 day separation has errors in X/Y of 12 m/year or 39 m/year, compared to 22 m/year or 31 m/year for Landsat-8 with a 16-day separation. Different error sources for radar and optical image pairs are investigated, where the seasonal variation and the error dependence on the temporal baseline are analyzed. Estimated velocities were compared with reference velocities derived from DLR's TanDEM-X SAR/InSAR data over the fast-moving glacier outlet, where Sentinel-1 results agree within 4% compared to 3-7% for Landsat-8. A comprehensive apples-to-apples comparison is made with regard to runtime and accuracy between multiple implementations of the proposed routine and the widely-used "dense ampcor" program from NASA/JPL's ISCE software. autoRIFT is shown to provide two orders of magnitude of runtime improvement with a 20% improvement in accuracy.

TI  - Geometric Positioning Accuracy Evaluation of Domestic High-Resolution Satellite Images Based on Unified Verification Field Method
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - There are differences in the geometric positioning accuracy of the domestic mainstream optical satellites with 2 m spatial resolution in different areas. For this reason, based on a rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) model and block adjustment, we proposed a method to test the geometric positioning accuracy of multiple satellites through the same control benchmark. Specifically, taking the Guyuan flat area in Hebei Province as the control area, we evaluated and tested the geometric positioning accuracy of high-resolution single-scene and stereo images from the GF1 series satellites (GF1, GF1-B, GF1-C, and GF1-D), the Ziyuan-3 series satellites (ZY3-1 and ZY3-2), and the Tianhui-1 satellite (TH-1). The research results are shown as follows: (1) Without considering the ground control points, the plane errors of single-scene images from the GF1 series satellites and TH-1 are mostly better than 4.2 m and about 6.36 m, respectively, while the accuracy of stereo images from ZY3-1 is high, with the plane and elevation errors being respectively 11.29 m and 3.5 m or so. (2) Considering the ground control points, all the plane errors of single-scene images from the GF1 series satellites are better than 13.3 m, and those from ZY3-1, ZY3-2, and TH-1 are better than 5.46 m, while for the stereo images of ZY3-1 and ZY3-2, the plane error is about 4.01 m and 4.29 m, and the elevation error is about 1.71 m and 1.61 m, respectively. It follows that the proposed method is reasonable and feasible to evaluate the geometric positioning accuracy of several high-resolution domestic optical satellites.

TI  - Hydrological and Kinematic Precursors of the 2017 Calving Event at the Petermann Glacier in Greenland Observed from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Both a decrease of sea ice and an increase of surface meltwater, which may induce ice-flow speedup and frontal collapse, have a significant impact on the stability of the floating ice shelf in Greenland. However, detailed dynamic precursors and drivers prior to a fast-calving process remain unclear due to sparse remote sensing observations. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation on hydrological and kinematic precursors before the calving event on 26 July 2017 of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland, by jointly using remote sensing observations at high-temporal resolution and an ice-flow model. Time series of ice-flow velocity fields during July 2017 were retrieved with Sentinel-2 observations with a sub-weekly sampling interval. The ice-flow speed quickly reached 30 m/d on 26 July (the day before the calving), which is roughly 10 times quicker than the mean glacier velocity. Additionally, a significant decrease in the radar backscatter coefficient of Sentinel-1 images suggests a rapid transformation from landfast sea ice into open water, associated with a decrease in sea ice extent. Additionally, the area of melt ponds on the floating ice tongue began to increase in mid-May, quickly reached a peak at the end of June and lasted for nearly one month until the calving occurred. We used the ice sheet system model to model the spatial-temporal damage and stress on the floating ice, thereby finding an abnormal stress distribution in a cracked region. It is inferred that this calving event may relate to a weakening of the sea ice, shearing of the tributary glacier, and meltwater infiltrating crevasses.

T2  - China Environmental Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Taken gridded spatial distribution data of bird and mammal species of Xinjiang in 2010 as primary data source, combined with multi-sources of remote sensing data production, such as land use, vegetation, climate, and topographic data, determinants which affected birds and mammal species richness in Xinjiang have been recognized and their spatial variation was discussed. Importance of each determinant which affected the number of bird and mammal species have been assessed and ranked using Random Forest approach. Then relationship models between species richness and determinants were built through exploratory regression analysis. Three main habitats of grassland, woodland and farmland were taken out and the difference of effect factors to birds and mammals species richness between them were compared and analyzed. The results show that among all the determinants, vegetation growing status and their energy conversion capability were the most two important factors for bird richness. As for grassland habitat, the importance of altitude was 38.38%, which was highest value. Climate type in farmland had significant impacts on bird diversity, among which the importance of annual average temperature reaches 32.98%. Climate and altitude were very important considerations for mammal when choosing a habitat, accountied for more than 60% of the importance, and the highest was 76.85%. In cultivated land, climatic factors were more important than vegetation growth for mammalian habitat. Optimal models for birds and mammals under different types of habitats were varied and their variables were different accordingly. Model performance of farmland for birds and forest for mammals were the best two, which could explain the relationship between determinants and species richness about 69.9% and 68.9%, respectively. The results of both random forest and exploratory regression analysis shown that altitude, average annual temperature and precipitation were the most three important determinants to mammal species richness.

TI  - Forest Changes by Precipitation Zones in Northern China after the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China launched the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program (TNSFP) in 1978 in northern China to combat desertification and dust storms, but it is still controversial in ecologically fragile arid and semi-arid areas, which is partly due to the uncertainties of monitoring of the spatial-temporal changes of forest distribution. In this study, we aim to provide an overall retrospect of the forest changes (i.e., forest gain and forest loss) in northern China during 2007-2017, and to analyze the forest changes in different precipitation zones. We first generated annual forest maps at 30 m spatial resolution during 2007-2017 in northern China through integrating Landsat and PALSAR/PALSAR-2 data. We found the PALSAR/Landsat-based forest maps outperform other four existing products (i.e., JAXA F/NF, FROM-GLC, GlobeLand30, and NLCD-China) from either PALSAR or Landsat data, with a higher overall accuracy 96% +/- 1%. The spatial-temporal analyses of forests showed a substantial forest expansion from 316,898 +/- 34,537 km(2) in 2007 to 384,568 +/- 35,855 km(2) in 2017 in the central and eastern areas. We found a higher forest loss rate (i.e., 35%) in the precipitation zones with the annual mean precipitation less than 400 mm (i.e., the arid and semi-arid areas) comparing to that (i.e., 25%) in the zones with more than 400 mm (i.e., the humid areas), which suggests the lower surviving rate in the drylands. This study provides satellite-based evidence for the forest changes in different precipitation zones, and suggests that the likely impacts of precipitation on afforestation effectiveness should be considered in future implementation of ecological restoration projects like TNSFP.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Images to Map the <i>Populus euphratica</i> Distribution Based on the Spectral Difference Acquired at the Key Phenological Stage
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Populus euphratica is an important tree species in desert ecosystems. The protection and restoration of natural Populus euphratica forests requires accurate positioning information. The use of Sentinel-2 images to map the Populus euphratica distribution at a large scale faces challenges associated with discriminating between Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis. To address this problem, this study selected the Daliyabuyi Oasis in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert as the study site and sought to distinguish Populus euphratica from Tamarix chinensis. First, we determined the peak spectral difference period (optimal time window) between Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis within monthly Sentinel-2 time-series images. Then, an appropriate vegetation index was selected to represent the spectral difference between Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis within the key phenological stage. Finally, the maximum entropy method was used to automatically determine the threshold to map the Populus euphratica distribution. The results indicated that the period from 22 April to 1 May was the optimal time window for mapping the Populus euphratica distribution in the Daliyabuyi Oasis. The combination of the inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI) and the maximum entropy method can effectively distinguish Populus euphratica from Tamarix chinensis. The user's accuracy of the Populus euphratica distribution extraction from single-data Sentinel-2 images acquired within the optimal time window was 0.83, the producer's accuracy was 0.72, and the F1-score was 0.77. This study verified the feasibility of mapping Populus euphratica distribution based on Sentinel-2 images, and analyzed the validity of exploiting spectral differences within the key phenological stage from a single-data image to distinguish between the two species. The results can be used to extract the distribution of Populus euphratica and serve as an auxiliary variable for other plant classification methods, providing a reference for the extraction and classification of desert plants.

TI  - Temperature-Based and Radiance-Based Validation of the Collection 6 MYD11 and MYD21 Land Surface Temperature Products Over Barren Surfaces in Northwestern China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, two collection 6 (C6) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level-2 land surface temperature (LST) products (MYD11L2 and MYD21L2) from the Aqua satellite were evaluated using temperature-based (<italic>T-</italic>based) and radiance-based (<italic>R</italic>-based) validation methods over barren surfaces in Northwestern China. The ground measurements collected at four barren surface sites from June 2012 to September 2018 during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment were used to perform the <italic>T-</italic>based evaluation. Ten sand dune sites were selected in six large deserts in Northwestern China to carry out an <italic>R</italic>-based validation from 2012 to 2018. The <italic>T-</italic>based validation results indicate that the C6 MYD21 LST product has a better accuracy than the C6 MYD11 product during both daytime and nighttime. The LST is underestimated by the C6 MYD11 products at the four <italic>T-</italic>based sites during the daytime, with a mean bias of 2.82 K and a mean RMSE of 3.82 K, whereas the MYD21 LST product has a mean bias and RMSE of 0.51 and 2.53 K, respectively. The LST is also underestimated at night by the C6 MYD11 products at the four <italic>T-</italic>based sites, with a mean bias of 1.40 K and a mean RMSE of 1.72 K, whereas the MYD21 LST product has a mean bias and RMSE of 0.23 and 1.01 K, respectively. For the <italic>R</italic>-based validation, the MYD11 results are associated with large negative biases during both daytime and nighttime at three sand dune sites and biases within 1 K at the other seven sites, whereas the MYD21 results are more consistent at all ten sand dune sites, with a mean bias of 0.45 and 0.70 K for daytime and nighttime, respectively. The emissivities for these two products in MODIS bands 31 and 32 were compared with each other and then compared with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) emissivity and laboratory emissivity. The results indicate that the emissivities in MODIS bands 31 and 32 of MYD11 at the four <italic>T-</italic>based and three of the <italic>R</italic>-based validation sites are overestimated and result in LST underestimation, whereas the emissivities of MYD21 are more consistent with the laboratory emissivity. Besides, an experiment was carried out to demonstrate that the physically retrieved dynamic emissivity of the MYD21 product can be utilized to improve the accuracy of the split-window (SW) algorithm for barren surfaces, making it a valuable data source for retrieving LST from different remote sensing data.

TI  - Using a landscape ecological perspective to analyze regime shifts in social-ecological systems: a case study on grassland degradation of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Landscape ecology thinking and social-ecological system (SES) thinking investigate human-environment relationships from the perspective of 'space' and 'system', respectively. To date, empirical landscape ecology studies attempting to understand SES complexities are rare.Objectives Using the Tibetan pastoral landscape as an empirical example, we conceptualize the black-soil formation as SES regime shifts. We seek to illustrate the spatial patterns of black-soil formation in the Tibetan SES, and to reveal their underlying ecological processes.Methods We conducted interdisciplinary research in a Tibetan pastoral village. We obtained quantitative data on historical land-use intensity (LUI) and the associated management narratives. Landsat-based NDVI time series were used to derive a grassland productivity proxy and to reconstruct the process leading to the up-scaling of the regime shift of degradation.Results Important SES features, such as LUI, productivity and degradation risk are heterogeneously distributed in space. Land-use intensification at farm-scales in the 1990s increased landscape-scale degradation risks. Eventually the regime shift of degradation scaled up from the plot level to the landscape level in the 2010s. The time lag was related to the gradual invasion of a native burrowing animal, the plateau pika, which inhabits low-vegetation height pastures.Conclusions Our study shows that landscape ecology thinking provides an important spatial perspective to understanding SES complexities. The finding that unfavorable SES regime shifts are strongly linked across spatial scales implies that an 'entry point' into an adaptive management circle should be initiated when local-scale regime shifts are perceived and interpreted as early warning signals.

TI  - A novel surface water index using local background information for long term and large-scale Landsat images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water plays a vital role in natural environment and human development. The research of water extraction method using remote sensing image is a hot topic, which has been widely developed in water index, classification, subpixel, and other aspects. Compared with other methods, a water-index based method has the advantages of fast speed and convenience. The characteristics of surface water, such as wide coverage and instability, make the water index stand out in monitoring large area of surface water. However, land surface in water environment is complex, and the main factors that reduce water extraction accuracy are also different, such as shadow in urban areas and water leakage in unshaded areas. The current index is bound to weaken the information in the water body when suppressing shadows, and vice versa. To address these issues, contrast difference water index (CDWI) and shadow difference water index (SDWI) are proposed in this paper by improving the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). CDWI is used to enhance water information, which is suitable for areas without building shadows. SDWI is used to eliminate the shadow of buildings, which is suitable for urban areas. Moreover, background difference water index (BDWI) was proposed by combining the advantages of CDWI and SDWI through a background regularizer B, which is used to extract surface water under complex background. The regularizer B represents the similarity between local background features of the image and the reference urban area, which is used to locally weight SDWI and CDWI, so that BDWI can automatically enhance the water body in the shadowless area and eliminate the shadow of buildings. The water extraction results of BDWI, MNDWI, the tasseled cap wetness index (TCW), the automatic water extraction index (AWEInsh, AWEIsh), and the water index 2015 (WI2015) were used for comparison. Other methods tend to perform well only in built-up areas or non-built-up areas, while the BDWI can extract surface water under various backgrounds with high accuracy and stability. The overall accuracy produced by the BDWI was 91.58-97.57%, CDWI was 84.85-97.09%, SDWI was 81.63-94.40%, MNDWI was 80.19-95.64%, TCW was 82.33-95.98%, AWEIsh was 87.50-96.37%, AWEInsh was 80.59-98.78%, and WI2015 was 78.24-98.38%. Combining water index with image local information is helpful to improve the accuracy of water extraction in large and complex environment. Finally, surface water in Jiangsu Province, China was extracted through BDWI and the changes in 1985, 2000, and 2015 were analyzed.

TI  - Rising surface ozone in China from 2013 to 2017: A response to the recent atmospheric warming or pollutant controls?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the enactment of Air Pollution Action Plan in 2013, the air quality improved in most Chinese cities, except that surface ozone (O-3) increased markedly. Some recent studies have examined this issue and presented controversial opinions, but only focus on summertime ozone increase. This study extends a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on China's ozone changes from 2013 to 2017 out of the summer season, combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. The annual trends of air pollutants, e.g., increase in 95th percentile O-3 concentration (+1.4-8.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)), and decreases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5; -4.0 similar to-7.5 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) and sulfur dioxide (-2.6 similar to-9.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) are uncovered by satellite and observational data. Model results show that the attributions of surface O-3 changes from 2013 to 2017 vary spatially and seasonally, and most regions are more affected by emission changes (-9.5-47.0 mu g m(-3)) rather than meteorological changes (-8.1-21.3 mu g m(-3)). In specific regions and seasons, e.g., south/southwestern and eastern China south of 35 degrees N in May and July, the surface O-3 responses to climate variability could have an equal or even greater importance than emission changes. In these major pollution control regions, e.g. northern and mid-eastern China, the precursor emissions control (11-35%) contributes in the same degree as the changes in aerosol effects (35-38%) to surface ozone enhancement in the warm seasons. More scientific emission controls and climate adaptation strategies are required to attain the synergetic control of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone in China.

TI  - Phenology-based classification of crop species and rotation types using fused MODIS and Landsat data: The comparison of a random-forest-based model and a decision-rule-based model
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of crop species and rotation types play a key role in crop yield estimation, natural resources management and climate change research. Remote sensing is an effective approach for monitoring agricultural management at the regional scale. However, the lack of remote sensing data with high spatiotemporal resolutions results in a generally limited crop mapping accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we employed an improved flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (IFSDAF) model to conduct data fusion using MODIS and Landsat imagery and extract NDVI time series with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Following this, we proposed a Random-Forest-based model and a decision-rule-based model for mapping crop species and rotation types. According to the accuracy assessment, the Random-Forest-based model with an overall accuracy of 90 % was more suitable for mapping crops with two or more growing seasons, such as double-cropping rice. Meanwhile, the decision-rule-based model with an overall accuracy of 89.7 % was more suitable for monitoring crops with only one growing season compared to the Random-Forest-based model. In comparison with traditional ways such as field survey, the classification models proposed in this study provide useful information for better monitoring spatiotemporal variations of crops species and rotation types, and guiding agricultural management accordingly.

TI  - BP Method With Rectified Linear Unit-Based Nonlinear Decoupling for 3-Axis FBG Force Sensor
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) force sensor with a compact size has been designed which can achieve the detection of three force components (F-x, F-y, F-z). The sensor is mainly comprised of a deformable body, a support body, and 5 FBGs. Although the FBGs show advantageous sensitivity on forces, the coupled effect among the measured components along different directions brings difficulties in the precision improvement of the sensor. In this article, a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) -based Back Propagation (BP) method has been adopted to decouple the designed sensor and improve the precision. Its theoretical sensing model and nonlinear decoupling algorithm have been derived and introduced, respectively. Experiments have been implemented to investigate the feasibility of the adopted method. Compared with the linear method (LM) and sigmoid function-based BP method, the ReLU-based BP method has better measurement accuracy that the average relative errors are less than 2% of full scale (F.S.) for the designed 3-axis force sensor. Such a result validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the adopted method to decouple the nonlinear response of the designed sensor.

TI  - Cadmium biosorption by lactic acid bacteria <i>Weissella viridescens</i> ZY-6
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cadmium in food and drinking water poses a serious threat to human health. In this study, a strain of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), namely, Weissella viridescens ZY-6 was utilized to remove Cd2+ from aqueous solution. Its Cd2+ binding capacity was assessed in different conditions, the underlying mechanism was investigated, and its use for removal of Cd2+ from vegetable and fruit juices was also evaluated. Results showed that Cd2+ binding ability of ZY-6 was influenced by Cd2+ concentration, biomass dosage, incubation time, temperature, and pH. Cd2+ adsorption could be improved by pretreatments of boiling and ultrasonication. In binary metal systems, the Cd2+ removal rate by ZY-6 decreased in the presence of other metal cations such as Mg2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+. Binding experiments using different cellular components showed that Cd2+ was mainly adsorbed on the bacterial cell walls, and only small amount accumulated inside the cells. Scanning electron microscopy proved that after adsorption, the cells appeared crumpled, wrinkled, and longer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed negatively charged functional groups such as -OH, -NH2, COO-, and P=O on the surface of the cells reacting with Cd2+ in the solution mainly through electrostatic reaction. ZY-6 treatment removed 69.45%-79.91% of the Cd2+ from three kinds of vegetable and fruit juices. Therefore, W. viridescens ZY-6 may be used as an effective biosorbent for cadmium in the environment, human diet, and animal feed due to its detoxification properties.

TI  - Adjacent-Track InSAR Processing for Large-Scale Land Subsidence Monitoring in the Hebei Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale land subsidence has threatened the safety of the Hebei Plain in China. For tens of thousands of square kilometers of the Hebei Plain, large-scale subsidence monitoring is still one of the most difficult problems to be solved. In this paper, we employed the small baseline subset (SBAS) and NSBAS technique to monitor the land subsidence in the Hebei Plain (45,000 km(2)). The 166 Sentinel-1A data of adjacent-track 40 and 142 collected from May 2017 to May 2019 were used to generate the average deformation velocity and deformation time-series. A novel data fusion flow for the generation of land subsidence velocity of adjacent-track is presented and tested, named as the fusion of time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) results of adjacent-track using synthetic aperture radar amplitude images (FTASA). A cross-comparison analysis between the two tracks results and two TS-InSAR results was carried out. In addition, the deformation results were validated by leveling measurements and benchmarks on bedrock results, reaching a precision 9 mm/year. Twenty-six typical subsidence bowls were identified in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Cangzhou, and Baoding. An average annual subsidence velocity over -79 mm/year was observed in Gaoyang County of Baoding City. Through the cause analysis of the typical subsidence bowls, the results showed that the shallow and deep groundwater funnels, three different land use types over the building construction, industrial area, and dense residential area, and faults had high spatial correlation related to land subsidence bowls.

TI  - A UAV-based framework for crop lodging assessment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging assessment needs to be carried out timely and accurately to ensure valuable information about the location and area where lodging occurs. Many applications have been explored and tested for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) visible imagery in agricultural management due to the ability of providing high-space-resolution information. However, there still face many challenges in extracting lodging information using UAV visible imagery, and lacks consensus on an appropriate way to assess crop lodging. The main purpose of this study was to proposed an efficient framework to identify crop lodging at the field scale using UAV visible imagery. This framework contained a two-phase procedure. Meanwhile, three methods were evaluated by providing the appropriate feature subset for objected-based classification to determine the best feature selection method. The results showed that the proposed framework provided high accuracy (94.0 %) for identification of sugarcane lodging. Furthermore, the Boruta algorithm yielded the best feature subset compared with statistical indicators and the RFE algorithm. Thus, the proposed framework based on UAV visible imagery is promising to identify crop lodging precisely, and has great application potential in precision agriculture.

TI  - Digital Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon Using Sentinel Series Data: A Case Study of the Ebinur Lake Watershed in Xinjiang
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important evaluation index of soil quality, soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil health, ecological security, soil material cycle and global climate cycle. The use of multi-source remote sensing on soil organic carbon distribution has a certain auxiliary effect on the study of soil organic carbon storage and the regional ecological cycle. However, the study on SOC distribution in Ebinur Lake Basin in arid and semi-arid regions is limited to the mapping of measured data, and the soil mapping of SOC using remote sensing data needs to be studied. Whether different machine learning methods can improve prediction accuracy in mapping process is less studied in arid areas. Based on that, combined with the proposed problems, this study selected the typical area of the Ebinur Lake Basin in the arid region as the study area, took the sentinel data as the main data source, and used the Sentinel-1A (radar data), the Sentinel-2A and the Sentinel-3A (multispectral data), combined with 16 kinds of DEM derivatives and climate data (annual average temperature MAT, annual average precipitation MAP) as analysis. The five different types of data are reconstructed by spatial data and divided into four spatial resolutions (10, 100, 300, and 500 m). Seven models are constructed and predicted by machine learning methods RF and Cubist. The results show that the prediction accuracy of RF model is better than that of Cubist model, indicating that RF model is more suitable for small areas in arid areas. Among the three data sources, Sentinel-1A has the highest SOC prediction accuracy of 0.391 at 10 m resolution under the RF model. The results of the importance of environmental variables show that the importance of Flow Accumulation is higher in the RF model and the importance of SLOP in the DEM derivative is higher in the Cubist model. In the prediction results, SOC is mainly distributed in oasis and regions with more human activities, while SOC is less distributed in other regions. This study provides a certain reference value for the prediction of small-scale soil organic carbon spatial distribution by means of remote sensing and environmental factors.

TI  - Mapping Essential Urban Land Use Categories in Beijing with a Fast Area of Interest (AOI)-Based Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land use mapping is critical to understanding human activities in space. The first national mapping result of essential urban land use categories of China (EULUC-China) was released in 2019. However, the overall accuracies in some of the plain cities such as Beijing, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou were lower than 50% because many parcel-based mapping units are large with mixed land uses. To address this shortcoming, we proposed an area of interest (AOI)-based mapping approach, choosing Beijing as our study area. The mapping process includes two major steps. First, grids with different sizes (i.e., 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m) were derived from original land parcels to obtain classification units with a suitable size. Then, features within these grids were extracted from Sentinel-2 spectral data, point of interest (POI), and Tencent Easygo crowdedness data. These features were classified using a random forest (RF) classifier with AOI data, resulting in a 10-category map of EULUC. Second, we superimposed the AOIs layer on classified units to do some rectification and offer more details at the building scale. The overall accuracy of the AOI layer reached 98%, and the overall accuracy of the mapping results reached 77%. This study provides a fast method for accurate geographic sample collection, which substantially reduces the amount of fieldwork for sample collection and improves the classification accuracy compared to previous EULUC mapping. The detailed urban land use map could offer more support for urban planning and environmental policymaking.

TI  - Forestland landscape change induced spatiotemporal dynamics of subtropical urban forest ecosystem services value in forested region of China: A case of Hangzhou city
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of urban forestland both type structure and change and their effects on forest ecosystem services (ES) is important for maintaining and enhancing the quality of life as well as ensuring sustainable urban planning in cities. In Hangzhou city of Zhejiang province in Southeast China, forestland covers more than 71% of its total land area, thereby providing a high variety of ES. Many studies have focused on the effects of land use change on ES value (ESV), but these have only applied to the first-level classification of land use. So there is an urgent need for studies to measure the effects of land use change on ESV applied to the second-level classification of land use. In this present study, from a rare insight into the forestland landscape change of Hangzhou city, the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban forest ESV (UFESV) during the period of 2000-2015 are analyzed based on the combination of remote sensing and a light-use-efficiency model (CASA). The results indicate that the total value of urban forest ES increases from 9.79 x 10(8) Yuan in 2000 to 12.31 x 10(8) Yuan in 2015, with a net increase of 2.52 x 10(8) Yuan in Hangzhou city, and forested land has the highest UFESV, contributing about 99.49% of the total services value, although the area of forestland decreases by 101.99 km(2) over the past 15 years. Carbon fixation and oxygen release and organic matter production are the two dominant service functions, accounting for 87.56% of the total on average. The construction and planning of Hangzhou's forest city has a positive impact on the value of urban forest ES during 2000-2015.

TI  - Identification of Abandoned Jujube Fields Using Multi-Temporal High-Resolution Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The jujube industry plays a very important role in the agricultural industrial structure of Xinjiang, China. In recent years, the abandonment of jujube fields has gradually emerged. It is critical to inventory the abandoned land soon after it is generated to adjust agricultural production better and prevent the negative impacts from the abandonment (such as outbreaks of diseases, insect pests, and fires). High-resolution multi-temporal satellite remote sensing images can be used to identify subtle differences among crops and provide a good tool for solving this problem. In this research, both field-based and pixel-based classification approaches using field boundaries were used to estimate the percentage of abandoned jujube fields with multi-temporal high spatial resolution satellite images (Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-6) and the Random Forest algorithm. The results showed that both approaches produced good classification results and similar distributions of abandoned fields. The overall accuracy was 91.1% for the field-based classification and 90.0% for the pixel-based classification, and the Kappa was 0.866 and 0.848 for the respective classifications. The areas of abandoned land detected in the field-based and pixel-based classification maps were 806.09 ha and 828.21 ha, respectively, accounting for 8.97% and 9.11% of the study area. In addition, feature importance evaluations of the two approaches showed that the overall importance of texture features was higher than that of vegetation indices and that 31 October and 10 November were important dates for abandoned land detection. The methodology proposed in this study will be useful for identifying abandoned jujube fields and have the potential for large-scale application.

TI  - An Effective Method for Generating Spatiotemporally Continuous 30 m Vegetation Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are key parameters for various applications. However, due to sensor tradeoff and cloud contaminations, these data are often temporally intermittent and spatially discontinuous. To address the discontinuities, this study proposed a method based on spectral matching of 30 m discontinuous values from Landsat data and 500 m temporally continuous values from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Experiments have proven that the proposed method can effectively yield spatiotemporally continuous vegetation products at 30 m spatial resolution. The results for three different study areas with NDVI and LAI showed that the method performs well in restoring the time series, fills in the missing data, and reasonably predicts the images. Remarkably, the proposed method could address the issue when no cloud-free data pairs are available close to the prediction date, because of the temporal information "borrowed" from coarser resolution data. Hence, the proposed method can make better use of partially obscured images. The reconstructed spatiotemporally continuous data have great potential for monitoring vegetation, agriculture, and environmental dynamics.

TI  - NASA's MODIS/VIIRS Global Water Reservoir Product Suite from Moderate Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global reservoir information can not only benefit local water management but can also improve our understanding of the hydrological cycle. This information includes water area, elevation, and storage; evaporation rate and volume values; and other characteristics. However, operational wall-to-wall reservoir storage and evaporation monitoring information is lacking on a global scale. Here we introduce NASA's new MODIS/VIIRS Global Water Reservoir product suite based on moderate resolution remote sensing data-the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This product consists of 8-day (MxD28C2 and VNP28C2) and monthly (MxD28C3 and VNP28C3) measurements for 164 large reservoirs (MxD stands for the product from both Terra (MOD) or Aqua (MYD) satellites). The 8-day product provides area, elevation, and storage values, which were generated by first extracting water areas from surface reflectance data and then applying the area estimations to the pre-established Area-Elevation (A-E) relationships. These values were then further aggregated to monthly, with the evaporation rate and volume information added. The evaporation rate and volume values were calculated after the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM) using MODIS/VIIRS land surface temperature product and meteorological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Validation results show that the 250 m area classifications from MODIS agree well with the high-resolution classifications from Landsat (R-2 = 0.99). Validation of elevation and storage products for twelve Indian reservoirs show good agreement in terms of R-2 values (0.71-0.96 for elevation, and 0.79-0.96 for storage) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) values (5.08-19.34% for elevation, and 6.39-18.77% for storage). The evaporation rate results for two reservoirs (Lake Nasser and Lake Mead) agree well with in situ measurements (R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.66, and NRMSE values of 16.25% and 21.76%). Furthermore, preliminary results from the VIIRS reservoir product have shown good consistency with the MODIS based product, confirming the continuity of this 20-year product suite. This new global water reservoir product suite can provide valuable information with regard to water-sources-related studies, applications, management, and hydrological modeling and change analysis such as drought monitoring.

TI  - Advancing Satellite Precipitation Retrievals With Data Driven Approaches: Is Black Box Model Explainable?
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based precipitation retrieval is an essential and long-standing scientific problem. With an increase of observational satellite data, the advances of data-driven approaches such as machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) are favored to deal with large data sets and potentially improve the accuracy of precipitation estimates. In this study, we took advantage of new technologies by wrapping up a ML/DL-based model pipeline (LinkNet segmentation + tree ensemble). This approach is applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 18 and 19 flight, and compared with the MultiRadar MultiSensor. Four simulations were configured to examine the performance gain by incorporating three components: (1) precipitation identification, (2) nonlocal features, and (3) precipitation classification. More importantly, we examined the interpretability of the "black box" model to get a better understanding of the underlying physical connections. First, the results by this model pipeline suggest the advantages of the ML model by reducing the systematic error and instantaneous error to a factor of two. Second, identifying precipitation pixels helps to reduce the systematic error by 130%, and predicting precipitation classification benefits improved correlations by 32%. Last, channels at higher frequencies (beyond 150 GHz) are favored to identify precipitation regions, and also channels at 89 and 150 GHz are ranked as the two most important features to precipitation retrieval. This study explores the potentials of AMSU precipitation estimates with ML algorithms and provides means of interpreting the models to facilitate the better prediction of precipitation.Plain Language Summary Accurate precipitation estimations could undoubtedly benefit water resources management and decision makings. As the precipitation data explode, especially for remote sensing, there is a growing opportunity to leverage these myriads of data to advance the satellite retrieval algorithms. In this study, we apply this novel machine learning/deep learning pipeline with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-18 and NOAA-19 satellite to compare with an operational retrieval algorithm. Beyond that, the black box model interpretability is explored to discover how the model predicts the outcome. The results prove that this model not only outperforms than the operational product, it but also makes physical sense with respect to its functionality.

TI  - The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Product Suite
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite currently contains 12 products, including leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fraction of green vegetation coverage, gross primary production, broadband albedo, broadband longwave emissivity, downward shortwave radiation and photosynthetically active radiation, land surface temperature, downward and upwelling thermal radiation, all-wave net radiation, and evapotranspiration. These products are generated from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data. Their unique features include long-term temporal coverage (many from 1981 to the present), high spatial resolutions of the surface radiation products (1 km and 0.05 degrees), spatial continuities without missing pixels, and high quality and accuracy based on extensive validation using in situ measurements and intercomparisons with other existing satellite products. Moreover, the GLASS products are based on robust algorithms that have been published in peer-reviewed literature. Herein, we provide an overview of the algorithm development, product characteristics, and some preliminary applications of these products. We also describe the next steps, such as improving the existing GLASS products, generating more climate data records (CDRs), broadening product dissemination, and fostering their wider utilization. The GLASS products are freely available to the public.

TI  - Retrieval of Regional Aerosol Optical Depth Using Deep Learning
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To solve the problem that there exist low precision and spatial resolution in the retrieval algorithm of land aerosol optical depth (AOD), a deep learning-based deep belief network (DBN) is proposed to realize the retrieval of land AOD with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The training samples for the algorithm include the AERONET site data with global long time series as well as the observation geometric data and apparent reflectivity data from Landsat 8 OLI which are corresponding to the former in space and time. To ensure the estimation accuracy and stability of retrieval, the process method for the AERONET site data, the spatial-temporal matching method for satellite and site data, and the setting of the DBN structure are investigated. The AERONET site data, independent of the training samples, are used to test the AOD estimation results at 550 nm for different surface types as a whole. In addition, the small-scale accuracy verification is conducted in the study area. The results demonstrate that the root mean square error and the mean absolute error of the proposed method are 0.11 and 0.072, respectively. The proposed method can break the situation in which the retrieval of AOD based on the existing methods relies excessively on other remote sensing products or time-phase data, and it effectively improves the efficiency and spatial resolution in the retrieval of AOD.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of Finer Impervious Surface Classes in Urban Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces (IS), the most common land cover in urban areas, not only provide convenience to the city, but also exert significant negative environmental impacts, thereby affecting the ecological environment carrying capacity of urban agglomerations. Most of the current research considers IS as a single land-cover type, yet this does not fully reflect the complex physical characteristics of various IS types. Therefore, limited information for urban micro-ecology and urban fine management can be provided through one IS land-cover type. This study proposed a finer IS classification scheme and mapped the detailed IS fraction in Guangzhou City, China using Landsat imagery. The IS type was divided into seven finer classes, including blue steel, cement, asphalt, other impervious surface, and other metal, brick, and plastic. Classification results demonstrate that finer IS can be well extracted from the Landsat imagery as all root mean square errors (RMSE) are less than 15%. Specially, the accuracies of asphalt, plastic, and cement are better than other finer IS types with the RMSEs of 7.99%, 8.48%, and 9.92%, respectively. Quantitative analyses illustrate that asphalt, other impervious surface, and brick are the dominant IS types in the study area with the percentages of 9.68%, 6.27%, and 4.45%, respectively, and they are mainly located in Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, and Panyu districts. These results are valuable for research into urban fine management and can support the detailed analysis of urban micro-ecology.

TI  - Landsat-based lake distribution and changes in western Alaska permafrost regions between the 1970s and 2010s
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an important ecosystem component and geomorphological agent in northern high latitudes and it is important to understand how lake initiation, expansion and drainage may change as high latitudes continue to warm. In this study, we utilized Landsat Multispectral Scanner System images from the 1970s (1972, 1974, and 1975) and Operational Land Imager images from the 2010s (2013, 2014, and 2015) to assess broad-scale distribution and changes of lakes larger than 1 ha across the four permafrost zones (continuous, discontinuous, sporadic, and isolated extent) in western Alaska. Across our 68 000 km(2) study area, we saw a decline in overall lake coverage across all permafrost zones with the exception of the sporadic permafrost zone. In the continuous permafrost zone lake area declined by -6.7% (-65.3 km(2)), in the discontinuous permafrost zone by -1.6% (-55.0 km(2)), in the isolated permafrost zone by -6.9% (-31.5 km(2)) while lake cover increased by 2.7% (117.2 km(2)) in the sporadic permafrost zone. Overall, we observed a net drainage of lakes larger than 10 ha in the study region. Partial drainage of these medium to large lakes created an increase in the area covered by small water bodies <10 ha, in the form of remnant lakes and ponds by 7.1% (12.6 km(2)) in continuous permafrost, 2.5% (15.5 km(2)) in discontinuous permafrost, 14.4% (74.6 km(2)) in sporadic permafrost, and 10.4% (17.2 km(2)) in isolated permafrost. In general, our observations indicate that lake expansion and drainage in western Alaska are occurring in parallel. As the climate continues to warm and permafrost continues to thaw, we expect an increase in the number of drainage events in this region leading to the formation of higher numbers of small remnant lakes.

TI  - Host interactions of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, an invasive vector of arboviruses, in Virginia, USA
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryNative to Southeast Asia, breeding populations of Aedes albopictus were first discovered in Harris County, Texas, in 1985, and as of 2017, seasonal populations of this species have been reported in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. Aedes albopictus breed readily in natural or man-made environment where stagnant water can accumulate such as gutters, flowerpots, discarded tires, and tree holes. This mosquito species has been implicated in outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses and is a competent vector of many arboviruses including West Nile, eastern equine encephalitis, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis. Aedes albopictus is regarded as an opportunistic mosquito feeding on a variety of domestic and wild mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians; however, a preference for human blood meals has been noted in blood meal analysis of field-collected mosquitoes and in laboratory investigations. We studied vector-host interactions of Ae. albopictus in Virginia, United States using molecular methods and identified ten mammalian, three reptilian, and two avian species as blood hosts of this mosquito species. Our study clarifies the host associations of Ae. albopictus and highlights concerns about the potential role of this mosquito species in transmission of emerging and reemerging arboviruses.BackgroundAs an invasive mosquito species in the United States, Aedes albopictus is a potential vector of arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and may also be involved in occasional transmission of other arboviruses such as West Nile, Saint Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and La Crosse viruses. Aedes albopictus feeds on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, wild and domestic, as well as humans.Methodology/Principal findingsIn order to investigate blood feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus, engorged specimens were collected from a variety of habitat types using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps, Biogents Sentinel 2 traps, and modified Reiter gravid traps in southeast Virginia. Sources of blood meals were determined by the analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences amplified in PCR assays. Our aims were to quantify degrees of Ae. albopictus interactions with vertebrate hosts as sources of blood meals, investigate arboviral infection status, assess the influence of key socioecological conditions on spatial variability in blood feeding, and investigate temporal differences in blood feeding by season. Analysis of 961 engorged specimens of Ae. albopictus sampled between 2017-2019 indicated that 96%, 4%, and less than 1% obtained blood meals from mammalian, reptilian, and avian hosts, respectively. Domestic cats were the most frequently identified (50.5%) hosts followed by Virginia opossums (17.1%), white-tailed deer (12.2%), and humans (7.3%), together representing 87.1% of all identified blood hosts. We found spatial patterns in blood feeding linked to socioecological conditions and seasonal shifts in Ae. albopictus blood feeding with implications for understanding human biting and disease risk. In Suffolk Virginia in areas of lower human development, the likelihood of human blood feeding increased as median household income increased and human blood feeding was more likely early in the season (May-June) compared to later (July-October). Screening of the head and thorax of engorged Ae. albopictus mosquitoes by cell culture and RT-PCR resulted in a single isolate of Potosi virus.Conclusion and significanceUnderstanding mosquito-host interactions in nature is vital for evaluating vectorial capacity of mosquitoes. These interactions with competent reservoir hosts support transmission, maintenance, and amplification of zoonotic agents of human diseases. Results of our study in conjunction with abundance in urban/suburban settings, virus isolation from field-collected mosquitoes, and vector competence of Ae. albopictus, highlight the potential involvement of this species in the transmission of a number of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika to humans. Limited interaction with avian hosts suggests that Ae. albopictus is unlikely to serve as a bridge vector of arboviruses such as West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis in the study region, but that possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.

TI  - Mast Cell Tryptase Promotes Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Induced Intestinal Fibrosis
T2  - INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intestinal fibrosis is the final pathological outcome of chronic intestinal inflammation without specific therapeutic drugs, which leads to ileus and surgical intervention. Intestinal fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The role of mast cells (MCs), which are members of the sentinel immune cell population, is unknown in intestinal fibrosis.Methods: In this study, we analyzed changes in MCs, tryptase proteins, and ECM components in human fibrotic and control patient intestines. We constructed dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal fibrosis models using wild-type mice, MC-reconstituted mice, and MC-deficient mice to explore the role of MCs and tryptase in intestinal fibrosis. The roles and mechanisms of MCs and tryptase on fibroblasts were evaluated using human MCs (HMC-1 and LAD-2), commercial tryptase proteins, human colon fibroblasts (CCD-18Co fibroblasts), the tryptase inhibitor APC366, and the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) antagonist ENMD-1068.Results: Regardless of whether the colon was a human colon or a mouse colon, the fibrotic intestinal tissue had increased MC infiltration and a higher expression of ECM proteins or genes than that of the control group. The dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal fibrosis in MC-deficient mice was alleviated compared with that in wild-type mice. After MC reconstruction in MC-deficient mice, the alleviating effect disappeared. Tryptase, as a content stored in MC granules, was released into fibrotic intestinal tissues in the form of degranulation, resulting in an increased expression of tryptase. Compared with the control group, the tryptase inhibition group (the APC366 group) had reduced intestinal fibrosis. The CCD-18Co fibroblasts, when cocultured with MCs or treated with tryptase proteins, were activated to differentiate into myofibroblasts and secrete more ECM proteins (such as collagen and fibronectin). The underlying mechanism of fibroblast activation by tryptase was the activation of the PAR-2/Akt/mTOR pathway.Conclusions: We found that MC tryptase promotes inflammatory bowel disease-induced intestinal fibrosis. The underlying mechanism is that tryptase promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into fibrotic-phenotype myofibroblasts by activating the PAR-2/Akt/ mTOR pathway of fibroblasts.

TI  - The increasing water clarity of Tibetan lakes over last 20 years according to MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity is a comprehensive indicator of the water environment status. Studies have shown that in recent years the clarity of inland and ocean water has decreased in many parts of the world owing to the influence of climate change and human activities. However, changes in inland water clarity exclusively resulting from climate change are largely ignored because most inland water is being utilized by human beings for applications such as waterworks or aquaculture. Therefore, understanding the trends and reasons of inland water clarity under natural conditions is important to recognize the inland water environment shifts under the global changes. Because of the harsh environment, the lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are less disturbed by human activities and are ideal objects for studying water clarity variations attributed to climatic changes. Here, we describe water clarity changes as measured using the Secchi Depth (SD) in 152 big lakes with an area greater than 50 km(2) based on in-situ investigations and the retrieval results from a high accuracy retrieval model (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). Most of the lakes had an SD of 3-10 m, although there was marked spatial variation and a significant positive correlation with lake area (P < 0.01). The mean SD of all 152 lakes significantly increased at a rate of 0.033 m/year (95% CI, 0.021-0.045; P < 0.01) between 2000 and 2019. Variations in lake SD were linked with temporal changes in precipitation, and related to spatial changes of water optical components including suspended matter (0.13 < R-2 < 0.40, P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), fDOM (R-2 = 0.24, P < 0.01) and chlorophyll-a concentration (R-2 = 0.12, P < 0.01). The reconstructed lake water clarity in our study will improve the understanding of inland water clarity changes and provide basic data to study the heat exchanges between lake water and atmosphere.

TI  - Using Satellite Remote Sensing to Study the Effect of Sand Excavation on the Suspended Sediment in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge crosses the Pearl River Estuary and is the largest bridge and tunnel project in the world. During the construction period of this project, the excessive suspended sediment was found in the construction region. The suspended sediment generated by sand excavation in the upstream was assumed to have a significant impact on the suspended sediment in the tunnel region. In this study, we assessed the impact of upstream sand excavation on the suspended sediment in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge construction area using Landsat OLI, ETM+, and TM data. Regional suspended sediment algorithms were developed for Landsat using a symbolic regression method based on data from in situ measurements in the study area from 2003 to 2014. A band shift was conducted on the remote sensing reflectance data from Landsat ETM+ and OLI to produce a time series of the suspended sediment concentrations that was internally consistent with that of the Landsat TM data. The suspended sediment distribution was extracted and used to compare under two different conditions, with and without sand excavation. The correlations of the time series of the suspended sediment concentrations in different regions in the surrounding waters, including the correlations between the construction regions and the sand excavation regions, were calculated. Our results indicated that the sand excavation north of the Pearl River Estuary had a limited impact on the surface suspended sediment concentrations in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge tunnel area.

TI  - Measurement Method of Random Errors in Spot Target Detection by Flat-Panel Detector
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the target's detection accuracy of the acquisition, tracking, and pointing system used in satellite-to-ground optical communications, the analysis and evaluation with high precision arc needed for the random errors influencing the position determination of the beacon spots on the flat-panel detector. Considering a variety of random factors influencing spot detection, a noise equivalent angle (NEA) model for the centroid localization which is not dependent on the point spread function of target signals is established and the influences of different factors on the NEA arc simulated. The results show that the change trend of NEA value under each point spread function of target signals is similar. It increases with the increase of noise, decreases with the increase of signal intensity, and increases with the increase of spot radius. The NEA values calculated under different point spread functions of target signals arc different, but the maximum difference is less than 30%. The research result provides a new measurement method and a theoretical analysis basis of random errors existing in target position detection, and is of great significance to the establishment and maintenance of long-distance satellite-to-ground optical communication links.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval in Farmland Areas with Sentinel Multi-Source Data Based on Regression Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component of the earth ecosystem, soil moisture monitoring is of great significance in the fields of crop growth monitoring, crop yield estimation, variable irrigation, and other related applications. In order to mitigate or eliminate the impacts of sparse vegetation covers in farmland areas, this study combines multi-source remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical satellites to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture content. Firstly, a traditional Oh model was applied to estimate soil moisture content after removing vegetation influence by a water cloud model. Secondly, support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models were used to establish the relationships between various remote sensing features and real soil moisture. Finally, a regression convolutional neural network (CNNR) model is constructed to extract deep-level features of remote sensing data to increase soil moisture retrieval accuracy. In addition, polarimetric decomposition features for real Sentinel-1 PolSAR data are also included in the construction of inversion models. Based on the established soil moisture retrieval models, this study analyzes the influence of each input feature on the inversion accuracy in detail. The experimental results show that the optimal combination of R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) for SVR is 0.7619 and 0.0257 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The optimal combination of R-2 and RMSE for GRNN is 0.7098 and 0.0264 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. Especially, the CNNR model with optimal feature combination can generate inversion results with the highest accuracy, whose R-2 and RMSE reach up to 0.8947 and 0.0208 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. Compared to other methods, the proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data. Furthermore, after adding polarization decomposition features, the R-2 of CNNR is raised by 0.1524 and the RMSE of CNNR decreased by 0.0019 cm(3)/cm(3) on average, which means that the addition of polarimetric decomposition features effectively improves the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval results.

TI  - A Mechanistic Approach for Modeling Soil Development Using Remotely Sensed Data Collected from Invaded Coasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of the exotic species Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has profoundly influenced coastal soil development in China. Accurate assessment and monitoring of invasion-driven development in coastal soils requires the development of reliable methods to support the sustainable governance of coastal ecosystems. A space-for-time substitution method and a stratified random sampling strategy were utilized in this study to obtain soil data from 15 sites at three depth intervals (0-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm) to obtain a total of 45 soil samples. We developed a mechanistic approach to model soil development using Sentinel-1 data. Here, soil development was represented by a comprehensive soil index, the soil quality index (SQI), which was calculated from key physical and chemical soil properties. In the structural equation model (SEM), soil, vegetation and remote-sensing data were initially assumed to be related to each other based on prior knowledge and were constructed from their corresponding observed variables. The results of the correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the invasion processes and SQI values, especially in the topsoil of the upper 30 cm. The final SEM model showed that the invasion process had great direct and positive effects on SQI in the upper 60 cm depth soil; however, vegetation (represented by a vegetation index) had a negative influence on SQI in the topmost layer. We found that Sentinel-1 data explained the large variation in the interacting ecosystem of the invasion, vegetation, and soils, with R-2 values ranging between 0.45 and 0.96. The results of model performance evaluation demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed model in predicting SQI, with a ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 1.44 in the upper 60 cm. Our findings highlight the potential of Sentinel-1 data in monitoring the pace of soil development in constructed S. alterniflora marshes.

TI  - Establishing forest resilience indicators in the hilly red soil region of southern China from vegetation greenness and landscape metrics using dense Landsat time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to respond and recover from damage or stress. It can inherently exhibit the cycle and feedback of the disturbed ecosystem recovery process for a specified period. The current availability of dense and consistent time series of satellite images holds the promise of monitoring forest resilience. The aim of this study is to establish forest resilience indicators using dense Landsat time series and assess forest resilience in response to the maximum disturbance magnitude in the hilly red soil region, Hengyang Basin, Southern China. To achieve this, Landsat images of the study area from 1987 to 2017 were collected. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), i.e., proxy of forest green characteristics, number of patch (NP), average patch size (PS), patch perimeter-area ratio (PPAR) and aggregation index (AI), i.e., proxies of forest landscape metrics were calculated from Landsat images. And then elasticity (i.e., the time and rate of recovery), malleability (i.e., degree of deviation from an initial state) and trend (i.e., the pattern of change) as the indicators of forest resilience were constructed. The local space-time Moran's I (STI) based on NDVI residual space-time Moran's I (STI) was employed to characterize the forest disturbance and recovery process. The results revealed the following. Firstly, the STI calculated from dense time series NDVI residuals are successful at monitoring the forest disturbance recovery process, regardless of whether changes were dramatic or subtle. Secondly, the most forest disturbances (i.e., > 75%) occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. NDVI and landscape metrics also differed in their response to disturbances; NDVI, PPAR and AI are more malleable to disturbance than PS and NP are. Finally, approximately 40% of the disturbed forest had the strong elasticity with a short recovery time (i.e., a year). We conclude that measuring forest resilience via vegetation greenness and landscape metrics using dense time series satellite images is practical as an operational tool for policy makers, landowners, and national park managers. Moreover, insights into ecological dynamics are emerging from capturing the process showing the difference both before and after the change.

TI  - Arbitrary Direction Ship Detection in Remote-Sensing Images Based on Multitask Learning and Multiregion Feature Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in remote sensing plays an important role in civil and military fields. Owing to the complex background and uncertain direction, ship detection is full of challenge by using the commonly used object-detection methods. In this article, a new framework for detecting the arbitrary direction ships is proposed based on the improvement in the Faster region-based convolutional network (R-CNN), in which the shape of the bounding box is described by three sides, namely, vertical side, horizontal side, and short side, respectively. The inclination of the ship is obtained by calculating the arc-tangent value of the vertical side to the horizontal side. First, the better performing ResNet-101 is adopted to extract features over an entire image, which are shared by the region proposal network (RPN) and the head network. Then, the multidirection proposal regions that may contain ships are generated by the RPN. Next, the global and local features of the proposal regions are combined as the whole features of the regions by a multiregion feature-fusion (MFF) module, which can provide more detailed information of the regions. Finally, the head network uses the whole features of the proposal regions for bounding-box recognition through multitask learning, including classification, regression, and incline direction prediction (left or right). The proposed method is tested and compared with other state-of-the-art ship-detection methods on two open remote-sensing data sets and some large-scale and real images. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach has achieved better performance.

TI  - Evaluating effects of Dielectric Models on the surface soil moisture retrieval in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the measurement of L-band ground-based microwave radiometer (ELBARA-III type) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the tau - omega radiative transfer model, this research evaluated the effects of four soil dielectric models, i.e., Wang-Schmugge, Mironov, Dobson, and Four-phase, on the L-band microwave brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval. The results show that with the same vegetation and roughness parameterization scheme, the four soil dielectric models display obvious differences in microwave brightness temperature simulation. When the soil moisture is less than 0.23 m(3)/m(3), the simulated microwave brightness temperature in Wang-Schmugge model is significantly different from that of the other three models, with maximum differences of horizontal polarization and vertical polarization reaching 8.0 K and 4.4 K, respectively; when the soil moisture is greater than 0.23 m(3)/m(3), the simulated microwave brightness temperature of Four-phase significantly exceeds that of the other three models; when the soil moisture is saturated, maximum differences in simulated microwave brightness temperature with horizontal polarization and vertical polarization are 6.1 K and 4.8 K respectively, and the four soil dielectric models are more variable in the microwave brightness temperature simulation with horizontal polarization than that with vertical polarization. As for the soil moisture retrieval based on the four dielectric models, the comparison study shows that, under the condition of horizontal polarization, Wang-Schmugge model can reduce the degree of retrieved soil moisture underestimating the observed soil moisture more effectively than other parameterization schemes, while under the condition of vertical polarization, the Mironov model can reduce the degree of retrieved soil moisture overestimating the observed soil moisture. Finally, based on the Wang-Schmugge model and FengYun-3C observation data, the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the study area is retrieved.

TI  - Inundation Assessment of the 2019 Typhoon Hagibis in Japan Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Intensity Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Hagibis passed through Japan on October 12, 2019, bringing heavy rainfall over half of Japan. Twelve banks of seven state-managed rivers collapsed, flooding a wide area. Quick and accurate damage proximity maps are helpful for emergency responses and relief activities after such disasters. In this study, we propose a quick analysis procedure to estimate inundations due to Typhoon Hagibis using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR intensity images. The study area was Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, including two flooded state-managed rivers, Naka and Kuji. First, the completely flooded areas were detected by two traditional methods, the change detection and the thresholding methods. By comparing the results in a part of the affected area with our field survey, the change detection was adopted due to its higher recall accuracy. Then, a new index combining the average value and the standard deviation of the differences was proposed for extracting partially flooded built-up areas. Finally, inundation maps were created by merging the completely and partially flooded areas. The final inundation map was evaluated via comparison with the flooding boundary produced by the Geospatial Information Authority (GSI) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan. As a result, 74% of the inundated areas were able to be identified successfully using the proposed quick procedure.

TI  - Rapid expansion of lakes in the endorheic basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau since 2000 and its potential drivers
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The QTP (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) holds the greatest concentration of high-elevation inland lakes in the world, and most of these lakes are located in the QTP endorheic basin. Accelerated lake expansion in the endorheic basin since 2000 has been confirmed by many studies, but there is disagreement as to which components of the water balance explain most of the lake expansion. In this paper, based on Landsat images, meteorological data, glacier data and permafrost monitoring data, we analyzed the spatial-temporal changes in lake area and further explored the driving factors behind rapid lake expansion in different zones in the endorheic basin. The results suggested that the spatial pattern of trends in lake area in the endorheic basin from 2000 to 2017 showed a southwest-northeast transition from contracting to slightly expanding to rapidly expanding. More importantly, the dramatic lake expansion observed in most regions was statistically significant (0.01 similar to 26.29 km(2)/yr). Although retreating glaciers may have contributed to lake growth, this can not fully explain the recent lake expansion. We find that increasing precipitation was the primary driver behind lake expansion, and that permafrost degradation accelerated lake expansion. Lakes on the northern slope of the Gangdise Mountains, fed by the most rapidly retreating glaciers, were relatively stable or even contracted. In contrast, most of the nonglacier-fed lakes in the Hoh Xil region and the central endorheic basin nevertheless experienced significant expansion and slight expansion, respectively, which were mainly attributed to the greatest increase in AP (annual precipitation). Remarkable lake expansion was found in the continuous permafrost zone. The increasing ALT (active layer thickness) and soil temperature of permafrost resulted in an increase in meltwater from ground ice, the partial release of soil moisture and an amount of unfrozen water content, which has contributed to supply lakes and accelerated lake expansion.

TI  - Assessing Sponge Cities Performance at City Scale Using Remotely Sensed LULC Changes: Case Study Nanjing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of high-density urbanization and climate change, both the frequency and intensity of extreme urban rainfall are increasing. Drainage systems are not designed to cope with this increase, and as a result, floods are becoming more common in cities, particularly in the rapidly growing cities of China. To better cope with more frequent and severe urban flooding and to improve the water quality of stormwater runoff, the Chinese government launched the national Sponge City Construction (SCC) program in 2014. The current SCC design standards and guidelines are based on static values (e.g., return periods, rainfall intensities, and volume capture ratio (VCR)). They do not fully acknowledge the large differences in climate conditions across the country and assume that the hydraulic conditions will not change over time. This stationary approach stems from the traditional engineering approach designed for grey infrastructure (following a "one size fits all" approach). The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology to assess the VCR baseline (before construction in the pre-development stage) and changes in VCR (difference between the VCR of the pre- and post-development stage). The VCR of the post-development stage is one of the required indicators of the Assessment Standard for Sponge Cities Effects to evaluate SCC projects. In this study, the VCR was derived from remote-sensing-based land use land cover (LULC) change analysis, applying an unsupervised classification algorithm on different Landsat images from 1985 to 2015. A visualization method (based upon Sankey chart, which depicts the flows and their proportions of components) and a novel and practical partitioning method for built-up regions were developed to visualize and quantify the states and change flows of LULC. On the basis of these findings, we proposed a new indicator, referred to as VCRa-L, in order to assess the changes in urban hydrology after SCC construction. This study employed the city of Nanjing as a case study and analyzed detailed information on how LULC changes over time of built-up areas. The surface area of the urban and built-up areas of Nanjing quadrupled from 11% in 1985 to 44% in 2015. In the same period, neither the entire city nor its subregions reached the VCR target of 80%. The proposed new methodology aims to support national, regional, and city governments to identify and prioritize where to invest and implement SCC measures more effectively in cities across China.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In recent years, a boom of synthetic drugs, especially methamphetamine has been documented in China, however, the situation in Jiangsu was unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changing trends in types of drug used, examine the prevalence trends of HIV, syphilis and HCV over time and compare the demographic, drug and sexual behaviors among different types of people who use drugs (PWD) in Jiangsu Province, China.Methods: Consecutive cross-sectional studies were conducted from 2011 to 2015 in nine compulsory detoxification centers, which were HIV sentinel surveillance sites, in Jiangsu Province, China. A structured questionnaire was administered in a face-to-face interview with each participant to collect demographic, behavioral and laboratory information. Participants were classified into three types: opioids PWD (using heroin, opium, morphine and dolantin); stimulant PWD (using cocaine, methamphetamine, methylene dioxymetham-phetamine and Magu); poly-drug PWD (using opioids and stimulant drugs simultaneously).Results: Among a total of 16,164 PWD recruited from 2011 to 2015, the proportion of opioids PWD declined from 40.1% in 2011 to 11.8% in 2015, while the proportion of stimulant PWD increased from 53.6% to 84.3%. Overall HIV, syphilis, and HCV prevalence for the period was 0.3%, 9.6% and 31.6%, respectively. As types of drugs used shifted from opioids to stimulants, HIV prevalence increased ( P = 0.031) while HCV decreased ( P < 0.001). HIV, syphilis and HCV prevalence trends varied across the three subgroups. Injection and needle-sharing behaviors differed between opioids and stimulant PWD, whereas unsafe sexual behaviors were similar. Poly-drug PWD might have higher risks for these infections due to combinations of unsafe sexual and injection behaviors.Conclusion: Although the trend of drugs used have changed over time, HIV, syphilis and HCV infection risk behaviors among PWD still exist. Therefore, traditional intervention strategies should seek to address the challenge of increasing stimulant PWD. Access to convenient testing services, as well as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV risk reduction should be improved among PWD. Antiviral treatment for HCV should be added to medical insurance coverage as soon as possible in Jiangsu Province.

T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a developing city, urban green space (UGS) plays an increasingly significant role in improving the urban environment and beautifying the urban landscape. In the meantime, UGS has been substantially and frequently interfered with by human activities. Taking Shenzhen city (a great metropolis of China) as an example, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of UGS and its influence on the urban thermal environment with Landsat images. From 1978 to 2018, all croplands and more than 50% of water bodies disappeared, while the built-up area increased more than 6 times. The rapid expansion of impervious surface and loss of UGS led to the spread of a surface urban heat island. The study shows that UGS has a significantly mitigating impact on urban land surface temperature, with cold islands mainly located at city parks. The results will be of great significance for improving UGS management, alleviating the urban heat island effect, and establishing a sustainable eco-environment.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Yield in Arid and Semiarid Regions Based on Assimilated Multi-Source Sentinel Data and the CERES-Wheat Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The farmland area in arid and semiarid regions accounts for about 40% of the total area of farmland in the world, and it continues to increase. It is critical for global food security to predict the crop yield in arid and semiarid regions. To improve the prediction of crop yields in arid and semiarid regions, we explored data assimilation-crop modeling strategies for estimating the yield of winter wheat under different water stress conditions across different growing areas. We incorporated leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture derived from multi-source Sentinel data with the CERES-Wheat model using ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation. According to different water stress conditions, different data assimilation strategies were applied to estimate winter wheat yields in arid and semiarid areas. Sentinel data provided LAI and soil moisture data with higher frequency (<14 d) and higher precision, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.9955 m(2) m(-2) and 0.0305 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively, for data assimilation-crop modeling. The temporal continuity of the CERES-Wheat model and the spatial continuity of the remote sensing images obtained from the Sentinel data were integrated using the assimilation method. The RMSE of LAI and soil water obtained by the assimilation method were lower than those simulated by the CERES-Wheat model, which were reduced by 0.4458 m(2) m(-2) and 0.0244 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. Assimilation of LAI independently estimated yield with high precision and efficiency in irrigated areas for winter wheat, with RMSE and absolute relative error (ARE) of 427.57 kg ha(-1) and 6.07%, respectively. However, in rain-fed areas of winter wheat under water stress, assimilating both LAI and soil moisture achieved the highest accuracy in estimating yield (RMSE = 424.75 kg ha(-1), ARE = 9.55%) by modifying the growth and development of the canopy simultaneously and by promoting soil water balance. Sentinel data can provide high temporal and spatial resolution data for deriving LAI and soil moisture in the study area, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of the assimilation model at a regional scale. In the arid and semiarid region of the southeastern Loess Plateau, assimilation of LAI independently can obtain high-precision yield estimation of winter wheat in irrigated area, while it requires assimilating both LAI and soil moisture to achieve high-precision yield estimation in the rain-fed area.

TI  - Incident Angle Dependence of Sentinel-1 Texture Features for Sea Ice Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust and reliable classification of sea ice types in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is needed for various operational and environmental applications. Previous studies have investigated the class-dependent decrease in SAR backscatter intensity with incident angle (IA); others have shown the potential of textural information to improve automated image classification. In this work, we investigate the inclusion of Sentinel-1 (S1) texture features into a Bayesian classifier that accounts for linear per-class variation of its features with IA. We use the S1 extra-wide swath (EW) product in ground-range detected format at medium resolution (GRDM), and we compute seven grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features from the HH and the HV backscatter intensity in the linear and logarithmic domain. While GLCM texture features obtained in the linear domain vary significantly with IA, the features computed from the logarithmic intensity do not depend on IA or reveal only a weak, approximately linear dependency. They can therefore be directly included in the IA-sensitive classifier that assumes a linear variation. The different number of looks in the first sub-swath (EW1) of the product causes a distinct offset in texture at the sub-swath boundary between EW1 and the second sub-swath (EW2). This offset must be considered when using texture in classification; we demonstrate a manual correction for the example of GLCM contrast. Based on the Jeffries-Matusita distance between class histograms, we perform a separability analysis for 57 different GLCM parameter settings. We select a suitable combination of features for the ice classes in our data set and classify several test images using a combination of intensity and texture features. We compare the results to a classifier using only intensity. Particular improvements are achieved for the generalized separation of ice and water, as well as the classification of young ice and multi-year ice.

TI  - On the Detection and Long-Term Path Visualisation of A-68 Iceberg
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a methodology for examining a temporal sequence of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as applied to the detection of the A-68 iceberg and its drifting trajectory. Using an improved image processing scheme, the analysis covers a period of eighteen months and makes use of a set of Sentinel-1 images. A-68 iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017 and is one of the largest icebergs observed by remote sensing on record. After the calving, there was only a modest decrease in the area (about 1%) in the first six months. It has been drifting along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and is expected to continue its path for more than a decade. It is important to track the huge A-68 iceberg to retrieve information on the physics of iceberg dynamics and for maritime security reasons. Two relevant problems are addressed by the image processing scheme presented here: (a) How to achieve quasi-automatic analysis using a fuzzy logic approach to image contrast enhancement, and (b) The use of ferromagnetic concepts to define a stochastic segmentation. The Ising equation is used to model the energy function of the process, and the segmentation is the result of a stochastic minimization.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of the Influences of Snow Drought on Forest and Grass Growth in Mid-High Latitude Regions by Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change, especially the snow drought events, is causing extreme weather events influencing regional vegetation growth and terrestrial ecosystem stability in a long-term and persistent way. In this study, the Sanjiang Plain was selected, as this area has been experiencing snow drought in the past two decades. Logistic models, combined with multisource remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data, as well as the meteorological data over the past 20 years, were used to calculate sixteen phenological periods and biomass. The results show that (1) over the past two decades, snow drought has been based on the snow accumulation and has been occurring more frequently, wider-ranging and more severely; (2) snow drought has advanced the forest start of season (SOS)/end of season (EOS) by 6/5 days, respectively; (3) if the snowfall is greater than 80% of a normal year, the SOS/EOS of grass is postponed by 8/6 days; conversely, if it is less than 80%, the SOS/EOS are advanced by 7/5 days; and (4) biomass decreased approximately 0.61%, compared with an abundant snowfall year. Overall, this study is the first to explore how snow drought impacts the phenological period in a mid-high latitude area, and more attention should be paid to these unknown risks to the ecosystem.

TI  - Elevational Movement of Vegetation Greenness on the Tibetan Plateau: Evidence from the Landsat Satellite Observations during the Last Three Decades
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, the highest plateau in the world, has experienced strong climate warming during the last few decades. The greater increase of temperature at higher elevations may have strong impacts on the vertical movement of vegetation activities on the plateau. Although satellite-based observations have explored this issue, these observations were normally provided by the coarse satellite data with a spatial resolution of more than hundreds of meters (e.g., GIMMS and MODIS), which could lead to serious mixed-pixel effects in the analyses. In this study, we employed the medium-spatial-resolution Landsat NDVI data (30 m) during 1990-2019 and investigated the relationship between temperature and the elevation-dependent vegetation changes in six mountainous regions on the Tibetan Plateau. Particularly, we focused on the elevational movement of the vegetation greenness isoline to clarify whether the vegetation greenness isoline moves upward during the past three decades because of climate warming. Results show that vegetation greening occurred in all six mountainous regions during the last three decades. Increasing temperatures caused the upward movement of greenness isoline at the middle and high elevations (>4000 m) but led to the downward movement at lower elevations for the six mountainous regions except for Nyainqentanglha. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity of greenness isoline movement changes from the positive value to negative value by decreasing elevations, suggesting that vegetation growth on the plateau is strongly regulated by other factors such as water availability. As a result, the greenness isoline showed upward movement with the increase of temperature for about 59% pixels. Moreover, the greenness isoline movement increased with the slope angles over the six mountainous regions, suggesting the influence of terrain effects on the vegetation activities. Our analyses improve understandings of the diverse response of elevation-dependent vegetation activities on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - A pixel-based spectral matching method for mapping high-resolution irrigated areas using EVI time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A pixel-based spectral matching method using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from GaoFen-1 (GF-1) Satellite was developed based on spectral similarity value (SSV) and iterative thresholding to map irrigated areas for varying and scattered croplands at high resolution in order to improve understanding of dynamic irrigation pattern. The approach was tested in a typical irrigation district in Northwest China, resulting in 16-m irrigated area maps of the major crops (wheat and maize) for 2015-2018. The results showed an overall accuracy of 92.67% with a Kappa Coefficient of 0.89, producer's accuracy of 97.42%, and user's accuracy of 92.65% for the irrigated area. This method does not require a large number of ground-truth data as training samples, resulting in fast calculation speed, which is different from other supervised classification methods. After obtaining the standard spectrum of the study area, the irrigated areas can be continuously mapped for multi-years. Comparing with the existing global products, these high-resolution maps can depict small and fragmented irrigated croplands effectively with higher accuracy, which benefit local water management, food security analysis, and drought impact assessment, providing the prototype for the regions with fragmented croplands which requires high-resolution products.

TI  - Using Time Series Sentinel-1 Images for Object-Oriented Crop Classification in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of object-oriented crop classification using Sentinel-1 images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this study, two study areas (Keshan farm and Tongnan town) with different average plot sizes in Heilongjiang Province, China, were selected. The research time was two consecutive years (2018 and 2019), which were used to verify the robustness of the method. Sentinel-1 images of the crop growth period (May to September) in each study area were composited with three time intervals (10 d, 15 d and 30 d). Then, the composite images were segmented by simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) according to different sizes and finally, the training samples and processed images were input into a random forest classifier for crop classification. The results showed the following: (1) the overall accuracy of using the object-oriented classification method combined composite Sentinel-1 image represented a great improvement compared with the pixel-based classification method in areas with large average plots (increase by 10%), the applicable scope of the method depends on the plot size of the study area; (2) the shorter time interval of the composite Sentinel-1 image was, the higher the crop classification accuracy was; (3) the features with high importance of composite Sentinel-1 images with different time intervals were mainly distributed in July, August and September, which was mainly due to the large differences in crop growth in these months; and (4) the optimal segmentation size of crop classification was closely related to image resolution and plot size. Previous studies usually emphasize the advantages of object-oriented classification. Our research not only emphasizes the advantages of object-oriented classification but also analyzes the constraints of using object-oriented classification, which is very important for the follow-up research of crop classification using object-oriented and synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

TI  - Combination of Feature Selection and CatBoost for Prediction: The First Application to the Estimation of Aboveground Biomass
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing numbers of explanatory variables tend to result in information redundancy and "dimensional disaster" in the quantitative remote sensing of forest aboveground biomass (AGB). Feature selection of model factors is an effective method for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates. Machine learning algorithms are also widely used in AGB estimation, although little research has addressed the use of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) for AGB estimation. Both feature selection and regression for AGB estimation models are typically performed with the same machine learning algorithm, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is the best method. Therefore, the present study focuses on evaluating the performance of the CatBoost algorithm for AGB estimation and comparing the performance of different combinations of feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms. AGB estimation models of four forest types were developed based on Landsat OLI data using three feature selection methods (recursive feature elimination (RFE), variable selection using random forests (VSURF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)) and three machine learning algorithms (random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and categorical boosting (CatBoost)). Feature selection had a significant influence on AGB estimation. RFE preserved the most informative features for AGB estimation and was superior to VSURF and LASSO. In addition, CatBoost improved the accuracy of the AGB estimation models compared with RFR and XGBoost. AGB estimation models using RFE for feature selection and CatBoost as the regression algorithm achieved the highest accuracy, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 26.54 Mg/ha for coniferous forest, 24.67 Mg/ha for broad-leaved forest, 22.62 Mg/ha for mixed forests, and 25.77 Mg/ha for all forests. The combination of RFE and CatBoost had better performance than the VSURF-RFR combination in which random forests were used for both feature selection and regression, indicating that feature selection and regression performed by a single machine learning algorithm may not always ensure optimal AGB estimation. It is promising to extending the application of new machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods to improve the accuracy of AGB estimates.

TI  - Integrating Multiresolution and Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Imagery for Land-Cover Mapping in the Xiongan New Area, China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land use/land cover (LULC) mapping over a large area is essential to environmentally sustainable development. Recently, the Chinese government established a new national economic zone called the Xiongan New Area, and along with the upcoming large-scale urban construction, this area will inevitably experience a dramatic LULC change, which will threaten the local ecological balance. In this article, we proposed a two-stage approach for LULC mapping in the Xiongan New Area ahead of the forthcoming dense urban construction. The first stage is to obtain base-class maps through a supervised imagery classification. Specifically, we designed a new object-based framework consisting of automatic image segmentation, pixel-based probabilistic estimation, and area-weighted probability statistics for Sentinel-2 multiresolution imagery classification. The second stage is an LULC map refinement process in which the temporal features of each land use category are extracted to refine the LULC classification. Through the implementation of the proposed two-stage approach, an LULC map containing permanent water, temporal water, natural vegetation, barren land, built-up land, and cropland categories can be produced. Through an accuracy assessment, the proposed multiresolution imagery classification method achieved the highest overall accuracy of 88.58 and an average accuracy (AA) of 87.78 compared with conventional classification methods. After obtaining the refined LULC map, we find that the current Xiongan New Area is in a less developed state, that is, cropland accounts for the highest proportion of 51.59, which is followed by natural vegetation (22.38) and built-up land (15.69).

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations and Driving Forces of Harmful Algal Blooms in Chaohu Lake: A Multi-Source Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (hereafter HABs) pose significant threats to aquatic health and environmental safety. Although satellite remote sensing can monitor HABs at a large-scale, it is always a challenge to achieve both high spatial and high temporal resolution simultaneously with a single earth observation system (EOS) sensor, which is much needed for aquatic environment monitoring of inland lakes. This study proposes a multi-source remote sensing-based approach for HAB monitoring in Chaohu Lake, China, which integrates Terra/Aqua MODIS, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2A/B MSI to attain high temporal and spatial resolution observations. According to the absorption characteristics and fluorescence peaks of HABs on remote sensing reflectance, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithm for MODIS, the floating algae index (FAI) and NDVI combined algorithm for Landsat 8, and the NDVI and chlorophyll reflection peak intensity index (rho(chl)) algorithm for Sentinel-2A/B MSI are used to extract HAB. The accuracies of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), floating algae index (FAI), and chlorophyll reflection peak intensity index (rho(chl)) are 96.1%, 95.6%, and 93.8% with the RMSE values of 4.52, 2.43, 2.58 km(2), respectively. The combination of NDVI and rho(chl) can effectively avoid misidentification of water and algae mixed pixels. Results revealed that the HAB in Chaohu Lake breaks out from May to November; peaks in June, July, and August; and more frequently occurs in the western region. Analysis of the HAB's potential driving forces, including environmental and meteorological factors of temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours, and wind, indicated that higher temperatures and light rain favored this HAB. Wind is the primary factor in boosting the HAB's growth, and the variation of a HAB's surface in two days can reach up to 24.61%. Multi-source remote sensing provides higher observation frequency and more detailed spatial information on a HAB, particularly the HAB's long-short term changes in their area.

TI  - Cooling Effect of Different Land Cover Types: A Case Study in Xi'an and Xianyang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the climate problems caused by rapid urbanization is the urban heat island effect, which directly threatens the human survival environment. In general, some land cover types, such as vegetation and water, are generally considered to alleviate the urban heat island effect, because these landscapes can significantly reduce the temperature of the surrounding environment, known as the cold island effect. However, this phenomenon varies over different geographical locations, climates, and other environmental factors. Therefore, how to reasonably configure these land cover types with the cooling effect from the perspective of urban planning is a great challenge, and it is necessary to find the regularity of this effect by designing experiments in more cities. In this study, land cover (LC) classification and land surface temperature (LST) of Xi'an, Xianyang and its surrounding areas were obtained by Landsat-8 images. The land types with cooling effect were identified and their ideal configuration was discussed through grid analysis, distance analysis, landscape index analysis and correlation analysis. The results showed that an obvious cooling effect occurred in both woodland and water at different spatial scales. The cooling distance of woodland is 330 m, much more than that of water (180 m), but the land surface temperature around water decreased more than that around the woodland within the cooling distance. In the specific urban planning cases, woodland can be designed with a complex shape, high tree planting density and large planting areas while water bodies with large patch areas to cool the densely built-up areas. The results of this study have utility for researchers, urban planners and urban designers seeking how to efficiently and reasonably rearrange landscapes with cooling effect and in urban land design, which is of great significance to improve urban heat island problem.

TI  - Influence of spatiotemporal pattern changes of impervious surface of urban megaregion on thermal environment: A case study of the Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of urban megaregions has changed the regional thermal environment by raising the land surface temperature (LST) in a continuous area. The thermal environment problem in urban megaregions has become a research focus. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the LST and the external expansion and internal spatial patterns of impervious surfaces area (ISA) in Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The Landsat and MODIS data, as well as various geospatial approaches, including buffer-based zoning, impervious surface density gradients and landscape-based metrics statistics, were used to facilitate the analysis. We found that the areas of ISA increased from 1697.293 km(2) in 2000 to 9754.936 km(2) in 2015 in the GBA, expanding to the east, southeast and south. The mean LST increased by 7.41 degrees C and 10.23 degrees C in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. The internal density of ISA had increased significantly in the past 15 years. The highest ISA density and the highest LST appeared in the 15 km buffer zone closest to study area's center. And the LST was decreased by 0.15 degrees C for each 15 km increased in the distance to the study area's center. There was a significant strong positively correlation between the LST and the density of the ISA. The LST of the very-high-density area of the ISA was about 2.85 degrees C higher than that of the very-low-density area. The internal landscape pattern of ISA was strongly correlated with the LST. The study highlight that the center of urban megaregion had the larger ISA patches, which were simpler in shape, more aggregated and connected, and less fragmented seemed to exacerbate elevate in the LST in successive regions. In particular, the study found that the nighttime LST were affected by the environmental characteristics of urban megaregion. The correlation between the LST and the ISA was higher at daytime than at nighttime.

TI  - Climatological aspects of size-resolved column aerosol optical properties over a rural site in the southern peninsular India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the long-term (2008-2018) climatological characteristics of column aerosol optical properties from the Sky Radiometer at Gadanki (13.48 degrees N, 79.18 degrees E), a typical rural site in southern peninsular India. A method to separate the fine and coarse mode spectral aerosol optical properties was presented. The climatological aspects related to the diurnal, monthly, and intra-annual variations of observed aerosol optical properties exhibited both seasonal and spectral dependence. While the size-resolved aerosol optical depth (AOD), absorption aerosol optical depth, and asymmetry parameter exhibited a decreasing trend, single scattering albedo (SSA) showed an increasing trend from shorter to longer wavelengths in all seasons with distinct magnitudes. Seasonal asymmetry in the diurnal variation of AOD and Angstrom exponent was observed. Intra-annual variability clearly indicated distinct fine and coarse mode dominance during winter and monsoon, respectively, while mixed contributions were found in other seasons. This is attributed to the influence of prevailing air masses on the column aerosol properties. Annual mean SSA values indicated the dominance of moderately absorbing (0.91) to weakly absorbing (0.95) aerosols. On evaluating the size-resolved AOD (at 500 nm) with those from extended Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (SDA+), the observed differences are found to be remarkable for coarse mode AOD although the correlations for both fine and coarse AODs were observed to be 0.96. Lastly, the Dark Target and Deep Blue merged AOD (at 550 nm) from MODIS Terra/Aqua are evaluated to examine the consistency with ground measurements and both have shown a systematic underestimation with an increase in the magnitude of AOD strongly dependent on the seasons. These results form a basis for the comprehensive characterization of aerosol types and associated radiative impacts that are vital for understanding the regional climate change.

TI  - AgroShadow: A New Sentinel-2 Cloud Shadow Detection Tool for Precision Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing for precision agriculture has been strongly fostered by the launches of the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 optical imaging constellation, enabling both academic and private services for redirecting farmers towards a more productive and sustainable management of the agroecosystems. As well as the freely and open access policy adopted by the European Space Agency (ESA), software and tools are also available for data processing and deeper analysis. Nowadays, a bottleneck in this valuable chain is represented by the difficulty in shadow identification of Sentinel-2 data that, for precision agriculture applications, results in a tedious problem. To overcome the issue, we present a simplified tool, AgroShadow, to gain full advantage from Sentinel-2 products and solve the trade-off between omission errors of Sen2Cor (the algorithm used by the ESA) and commission errors of MAJA (the algorithm used by Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales/Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt, CNES/DLR). AgroShadow was tested and compared against Sen2Cor and MAJA in 33 Sentinel 2A-B scenes, covering the whole of 2020 and in 18 different scenarios of the whole Italian country at farming scale. AgroShadow returned the lowest error and the highest accuracy and F-score, while precision, recall, specificity, and false positive rates were always similar to the best scores which alternately were returned by Sen2Cor or MAJA.

TI  - Monitoring the Foliar Nutrients Status of Mango Using Spectroscopy-Based Spectral Indices and PLSR-Combined Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods of plant nutrient estimation for nutrient management need a huge number of leaf or tissue samples and extensive chemical analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive. Remote sensing is a viable tool to estimate the plant's nutritional status to determine the appropriate amounts of fertilizer inputs. The aim of the study was to use remote sensing to characterize the foliar nutrient status of mango through the development of spectral indices, multivariate analysis, chemometrics, and machine learning modeling of the spectral data. A spectral database within the 350-1050 nm wavelength range of the leaf samples and leaf nutrients were analyzed for the development of spectral indices and multivariate model development. The normalized difference and ratio spectral indices and multivariate models-partial least square regression (PLSR), principal component regression, and support vector regression (SVR) were ineffective in predicting any of the leaf nutrients. An approach of using PLSR-combined machine learning models was found to be the best to predict most of the nutrients. Based on the independent validation performance and summed ranks, the best performing models were cubist (R-2 >= 0.91, the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) >= 3.3, and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) >= 3.71) for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc, SVR (R-2 >= 0.88, RPD >= 2.73, RPIQ >= 3.31) for calcium, iron, copper, boron, and elastic net (R-2 >= 0.95, RPD >= 4.47, RPIQ >= 6.11) for magnesium and sulfur. The results of the study revealed the potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing data for non-destructive estimation of mango leaf macro- and micro-nutrients. The developed approach is suggested to be employed within operational retrieval workflows for precision management of mango orchard nutrients.

TI  - DETECTION OF LONG-TERM VEGETATION DEGRADATION IN BALUCHISTAN IN SOUTHWEST ASIA USING NDVI PRODUCTS OF THE MODIS SENSOR OF TERRA SATELLITE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed at investigating the long-term degradation of vegetation in Baluchistan in southwest Asia. To achieve the objective NDVI products of the MODIS sensor on Terra Satellite (MOD13A3) with spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km for a period of 16 years (2000-2015) were used. After obtaining images from the NASA land processes distributed active archive center, all images downloaded for the study area were mosaicked and referenced by Universal Transverse Mercator Project System and by using the nearest-neighbour re-sampling method. Then, on a pixel-based scale, the trend of long-term changes in vegetation was studied using the seasonal Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. The results show that 1.23% of the total area under study had a long-term decreasing trend in vegetation. Out of this 1.23%, 0.33% were significant at a probability level of alpha = 0.01, 0.24% was significant at a probability level of alpha = 0.05, and 0.12% were significant at a probability level of alpha = 0.1. The decreasing trend of 0.54% of them was not confirmed at any of the significant levels. Among the various types of vegetation, shrublands and croplands had the most significant long-term decreasing changes, which could be dangerous signs of ecotones degradation as well as weakening the sustainable rural livelihoods in this land.

TI  - Deep Learning with WASI Simulation Data for Estimating Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Concentration of Inland Water Bodies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies is essential for water monitoring. This study focuses on estimating chlorophyll a with remote sensing data, and machine learning (ML) approaches on the real-world SpecWa dataset. We adapt and apply a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) as a deep learning architecture for the first time to address this estimation. Since such a DL approach requires a large amount of data for its training, we rely on simulation data generated by the Water Color Simulator (WASI). This simulation is prepared accordingly and includes a knowledge-based water composition with two origins of the chlorophyll a concentration. Therefore, the training data is independent of the real-world SpecWa dataset, which is challenging for any ML approach. We define two spectral downsampling approaches as a pre-processing step, representing the hyperspectral EnMAP satellite mission (SR-EnMAP) and the multispectral Sentinel-2 mission (SR-Sentinel). Subsequently, we train a Random Forest, an artificial neural network, a band-ratio approach, and the 1D CNN on the WASI-generated simulation training dataset. Finally, all ML models are evaluated on the real SpecWa dataset. For both downsampled data, the 1D CNN outperforms the other ML models. On the finer resolved SR-EnMAP data it achieves an R-2=81.9%, RMSE=12.4 mu g L-1, and MAE=6.7 mu g L-1. Besides, the 1D CNN's performance decreases on the SR-Sentinel data to R-2=62.4%. When focusing on the individual water bodies of the SpecWa dataset, the most significant differences exist between natural and artificial water bodies. We discover that the applied models estimate the chlorophyll a concentration of most natural water bodies satisfyingly. In sum, the newly DL approach can estimate the chlorophyll a values of unknown inland water bodies successfully, although it is trained on an entire simulation dataset.

TI  - Carbon monoxide emissions assessment by using satellite and modeling data: Central Mexico case study
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper quantifies and reduces the differences in emissions from the 2008 inventory with respect to the real ones through the use of satellite observations and modeling. Carbon monoxide column comparisons from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite data were made against columns obtained from the WRF-Chem model, during February 2011. The analysis was carried out at the satellite passage local time (approximately 10:00 LT) over Mexico City. The 2008 National Emissions Inventory generated by the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources was utilized. An inversion method was applied to the modeled and observed column data. With the above, scaling factors were obtained for five regions and the concentration from the model domain boundaries, which were used to update the emissions. These were used in modeling and the result was compared with surface measurements. For Mexico City and the Metropolitan Area, a scaling factor equal to 0.43 was obtained when using the 2008 emissions inventory; for Toluca, Morelos and Puebla, a less than one factor was estimated, while for Hidalgo and the concentration from model boundaries it was close to two. The model performance was improved by an increment in the agreement index and a reduction on the mean square error when the updated CO emissions were used.

TI  - Landscape Similarity Analysis Using Texture Encoded Deep-Learning Features on Unclassified Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known for their ability to learn shape and texture descriptors useful for object detection, pattern recognition, and classification problems. Deeper layer filters of CNN generally learn global image information vital for whole-scene or object discrimination. In landscape pattern comparison, however, dense localized information encoded in shallow layers can contain discriminative information for characterizing changes across image local regions but are often lost in the deeper and non-spatial fully connected layers. Such localized features hold potential for identifying, as well as characterizing, process-pattern change across space and time. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective texture-based CNN (Tex-CNN) via a feature concatenation framework which results in capturing and learning texture descriptors. The traditional CNN architecture was adopted as a baseline for assessing the performance of Tex-CNN. We utilized 75% and 25% of the image data for model training and validation, respectively. To test the models' generalization, we used a separate set of imagery from the Aerial Imagery Dataset (AID) and Sentinel-2 for model development and independent validation. The classical CNN and the Tex-CNN classification accuracies in the AID were 91.67% and 96.33%, respectively. Tex-CNN accuracy was either on par with or outcompeted state-of-the-art methods. Independent validation on Sentinel-2 data had good performance for most scene types but had difficulty discriminating farm scenes, likely due to geometric generalization of discriminative features at the coarser scale. In both datasets, the Tex-CNN outperformed the classical CNN architecture. Using the Tex-CNN, gradient-based spatial attention maps (feature maps) which contain discriminative pattern information are extracted and subsequently employed for mapping landscape similarity. To enhance the discriminative capacity of the feature maps, we further perform spatial filtering, using PCA and select eigen maps with the top eigen values. We show that CNN feature maps provide descriptors capable of characterizing and quantifying landscape (dis)similarity. Using the feature maps histogram of oriented gradient vectors and computing their Earth Movers Distances, our method effectively identified similar landscape types with over 60% of target-reference scene comparisons showing smaller Earth Movers Distance (EMD) (e.g., 0.01), while different landscape types tended to show large EMD (e.g., 0.05) in the benchmark AID. We hope this proposal will inspire further research into the use of CNN layer feature maps in landscape similarity assessment, as well as in change detection.

TI  - From comprehensive field inventories to remotely sensed wall-to-wall stand attribute data - a brief history of management inventories in the Nordic countries
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest management inventories (FMIs) provide critical information, usually at the stand level, for forest management planning. A typical FMI includes (1) the delineation of the inventory area to stands by applying auxiliary information; (ii) the classification of the stands according to categorical attributes such as age, site fertility, main tree species, and stand development; and (iii) measurement, modelling, and prediction of stand attributes of interest. The emergence of wall-to-wall remote-sensing data has enabled a paradigm change in FMIs from highly subjective, visual assessments to objective, model-based inferences. Previously, optical remote-sensing data were used to complement visual assessments, especially in stand delineation and height measurements. The evolution of airborne laser scanning (ALS) has made objective estimation of forest characteristics with known accuracy possible. New optical and Lidar-based sensors and platforms will allow further improvements of accuracy. However, there are still bottlenecks related to species-specific stand attribute information in mixed stands and assessments of tree quality. Here, we concentrate on approaches and methods that have been applied in the Nordic countries in particular.

TI  - A Workflow Based on SNAP-StaMPS Open-Source Tools and GNSS Data for PSI-Based Ground Deformation Using Dual-Orbit Sentinel-1 Data: Accuracy Assessment with Error Propagation Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses a full interferometry processing chain based on dual-orbit Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B (S1) synthetic aperture radar data and a combination of open-source routines from the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), and additional routines introduced by the authors. These are used to provide vertical and East-West horizontal velocity maps over a study area in the south-western sector of the Po Plain (Italy) where land subsidence is recognized. The processing of long time series of displacements from a cluster of continuous global navigation satellite system stations is used to provide a global reference frame for line-of-sight-projected velocities and to validate velocity maps after the decomposition analysis. We thus introduce the main theoretical aspects related to error propagation analysis for the proposed methodology and provide the level of uncertainty of the validation analysis at relevant points. The combined SNAP-StaMPS workflow is shown to be a reliable tool for S1 data processing. Based on the validation procedure, the workflow allows decomposed velocity maps to be obtained with an accuracy of 2 mm/yr with expected uncertainty levels lower than 2 mm/yr. Slant-oriented and decomposed velocity maps provide new insights into the ground deformation phenomena that affect the study area arising from a combination of natural and anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Multidecadal analysis of beach loss at the major offshore sea turtle nesting islands in the northern Arabian Gulf
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Undocumented historical losses of sea turtle nesting beaches worldwide could overestimate the successes of conservation measures and misrepresent the actual status of the sea turtle population. In addition, the suitability of many sea turtle nesting sites continues to decline even without in-depth scientific studies of the extent of losses and impacts to the population. In this study, multidecadal changes in the outlines and area of Jana and Karan islands, major sea turtle nesting sites in the Arabian Gulf, were compared using available Kodak aerographic images, USGS EROS Declassified satellite imagery, and ESRI satellite images. A decrease of 5.1% and 1.7% of the area of Jana and Karan islands, respectively, were observed between 1965 and 2017. This translated to 14,146 m(2) of beach loss at Jana Is. and 16,376 m(2) of beach loss at Karan Is. There was an increase of island extent for Karan Is. from 1965 to 1968 by 9098 m(2) but comparing 2017 with 1968, Karan Is. lost as much as 25,474 m(2) or 2.6% of the island extent in 1968. The decrease in island aerial extent was attributed to loss of beach sand. The southern tips of the island lost the most significant amount of sand. There was also thinning of beach sand along the middle and northern sections that exposed the rock outcrops underneath the beach. The process of beach changes of both islands was tracked by the satellite imagery from Landsat 1,3,5,7 and Sentinel-2 during 1972 to 2020. Other factors including the distribution of beach slope, sea level changes, as well as wind & current from both northward and eastward components were analyzed to show its impact on the beach changes. The loss of beach sand could potentially impact the quality and availability of nesting beach for sea turtles utilizing the islands as main nesting grounds. Drivers of beach loss at the offshore islands are discussed in the context of sea level rise, dust storms, extreme wave heights and island desertification.

TI  - Investigation of Spatial and Temporal Distribution Characteristics of Global Aerosol Optical Depth from 2009 to 2018
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key factor for characterizing aerosol content and atmospheric pollution. In this study, level 2 aerosol profile products of the CALIPSO satellite were used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics and trends of AOD in specific regions worldwide from 2009 to 2018. Results show that AOD has a certain temporal and spatial difference in different areas. On the spatial scale, high AOD value centers are mainly distributed in India, Saudi Arabia, and other regions; moreover, on the temporal scale, noticeable seasonal differences exist. Specific regions such as India, Saudi Arabia, and northern China show peak AOD during the MAM and DJF periods, while Brazil peak during the JJA period. Moreover, significant AOD trend differences exist in each typical region, with the strongest upward trend in India.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Suspended Sediments in the Negro River, Amazon Basin, from In Situ and Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring suspended sediments through remote sensing data in black-water rivers is a challenge. Herein, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from in situ measurements and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images were used to estimate the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the largest black-water river of the Amazon basin. The Negro River exhibits extremely low R-rs values (<0.005 sr(-1) at visible and near-infrared bands) due to the elevated absorption of coloured dissolved organic matter (aCDOM at 440 nm > 7 m(-1)) caused by the high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC > 7 mg L-1) and low SSC (<5 mg L-1). Interannual variability of R-rs is primarily controlled by the input of suspended sediments from the Branco River, which is a clear water river that governs the changes in the apparent optical properties of the Negro River, even at distances that are greater than 90 km from its mouth. Better results were obtained using the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band (Band 4 at 665 nm) in order to estimate the SSC, with an R-2 value greater than 0.85 and an error less than 20% in the adjusted models. The magnitudes of water reflectance in the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band were consistent with in situ R-rs measurements, indicating the large spatial variability of the lower SSC values (0 to 15 mg L-1) in a complex anabranching reach of the Negro River. The in situ and satellite data analysed in this study indicates sedimentation processes in the lower Negro River near the Amazon River. The results suggest that the radiometric characteristics of sensors, like sentinel-2 MSI, are suitable for monitoring the suspended sediment concentration in large tropical black-water rivers.

TI  - Coastal Water Remote Sensing From Sentinel-2 Satellite Data Using Physical, Statistical, and Neural Network Retrieval Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent optical remote sensing satellite missions, such as Sentinel-2 with the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) onboard, allow the estimation of coastal water key parameters with very high spatial resolutions (down to 10 m). In this article, multiple approaches are proposed for retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts in Italy, using both empirical and model-based frameworks to design regressive and neural network (NN) estimation methods. The latter proves to be more accurate on a regional scale, where standard ocean color physical models exhibit high uncertainty in their local parameterization due to the complex spectral characteristics of the observed scene. Retrieval results are encouraging for Chl-a with a coefficient of determination ${R}<^>{2}$ up to 0.72 with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.33 mg $\text{m}<^>{-3}$ , using an empirical NN. The TSM algorithms exhibit higher uncertainty, mainly due to scarcity of <italic>in situ</italic> measurements and model parameterizations, with $R<^>{2}= 0.52$ and RMSE 1.95 g/m(3) using NNs. The bio-optical model, used for the development of model-based algorithms, shows some inadequacies in representing the inherent and apparent optical properties for the case study areas, especially considering the different spectral features between the oligotrophic Tyrrhenian Sea and the eutrophic Adriatic Sea. This study confirms the potential of Sentinel-2 MSI products for coastal water monitoring, but it also highlights key issues to be further tackled such as the atmospheric correction impact, the need of reliable <italic>in situ</italic> measurements, and possible bathymetry effects near the shores.

TI  - Intelligent Reflecting Surface Operation Under Predictable Receiver Mobility: A Continuous Time Propagation Model
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The operation of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) under predictable receiver mobility is investigated. We develop a continuous time system model for multipath channels and discuss the optimal IRS configuration with respect to received power, Doppler spread, and delay spread. It is shown that the received power can be maximized without adding Doppler spread to the system. In a numerical case study, we show that an IRS having the size of just two large billboards can improve the link budget of ground to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite links by up to 6dB. It also adds a second, almost equivalently strong, communication path that improves the link reliability.

TI  - Implementation of the NHI (Normalized Hot Spot Indices) Algorithm on Infrared ASTER Data: Results and Future Perspectives
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI) tool is a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-App developed to investigate and map worldwide volcanic thermal anomalies in daylight conditions, using shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near infrared (NIR) data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), respectively, onboard the Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 satellites. The NHI tool offers the possibility of ingesting data from other sensors. In this direction, we tested the NHI algorithm for the first time on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. In this study, we show the results of this preliminary implementation, achieved investigating the Kilauea (Hawaii, USA), Klyuchevskoy (Kamchatka; Russia), Shishaldin (Alaska; USA), and Telica (Nicaragua) thermal activities of March 2000-2008. We assessed the NHI detections through comparison with the ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA), the manual inspection of satellite imagery, and the information from volcanological reports. Results show that NHI integrated the AVA observations, with a percentage of unique thermal anomaly detections ranging between 8.8% (at Kilauea) and 100% (at Shishaldin). These results demonstrate the successful NHI exportability to ASTER data acquired before the failure of SWIR subsystem. The full ingestion of the ASTER data collection, available in GEE, within the NHI tool allows us to develop a suite of multi-platform satellite observations, including thermal anomaly products from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), which could support the investigation of active volcanoes from space, complementing information from other systems.

TI  - Utilization patterns and characteristics of users of biologic anti-inflammatory agents in a large, US commercially insured population
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY RESEARCH & PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - We report utilization patterns and characteristics of patients treated with biologic anti-inflammatory agents in a large commercially insured patient population in the United States. We identified adult (age >= 18 years) patients receiving biologic anti-inflammatory agents between 1 January 2012 and 31 March 2019 across the five Research Partners in the Biologic and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's Distributed Research Network. We examined the number of incident use episodes for each biologic, as well as patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Curated data and analytic tools from the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System were used to perform the analyses. We identified 90,360 incident episodes of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) and 70,506 incident episodes of non-TNFi medications. Adalimumab was the most common TNFi drug (47% of all TNFi episodes) and showed a steady increase in utilization during the study period compared to other TNFi agents. Rituximab was the most commonly initiated non-TNFi medication (44% of non-TNFi episodes). Other non-TNFi agents, namely, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and secukinumab, demonstrated notable increases in utilization over time. Biosimilar use was limited; we observed 653 incident episodes for infliximab-dyyb and 39 incident episodes for infliximab-abda. As more biologics enter the market, greater variation in the use of biologics with similar indications and between biologic originators and biosimilars is anticipated. Because information on efficacy and safety at the time of drug approval is limited, post-marketing surveillance and research is needed to monitor medication safety and evaluate effectiveness between biologic drugs using real-world data.

TI  - The SARSense Campaign: Air- and Space-Borne C- and L-Band SAR for the Analysis of Soil and Plant Parameters in Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the upcoming L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite mission Radar Observing System for Europe L-band SAR (ROSE-L) and its integration into existing C-band satellite missions such as Sentinel-1, multi-frequency SAR observations with high temporal and spatial resolution will become available. The SARSense campaign was conducted between June and August 2019 to investigate the potential for estimating soil and plant parameters at the agricultural test site in Selhausen (Germany). It included C- and L-band air- and space-borne observations accompanied by extensive in situ soil and plant sampling as well as unmanned aerial system (UAS) based multispectral and thermal infrared measurements. In this regard, we introduce a new publicly available SAR data set and present the first analysis of C- and L-band co- and cross-polarized backscattering signals regarding their sensitivity to soil and plant parameters. Results indicate that a multi-frequency approach is relevant to disentangle soil and plant contributions to the SAR signal and to identify specific scattering mechanisms associated with the characteristics of different crop type, especially for root crops and cereals.

TI  - Comparing land surface phenology of major European crops as derived from SAR and multispectral data of Sentinel-1 and-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent acquisitions of fine spatial resolution imagery (10 m) offered by recent multispectral satellite missions, including Sentinel-2, can resolve single agricultural fields and thus provide crop-specific phenology metrics, a crucial information for crop monitoring. However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the "Copernicus module" of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level.

TI  - Reclaimed-Airport Surface-Deformation Monitoring by Improved Permanent-Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar: A Case Study of Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, China
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclaimed airports usually have fragile geological structures and are susceptible to the uneven ground settlements caused by filling-material consolidation, underground construction, and dynamic loading from takeoff and landing of aircrafts. Therefore, deformation monitoring is of great significance to the safe operation of reclaimed airports. This study adopts an improved permanent-scatterer interferometric synthetic-aperture radar strategy to map the spatiotemporal deformation of Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport in China using ascending and descending Envisat/ASAR data acquired from 2007 to 2010 and Sentinel-1 data from 2015 to 2019. The results show that uneven settlements of the airport concentrate in the new reclaimed land. Then we explore the settlement characteristics of each functional area. Furthermore, we separate out the dynamic-load settlement of runway No. 2 and confirm the settlements caused by dynamic load. This study provides new ideas for studying deformation in similar fields, and technical references for the future construction of Shenzhen Airport.

AB  - We report a case of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer achieved a complete response(CR)to paclitaxel(PTX) and trastuzumab(HER) in combination with pertuzumab(PER) in 5th therapy. A 69-year-old woman was diagnosed left breast cancer and underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in January 2011. Pathological examination revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma that was ER 0%, PgR 0%, HER2(3+), Ki-67 67% and node negative. Two years after the operation, she found multiple lung metastases in both lungs. She was administered drug treatment as HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, but multiple lung metastases got worse after 4th treatment. Weekly PTX, trastuzumab and pertuzumab were administered as 5th therapy. After 2 months, lung metastases diminished significantly. After 44 courses of drug treatment, positron emission tomography computed tomography(PET-CT)scan revealed CR. She wanted to cease treatment, so she continues to get CT scan every half a year and the CR has been maintained.

This study aims at developing a multispectral empirical model useful in estimating the concentration of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometres (mu m) or less in diameter (PM2.5) on a city-wide scale using Landsat 8 satellite's data over the metropolis of Delhi, India. The data pertaining to PM2.5 mass concentration as well as meteorological parameters like relative humidity and temperature were taken from the field observation stations of the Central Pollution Control Board in New Delhi conform to the date of data collection from Landsat 8 satellite. The ambient reflectance in the visible spectrum bands was measured and compared with the in-situ concentration of PM2.5 and the meteorological evidence acquired from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The correlation coefficient and root mean square error value were utilized to analyse the feasibility of the algorithm proposed. It can be concluded from the results that the aforementioned multispectral PM2.5 model can predict particulate matter concentrations with an adequate level of accuracy.

TI  - Assimilation of coupled microwave/thermal infrared soil moisture profiles into a crop model for robust maize yield estimates over Southeast United States
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food security is one of the most pressing issues of the current century, particularly for developing nations. Agricultural simulation models can be a key component in testing new technologies, seeds and cultivars etc., however, inaccurate input information in addition to model related errors adds to model uncertainties. Satellite observations of soil moisture (SM), vegetation index etc. can be assimilated into crop models to reduce input and model related uncertainties. The goal of this study was to determine if assimilation of satellite-driven SM profiles can improve crop model yield estimations in a commonly used crop model while reducing the reliance on field management information at regional scales. Toward reaching this goal, this study utilized satellite derived microwave and thermal-infrared coupled SM profiles assimilated into a crop model via the Ensemble Kalman Filter over parts of the Southeastern United States from 2006 to 2010. The gridded Decision Support System for AgroTechnology Transfer (GriDSSAT) model was used to test and verify the SM profile assimilation methodology in two specific modes: (a) first using the best state-of-the art climate inputs available without data assimilation ("open-loop"); (b) then enhancing the open-loop model by assimilating into the model Remote sensing Driven SM Profile (RDSMP) data where available. The National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS) reported yield data at county levels were used for comparison and validation purposes. For non-irrigated regions, the GriDSSAT model simulation (rain-fed) showed an overall absolute error of nearly 36 % in comparison with the reported NASS yields, whereas the error in crop yields after data assimilation was only 29 %. Over irrigated counties, the GriDSSAT model simulation (irrigated) showed an error of nearly 24 % while using the data assimilation model simulation without irrigation information also showed overall error of similar to 23 %. Compared to the open-loop model simulation and improvement in simulated crop yields of nearly 2.5 times was found over irrigated regions (23 % vs 58 %).

TI  - An Assessment of Forest Cover Change and Its Driving Forces in the Syrian Coastal Region during a Period of Conflict, 2010 to 2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Syria, 76% of the forests are located in the Syrian coast region. This region is witnessing a rapid depletion of forest cover during the conflict that broke out in mid-2011. To date, there have been no studies providing accurate, reliable, and comprehensive data on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of forest change dynamics and the underlying drivers behind this change. In this study, changes in the dynamics of forest cover and its density between 2010 and 2020 were detected and analyzed using multi-temporal Landsat images. This study also analyzed the relationship between changes in forest cover and selected physical and socio-demographic variables associated with the drivers of change. The results revealed that the study area witnessed a significant decrease in the total forest area (31,116.0 ha, 24.3%) accompanied by a considerable decrease in density, as the area of dense forests decreased by 11,778.0 ha (9.2%) between 2010 and 2020. The change in forest cover was driven by a variety of different factors related to the conflict. The main drivers were changes in economic and social activities, extensive exploitation of forest resources, frequent forest fires, and weakness of state institutions in managing natural resources and environmental development. Forest loss was also linked to the expansion of cultivated area, increase in population and urban area. Fluctuating climatic conditions are not a major driver of forest cover dynamics in the study area. This decrease in forest area and density reflects sharp shifts in the natural environment during the study period. In the foreseeable future, it is not possible to determine whether the changes in forest cover and its density will be permanent or temporary. Monitoring changes in forest cover and understanding the driving forces behind this change provides quantitative and qualitative information to improve planning and decision-making. The results of this study may draw the attention of decision-makers to take immediate actions and identify areas of initial intervention to protect current the forests of the Syrian coast region from loss and degradation, as well as develop policies for the sustainable management of forest resources in the long term.

TI  - Variations in the Characteristics of Sea Waves in the Arctic Basin Caused by Climate Changes in the 21st Century Based on Model Simulations
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the characteristics of intensity of sea waves in the Arctic Basin has been performed using the WAVEWATCH III model and results of simulations of sea ice and wind in the atmosphere with the ensemble of the CMIP5 global climate models. An assessment is made of the relative role of wind waves and swell in the total intensity of sea waves in the Arctic based on the model simulations in comparison with those obtained using reanalysis and satellite data. Estimates of possible changes in sea waves accompanying a significant decrease in the extent of sea ice in the Arctic were obtained from model simulations for the 21st century under different scenarios of anthropogenic impacts. Peculiarities of various regimes of sea waves in the Arctic Basin were revealed with an assessment of the role of wind waves, swell, their interaction, and regimes of chaotic waves like choppy waves.

TI  - Embeddedness as a Differentiating Element of Indigenous Entrepreneurship: Insights from Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work aims to know the motives of why Indigenous entrepreneurs start companies, as well as how the characteristics of these groups influence the motives for company creation and determine entrepreneurial behavior. Through qualitative research, using interviews from five Indigenous entrepreneurs in Mexico, and the comparative case studies, this research identifies the motivators and characteristics of Indigenous entrepreneurs, as well as community embeddedness as an element of core business, without which company creation could not happen. The results show that embeddedness, identity, comunalidad (communal way of life), and worldview contribute positively to entrepreneurial project achievements, which also impact the community itself. Recommendations for different economic and social agents, concerning supporting the sustainability of Indigenous communities, and the protection of their culture and historical legacies, are derived from this study.

TI  - INJURY PREVENTION PROGRAMS BASED ON FLYWHEEL VS. BODY WEIGHT RESISTANCE IN RECREATIONAL ATHLETES
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the effect of an isoinertial flywheel technology vs. a traditional gravity-dependent exercise protocol on modifiable factors associated with the incidence of hamstring strain (HAM) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Furthermore, the effect on repeated sprint ability was also considered. Eighteen recreationally trained volleyball players completed one of the following 6-week protocols: (a) flywheel (FY) included 3 exercises using a YoYo isoinertial-squat machine and 3 exercises with a Versa-Pulley isoinertial device, and (b) gravity-dependent (GT) involved 6 similar exercises with no external resistance (participants' body weight). Both programs consisted in 2 sessions.wk(-1) performing 2 sets of 8 repetitions with 2 minutes of rest. Outcomes included a 10-second tuck jump assessment (TJA), landing knee valgus score, hamstring and quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokinetic 60 degrees.s(-1) peak torque, optimal peak torque localization, conventional and functional hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio, and 30-m repeated shuttle sprint ability (RSSA) test. FY improved TJA (-2, interquartile range [IQR] = -3 to -1) and valgus (-1, IQR = -1 to 0) scores, hamstring eccentric (20.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.27-31.47 N.m) and concentric (17.87, 95% CI = 0.40-35.34 N.m) peak torque, as well as the RSSA (-0.28, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.10 seconds), whereas GT only improved hamstring eccentric peak torque (21.41, 95% CI = 9.00-33.82 N.m). A 6-week protocol using flywheel technology seems to elicit better positive adaptations to protect athletes from HAM and ACL injuries and to enhance RSSA performance compared to exercising with no external resistance other than athletes' body weight.

TI  - Flow Velocity Change of David Glacier, East Antarctica, from 2016 to 2020 Observed by Sentinel-1A SAR Offset Tracking Method
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study measures the change of ice flow velocity of David Glacier, one of the fast-moving glaciers in East Antarctica that drains through Drygalski Ice Tongue. In order to effectively observe the rapid flow velocity, we applied the offset tracking technique to Sentinel-1A SAR images obtained from 2016 to 2020 with 36-day temporal baseline. The resulting velocity maps were averaged and the two relatively fast points (A1 and A2) were selected for further time-series analysis. The flow velocity increased during the Antarctic summer (around December to March) over the four years' observation period probably due to the ice surface melting and reduced friction on the ice bottom. Bedmap2 showed that the fast flow velocities at A1 and A2 are associated with a sharp decrease in the ice surface and bottom elevation so that ice volumetric cross-section narrows down and the crevasses are being created on the ice surface. The local maxima in standard deviation of ice velocity, S1 and S2, showed random temporal fluctuation due to the rotational ice swirls causing error in offset tracking method. It is suggested that more robust offset tracking method is necessary to incorporate rotational motion.

TI  - Recent fishing footprint of the high-seas bottom trawl fisheries on the Northwestern Hawaiian Ridge and Emperor Seamount Chain: A finer-scale approach to a large-scale issue
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A standing data gap for management of high-seas seamounts of the Northwestern Hawaiian Ridge and Emperor Seamounts (ES-NHR) by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission is the footprint of fisheries activities on these seamounts. Using satellite AIS data and the algorithms of the publicly available Global Fishing Watch database, a spatial map of trawling in a 0.01-degree latitude by 0.01-degree longitude square grid was created to review the data available to map this footprint. From 2012 to 2018 much of the trawling effort for all countries focused on Koko, Yuryaku, Kammu, and Colahan Seamounts at depths between 400 m (summits) and the depth limit currently set by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission of 1500 m. Additional seamounts with fishing activity included Annei (North Koko), Kinmei, Jingu, and Suiko. The remaining ES-NHR seamount locations show no trawling in those years. Bottom contact fishing was predominately carried out by ships with flag states of Japan and Korea. To date there appears to be compliance with the recent small-scale closures on C-H seamount and Koko.An additional source of data comes from scientific Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) surveys in 2014 and 2015 from three of these seamounts, in which scars from bottom contact gear are readily visible. These cover a smaller spatial area and depth range than the satellite data, but indicate the full footprint is not encompassed by the satellite data, suggesting either the fishing footprint is not fully captured by the AIS approach or that the footprint has shifted through time. AUV surveys also provide data on areas where abundant megafauna occur, which can provide candidate starting points for VME management efforts and further closures, similar to ones already in effect in the ES-NHR. The combination of satellite and AUV data provide a finer-scale fisheries footprint for this region that can aid in management of these sites.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution and High Temporal Frequency (30-m/15-day) Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation over China Using Multiple Remote Sensing Datasets: Method Development and Validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution and high temporal frequency fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products have been increasingly in demand to monitor and research land surface processes. This paper develops an algorithm to estimate FVC at a 30-m/15-day resolution over China by taking advantage of the spatial and temporal information from different types of sensors: the 30-m resolution sensor on the Chinese environment satellite (HJ-1) and the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The algorithm was implemented for each main vegetation class and each land cover type over China. First, the high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was acquired by using the continuous correction (CC) data assimilation method. Then, FVC was generated with a nonlinear pixel unmixing model. Model coefficients were obtained by statistical analysis of the MODIS NDVI. The proposed method was evaluated based on in situ FVC measurements and a global FVC product (GEOV1 FVC). Direct validation using in situ measurements at 97 sampling plots per half month in 2010 showed that the annual mean errors (MEs) of forest, cropland, and grassland were -0.025, 0.133, and 0.160, respectively, indicating that the FVCs derived from the proposed algorithm were consistent with ground measurements [R-2 = 0.809, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.065]. An intercomparison between the proposed FVC and GEOV1 FVC demonstrated that the two products had good spatial-temporal consistency and similar magnitude (RMSD approximates 0.1). Overall, the approach provides a new operational way to estimate high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency FVC from multiple remote sensing datasets.

TI  - Development of New Index-Based Methodology for Extraction of Built-Up Area From Landsat7 Imagery: Comparison of Performance With SVM, ANN, and Existing Indices
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By studying the spectral reflectance features of different land cover types and leveraging information of primarily "BLUE" band along with "RED" and "NIR" bands, this article seeks to introduce a new built-up index such as powered B1 built-up index (PB1BI). The proposed index, while being conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, can extract the built-up areas from Landsat7 satellite images efficiently. For Landsat7 satellite imagery, classification performances of the proposed index along with support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and three existing built-up indices have been examined for three study sites of 1 degrees Latitude x 1 degrees Longitude (approximate to 12 100 sq . km) area from three diverse geographical regions in India. The computed value of the M-Statistics for PB1BI is consistently greater than 1.80, indicating a better spectral separability between built-up and nonbuilt-up classes by the index. In order to improve the performance of the built-up indices, this article has suggested a bootstrapping method for threshold estimation in addition to the existing Otsu's method for the same. It has been found that using bootstrapping method instead of Otsu's method for threshold estimation has helped to improve the classification performance of built-up indices up to 17.75% and 40.49% in terms of overall accuracy and kappa (kappa) coefficient, respectively. It has been observed that for the validation set, average overall accuracy (97.45%) and kappa (kappa) coefficient (0.907) of PB1BI for considered study sites are not only significantly higher than existing indices but also comparable with the same of SVM (99.10% and 0.942) and ANN (87.24% and 0.450). This article has also shown that the proposed index provides a stable performance for multitemporal analysis of the study sites and is able to capture growth in built-up region in time horizon. The classification performance of PB1BI has also been verified for Landsat8 imagery across 11 study sites from different continents around the globe, and the results show overall accuracy and kappa to be consistently more than 90% and 0.75, respectively. For considered study sites, the reported values of average accuracy and kappa of PB1BI for built-up classification using Landsat8 satellite data are 95.7151% and 0.8843, respectively.

TI  - Genotype by environment interaction for fat and protein yields <i>via</i> reaction norms in Holstein cattle of southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the genetic merit of Holstein cattle population in southern Brazil in response to variations in the regional temperature by analyzing the genotype by environment interaction using reaction norms. Fat yield (FY) and protein yield (PY) data of 67 360 primiparous cows were obtained from the database of the Parana Holstein Breeders Association, Brazil (APCBRH). The regional average annual temperature was used as the environmental variable. A random regression model was adopted applying mixed models with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) algorithm using WOMBAT software. The genetic merit of the 15 most representative bulls, depending on the temperature gradient, was evaluated. Heritability ranged from 0.21 to 0.27 for FY and from 0.14 to 0.20 for PY. The genetic correlation observed among the environmental gradients proved to be higher than 0.80 for both traits. Slight reranking of bulls for both traits was detected, demonstrating that non-relevant genotype by environment interaction for FY and PY were observed. Consequently, no inclusion of the temperature effect in the model of genetic evaluation in southern Brazilian Holstein breed is required.

TI  - Land-Atmosphere Coupling Sensitivity to GCMs Resolution: A Multimodel Assessment of Local and Remote Processes in the Sahel Hot Spot
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-atmosphere interactions are often interpreted as local effects, whereby the soil state drives local atmospheric conditions and feedbacks originate. However, nonlocal mechanisms can significantly modulate land-atmosphere exchanges and coupling. We make use of GCMs at different resolutions (low similar to 1 degrees and high similar to 0.25 degrees) to separate the two contributions to coupling: better represented local processes versus the influence of improved large-scale circulation. We use a two-legged metric, complemented by a process-based assessment of four CMIP6 GCMs. Our results show that weakening, strengthening, and relocation of coupling hot spots occur at high resolution globally. The northward expansion of the Sahel hot spot, driven by nonlocal mechanisms, is the most notable change. The African easterly jet's horizontal wind shear is enhanced in JJA due to better resolved orography at high resolution. This effect, combined with enhanced easterly moisture flux, favors the development of African easterly waves over the Sahel. More precipitation and soil moisture recharge produce strengthening of the coupling, where evapotranspiration remains controlled by soil moisture, and weakening where evapotranspiration depends on atmospheric demand. In SON, the atmospheric influence is weaker, but soil memory helps to maintain the coupling between soil moisture and evapotranspiration and the relocation of the hot spot at high resolution. The multimodel agreement provides robust evidence that atmospheric dynamics determines the onset of land-atmosphere interactions, while the soil state modulates their duration. Comparison of precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration against satellite data reveals that the enhanced moistening at high resolution significantly reduces model biases, supporting the realism of the hot-spot relocation.

TI  - Map-based site-specific seeding of seed potato production by fusion of proximal and remote sensing data
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Uniform rate seeding (URS), adopted by the majority of farmers worldwide, is an inappropriate approach particularly in fields with large variability to optimize seeding rate that is crucial to manage farm resources sustainably. The objective of this study was to examine the potential of map-based site-specific seeding (SSS) of seed potato for improving crop yield and economic return. A 6-ha-field was scanned using an on-line visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy and an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor. Two SSS treatments were adopted based-on two types of management zone (MZ) maps, delineated with K-means clustering algorithm, and these were compared with the URS. The first treatment was based on a MZ map developed using EMI data (EMI-SSS), whereas the second treatment was based on fusion of vis-NIR measured soil data with Sentinel-2 derived normalized difference vegetation index (visNIRsen-SSS). Seed potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Hermes) were planted at 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 cm seed-to-seed spaces according to "Kings" principle i.e., sowing more seeds to the most fertile zones and vice-versa. Results showed that both SSS approaches have resulted in increased tuber yields (EMI-SSS: 32.42 t/ha, visNIRsen-SSS: 31.89 t/ha) and higher economic return, compared to URS. Although visNIRSen-SSS provided lower gross yield than EMI-SSS, the larger yield of small size (28-45 mm) tubers, having higher market price than other size categories has resulted in actual market price for the former being higher than that of the latter approach. The visNIRsen-SSS and EMI-SSS produced net returns of 4995 (sic)/ha and 4947 (sic)/ha, respectively, which were more than that of the URS of 4528 (sic)/ha, by 467 (sic)/ha and 419 (sic)/ha, respectively. In addition, visNIRsen-SSS approach has saved seeding costs by 14 (sic)/ha though EMI-SSS consumed 5 (sic)/ha more compared to URS. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt SSS (particularly visNIRsen-SSS) for seed potato production, as a means of increasing crop yield, reducing input cost and thus maximizing profitability compared to URS.

TI  - Preliminary Study on the Effect of an Early Physical Therapy Intervention after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: A Multicenter Non-Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) represents a minimally invasive surgery in patients with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the possible effect of an early physiotherapy intervention for the recovery of the upper limb and the surgical scars after SLNB in comparison with usual care. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in either the control group (n = 20) or the experimental group (n = 20). The intervention group performed an early physiotherapy program based on functional exercises, scar manual therapy, and educational tips. The control group received usual care. Shoulder range of motion (ROM), grip strength, upper limb pain and disability (SPADI), scar recovery (POSAS), myofascial adhesions (MAP-BC), quality of life (EORTCQLA-BR-23) and the presence of axillary web syndrome (AWS) and lymphoedema were assessed at baseline and immediately after intervention. A follow-up period of 6 months was performed for lymphoedema surveillance. Between groups significant differences in favor of the intervention were found for ROM (r = 0.43), grip strength (r = 0.32), SPADI (d = 0.45), POSAS (d = 1.28), MAP-BC (d = 1.82) and EORTCQLQ-BR 23 general function subscale (d = 0.37) (p < 0.05 for all variables). Our results suggest that an early physical therapy program seems to be more effective than usual care in women after SLNB. However, results should be interpreted with caution and future randomized trial with a larger sample size is needed.

TI  - Single-Pass Soil Moisture Retrieval Using GNSS-R at L1 and L5 Bands: Results from Airborne Experiment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has already proven its potential for retrieving a number of geophysical parameters, including soil moisture. However, single-pass GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval is still a challenge. This study presents a comparison of two different data sets acquired with the Microwave Interferometer Reflectometer (MIR), an airborne-based dual-band (L1/E1 and L5/E5a), multiconstellation (GPS and Galileo) GNSS-R instrument with two 19-element antenna arrays with four electronically steered beams each. The instrument was flown twice over the OzNet soil moisture monitoring network in southern New South Wales (Australia): the first flight was performed after a long period without rain, and the second one just after a rain event. In this work, the impact of surface roughness and vegetation attenuation in the reflectivity of the GNSS-R signal is assessed at both L1 and L5 bands. The work analyzes the reflectivity at different integration times, and finally, an artificial neural network is used to retrieve soil moisture from the reflectivity values. The algorithm is trained and compared to a 20-m resolution downscaled soil moisture estimate derived from SMOS soil moisture, Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, and ECMWF Land Surface Temperature.

TI  - An Analysis of Bare Soil Occurrence in Arable Croplands for Remote Sensing Topsoil Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A better comprehension of soil properties and processes permits a progress in agricultural management effectiveness, together with a diminution of environmental damage and more beneficial use of resources. This research investigated the usage of multispectral (Sentinel-2 MSI) satellite data at the farm/regional level, for the identification of agronomic bare soil presence, utilizing bands of the spectral range from visible to shortwave infrared. The research purpose was to assess the frequency of cloud-free bare soil time-series images available during the year in typical agricultural areas, needed for the development of digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches for agricultural applications, using hyperspectral satellite missions such as current PRISMA and the planned EnMAP or CHIME. The research exploited the Google Earth Engine platform, by processing all available cloud-free Sentinel-2 images throughout a time span of four years. Two main results were obtained: (i) bare soil frequency, indicating where and when a pixel (or an agricultural field) was detected as bare surface in three representative agricultural areas of Italy, and (ii) a temporal sensitivity analysis, providing the acquisition frequency of useful bare soil images applicable for the retrieval of soil variables of interest. It was shown that, in order to provide for an effective agricultural soil monitoring capability, a revisit frequency in the range of five to seven days is required, which is less than the planned specifications e.g., of PRISMA or CHIME hyperspectral missions, but could be addressed by combining data from the two sensors.

TI  - Roads in the Southwestern Amazon, State of Acre, between 2007 and 2019
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 40 years, roads have been the main driver behind the State of Acre's occupation and development. However, the expansion of roads, has often been associated with the advance of deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and social conflicts. There are no up-to-date data available on the current extent of Acre's road network nor its environmental and socioenvironmental impacts. In this study, we updated the State of Acre's road network map for the period 2007 to 2019 through the visual interpretation of 153 Landsat images (5, 7, and 8) at a scale of 1:50,000. To estimate the impact of roads, we measured the distribution of roads in municipalities and in different land tenure categories and calculated the correlation between roads and annual deforestation. Up to 2019, we estimated 19,620 km of roads, of which 92% were unofficial roads, 6% federal roads, and 2% state roads. The roads increased at an average annual rate of 590 km year(-1). The most significant advance in road length between 2007 and 2019 was in protected areas (240%), followed by public lands (68%) and settlement projects (66%). We recommend monitoring of the road network to understand the landscape's evolution and support actions against illicit environmental and socioenvironmental impacts.

TI  - Cosmos, Chaos and Order <i>Mapping as Knowing</i>
T2  - LEONARDO
M3  - Article
AB  - Observation and experiment are seen as the cornerstones of empirical science. Astronomy, an inherently observational science, affords a case study of a discipline in which controlled experiments cannot be performed. The author argues that in such disciplines maps and mapping serve to interpolate intellectually between observation and experiment. This is particularly noticeable in the early conceptions of cosmos and changes in worldview wherein major cognitive shifts are encoded in maps. With historical advances in map-making techniques, the epistemic purposes served by maps have also evolved significantly. Maps in astronomy today are deployed as powerful visual devices that record and transmute observational data to support theoretical ideas underpinning our current understanding of the cosmos. One example is dark matter maps, which offer compelling indirect evidence for the existence of the elusive dominant matter component that shapes our universe: dark matter.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on land use and land cover change in Guwahati city, India and its implication on declining groundwater level
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban environment continues to expand at an unprecedented rate to meet the demand of increasing population and economic development. The resulting changes to landscapes have increased stress to hydrological cycles, biogeochemical processes, and environmental sustainability of natural resources. This study evaluated spatio-temporal changes of land use and land cover (LULC) between 1990 and 2020 in Guwahati city, India. Time-series Landsat satellite images were analyzed using supervised classification schemes followed by quantification of LULC change over time. Five broad LULC classes were identified on the basis of spectral reflectance signature. Confusion matrix determined high classification accuracy with Kappa Coefficient >0.81 in all cases. The results showed that the urban built environment has doubled in area in 30 years (1990-2020). The urban environments have increased at the expense of vegetation, fallow land, and open areas and to some extent wetlands. Notably, the expansions of urban areas have taken place from city center to the south, to the southeast, and along the east-west National Highway 37 connecting other NE States of India. There is no clear indication of change in the amount of precipitation in response to urbanization. However, analysis of long-term groundwater level data suggests a steady decline in the depth to groundwater level. The declining trend is attributed to urbanization and population growth. The increase in impervious surface coverage due to urbanization have extensively reduced the areas of high potential groundwater recharge zones and thereby dropping the level of groundwater in the wells.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Soil Moisture in Mongolia Using SMAP and MODIS Satellite Data: A Time Series Model (2010-2025)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the essential variables of the water cycle, and plays a vital role in agriculture, water management, and land (drought) and vegetation cover change as well as climate change studies. The spatial distribution of soil moisture with high-resolution images in Mongolia has long been one of the essential issues in the remote sensing and agricultural community. In this research, we focused on the distribution of soil moisture and compared the monthly precipitation/temperature and crop yield from 2010 to 2020. In the present study, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used, including the MOD13A2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), MOD11A2 Land Surface Temperature (LST), and precipitation/temperature monthly data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) from 2010 to 2020 over Mongolia. Multiple linear regression methods have previously been used for soil moisture estimation, and in this study, the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Arima (ARIMA) model was used for soil moisture forecasting. The results show that the correlation was statistically significant between SM-MOD and soil moisture content (SMC) from the meteorological stations at different depths (p < 0.0001 at 0-20 cm and p < 0.005 at 0-50 cm). The correlation between SM-MOD and temperature, as represented by the correlation coefficient (r), was 0.80 and considered statistically significant (p < 0.0001). However, when SM-MOD was compared with the crop yield for each year (2010-2019), the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.84. The ARIMA (12, 1, 12) model was selected for the soil moisture time series analysis when predicting soil moisture from 2020 to 2025. The forecasting results are shown for the 95 percent confidence interval. The soil moisture estimation approach and model in our study can serve as a valuable tool for confident and convenient observations of agricultural drought for decision-makers and farmers in Mongolia.

TI  - Evaluation of atmospheric correction methods for low to high resolutions satellite remote sensing data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of atmospheric correction is to retrieve surface reflectance from the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. However, estimating surface reflectance from the TOA reflectance satellite data requires knowledge about the state of the atmosphere (e.g., water vapor and ozone) and the contribution of aerosols to the atmospheric path radiance. Thus, obtaining precise measurements of these parameters, which is very difficult, is crucial for accurate estimation of surface reflectance. The SREM (Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method) is a physical-based atmospheric correction method based on the Radiative transfer (RT) equations of the second simulation of the Satellite Signal in Solar Spectrum (6SV). Essentially the SREM is a simplified version of 6SV which does not require Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), aerosol type, water vapor, and ozone. An initial study showed accuracy comparable to the Landsat operational Surface Reflectance Products (SRProd) which is generated through different RT models using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data. To further validate the SREM under varying atmospheric conditions and at different spatial resolutions, an independent Reference Surface Reflectance (SRRef) dataset was generated using the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements as input to the 6SV RT model. The surface reflectances estimated by SREM (SRSREM) and SRProd from Planet Scope (PS, at 3 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 AB (S2AB) Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI, at 10 to 60 m spatial resolution), and Landsat-8 (L8) operational Land Imager (OLI, at 30 m spatial resolution) were validated against SRRef. Results showed that SRSREM performed similar to the SRProd of PS, S2AB MSI, and L8 OLI against SRRef. An inferior performance (R of 0.35 and 0.57) of L8 OLI's SRProd in the coastal blue (SB1) and blue (SB2) bands was observed, compared to SREM. The comparison of SRSREM with SRProd reveals the robustness of SREM, without using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data, for estimation of surface reflectance for all RT models tested. For some dates, SRRef and the SRProd under-corrected and produced higher values than the TOA reflectance, even when the atmosphere was clear but this was not the case for SREM. Analysis of surface reflectance estimation in shadowed areas revealed that the SRRef and SRProd had mainly negative values in coastal blue and blue bands for L8 OLI, while no negative SR value was observed for SREM in any band. These results recommend the utilization of SREM for the provision of surface reflectance products across a range of sensors

TI  - Methylene Blue and Proflavine as Intraarterial Marker for Functional Perforazome-Comparative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methylene blue (MB) is both a dye and a medicine known and used for a long time including as lymphatic tracer in melanoma and breast cancer for revealing sentinel lymph nodes. Proflavine (PRO) is an acriflavine dye, used as bacteriostatic disinfectant against many gram-positive bacteria that was also successfully applied to evaluate morphopathological changes in tissues. This study was performed on a group of twenty-eight Wistar rats and had as its main objective the in vivo evaluation of the use of MB and PRO as perforator tracers. The two dyes proved to be effective functional perforasome tracers with medium inflammatory infiltrate in the skin of the island perforator flap which heals perfectly at 14 days with complete absence of the inflammatory reaction. At the same injected amount, PRO seems to determine a greater inflammatory reaction compared with MB, but in smaller concentration, the inflammatory response is absent in the case of PRO. In conclusion, both substances tested within this in vivo study are good functional perforasome tracers, but PRO has the advantage of the absence of inflammatory reaction when using lower concentrations, while preserving unalerted its efficiency as tracer.

T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Young exoplanets can offer insight into the evolution of planetary atmospheres, compositions, and architectures. We present the discovery of the young planetary system TOI 451 (TIC 257605131, Gaia DR2 4844691297067063424). TOI 451 is a member of the 120 Myr old Pisces-Eridanus stream (Psc-Eri). We confirm membership in the stream with its kinematics, its lithium abundance, and the rotation and UV excesses of both TOI 451 and its wide-binary companion, TOI 451 B (itself likely an M-dwarf binary). We identified three candidate planets transiting in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data and followed up the signals with photometry from Spitzer and ground-based telescopes. The system comprises three validated planets at periods of 1.9, 9.2, and 16 days, with radii of 1.9, 3.1, and 4.1 R, respectively. The host star is near-solar mass with V = 11.0 and H = 9.3 and displays an infrared excess indicative of a debris disk. The planets offer excellent prospects for transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, providing the opportunity to study planetary atmospheres that may still be in the process of evolving.

TI  - Development of Machine Learning Models to Predict Compressed Sward Height in Walloon Pastures Based on Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Meteorological Data Using Multiple Data Transformations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about the available standing biomass on pastures is critical for the adequate management of grazing and its promotion to farmers. In this paper, machine learning models are developed to predict available biomass expressed as compressed sward height (CSH) from readily accessible meteorological, optical (Sentinel-2) and radar satellite data (Sentinel-1). This study assumed that combining heterogeneous data sources, data transformations and machine learning methods would improve the robustness and the accuracy of the developed models. A total of 72,795 records of CSH with a spatial positioning, collected in 2018 and 2019, were used and aggregated according to a pixel-like pattern. The resulting dataset was split into a training one with 11,625 pixellated records and an independent validation one with 4952 pixellated records. The models were trained with a 19-fold cross-validation. A wide range of performances was observed (with mean root mean square error (RMSE) of cross-validation ranging from 22.84 mm of CSH to infinite-like values), and the four best-performing models were a cubist, a glmnet, a neural network and a random forest. These models had an RMSE of independent validation lower than 20 mm of CSH at the pixel-level. To simulate the behavior of the model in a decision support system, performances at the paddock level were also studied. These were computed according to two scenarios: either the predictions were made at a sub-parcel level and then aggregated, or the data were aggregated at the parcel level and the predictions were made for these aggregated data. The results obtained in this study were more accurate than those found in the literature concerning pasture budgeting and grassland biomass evaluation. The training of the 124 models resulting from the described framework was part of the realization of a decision support system to help farmers in their daily decision making.

AB  - The Amazon is the largest expanse of tropical rainforest globally and deforestation resulting from land use changes poses a major concern for sustainable resource management. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have all-weather and all-day capability, and thus are well-suited for mapping land use land cover (LULC) in tropical regions, which are seasonally influenced by cloud cover. Understanding modified land uses and drivers of deforestation is fundamental for the development of policies and measures to reduce emissions and for developing forest reference levels. Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data present unprecedented potential since the observations are free and openly available, providing for the first regular and standardize SAR data. This study analyzes the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for LULC classification as an effort to differentiate modified land uses, which is a current need for early-warning deforestation systems. The study area covers a deforestation frontier in the Peruvian Amazon where the landscape is characterized by a mosaic of LULC types. Collect Earth Online is used for reference LULC data collection, and seven classes are defined for this study: forest, secondary vegetation, agriculture, pasture, urban, mining, water. Amplitude gamma(o) time-series spanning 2017-2019 are analyzed along with statistical metrics for each class, and a classification decision tree is developed in Google Earth Engine. Overall accuracy obtained is considered low (52%). Results show high user's accuracy for forest and water classification, a lot of confusion between agriculture, secondary vegetation, and forest, and the use of the polarization ratio VV/VH is suggested to be useful for pasture classification. The orientation of streets in a urban environment is confirmed to have high influence on backscattering response. This study provides information for future research on LULC and the identification of drivers in deforestation monitoring systems that could result in additional actionable information for decision-making.

TI  - Effects of Cropland Expansion on the Regional Land Surface Radiative Energy Balance and Heat Fluxes in Northern China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change can impact the land surface radiation budget and energy balance by changing surface biophysical processes. Based on satellite remote sensing data and land use data from 2000 to 2015, we quantitatively estimated radiative forcing induced by cropland expansion during the early 21st century in northern China. The results showed that heat flux from the land surface to the atmosphere due to cropland expansion was quite variable in different climate zones. The heat flux increased in humid North China, whereas it decreased in arid Northwest China, semiarid Inner Mongolia, and humid Northeast China. Cropland expansion from woodland areas led to a general decline in the land surface heat flux to the atmosphere, which led to a cooling effect on the climate. The surface heat flux to the atmosphere due to cropland expansion in grassland areas displayed significant variations in different climate zones. The surface heat flux decreased only in humid Northeast China and arid Northwest China. The net surface radiation and latent heat flux both increased when grasslands were changed into cropland, but to different extents, which produced the differences in the surface heat flux to the atmosphere between different zones.

TI  - Evaluation of SEBS, METRIC-EEFlux, and QWaterModel Actual Evapotranspiration for a Mediterranean Cropping System in Southern Italy
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) models with various levels of sophistication have emerged recently with the possibilities of user-defined model calibrations. Their application for water resources management and climate studies from regional to global scale has been rapidly increasing, which makes it important to validate field scale ET in a complex crop assemblage before operational use. Based on in situ flux-tower measurements by the eddy-covariance (EC) system, this study tested three single-source energy balance models for estimating daily ET from fennel/maize/ryegrass-clover cropland rotations in a Mediterranean context in southern Italy. The sensitivity of three user-friendly ET models (SEBS, QWaterModel, and METRIC-EEFlux) with reference to the EC system over a center pivot irrigated cropland is discussed in detail. Results in terms of statistical indicators revealed that SEBS and METRIC-EEFlux showed reasonable agreements with measured ET (r(2) = 0.59(SEBS), RMSE = 0.71 mm day(-1); r(2) = 0.65(METRIC), RMSE = 1.13 mm day(-1)) in terms of trends and magnitudes. At 30 m spatial resolution, both models were able to capture the in-field variations only during the maize development stage. The presence of spurious scan lines due to sensor defects in Landsat L7 ETM+ can contribute to the qualities of the METRIC-Efflux's ET product. In our observation, the QWaterModel did not perform well and showed the weakest congruency (r(2) = 0.08(QWaterModel)) with ground-based ET estimates. In a nutshell, the study evaluated these automated remote sensing-based ET estimations and suggested improvements in the context of a generic approach used in their underlying algorithm for robust ET retrievals in rotational cropland ecosystems.

TI  - Continuous Urban Tree Cover Mapping from Landsat Imagery in Bengaluru, India
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Percent tree cover maps derived from Landsat imagery provide a useful data source for monitoring changes in tree cover over time. Urban trees are a special group of trees outside forests (TOFs) and occur often as solitary trees, in roadside alleys and in small groups, exhibiting a wide range of crown shapes. Framed by house walls and with impervious surfaces as background and in the immediate neighborhood, they are difficult to assess from Landsat imagery with a 30 m pixel size. In fact, global maps based on Landsat partly failed to detect a considerable portion of urban trees. This study presents a neural network approach applied to the urban trees in the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India, resulting in a new map of estimated tree cover (MAE = 13.04%); this approach has the potential to also detect smaller trees within cities. Our model was trained with ground truth data from WorldView-3 very high resolution imagery, which allows to assess tree cover per pixel from 0% to 100%. The results of this study may be used to improve the accuracy of Landsat-based time series of tree cover in urban environments.

TI  - Downscaling of MODIS NDVI by Using a Convolutional Neural Network-Based Model with Higher Resolution SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple but powerful indicator, that can be used to observe green live vegetation efficiently. Since its introduction in the 1970s, NDVI has been used widely for land management, food security, and physical models. For these applications, acquiring NDVI in both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution is preferable. However, there is generally a trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution when using satellite images. To relieve this problem, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based downscaling model was proposed in this research. This model is capable of estimating 10-m high resolution NDVI from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 250-m resolution NDVI by using Sentinel-1 10-m resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. First, this downscaling model was trained to estimate Sentinel-2 10-m resolution NDVI from a combination of upscaled 250-m resolution Sentinel-2 NDVI and 10-m resolution Sentinel-1 SAR data, by using data acquired in 2019 in the target area. Then, the generality of this model was validated by applying it to test data acquired in 2020, with the result that the model predicted the NDVI with reasonable accuracy (MAE = 0.090, rho = 0.734 on average). Next, 250-m NDVI from MODIS data was used as input to confirm this model under conditions replicating an actual application case. Although there were mismatch in the original MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDVI data, the model predicted NDVI with acceptable accuracy (MAE = 0.108, rho = 0.650 on average). Finally, this model was applied to predict high spatial resolution NDVI using MODIS and Sentinel-1 data acquired in target area from 1 January 2020 similar to 31 December 2020. In this experiment, double cropping of cabbage, which was not observable at the original MODIS resolution, was observed by enhanced temporal resolution of high spatial resolution NDVI images (approximately x2.5). The proposed method enables the production of 10-m resolution NDVI data with acceptable accuracy when cloudless MODIS NDVI and Sentinel-1 SAR data is available, and can enhance the temporal resolution of high resolution 10-m NDVI data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics and Trend Analysis of Two Evapotranspiration-Based Drought Products and Their Mechanisms in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought severity still remains a serious concern across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to its destructive impact on multiple sectors of society. In this study, the interannual variability and trends in the changes of the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) based on the Penman-Monteith (scPDSI(PM)) and Thornthwaite (scPDSI(TH)) methods for measuring potential evapotranspiration (PET), precipitation (P), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies were investigated through statistical analysis of modeled and remote sensing data. It was shown that scPDSI(PM) and scPDSI(TH) differed in the representation of drought characteristics over SSA. The regional trend magnitudes of scPDSI in SSA were 0.69 (scPDSI(PM)) and 0.2 mm/decade (scPDSI(TH)), with a difference in values attributed to the choice of PET measuring method used. The scPDSI and remotely sensed-based anomalies of P and NDVI showed wetting and drying trends over the period 1980-2012 with coefficients of trend magnitudes of 0.12 mm/decade (0.002 mm/decade). The trend analysis showed increased drought events in the semi-arid and arid regions of SSA over the same period. A correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between the choice of PET measuring method and both P and NDVI anomalies for monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. The correlation analysis of the choice of PET measuring method with SST anomalies indicated significant positive and negative relationships. This study has demonstrated the applicability of multiple data sources for drought assessment and provides useful information for regional drought predictability and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Using Satellite Data to Analyse Raw Material Consumption in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we provide an innovative route for analysing urban expansion and population growth and their link to the consumption of construction materials by combining satellite data with material consumption analysis within the Hanoi Province (Vietnam). Urban expansion is investigated with the use of landcover maps for the period 1975-2020 derived from satellite. During this period, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas have increased by 11.6% and 15.5%, respectively, while forests have decreased by 26.7%. We have used publicly available datasets to calculate and forecast the construction materials consumption and measure its statistical correlation with urban expansion between 2007 and 2018. Our results show that official figures for sand consumption are currently underestimated, and that by 2030, steel and sand and gravel consumption will increase even further by three and two times, respectively. Our analysis uses a new method to assess urban development and associated impacts by combining socio-economic and Earth Observation datasets. The analysis can provide evidence, underpin decision-making by authorities, policymakers, urban planners and sustainability experts, as well as support the development of informed strategies for resource consumption. It can also provide important information for identifying areas of land conservation and ecological greenways during urban planning.

TI  - Damage Proxy Map (DPM) of the 2016 Gyeongju and 2017 Pohang Earthquakes Using Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The M-L 5.8 earthquake shocked Gyeongju, Korea, at 11:32:55 UTC on September 12, 2016. One year later, on the afternoon of November 15, 2017, the M-L 5.4 earthquake occurred in Pohang, South Korea. The earthquakes injured many residents, damaged buildings, and affected the economy of Gyeongju and Pohang. The damage proxy maps (DPMs) were generated from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery by comparing pre- and co-events interferometric coherences to identify anomalous changes that indicate damaged by the earthquakes. DPMs manage to detect coherence loss in residential and commercial areas in both Gyeongju and Pohang earthquakes. We found that our results show a good correlation with the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) report with Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale values of more than VII (seven). The color scale of Sentinel-1 DPMs indicates an increasingly significant change in the area covered by the pixel, delineating collapsed walls and roofs from the official report. The resulting maps can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage after the Gyeongju and Pohang earthquakes and can also be used as inventory data of damaged buildings to map seismic vulnerability using machine learning in Gyeongju or Pohang.

TI  - LINGUOCULTURAL SPECIFITY OF PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS IN THE PROCESS OF TEACHING LANGUAGES
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In modern linguistics, there is a great interest in the analysis of linguistic and cultural material in the process of teaching languages, an anthropocentric paradigm is formed, the language is considered not only within its communicative and cognitive function, but as a kind of cultural code of individual linguistic and cultural communities. The purpose of this scientific article is to study the manifestation of linguistic and cultural worldview and to study the linguistic and cultural aspect of learning English through phraseological level units. The study of the conceptual structure allows us to identify deeper and more significant properties of an object or phenomenon. Such properties represent generalized features of an object or phenomenon that are considered the most important and necessary for their identification, since the features of an object or phenomenon form the structure of the concept. The object of this scientific article is phraseological units that express the concepts of the inner world of a person, the specifics of their functioning and interpretation in the English language, and aspects of their use in the process of teaching English. All the subtleties of a nation's culture are reflected in its language, which is specific and unique since it captures the world and the person in it in different ways (BUYANOVA, 1998). "Therefore, the problem of the relationship between language and culture occupies one of the Central places in the problems of research conducted in the field of linguoculturology and cognitive science.". Linguoculturology is the branch of linguistics that emerged at the intersection of linguistics and cultural studies and exploring the manifestations of the culture of the people, which were reflected and fixed in the language (VERESHCHAGIN, 1982).

TI  - Global Spatial and Temporal Variation of the Combined Effect of Aerosol and Water Vapour on Solar Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to calculate the combined and individual effects of the optical thickness of aerosols (AOT) and precipitable water vapour (PWV) on the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface at a global scale and to analyse its spatial and temporal variation. For that purpose, a novel but validated methodology is applied to CERES SYN1deg products for the period 2000-2019. Spatial distributions of AOT and PWV effects, both individually and combined, show a close link with the spatial distributions of AOT and PWV. The spatially averaged combined effect results in a -13.9% reduction in irradiance, while the average AOT effect is -2.3%, and the PWV effect is -12.1%. The temporal analysis focuses on detecting trends in the anomalies. The results show overall positive trends for AOT and PWV. Consequently, significant negative overall trends are found for the effects. However, significant positive trends for the individual AOT and the combined AOT-PWV effects are found in specific regions, such as the eastern United States, Europe or Asia, indicating successful emission control policies in these areas. This study contributes to a better understanding of the individual and combined effects of aerosols and water vapour on solar radiation at a global scale.

TI  - Implementation of Non-Linear Non-Parametric Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and Its Robustness for Displacement Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To derive surface displacement, interferometric stacking with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is commonly used, and this technique is now in the implementation phase in the real world. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is one of the most universal approaches among in- terferometric stacking techniques, and non-linear non-parametric PSI (NN-PSI) was proposed to overcome the drawbacks of PSI approaches. The estimation of the non-linear displacements was successfully conducted using NN-PSI. However, the estimation of NN-PSI is not always stable with certain displacements because wider range of the velocity spectrum is used in NN-PSI than the conventional approaches; therefore, a calculation procedure and parameter optimization are needed to consider. In this paper, optimized parameters and procedures of NN-PSI are proposed, and real data processing with Sentinel-1 in the Kanto region in Japan was conducted. We confirmed that the displacement estimation was comparable to the measurement of the permanent global positioning system (GPS) stations, and the root mean square error between the GPS measurement and NN-PSI estimation was less than 3 mm in two years. The displacement over 2 pi ambiguity, which the conventional PSI approach wrongly reconstructed, was also quantitatively validated and successfully estimated by NN-PSI. As a result of the real data processing, periodical displacements were also reconstructed through NN-PSI. We concluded that the NN-PSI approach with the proposed parameters and method enabled the estimation of several types of surface displacements that conventional PSI approaches could not reconstruct.

TI  - Using sentinel-2 satellite imagery to develop microphytobenthos-based water quality indices in estuaries
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Microphytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (52) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User's and Producer's accuracies, which corresponded to 94% and 84% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 52 images from over a full year, 28% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, 52 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters.

TI  - Land Subsidence and Its Relations with Sinkhole Activity in Karapinar Region, Turkey: A Multi-Sensor InSAR Time Series Study
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karapinar basin, located in the Central Anatolian part of Turkey, is subjected to land subsidence and sinkhole activity due to extensive groundwater withdrawal that began in the early 2000s. In this study, we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and groundwater level data to monitor and better understand the relations between groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sinkhole formation in the Karapinar basin. The main observations used in the study are InSAR-derived subsidence velocity maps calculated from both Sentinel-1 (2014-2018) and COSMO-SkyMed (2016-2017) SAR data. Our analysis reveals broad areas of subsidence with rates exceeding 70 mm/yr. The InSAR-derived subsidence was compared with GNSS data acquired by a continuously operating GNSS station located in the study area, which show a similar rate of subsidence. The temporal characteristic of both InSAR and GNSS time series indicate a long-term subsidence signal superimposed by seasonal variability, which follows the overall groundwater level changes, with over 80% cross-correlation consistency. Our results also indicate that sinkhole activity is limited to slow subsidence areas, reflecting strong cohesion of near-surface rock layers that resist subsidence but yield to collapse in response to aquifer system deformation induced by groundwater extraction.

TI  - New Insight on Soil Loss Estimation in the Northwestern Region of the Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil loss is one of the most important causes of land degradation. It is an inevitable environmental and socio-economic problem that exists in many physiographic regions of the world, which, besides other impacts, has a direct bearing on agricultural productivity. A reliable estimate of soil loss is critical for designing and implementing any mitigation measures. We applied the widely used Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in the Khabur River Basin (KhRB) within the NW part of the Zagros Fold and Thrust Belt (ZFTB). The areas such as the NW Zagros range, characterized by rugged topography, steep slope, high rainfall, and sparse vegetation, are most susceptible to soil erosion. We used the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), and Landsat imagery to estimate annual soil loss using the RUSLE model. In addition, we estimated sediment yield (SY) at sub-basin scale, in the KhRB where a number of dams are planned, and where basic studies on soil erosion are lacking. Estimation of SY will be useful in mitigation of excessive sedimentation affecting dam performance and watershed management in this region. We determined the average annual soil loss and the SY in the KhRB to be 11.16 t.ha(-1).y(-1) and 57.79 t.ha(-1).y(-1), respectively. The rainfall and runoff erosivity (R factor), slope length (L factor), and slope steepness (S factor), are the three main factors controlling soil loss in the region. This is the first study to determine soil loss at the sub-basin scale along with identifying suitable locations for check dams to trap the sediment before it enters downstream reservoirs. The study provides valuable input data for design of the dams to prevent excessive siltation. This study also aims at offering a new approach in relating potential soil erosion to the actual erosion and hypsometric integrals.

TI  - Data Validation and Mesoscale Assimilation of <i>Himawari-8</i> Optimal Cloud Analysis Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 optimal cloud analysis (OCA), which employs all 16 channels of the Advanced Himawari Imager, provides cloud properties such as cloud phase, top pressure, optical thickness, effective radius, and water path. By using OCA, the water vapor distribution can be inferred with high spatiotemporal resolution and with a wide coverage, including over the ocean, which can be useful for improving initial states for prediction of the torrential rainfalls that occur frequently in Japan. OCA products were first evaluated by comparing them with different kinds of datasets (surface, sonde, and ceilometer observations) and with model outputs, to determine their data characteristics. Overall, OCA data were consistent with observations of water clouds with moderate optical thicknesses at low to midlevels. Next, pseudorelative humidity data were derived from the OCA products, and utilized in assimilation experiments of a few heavy rainfall cases, conducted with the Japan Meteorological Agency's nonhydrostatic model-based Variational Data Assimilation System. Assimilation of OCA pseudorelative humidities caused there to be significant differences in the initial conditions of water vapor fields compared to the control, especially where OCA clouds were detected, and their influence lasted relatively long in terms of forecast hours. Impacts of assimilation on other variables, such as wind speed, were also seen. When the OCA data successfully represented low-level inflows from over the ocean, they positively impacted precipitation forecasts at extended forecast times.

TI  - From Boolean Valued Analysis to Quantum Set Theory: Mathematical Worldview of Gaisi Takeuti
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaisi Takeuti introduced Boolean valued analysis around 1974 to provide systematic applications of the Boolean valued models of set theory to analysis. Later, his methods were further developed by his followers, leading to solving several open problems in analysis and algebra. Using the methods of Boolean valued analysis, he further stepped forward to construct set theory that is based on quantum logic, as the first step to construct "quantum mathematics", a mathematics based on quantum logic. While it is known that the distributive law does not apply to quantum logic, and the equality axiom turns out not to hold in quantum set theory, he showed that the real numbers in quantum set theory are in one-to-one correspondence with the self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, or equivalently the physical quantities of the corresponding quantum system. As quantum logic is intrinsic and empirical, the results of the quantum set theory can be experimentally verified by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we analyze Takeuti's mathematical world view underlying his program from two perspectives: set theoretical foundations of modern mathematics and extending the notion of sets to multi-valued logic. We outlook the present status of his program, and envisage the further development of the program, by which we would be able to take a huge step forward toward unraveling the mysteries of quantum mechanics that have persisted for many years.

TI  - Impact of lake surface changes on climate fluctuation within a lake-affected region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are one of the most important aquatic ecosystems that are vulnerable to various factors, including human activity or natural events such as drought. Remote sensing technology is an effective technique for managing and monitoring changes in these ecosystems caused by natural events and human activities. The present study evaluated the effects of changes at Bakhtegan Lake on six climatic parameters in its surrounding environments. Landsat satellite imagery was used to monitor changes in the Bakhtegan Lake surface during times of maximum extent in the period from 2000 to 2015. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was applied to extract the characteristics of the lake surface. Then, the distance of 80 km from the lakeshore was identified as the environment of its influence on the surrounding land, which was divided into three buffers from 0 to 25, 26-55 and 56-80 km. The results showed that a higher accuracy than the index for extracting lake area was achieved using the SVM classification method. Additionally, the climate parameters of mean annual precipitation, relative humidity, and percentage of cloud cover significantly influenced (0.001) lake surface changes in buffer one, indicating the highest impact among all climatic parameters. In buffer two, the significance level of the precipitation parameter decreased to about 0.05, and the annual mean minimum temperature was significantly lower (0.05); however, the mean annual minimum and maximum temperatures were not significant

TI  - Can Subjective Perceptions of Trauma Differentiate Between ICD-11 PTSD and Complex PTSD? A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Three African Countries
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The primary aim of the current study was to establish the cutoffs scores for the Subjective Traumatic Outlook (STO), a relatively new tool that examines the introspective worldview of those exposed to traumatic events. This tool was developed as a complementary scale to be used in conjunction with the observed-phenomenological measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complex PTSD (CPTSD). The present study examines the predictive power of STO for distinguishing between PTSD and CPTSD in African countries. Method: A national representative (based on age and gender) sample of 2,554 participants was drawn from 3 African countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana) who completed the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and the STO. We conducted a set of analyses examining that alignment of ITQ probable PTSD and CPTSD and different STO cutoff scores. Results: Results suggest that the STO single-factor structure was stable across countries, had a strong association with PTSD and CPTSD levels, and had predictive utility in differentiating between PTSD and CPTSD. Moreover, we found that there are different cutoffs for the STO in the different countries. Conclusion: There is a strong but distinctive association between the introspective and the observed-phenomenological approaches of PTSD and CPTSD. Our findings call for more integrative approaches for the assessment of PTSD and CPTSD and suggest that there are cultural differences in STO.

TI  - Relationship between MODIS Derived NDVI and Yield of Cereals for Selected European Countries
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the relationships between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained based on MODIS satellite data and grain yield of all cereals, wheat and barley at a country level were analyzed. The analysis was performed by using data from 2010-2018 for 20 European countries, where percentage of cereals is high (at least 35% of the arable land). The analysis was performed for each country separately and for all of the collected data together. The relationships between NDVI and cumulative NDVI (cNDVI) were analyzed by using linear regression. Relationships between NDVI in early spring and grain yield of cereals were very strong for Croatia, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia. This means that the yield prediction for these countries can be as far back as 4 months before the harvest. The increase of NDVI in early spring was related to the increase of grain yield by about 0.5-1.6 t/ha. The cumulative of averaged NDVI gives more stable prediction of grain yield per season. For France and Belgium, the relationships between NDVI and grain yield were very weak.

TI  - Application of Deep Learning for Speckle Removal in GOCI Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration Images (2012-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and removal of erroneous pixels is a critical pre-processing step in producing chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration values to adequately understand the bio-physical oceanic process using optical satellite data. Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) chl-a images revealed that numerous speckle noises with enormously high and low values were randomly scattered throughout the seas around the Korean Peninsula as well as in the Northwest Pacific. Most of the previous methods used to remove abnormal chl-a concentrations have focused on inhomogeneity in spatial features, which still frequently produce problematic values. Herein, a scheme was developed to detect and eliminate chl-a speckles as well as erroneous pixels near the boundary of clouds; for the purpose, a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm was applied to a large-sized GOCI database from the 6-year period of 2012-2017. The input data of the proposed DNN model were composed of the GOCI level-2 remote-sensing reflectance of each band, chl-a concentration image, median filtered, and monthly climatology chl-a image. The quality of the individual images as well as the monthly composites of chl-a data was improved remarkably after the DNN speckle-removal procedure. The quantitative analyses showed that the DNN algorithm achieved high classification accuracy with regard to the detection of error pixels with both very high and very low chl-a values, and better performance compared to the general arithmetic algorithms of the median filter and threshold scheme. This implies that the implemented method can be useful for investigating not only the short-term variations based on hourly chl-a data but also long-term variabilities with composite products of the GOCI chl-a concentration over the span of a decade.

TI  - Estimation of mass and energy balance of glaciers using a distributed energy balance model over the Chandra river basin (Western Himalaya)
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing glacier shrinking in the Himalayan region causes a significant threat to freshwater sustainability and associated future runoff. However, data on the spatial climatic contribution of glacier retreat is scanty in this region. To investigate the spatially distributed glacier surface energy and mass fluxes, a two-dimensional mass balance model was developed and applied to the selected glaciers of the Chandra basin, in the Upper Indus Basin, Western Himalaya. This model is driven by the remote sensing data and meteorological variables measured in the vicinity of the Chandra basin for six hydrological years (October 2013 to September 2019). The modelled variables were calibrated/validated with the in-situ observation from the Himansh station in the Chandra basin. We have derived air temperature (T-a) spatially using the multivariate statistical approach, which indicates a relative error of 0.02-0.05 degrees C with the observed data. Additionally, the relative error between the modelled and observed radiation fluxes was a(-1) for the six hydrological years. Results illustrated that the mean surface melt rate of the selected glaciers ranged from -5.1 to -2.5 m w.e. a(-1) that lies between 4500 and 5000 m a.s.l. The study revealed that the net radiation (R-N) contributes ~75% in total energy (F-M) during the melt season while sensible heat (H-S), latent heat (H-l), and ground heat (H-G) fluxes shared 15%, 8%, and 2%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the energy balance components suggested that the mass balance is highly sensitive to albedo and surface radiations in the study area. Overall, the proposed model performed well for glacier-wide energy and mass balance estimation and confirms the utility of remote sensing data, which may help in reducing data scarcity in the upper reaches of the Himalayan region.

TI  - i am keeping my cultural hat on: exploring a `culture-enabling' philosophy for/with children practice
T2  - CHILDHOOD AND PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I offer a preliminary sketch of a culture-enabling Philosophy for/with Children practice. It is an approach to engaging philosophically with children that aims to encourage the exercise of critical reflection at the level of their respective cultures. This kind of P4wC practice hopes to address the challenges in facilitating philosophical dialogues with culturally/ethnically-diverse groups, especially when prejudice and negative stereotypes towards cultural/ethnic minorities are prevalent. Its focus is on helping children become cognizant of their cultural situatedness and its impact on their thinking and attitude towards dialogue. Underlying this practice is the assumption that Philosophy is fundamentally a worldview and a method that is embedded in the culture where it is created, validated, and used. Such a manner of doing philosophy recognizes that children are active bearers of culture and are entitled to educational opportunities, like P4wC, that can empower them to think for themselves and with others while staying grounded in their cultural backgrounds. Thus, the community of inquiry functions as a caring space where intercultural understanding and critical affirmation of cultures are fostered and sustained. In connection, I suggest that a culture-enabling P4wC teacher should have three desired traits: a) openness to various cultural resources and frames, b) a sense of critical positionality, and c) partiality to the culturally marginalized.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes over 1973-2017 period in peripheral Delhi were mapped based on digital classification of satellite data and their driving forces ascertained. Urban area expanded and agricultural area diminished at annual rates of 38.6% and 2.1%, respectively, during the 1973-2017 period. Urban expansion occurred more in scrub and sparse vegetation areas than in cultivated lands or ponds. Loss of cultivated land happened mostly due to abandonment of cropping and tree planting in farmhouses developed by the urban elites. Improvement in the state of forests in terms of their expansion as well as densification offsets their loss due to urbanisation, encroachment and logging. The increment in the green cover was due to strict enforcement of compensatory afforestation/forest conservation law, growing demand of ecotourism, emergence of tree-clad farmhouses and increased environmental awareness and surveillance. This research will help in comprehending policies favouring sustainable urban development.

TI  - Cross-Sectional Study on the Prevalence and Factors Influencing Occurrence of Tick-Borne Encephalitis in Horses in Lithuania
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various animal species have been evaluated in depth for their potential as Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) sentinel species, although evidence for equine capacity is incomplete. Therefore, a comprehensive cross-sectional stratified serosurvey and PCR analysis of selected horses (n = 301) were performed in TBEV endemic localities in Lithuania. Attached and moving ticks (n = 241) have been collected from aforementioned hosts to evaluate natural infectivity of TBEV vectors (Ixodes spp.) in the recreational environments surrounding equestrian centers. All samples were screened for TBEV IgG and positive samples were confirmed by virus neutralization test (VNT). 113 (37.5%) horses from all counties of Lithuania tested positive for TBEV IgG, revealing age and sex indifferent results of equine seroprevalence that were significantly dependent on pedigree: horses of mixed breed were more susceptible to infection possibly due to their management practices. TBEV prevalence in equine species corresponded to TBEV-confirmed human cases in the precedent year. As much as 3.9% of horses were viraemic with TBEV-RNA with subsequent confirmation of TBEV European subtype. 4/38 of tested tick pools were positive for TBEV-RNA (Minimal infectious rate 1.2%). Several unknown microfoci were revealed during the study indicating areas of extreme risk close to popular human entertainment sites. The study provides important evidence in favor of horses' usage as sentinel species, as equines could provide more detailed epidemiological mapping of TBEV, as well as more efficient collection of ticks for surveillance studies.

TI  - An Efficient Multi-stage Object-Based Classification to Extract Urban Building Footprints from HR Satellite Images
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban building information can be effectively extracted by applying object-based image segmentation and multi-stage thresholding on High Resolution (HR) remote sensing satellite imageries. This study provides the results obtained using this method on the images of Indian remote sensing satellite, CARTOSAT-2S launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). In this study, a method is developed to extract urban building footprints from the HR remote sensing satellite images. The first step of the process consists of generating highly dense per pixel Digital Surface Model (DSM) by using semi global matching algorithm on HR satellite stereo images and applying robust ground filtering to generate Digital Terrain Model (DTM). In the second step, multi-stage object-based approach is adopted to extract building bases using the PAN sharpened image, normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) derived from DSM and DTM, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results are compared with the manual method of drawing building footprints by cartographers. An average precision of 0.930, recall of 0.917, and f-score of 0.922 are obtained. The results are found to be in a match with the method using the high resolution Airborne LiDAR DSM by providing a solution for large areas, low cost and low time.

TI  - Improvement of the plasmapause location model based on LANL satellite
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the electron density data measured by the RBSP-A satellite in strong magnetic storms and moderate magnetic storms, an error test is carried out on the dynamic analytical model of the plasmapause location newly constructed by Goldstein et al. in 2019. It is found that there is a large error between the model calculation results and observation data in the dayside area, especially the plume, and the average error reaches 32. 31%). To improve the error situation of the model, we use LANL satellite data to analyze 14 moderate magnetic storms between 1998 and 2006. The plasmapause location in the plume region was counted. The results show that with the change of the magnetic storm period (-12 h <= T-epoch <= 4 h), the plume region will have a westward drift when approaching the peak of the magnetic storm, and then contract rapidly and drift east after the peak. In view of this phenomenon, we modify the model in this period into four parts. The average error of the improved model in the plume region has decreased from 27. 34% to 20. 2% , and the accuracy has been improved by 26%. The model calculation results obtained are more in line with satellite observations.

TI  - Environmental constraints to net primary productivity at northern latitudes: A study across scales of radiation interception and biomass production of potato
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (Ipar, MJ m(-2) d(-1)) is a key biophysical variable governing plant photosynthetic rate and net primary productivity (NPP, g m(-2) d(-1)). Under optimal growth conditions, Ipar scales proportionally to NPP by a factor termed 'optimum radiation use efficiency' (RUEopt). The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) considers temperature and moisture constraints to RUEopt and has been widely used in remote sensing studies to estimate productivity of various ecosystems. However, scale effects on the CASA have not been sufficiently investigated nor quantified. In this study, data at scales of field (Rapidscan reflectance data), air- (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery) and spaceborne (Sentinel-2 imagery), as well as for several environmental constraints, were utilized to develop and test the CASA. The test plant was potato grown for multiple years on sandy soils in Denmark. The results showed that data from all scales provided comparable estimates of daily fraction of Ipar (f(Ipar)) and Ipar. Maximum air temperature and diffuse radiation were the most important environmental factors constraining RUEopt of potato. Taking these into account considerably improved the prediction of NPP with the CASA (R-2 increase of 25-32 % compared to no constraints), whereas stress effects due to soil moisture and vapor pressure deficits were less important (relative improvement in R-2 of 2-3 %). Hence, RUEopt was 4.66, 4.19 and 4.98 g MJ(-1) for Rapidscan, UAV and Sentinel-2, respectively, which was about 47 %-59 % higher than the estimates of the observed actual radiation use efficiency. This study offers an operational method for deriving RUEopt at plant species level since remote sensing and meteorological data are both readily available, and demonstrates that environmental constraints of the CASA does vary, depending on the study region. The method can be used to predict dry matter production in-season for other crops as well, with potential for extending the approach to determine fertilization and irrigation demands.

TI  - Surface Velocity Analysis of Surge Region of Karayaylak Glacier from 2014 to 2020 in the Pamir Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The west branch of Karayaylak Glacier (eastern Pamir Plateau) surged in May 2015, significantly impacting on local socio-economic development. This event was also of great significance for studies of surging glaciers. Using Sentinel-1 imagery analyzed by offset tracking, based on normalized cross-correlation (NCC), and with the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we quantified the ice surface velocity of the west branch and terminus of Karayaylak Glacier from 13 October 2014 to 17 October 2020. Sentinel-1 images were acquired at intervals of 12 or 24 days. We also used a three-dimensional (3-D) laser scanner to measure the velocity of 3 ablation stakes and 56 feature points in the study region from 15 August to 6 October 2015, for the purpose of accuracy assessment. We set up an automatic meteorological station to record the air temperature in the same period and combined this with data from Tashkurgan meteorological station from 1957 to 2015. Analysis of this dataset provided insights into the glacier surge mechanism, with the following conclusions. (1) Surface velocity of the west branch and terminus of Karayaylak Glacier increased sharply after October 2014. The velocity then dropped significantly in the two months after the surge, and stayed at low values for nearly a year. After 2017, the velocity was slightly higher than in the previous period. (2) The surge event occurred from 11 April to 17 May 2015; the average surface velocity in this phase attained 2395 m a(-1) with a maximum velocity of 4265 m a(-1) at the west branch terminus. (3) From 2017 to 2020, the velocity showed periodic annual changes. (4) Based on the meteorological data analysis, we conclude that this surge resulted from the interaction between thermal and hydrological control mechanisms. Simultaneously, we demonstrate the high potential of the GEE platform and Sentinel-1 data to extract glacier surface velocity.

TI  - Rainfall patterns and geomorphological controls driving inundation frequency in tropical wetlands: How does the Pantanal flood?
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands. The spatial and temporal variability of flooded areas is a key factor for preserving and managing the flora and fauna of this biodiversity hotspot, and thus, its dynamic is crucial to maintain ecosystem services. However, existing inventories of flooded areas with high spatial resolution are scarce or do not represent a continuous time series considering the entire Pantanal wetland. In this study, flooded areas were derived from Landsat and Resourcesat satellite imagery time series for the years 2000 to 2020 through big data analytical tools. Our results show that permanently flooded areas accounted for 3.40% of the total Pantanal wetland and 8.85% of the study area was flooded during only one year, indicating a complex and dynamic fluvial system. In addition, approximately 39% of the basin was composed of non-flooded areas. During the analyzed period (2000-2020), the highest flood event occurred in 2011 covering an area of 57,969 km(2), followed by 2014, with 52,500 km(2) (respectively 38.55% and 34.91% of the total area of the Pantanal). The year with the smallest flooded area was 2020 (10,668 km(2)), 83% lower when compared to the period-based average. The Pantanal is a seasonal wetland, thus, rainfall plays a significant role in the flood pulse, accounting for approximately 60% of the total variability of the flooded areas. The flood dynamics is also affected by the morphology of the modern depositional system of the Pantanal, which is composed by large megafans created by several distributive rivers, and by neotectonics that generates differential movements of blocks creating lower areas that will determine how flood pulse moves spatially and temporally. Therefore, the understanding and analysis of this dynamism becomes an indispensable tool for the public government ordering defining policies for the occupation and the economic zoning of the Pantanal.

TI  - Contrasting long term temporal trends in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in eggs of the northern gannet (<i>Morus bassanus</i>) from two UK colonies
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared long-term (1977 to 2014) trends in concentrations of PFAS in eggs of the marine sentinel species, the Northern gannet (Morus bassanus), from the Irish Sea (Ailsa Craig) and the North Sea (Bass Rock). Concentrations of eight perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were determined and we report the first dataset on PFAS in UK seabirds before and after the PFOS ban. There were no significant differences in Sigma PFAS or Sigma PFSAs between both colonies. The Sigma PFSAs dominated the PFAS profile (>80%); PFOS accounted for the majority of the PFSAs (98-99%). In contrast, Sigma PFCAs concentrations were slightly but significantly higher in eggs from Ailsa Craig than in those from Bass Rock. The most abundant PFCAs were perfluorotridecanoate (PFTriDA) and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnA) which, together with PFOA, comprised around 90% of the Sigma PFCAs.The Sigma PFSAs and Sigma PFCAs had very different temporal trends. Sigma PFSAs concentrations in eggs from both colonies increased significantly in the earlier part of the study but later declined significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the phasing out of PFOS production in the 2000s. In contrast, SPFCAs concentrations in eggs were constant and low in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting minimal environmental contamination, but residues subsequently increased significantly in both colonies until the end of the study. This increase appeared driven by rises in long chain compounds, namely the odd chain numbered PFTriDA and PFUnA. PFOA, had a very different temporal trend from the other dominant acids, with an earlier rise in concentrations followed by a decline in the last 15 years in Ailsa Craig; later temporal trends in Bass Rock eggs were unclear.Although eggs from both colonies contained relatively low concentrations of PFAS, the majority had PFOS residues that exceeded a suggested Predicted No Effect Concentration and similar to 10% of the eggs exceeded a suggested Lowest-Observable-Adverse-Effect.

TI  - Green LAI Mapping and Cloud Gap-Filling Using Gaussian Process Regression in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last decade, Gaussian process regression (GPR) proved to be a competitive machine learning regression algorithm for Earth observation applications, with attractive unique properties such as band relevance ranking and uncertainty estimates. More recently, GPR also proved to be a proficient time series processor to fill up gaps in optical imagery, typically due to cloud cover. This makes GPR perfectly suited for large-scale spatiotemporal processing of satellite imageries into cloud-free products of biophysical variables. With the advent of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, new opportunities emerged to process local-to-planetary scale satellite data using advanced machine learning techniques and convert them into gap-filled vegetation properties products. However, GPR is not yet part of the GEE ecosystem. To circumvent this limitation, this work proposes a general adaptation of GPR formulation to parallel processing framework and its integration into GEE. To demonstrate the functioning and utility of the developed workflow, a GPR model predicting green leaf area index (LAIG) from Sentinel-2 imagery was imported. Although by running this GPR model into GEE any corner of the world can be mapped into LAIG at a resolution of 20 m, here we show some demonstration cases over western Europe with zoom-ins over Spain. Thanks to the computational power of GEE, the mapping takes place on-the-fly. Additionally, a GPR-based gap filling strategy based on pre-optimized kernel hyperparameters is also put forward for the generation of multi-orbit cloud-free LAIG maps with an unprecedented level of detail, and the extraction of regularly-sampled LAIG time series at a pixel level. The ability to plugin a locally-trained GPR model into the GEE framework and its instant processing opens up a new paradigm of remote sensing image processing.

TI  - Radionuclide-guided sentinel lymph node mapping in urachal cancer
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Urachal cancer gives metastases through the lymph nodes (LNs). No lymphadenectomy scheme in the case of this cancer exist, yet it is proposed as a staging procedure. An assessment of lymphatic outflow from the tumor site with the use of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphangiography is possible for staging purposes.Objectives. To perform the mapping of the LNs draining the lymph from urachal cancer with the use of radioisotope-based technique and to propose the lymphadenectomy template in case of urachal cancer.Material and methods. A prospective study was conducted in 5 patients with urachal cancer. The 99m-technetiu m (Tc-99m)-nanocolloid was injected during a cystoscopy prior to the surgery. Lymphangiography was performed using SPECT/CT. A radioactive LNs analysis with the use of a hand-held gamma-ray detection probe was conducted during the surgery and the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedure was performed. An additional lymphadenectomy containing the lymphatic basin of identified radioactive LNs was performed.Results. In all cases lymphatic outflow from the urachal tumor to the LNs was present. Preoperative SPECT/CT allowed detecting the activity of the radiotracer in the common iliac region in all the studied patients. In 3 cases, bilateral lymphatic outflow, and in 2 cases, unilateral lymphatic outflow was observed. All preoperatively visualized LNs were found and excised with the use of a gamma-ray detection probe during a lymphadenectomy. In all cases, SLN5 did not contain metastases.Conclusions. Mapping of the LNs draining the lymph from urachal cancer with the use of radiotracer is possible. Lymphatic outflow in the case of this cancer can be both unilateral and bilateral. No recommendations about the extension of lymphadenectomy are proposed. We recommend individual assessment and treatment based on additional knowledge about lymphatic outflow. This allows for minimally invasive yet targeted treatment as an SLN basin lymphadenectomy.

TI  - A Proposal of Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning for Medical Purposes: An Application Case
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Learning tasks are implemented via mappings of the sampled data set, including both the classical and the quantum framework. Biomedical data characterizing complex diseases such as cancer typically require an algorithmic support for clinical decisions, especially for early stage tumors that typify breast cancer patients, which are still controllable in a therapeutic and surgical way. Our case study consists of the prediction during the pre-operative stage of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients resulting in a negative diagnosis after clinical and radiological exams. The classifier adopted to establish a baseline is characterized by the result invariance for the order permutation of the input features, and it exploits stratifications in the training procedure. The quantum one mimics support vector machine mapping in a high-dimensional feature space, yielded by encoding into qubits, while being characterized by complexity. Feature selection is exploited to study the performances associated with a low number of features, thus implemented in a feasible time. Wide variations in sensitivity and specificity are observed in the selected optimal classifiers during cross-validations for both classification system types, with an easier detection of negative or positive cases depending on the choice between the two training schemes. Clinical practice is still far from being reached, even if the flexible structure of quantum-inspired classifier circuits guarantees further developments to rule interactions among features: this preliminary study is solely intended to provide an overview of the particular tree tensor network scheme in a simplified version adopting just product states, as well as to introduce typical machine learning procedures consisting of feature selection and classifier performance evaluation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background The presence of ulceration has been recognized as an adverse prognostic factor in primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM).Objectives To investigate whether the extent of ulceration (EoU) predicts relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in PCM.Materials and methods We retrieved data for 477 patients with ulcerated PCM from databases of the Italian Melanoma Intergroup. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the independent prognostic impact of EoU.Results A significant interaction emerged between Breslow thickness (BT) and EoU, considering both RFS (P < 0 center dot 0001) and OS (P = 0 center dot 0006). At multivariable analysis, a significant negative impact of EoU on RFS [hazard ratio (HR) (1-mm increase) 1 center dot 26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 center dot 08-1 center dot 48, P = 0 center dot 0047] and OS [HR (1-mm increase) 1 center dot 25, 95% CI 1 center dot 05-1 center dot 48, P = 0 center dot 0120] was found in patients with BT <= 2 mm, after adjusting for BT, age, tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, sentinel lymph node status and mitotic rate. No impact of EoU was found in patients with 2 center dot 01-4 mm and > 4 mm BT.Conclusions This study demonstrates that EoU has an independent prognostic impact in PCM and should be recorded as a required element in pathology reports.

TI  - Mapping global forest canopy height through integration of GEDI and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent, large-scale operational monitoring of forest height is essential for estimating forest-related carbon emissions, analyzing forest degradation, and quantifying the effectiveness of forest restoration initiatives. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument onboard the International Space Station has been collecting unique data on vegetation structure since April 2019. Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R-2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R-2 = 0.61). The demonstrated integration of GEDI data with time-series optical imagery is expected to enable multidecadal historic analysis and operational forward monitoring of forest height and its dynamics. Such capability is important to support global climate and sustainable development initiatives.

TI  - Molecular detection of gastrointestinal pathogens among children under 5 years old with diarrhea in a hospital center for rotavirus sentinel surveillance in Chile
T2  - REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Infectious diarrhea is still a major problem in public health, especially in children under 5 years of age. The identification of the etiologic agent is important for the clinical management of the diarrhea episode and, from the epidemiological point of view, to implement control measures. Aim: To determine the presence of gastrointestinal pathogens in children under five years of age with diarrhea in a Chilean rotavirus surveillance center. Methods: Observational study in children under five years of age who were hospitalized for diarrhea at the Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna Hospital from December 2015 to December 2019. Molecular detection was performed using the FilmArray gastrointestinal (FilmArray GI (R)) panel. Results: We analyzed 493 diarrheal stool samples of children, 427 samples (87%) were positive and 66 samples (13%) were negative. Of positive samples, 174 samples (41%) and 253 samples (59%) were positive for one or more pathogen, respectively. In children under one year and the group between one and four years there was a predominance of infections caused by enteric virus. Rotavirus and norovirus were the most common virus in both age groups. The most frequent bacteria were EPEC (27%), C. difficile (17%), EAEC (14%) and Campylobacter (9%). In parasites, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium were identified, in 3% and 1% of the total samples, respectively. Conclusions: The molecular detection system used allowed an increase in the detection of enteropathogens in children under five years of age. The information generated by this type of surveillance could help to characterize the episodes of diarrhea in the population and might be a tool to technically advise the authorities in the decision-making process for the implementation of control measures.

TI  - Assessment of Landsat Based Deep-Learning Membership Analysis for Development of <i>from</i>-<i>to</i> Change Time Series in the Prairie Region of Canada from 1984 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prairie region of Canada is a dynamically changing landscape in relation to past and present anthropogenic activities and recent climate change. Improving our understanding of the rate, timing, and distribution of landscape change is needed to determine the impact on wildlife populations and biodiversity, ultimately leading to better-informed management regarding requirements for habitat amount and its connectedness. In this research, we assessed the viability of an approach to detect from-to class changes designed to be scalable to the prairie region with the capacity for local refinement. It employed a deep-learning convolutional neural network to model general land covers and examined class memberships to identify land-cover conversions. For this implementation, eight land-cover categories were derived from the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory. Change was assessed in three study areas that contained different mixes of grassland, pasture, and forest cover. Results showed that the deep-learning method produced the highest accuracy across all classes relative to an implementation of random forest that included some first-order texture measures. Overall accuracy was 4% greater with the deep-learning classifier and class accuracies were more balanced. Evaluation of change accuracy suggested good performance for many conversions such as grassland to crop, forest to crop, water to dryland covers, and most bare/developed-related changes. Changes involving pasture with grassland or cropland were more difficult to detect due to spectral confusion among classes. Similarly, conversion to forests in some cases was poorly detected due to gradual and subtle change characteristics combined with confusion between forest, shrub, and croplands. The proposed framework involved several processing steps that can be explored to enhance the thematic content and accuracy for large regional implementation. Evaluation for understanding connectivity in natural land covers and related declines in species at risk is planned for future research.

TI  - Estimation of sea ice parameters using an assimilated sea ice model with a variable drag formulation
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, sea ice concentrations in the regions of Baffin Bay, Hudson Bay, the Labrador Sea and the Gulf of St. Lawrence were estimated using a standalone regional configuration of Los Alamos Sea ice Model, CICE. A sensitivity analysis of the mixed layer depth criteria that affects the predicted sea ice formation/ablation has been carried out to tune the model. Sea ice concentration from AMSR2 OSISAF, sea ice edge from SSMIS/ASCAT OSISAF, and sea surface temperature from OISST AVHRR-only products were then assimilated into the tuned model using a combined optimal interpolation method. Extending previous studies, which used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation schemes, we use a variable drag formulation to represent the friction associated with effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice-atmosphere and ice-ocean interfaces. The variable drag coefficient is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as the ice concentration, the vertical extent and area of the ridges, the freeboard, the floe draft, the size of floes and melt ponds. The new features of the assimilated model include tracers to estimate ridged ice, level ice, melt ponds, freeboard, sail height and keel depth. The estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are then compared with the ice concentration product from the Canadian Ice Service. The results show that the updates provided to the tracers through the assimilation of sea ice products are reasonable and the model estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are better than the non-assimilated model estimates. Finally, the estimates of updated sea ice parameters such as ridged ice area, volume and ice thickness are compared with the estimates from non-assimilated models and the literature to verify the results.

TI  - Machine Learning Classification of Mediterranean Forest Habitats in Google Earth Engine Based on Seasonal Sentinel-2 Time-Series and Input Image Composition Optimisation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of natural heritage is presently considered a global strategic issue. Owing to the ever-growing availability of free data and software, remote sensing (RS) techniques have been primarily used to map, analyse, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. The need to adopt multi-scale and multi-temporal approaches to detect different phenological aspects of different vegetation types and species has also emerged. The time-series composite image approach allows for capturing much of the spectral variability, but presents some criticalities (e.g., time-consuming research, downloading data, and the required storage space). To overcome these issues, the Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proposed, a free cloud-based computational platform that allows users to access and process remotely sensed data at petabyte scales. The application was tested in a natural protected area in Calabria (South Italy), which is particularly representative of the Mediterranean mountain forest environment. In the research, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were used to perform supervised pixel-based classification based on the use of Sentinel-2 images. A process to select the best input image (seasonal composition strategies, statistical operators, band composition, and derived vegetation indices (VIs) information) for classification was implemented. A set of accuracy indicators, including overall accuracy (OA) and multi-class F-score (F-m), were computed to assess the results of the different classifications. GEE proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for the classification process. The best results (OA = 0.88 and F-m = 0.88) were achieved using RF with the summer image composite, adding three VIs (NDVI, EVI, and NBR) to the Sentinel-2 bands. SVM and RF produced OAs of 0.83 and 0.80, respectively.

TI  - RELIGIOUS EPIDEMICS ON THE TERRITORY OF UKRAINE: HISTORICAL PARALLELS AND ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with two religious epidemics that unfolded in Ukraine in a span of one hundred years. The study analyzes the factors influencing the emergence and development of religious epidemics. On this basis, their peculiar algorithm has been singled out, the components of which are, on the one hand, the worldview and crisis of values caused by the rapid turns of history, and-on the other--choosiness by God, charisma of the leader of a particular organization, which is "fed" by an eschatological idea, syncretic teachings, which are cultivated as an alternative religious model to established traditions. The definition of a religious epidemic is given, which, arising on the wave of a crisis of social changes and acquiring a mass character, causes a change in human identity, in which imitation, self-suggestion and mutual suggestion play a significant role.

TI  - Deep Learning of Sea Surface Temperature Patterns to Identify Ocean Extremes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed an out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis of similar to 12,000,000 semi-independent 128 x 128 pixel2 sea surface temperature (SST) regions, which we define as cutouts, from all nighttime granules in the MODIS R2019 Level-2 public dataset to discover the most complex or extreme phenomena at the ocean's surface. Our algorithm (ULMO) is a probabilistic autoencoder (PAE), which combines two deep learning modules: (1) an autoencoder, trained on similar to 150,000 random cutouts from 2010, to represent any input cutout with a 512-dimensional latent vector akin to a (non-linear) Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis; and (2) a normalizing flow, which maps the autoencoder's latent space distribution onto an isotropic Gaussian manifold. From the latter, we calculated a log-likelihood (LL) value for each cutout and defined outlier cutouts to be those in the lowest 0.1% of the distribution. These exhibit large gradients and patterns characteristic of a highly dynamic ocean surface, and many are located within larger complexes whose unique dynamics warrant future analysis. Without guidance, ULMO consistently locates the outliers where the major western boundary currents separate from the continental margin. Prompted by these results, we began the process of exploring the fundamental patterns learned by ULMO thereby identifying several compelling examples. Future work may find that algorithms such as ULMO hold significant potential/promise to learn and derive other, not-yet-identified behaviors in the ocean from the many archives of satellite-derived SST fields. We see no impediment to applying them to other large remote-sensing datasets for ocean science (e.g., SSH and ocean color).

TI  - Potential Dam Breach Analysis and Flood Wave Risk Assessment Using HEC-RAS and Remote Sensing Data: A Multicriteria Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Dam breach has disastrous consequences for the economy and human lives. Floods are one of the most damaging natural phenomena, and some of the most catastrophic flash floods are related to dam collapses. The goal of the present study is to analyse the impact of a possible failure-collapse on a potentially affected area downstream of the existing Bramianos dam on southern Crete Island. HEC-RAS hydraulic analysis software was used to study the dam breach, the flood wave propagation, and estimate the extent of floods. The analysis was performed using two different relief datasets of the same area: a digital elevation model (DEM) taken from very high-resolution orthophoto images (OPH) of the National Cadastre and Mapping Agency SA and a detailed digital surface model (DSM) extracted from aerial images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Remote sensing data of the Sentinel-2 satellite and OPH were utilised to create the geographic information system (GIS) layers of a thorough land use/cover classification (LULC) for the potentially flooded area, which was used to assess the impact of the flood wave. Different dam breach and flood scenarios, where the water flows over man-made structures, settlements, and olive tree cultivations, were also examined. The study area is dominated mainly by three geological formations with different hydrogeological characteristics that dictated the positioning and structure of the dam and determine the processes that shape the geomorphology and surface roughness of the floodplain, affecting flow conditions. The results show that the impact of a potential dam break at Bramianos dam is serious, and appropriate management measures should be taken to reduce the risk. The water flow downstream of the collapsed dam depends on the water volume stored in the reservoir. Moreover, the comparison of DSM and DEM cases shows that the detailed DSM may indicate more accurately the surface relief and existing natural obstacles such as vegetation, buildings, and greenhouses, enabling more realistic hydraulic simulation results. Dam breach flood simulations and innovative remote sensing data can provide valuable outcomes for engineers and stakeholders for decision-making and planning in order to confront the consequences of similar incidents worldwide.

TI  - Changes in Landscape Structure in the Municipalities of the Nitra District (Slovak Republic) Due to Expanding Suburbanization
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Suburbanization, as a set of several factors, influences and changes the landscape structure of smaller municipalities in the hinterland of larger cities. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the built-up areas related to suburbanization within three time horizons-in 2002, 2005, and 2020-in 62 municipalities of the district (including two cities, Nitra and Vrable). This study examines the process of spatial changes in landscape features (residential, industrial, agricultural, transport) related to suburbanization between 2002 and 2005 and between 2002 and 2020. The input analytical data were digital orthophotomaps from 2002 and 2005 and the current orthophotomosaics of the Slovak Republic from 2017 (GKu, Bratislava), updated for the year 2020 using Sentinel 2 satellite image data (European Space Agency). The impact of suburbanization processes between 2002 and 2005 did not reach the dimensions of the changes that occurred due to suburbanization processes between 2002 and 2020 or 2005 and 2020. The main research objective of the article is the identification and assessment of these changes. We determined which landscape features related to suburbanization affected spatial changes in municipalities of the district Nitra. The total area affected by one of the suburbanization processes monitored by us reached 92.52 ha in the period between 2002 and 2005. Between the years 2002 and 2020, the area reached a total of 2272.82 ha, which is an increase of 2180.30 ha in 2020 compared to 2002. This included mainly the expansion of settlements or housing (60.15%), industrial areas (29.31%), transport facilities (4.35%), agricultural areas (0.73%), and other areas (5.46%). These results show expanding suburbanization for the period from 2002 to 2020 and that this process has been gaining momentum in the municipalities of the Nitra district, especially in recent years, which changes the look of rural municipalities and the character of a typical rural landscape.

TI  - Predictive risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis using preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound in early-stage breast cancer patients
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer patients. The positive rate of SLNs in cN0 stage patients ranges from 20.5% to 25.5%, so identifying appropriate candidates for SLNB is quite challenging. The aims of this study were to assess whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could be utilized to noninvasively predict SLN metastasis, and to explore the predictive value of the involved factors.Methods: Between May 2016 and May 2018, 217 consenting breast cancer patients undergoing SLNB were enrolled. Before the surgery, CEUS was utilized to identify the SLNs, and predict whether metastasis had occurred according to their enhancement pattern. Blue dye was also used to identify the SLNs during SLNB. The rates of identification and accuracy of both methods were recorded. The predictive outcomes of SLNs identified by CEUS were recorded and compared with the pathological diagnosis.Results: Of the 217 cases, SLNs in 212 cases were successfully identified, comprising 208 cases identified by CEUS and 206 cases by blue dye, with no significant difference between the two methods (P=0.6470). A total of 78 cases were predicted SLN-positive preoperatively by CEUS, comprising 61 cases of SLN metastasis confirmed by pathology and 17 cases of no SLN metastasis, and 130 cases were predicted SLN-negative by CEUS, comprising 6 cases of SLN metastasis and 124 cases of no SLN metastasis. The sensitivity of CEUS preoperative prediction was 91.0%, the specificity was 87.9%, the positive and negative predictive values were 78.2% and 95.4%, respectively, and the accuracy was 88.9%. The maximum diameter size of positive SLNs predicted by CEUS was greater than that of negative SLNs (mean value 1.67 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.40 +/- 0.05 cm, P=0.0007). Similarly, the primary tumor size predicted SLN-positive by CEUS was greater than that in patients with negative SLNs (mean value 2.64 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.09 cm, P<0.0001).Conclusions: CEUS accurately identified SLNs and can be used to noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients. However, the primary tumor size and the SLN size should not be overlooked by clinicians when judging the status of SLNs. This novel method may be a recommended strategy for identifying appropriate SLNB candidates.

TI  - Quantifying Forest Fire and Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery in the Daxin'anling Area of Northeastern China Using Landsat Time-Series Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many post-fire on-site factors, including fire severity, management strategies, topography, and local climate, are concerns for forest managers and recovery ecologists to formulate forest vegetation recovery plans in response to climate change. We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance in the Daxing'anling area, Northeastern China, from 1987 to 2016. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier and historical fire records were used to separate burned patches from disturbance patches obtained from VCT. Afterward, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), SVM, and random forest (RF) were applied to assess the statistical relationships between vegetation recovery characteristics and various influential factors. The results indicated that the forest disturbance events obtained from VCT had high spatial accuracy, ranging from 70% to 86% for most years. The overall accuracy of the annual fire patches extracted from the proposed VCT-SVM algorithm was over 92%. The modeling accuracy of post-fire vegetation recovery was excellent, and the validation results confirmed that the RF algorithm provided better prediction accuracy than SVM and SMLR. In conclusion, topographic variables (e.g., elevation) and meteorological variables (e.g., the post-fire annual precipitation in the second year, the post-fire average relative humidity in the fifth year, and the post-fire extreme maximum temperature in the third year) jointly affect vegetation recovery in this cold temperate continental monsoon climate region.

TI  - Techniques for the Automatic Detection and Hiding of Sensitive Targets in Emergency Mapping Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergency remote sensing mapping can provide support for decision making in disaster assessment or disaster relief, and therefore plays an important role in disaster response. Traditional emergency remote sensing mapping methods use decryption algorithms based on manual retrieval and image editing tools when processing sensitive targets. Although these traditional methods can achieve target recognition, they are inefficient and cannot meet the high time efficiency requirements of disaster relief. In this paper, we combined an object detection model with a generative adversarial network model to build a two-stage deep learning model for sensitive target detection and hiding in remote sensing images, and we verified the model performance on the aircraft object processing problem in remote sensing mapping. To improve the experimental protocol, we introduced a modification to the reconstruction loss function, candidate frame optimization in the region proposal network, the PointRend algorithm, and a modified attention mechanism based on the characteristics of aircraft objects. Experiments revealed that our method is more efficient than traditional manual processing; the precision is 94.87%, the recall is 84.75% higher than that of the original mask R-CNN model, and the F1-score is 44% higher than that of the original model. In addition, our method can quickly and intelligently detect and hide sensitive targets in remote sensing images, thereby shortening the time needed for emergency mapping.

TI  - Unsupervised Classification of Polarimetric SAR Image Based on Geodesic Distance and Non-Gaussian Distribution Feature
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification plays a significant role in PolSAR image interpretation. This letter presents a novel unsupervised classification method for PolSAR images based on the geodesic distance and K-Wishart distribution. The geodesic distance is obtained between the Kennaugh matrices of the observed target and canonical targets, and it is further utilized to define scattering similarity. According to the maximum scattering similarity, initial segmentation is produced, and the image is divided into three main categories: surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, and random volume scattering. Then, using the shape parameter alpha of K-distribution, each scattering category is further divided into three sub-categories with different degrees of heterogeneity. Finally, the K-Wishart maximum likelihood classifier is applied iteratively to update the results and improve the classification accuracy. Experiments are carried out on three real PolSAR images, including L-band AIRSAR, L-band ESAR, and C-band GaoFen-3 datasets, containing different resolutions and various terrain types. Compared with four other classic and recently developed methods, the final classification results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - Accuracy Improvements to Pixel-Based and Object-Based LULC Classification with Auxiliary Datasets from Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and assessment of land use/land cover (LULC) change over large areas are significantly important in numerous research areas, such as natural resource protection, sustainable development, and climate change. However, accurately extracting LULC only using the spectral features of satellite images is difficult owing to landscape heterogeneities over large areas. To improve the accuracy of LULC classification, numerous studies have introduced other auxiliary features to the classification model. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) not only provides powerful computing capabilities, but also provides a large amount of remote sensing data and various auxiliary datasets. However, the different effects of various auxiliary datasets in the GEE on the improvement of the LULC classification accuracy need to be elucidated along with methods that can optimize combinations of auxiliary datasets for pixel- and object-based classification. Herein, we comprehensively analyze the performance of different auxiliary features in improving the accuracy of pixel- and object-based LULC classification models with medium resolution. We select the Yangtze River Delta in China as the study area and Landsat-8 OLI data as the main dataset. Six types of features, including spectral features, remote sensing multi-indices, topographic features, soil features, distance to the water source, and phenological features, are derived from auxiliary open-source datasets in GEE. We then examine the effect of auxiliary datasets on the improvement of the accuracy of seven pixels-based and seven object-based random forest classification models. The results show that regardless of the types of auxiliary features, the overall accuracy of the classification can be improved. The results further show that the object-based classification achieves higher overall accuracy compared to that obtained by the pixel-based classification. The best overall accuracy from the pixel-based (object-based) classification model is 94.20% (96.01%). The topographic features play the most important role in improving the overall accuracy of classification in the pixel- and object-based models comprising all features. Although a higher accuracy is achieved when the object-based method is used with only spectral data, small objects on the ground cannot be monitored. However, combined with many types of auxiliary features, the object-based method can identify small objects while also achieving greater accuracy. Thus, when applying object-based classification models to mid-resolution remote sensing images, different types of auxiliary features are required. Our research results improve the accuracy of LULC classification in the Yangtze River Delta and further provide a benchmark for other regions with large landscape heterogeneity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of the forage-livestock balance in the Xilin Gol steppe, China: implications for sustainably utilizing grassland-ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of the forage-livestock balance is imperative for regionally arranging animal husbandry production while ensuring sustainable grassland-ecosystem service use. The Xilin Gol steppe is an important native grassland resource in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. This study aimed to elucidate the dynamics of the forage-livestock balance in the Xilin Gol steppe during the period 2000-2015. We evaluated the forage production and corresponding livestock carrying capacity (LCC) in the growing seasons of 2000-2015 using remote sensing data and field surveys. The spatiotemporal patterns of the forage-livestock balance were then assessed at regional, city (including city, county and banner), and village scales using statistical and household survey data. The results showed that both forage production and LCC decreased in the Xilin Gol steppe from east to west. During the period 2000-2015, the regional average forage production and corresponding LCC fluctuated without following a distinct trend, but were consistent with the variations in precipitation. The forage-livestock balance varied with time, space, and scale. At the regional scale, steppes were overgrazed in the early 2000s, but a forage-livestock balance or even grazing potential was achieved in other years. At the city scale, approximately half of the region exhibited a "forage-livestock balance" since 2000. However, about half of the region still experienced overgrazing, which mainly located in the southwest sandy zones. Such changes may have been affected by the variations in grassland quality, forage production, compensation payment, and so on. We suggest a location-specific management scheme for grazing constraints, ecological compensation payment, and industry development to aid in harmonizing animal husbandry and environmental restoration, while promoting sustainable development goals by 2030.

TI  - Retrieval model for total nitrogen concentration based on UAV hyper spectral remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms - A case study in the Miyun Reservoir, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the water pollution level in real time is the most critical issue for protecting the water quality of water reservoirs. Due to the restrictions on flight areas of Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAV), four sensitive regions with the area of 1-2 km2 were first selected in this study based on the spatial distribution of total nitrogen (TN) concentration changes estimated by the Landsat remote sensing data. And then twelve machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), Lasso Regression (Lasso), Elastic Net (EN), Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), K Neighbors Regression (KNR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Extra Trees Regression (ETR), AdaBoost Regression (ABR) and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) were compared to construct a more accurate retrieval model by using the UAV hyper spectral remote sensing and ground monitoring data. And then the TN concentration was estimated after the process of dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing denoing. Finally, spatial heterogeneity of the TN concentration was analyzed in four sensitive areas of the Miyun reservoir. The results demonstrated that among the tested algorithms the Extra Trees Regression was best suitable for the construction of a TN concentration retrieval model on the basis of UAV hyper spectral data, and its absolute squared error was 0.000065. The spatial distribution of the TN showed that the concentration was highest within the water area of the Bulaotun village and the Houbajiazhuang village, while it was relatively low for the Chao river dam and Bai river dam. Additionally, no significant differences regarding the concentrations were shown in the single UAV flight area except the Houbajia village, which indicated that the water quality in Miyun reservoir was relatively stable and changed in a small interval. These conclusions can provide scientific references for water quality monitoring and management in the water reservoir.

TI  - Outbreak of Severe Vomiting in Dogs Associated with a Canine Enteric Coronavirus, United Kingdom
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of population health surveillance for companion animal populations leaves them vulnerable to the effects of novel diseases without means of early detection. We present evidence on the effectiveness of a system that enabled early detection and rapid response to a canine gastroenteritis outbreak in the United Kingdom. In January 2020, prolific vomiting among dogs was sporadically reported in the United Kingdom. Electronic health records from a nationwide sentinel network of veterinary practices confirmed a significant increase in dogs with signs of gastroenteric disease. Male dogs and dogs living with other vomiting dogs were more likely to be affected. Diet and vaccination status were not associated with the disease; however, a canine enteric coronavirus was significantly associated with illness. The system we describe potentially fills a gap in surveillance in neglected populations and could provide a blueprint for other countries.

TI  - Clade-Specific Biosurveillance of <i>Pseudoperonospora cubensis</i> Using Spore Traps for Precision Disease Management of Cucurbit Downy Mildew
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudoperonospora cubensis is an obligate oomycete and cause of cucurbit downy mildew (CDM), the most destructive foliar disease affecting cucurbit hosts. Annual epidemics develop throughout the United States as windborne sporangia travel great distances and survive prolonged exposure to solar radiation. Recent genomic evidence suggests that P. cubensis isolates display host adaptation based on their respective Glade. Early detection is key for fungicide application timing, and identification of the host-adapted Glade provides information on the risk of infection for specific cucurbit crops. In this study, a multiplex quantitative PCR assay was developed based on species- and clade-specific nuclear genomic markers. The assay detected as few as 10 sporangia or DNA at 100 fg/ml for both clades and was validated in the field by deploying rotorod spore samplers in cucurbit sentinel plots located at two research stations in North Carolina. Using this assay, sporangia DNA was detected in spore trap sampling rods before signs of P. cubensis or CDM symptoms were observed in the sentinel plots. Both Glade 1 and Glade 2 DNA were detected in late-season cucumber and watermelon plots but only Glade 2 DNA was detected in the early-season cucumber plots. These results will significantly improve disease management of CDM by monitoring inoculum levels to determine the cucurbit crops at risk of infection throughout each growing season.

TI  - Exploring analog-based schemes for aerosol optical depth forecasting with WRF-Chem
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We implement and test an analog-based post-processing method to improve short range forecasts of aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Model postprocessing of AOD is performed using historical analog forecasts and a Kalman Filter (KF). Analog forecasts are selected from WRF-Chem simulations based on a set of environmental predictors (AOD, wind speed, precipitable water, and particulate matter) that exhibit past values similar to the current forecasts. Space-borne AOD from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard Terra and Aqua satellites corresponding to the analogs are used to build the analog ensemble. This study focuses on a spatial domain covering the AERONET sites in contiguous United States. We use the analog ensemble weighted mean (AN) and Kalman filter analog (KFAN) algorithms, which are both trained using WRF-Chem AOD forecasts for the months of June to August during 2008-2011 and tested during the same months for 2012. Overall, the AOD forecast are more skillful when the forecast errors are corrected using a combination of analogs and Kalman filter in KFAN. This is especially true for the western US where the correlation of AOD with PM2.5, PM10, and surface horizontal wind speed are higher than those for other predictors. In fact, the overall biases in AOD are significantly reduced close to zero, with KFAN AOD being statistically indistinguishable to MODIS. However, both methods show mixed results (albeit still showing overall improvements) in eastern and central U.S., where AOD and its variability are highest. We find that, during the summer, PM is not the only predominant factor driving AOD in these regions, unlike western United States (U.S.) (except New Mexico and Arizona). We note, however, that the quality of the analogs depends on the model's capability to accurately simulate total precipitable water, which in turn influences aerosol sources and sinks.

TI  - Effects of Training Set Size on Supervised Machine-Learning Land-Cover Classification of Large-Area High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The size of the training data set is a major determinant of classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the collection of a large training data set for supervised classifiers can be a challenge, especially for studies covering a large area, which may be typical of many real-world applied projects. This work investigates how variations in training set size, ranging from a large sample size (n = 10,000) to a very small sample size (n = 40), affect the performance of six supervised machine-learning algorithms applied to classify large-area high-spatial-resolution (HR) (1-5 m) remotely sensed data within the context of a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach. GEOBIA, in which adjacent similar pixels are grouped into image-objects that form the unit of the classification, offers the potential benefit of allowing multiple additional variables, such as measures of object geometry and texture, thus increasing the dimensionality of the classification input data. The six supervised machine-learning algorithms are support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), single-layer perceptron neural networks (NEU), learning vector quantization (LVQ), and gradient-boosted trees (GBM). RF, the algorithm with the highest overall accuracy, was notable for its negligible decrease in overall accuracy, 1.0%, when training sample size decreased from 10,000 to 315 samples. GBM provided similar overall accuracy to RF; however, the algorithm was very expensive in terms of training time and computational resources, especially with large training sets. In contrast to RF and GBM, NEU, and SVM were particularly sensitive to decreasing sample size, with NEU classifications generally producing overall accuracies that were on average slightly higher than SVM classifications for larger sample sizes, but lower than SVM for the smallest sample sizes. NEU however required a longer processing time. The k-NN classifier saw less of a drop in overall accuracy than NEU and SVM as training set size decreased; however, the overall accuracies of k-NN were typically less than RF, NEU, and SVM classifiers. LVQ generally had the lowest overall accuracy of all six methods, but was relatively insensitive to sample size, down to the smallest sample sizes. Overall, due to its relatively high accuracy with small training sample sets, and minimal variations in overall accuracy between very large and small sample sets, as well as relatively short processing time, RF was a good classifier for large-area land-cover classifications of HR remotely sensed data, especially when training data are scarce. However, as performance of different supervised classifiers varies in response to training set size, investigating multiple classification algorithms is recommended to achieve optimal accuracy for a project.

TI  - Cluster of Post-Operative Endophthalmitis Caused by <i>Acanthamoeba</i> T10 Genotype - A First Report
T2  - CORNEA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To report a cluster of postoperative Acanthamoeba endophthalmitis after routine cataract surgeries. Methods: A brief summary of sentinel events leading to the referral of 4 patients of postoperative endophthalmitis to our hospital is followed by clinical descriptions and the various diagnostic approaches and interventions used. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis are also discussed. Results: Four cases of postoperative cluster endophthalmitis, presumed to be bacterial and treated as such, were referred to our hospital. The presence of an atypical ring infiltrate in the first case facilitated the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba endophthalmitis. All patients had vitritis, corneal involvement, and scleral inflammation. Multiple diagnostic methods, such as corneal scrapings, confocal microscopy, aqueous and vitreous taps, scleral abscess drainage, histopathological studies, polymerase chain reaction, and genotyping and phylogenetic analyses of isolated Acanthamoeba, were used to confirm the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and to establish the extent of ocular involvement. Various medical and therapeutic interventions used to control the infections were also documented. The isolated Acanthamoeba were confirmed as belonging to the T10 genotype, an environmentally and clinically rare variety. Conclusions: This is the first report of a cluster of postoperative T10 genotype Acanthamoeba endophthalmitis, occurring after routine cataract surgery in immunocompetent individuals. Contrary to current perceptions, a rapidly evolving infection can occur with Acanthamoeba.

TI  - Multi-Scale LG-Mod Analysis for a More Reliable SAR Sea Surface Wind Directions Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved version of the Local-Gradient-Modified (LG-Mod) algorithm for Sea Surface Wind (SSW) directions retrieval by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is presented. A "local" multi-scale analysis of wind-aligned SAR patterns is introduced to improve the LG-Mod sensitivity to SAR backscattering modulations, occurring locally with various spatial wavelengths. The Marginal Error parameter is redefined, and the adoption of the Directional Accuracy Maximization Criterion (DAMC) allows for the novel Multi-Scale (MS) LG-Mod to automatically select the local processing scale that may be regarded as optimal for pattern enhancement, once a discrete set of scales has been already fixed. Hence, this optimal scale successfully gives evidence to guarantee the best achievable local direction estimation. The assessment of the MS LG-Mod is carried on both simulated SAR images and a Sentinel-1 (S-1) dataset, consisting of 350 Interferometric Wide Swath Ground Range Multi-Look Detected High-Resolution images, which cover the region of the Gulf of Maine. In the latter case, the removal of artifacts and non-wind features from SAR amplitudes is mandatory before directional estimations. In situ wind observations gathered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Data Buoy Center (NOAA NDBC) are exploited for validation. The findings obtained from S-1 data confirm the ones from simulated patterns. The MS LG-Mod analysis performs better than each single-scale one in terms of both percentages of reliable directions and directional Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values achieved.

TI  - Framework to Study the Effects of Climate Change on Vulnerability of Ecosystems and Societies: Case Study of Nitrates in Drinking Water in Southern Finland
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change may alter the services ecosystems provide by changing ecosystem functioning. As ecosystems can also resist environmental perturbations, it is crucial to consider the different processes that influence resilience. Our case study considered increased NO3- concentration in drinking water due to the climate change. We analyzed changes in ecosystem services connected to water purification at a catchment scale in southern Finland. We combined climate change scenarios with process-based forest growth (PREBAS) and eco-hydrological (PERSiST and INCA) models. We improved traditional model calibration by timing of forest phenology and snow-covered period from network of cameras and satellite data. We upscaled the combined modelling results with scenarios of population growth to form vulnerability maps. The boreal ecosystems seemed to be strongly buffered against NO3- leaching by increase in evapotranspiration and vegetation NO3- uptake. Societal vulnerability varied greatly between scenarios and municipalities. The most vulnerable were agricultural areas on permeable soil types.

TI  - Effect of Lockdown due to COVID-19 on the Aerosol and Trace Gases Spatial Distribution over India and Adjoining Regions
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant improvement in the air quality has been reported during the `Lockdown' being implemented due to the Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in several parts of the globe. Using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite measurements, we found a 50-60% reduction in the mean tropospheric columnar Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and planetary boundary layer Sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels over India and adjoining regions during the lockdown (25 March-7 April 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown periods (8-21 March 2020). Similar decreases in aerosol concentrations over Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and south India during lockdown are noticed in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements, reaching the lowest values in the satellite era. Surprisingly, aerosol concentrations increased significantly (50-70%) during lockdown over central India when compared to pre-lockdown and climatology (20012019). A Concentration Weighted Trajectory analysis suggests that the air masses traveling from middle-east and Africa are the potential sources for the observed high aerosol concentrations over central India. Changes in the background meteorology (decrease in wind speed and increase in water vapour) during the lockdown made these aerosols stagnant and increased their size over central India, leading to higher AOD. These results suggest that natural sources (long-range transport) dominate anthropogenic pollution sources over India and adjoining regions, at least during the dry season. This finding is important to argue against the common belief that Asian countries are the main sources of pollution when long-range transport, which is a natural source, is the main cause. Lockdown has provided an opportunity to test this through a natural simulation by turning down the anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Forest disturbance alerts for the Congo Basin using Sentinel-1
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A humid tropical forest disturbance alert using Sentinel-1 radar data is presented for the Congo Basin. Radar satellite signals can penetrate through clouds, allowing Sentinel-1 to provide gap-free observations for the tropics consistently every 6-12 days at 10 m spatial scale. In the densely cloud covered Congo Basin, this represents a major advantage for the rapid detection of small-scale forest disturbances such as subsistence agriculture and selective logging. Alerts were detected with latest available Sentinel-1 images and results are presented from January 2019 to July 2020. We mapped 4 million disturbance events during this period, totalling 1.4 million ha with nearly 80% of events smaller than 0.5 ha. Monthly distribution of alert totals varied widely across the Congo Basin countries and can be linked to regional differences in wet and dry season cycles, with more forest disturbances in the dry season. Results indicated high user's and producer's accuracies and the rapid confirmation of alerts within a few weeks. Our disturbance alerts provide confident detection of events larger than or equal to 0.2 ha but do not include smaller events, which suggests that disturbance rates in the Congo Basin are even higher than presented in this study. The new alert product can help to better study the forest dynamics in the Congo Basin with improved spatial and temporal detail and near real-time detections, and highlights the value of dense Sentinel-1 time series data for large-area tropical forest monitoring. The research contributes to the Global Forest Watch initiative in providing timely and accurate information to support a wide range of stakeholders in sustainable forest management and law enforcement. The alerts are available via the https://www.globalforestwatch.org and http://radd-alert.wur.nl.

TI  - Upscaling Net Ecosystem Exchange Over Heterogeneous Landscapes With Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses different feature selection methods and CO2 flux data sets with a varying quality-quantity balance for the application of a Random Forest model to predict daily CO2 fluxes at 250 m spatial resolution for the Rur catchment area in western Germany between 2010 and 2018. Measurements from eddy covariance stations of different ecosystem types, remotely sensed vegetation data from MODIS, and COSMO-REA6 reanalysis data were used to train the model and predictions were validated by a spatial and temporal validation scheme. Results show the capabilities of a backwards feature elimination to remove irrelevant variables and an importance of high-quality-low-quantity flux data set to improve predictions. However, results also show that spatial prediction is more difficult than temporal prediction by reflecting the mean value accurately though underestimating the variance of CO2 fluxes. Vegetated parts of the catchment acted as a CO2 sink during the investigation period, net capturing about 237 g C m(-2) y(-1). Croplands, coniferous forests, deciduous forests and grasslands were all sinks on average. The highest uptake was predicted to occur in late spring and early summer, while the catchment was a CO2 source in fall and winter. In conclusion, the Random Forest model predicted a narrower distribution of CO2 fluxes, though our methodological improvements look promising in order to achieve high-resolution net ecosystem exchange data sets at the regional scale.

TI  - Velocity Estimation of Moving Targets in Multi-channel SAR images by Optimally-weighted Velocity Averaging of Multiple Pixels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A scheme is proposed for the radial-velocity estimation of moving targets in multi-channel SAR systems. A moving target consists of multiple pixels in SAR images, generally. The radial velocity of each pixel can be estimated from its interferometric phase. The radial velocity of the moving target is then obtained by averaging the radial-velocity estimates of its multiple pixels. In the averaging, the weight of each radial-velocity estimate is designed to minimize the mean-square-error (MSE) between the estimate and the truth. This scheme has a higher estimation accuracy than those conventional schemes, which take the radial-velocity estimate of one pixel as the final radial-velocity estimate of the moving target. The experimental results of both simulated and real data show the effectiveness of this scheme.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover are continuously changing in today's world. Both domains, therefore, have to rely on updates of external information sources from which the relevant land use/land cover (classification) is extracted. Satellite images are frequent candidates due to their temporal and spatial resolution. On the contrary, the extraction of relevant land use/land cover information is demanding in terms of knowledge base and time. The presented approach offers a proof-of-concept machine-learning pipeline that takes care of the entire complex process in the following manner. The relevant Sentinel-2 images are obtained through the pipeline. Later, cloud masking is performed, including the linear interpolation of merged-feature time frames. Subsequently, four-dimensional arrays are created with all potential training data to become a basis for estimators from the scikit-learn library; the LightGBM estimator is then used. Finally, the classified content is applied to the open land use and open land cover databases. The verification of the provided experiment was conducted against detailed cadastral data, to which Shannon's entropy was applied since the number of cadaster information classes was naturally consistent. The experiment showed a good overall accuracy (OA) of 85.9%. It yielded a classified land use/land cover map of the study area consisting of 7188 km2 in the southern part of the South Moravian Region in the Czech Republic. The developed proof-of-concept machine-learning pipeline is replicable to any other area of interest so far as the requirements for input data are met.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of axillary staging by ultrasound in early breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary ultrasound (AUS) is a standard procedure in the preoperative clinical identification of axillary metastatic lymph node (LN) involvement. It guides decisions about local and systemic therapy for patients with early breast cancer (EBC). But there is only weak evidence on the diagnostic criteria and standard interpretation. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of AUS in the detection and exclusion of LN metastases.Methods: In a retrospective single-center study, 611 consecutive EBC patients with 622 axillae underwent AUS +/- core needle biopsy (CNB) plus axillary surgery, i.e. sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection. For all patients, AUS image documentation of at least the most suspicious LN was saved during the initial diagnostic work-up. The diagnostic outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Youden-index (YI), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) on the basis of the daily routine interpretation and on the basis of previously recommended diagnostic criteria by two blinded examiners.Results: On the basis of the daily routine interpretation, AUS had a sensitivity (95 % CI) of 53.3 % (46.4-60.1), a specificity (95 % CI) of 93.6 % (90.8-95.8), an accuracy (95 % CI) of 79.7 % (76.4-82.8), a YI (95 % CI) of 0.47 (0.40 - 0.54), and a DOR (95 % CI) of 16.75 (10.37-27.05). Systematic application of previously recommended diagnostic criteria did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of routinely interpreted AUS.Conclusion: AUS performance alone is not sufficient to accurately identify or exclude axillary metastatic disease in unselected patients with EBC.

TI  - Rangeland Fractional Components Across the Western United States from 1985 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring temporal dynamics of rangelands to detect and understand change in vegetation cover and composition provides a wealth of information to improve management and sustainability. Remote sensing allows the evaluation of both abrupt and gradual rangeland change at unprecedented spatial and temporal extents. Here, we describe the production of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) Back in Time (BIT) dataset which quantified the percent cover of rangeland components (bare ground, herbaceous, annual herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush (Artemisia spp. Nutt.) across the western United States using Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2018. We evaluate the relationships of component trends with climate drivers at an ecoregion scale, describe the nature of landscape change, and demonstrate several case studies related to changes in grazing management, prescribed burns, and vegetation treatments. Our results showed the net cover of shrub, sagebrush, and litter significantly (p < 0.01) decreased, bare ground and herbaceous cover had no significant change, and annual herbaceous cover significantly (p < 0.05) increased. Change was ubiquitous, with a mean of 92% of pixels with some change and 38% of pixels with significant change (p < 0.10). However, most change was gradual, well over half of pixels have a range of less than 10%, and most change occurred outside of known disturbances. The BIT data facilitate a comprehensive assessment of rangeland condition, evaluation of past management actions, understanding of system variability, and opportunities for future planning.

TI  - Monitoring Key Forest Structure Attributes across the Conterminous United States by Integrating GEDI LiDAR Measurements and VIIRS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the global distribution and the three-dimensional (3D) structure of Earth's forests is needed to assess forest biomass stocks and to project the future of the terrestrial Carbon sink. In spite of its importance, the 3D structure of forests continues to be the most crucial information gap in the observational archive. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor is providing an unprecedented near-global sampling of tropical and temperate forest structural properties. The integration of GEDI measurements with spatially-contiguous observations from polar orbiting optical satellite data therefore provides a unique opportunity to produce wall-to-wall maps of forests' 3D structure. Here, we utilized Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) annual metrics data to extrapolate GEDI-derived forest structure attributes into 1-km resolution contiguous maps of tree height (TH), canopy fraction cover (CFC), plant area index (PAI), and foliage height diversity (FHD) for the conterminous US (CONUS). The maps were validated using an independent subset of GEDI data. Validation results for TH (r(2) = 0.8; RMSE = 3.35 m), CFC (r(2) = 0.79; RMSE = 0.09), PAI (r(2) = 0.76; RMSE = 0.41), and FHD (r(2) = 0.83; RMSE = 0.25) demonstrated the robustness of VIIRS data for extrapolating GEDI measurements across the nation or even over larger areas. The methodology developed through this study may allow multi-decadal monitoring of changes in multiple forest structural attributes using consistent satellite observations acquired by orbiting and forthcoming VIIRS instruments.

TI  - Investigation of an Intense Dust Outbreak in the Mediterranean Using XMed-Dry Network, Multiplatform Observations, and Numerical Modeling
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with online coupled chemistry (WRFChem) is applied to study an intense Saharan dust outbreak event affecting the Italian peninsula in 15 and 16 April 2018. According to the MODIS retrievals, this intrusion was characterized by an intense aerosol optical depth (AOD) peak value in the southern Mediterranean. Measurements within the Dry Deposition Network Across the Mediterranean (XMed-Dry) are compared with the output of the WRF-Chem model. XMed-Dry samples from Lecce (Italy), Athens (Greece) and San Lawrenz/Gozo (Malta) were analysed with respect to aerosol particle size distribution, relative dust contribution, and composition. The discrepancy between the model and measured deposition indicate the need to formulate in WRF-Chem more sophisticated deposition schemes, this will need to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the precise particle size limits chosen for the aerosol model. Moreover, satellite retrievals from MODIS sensors elaborated with the MAIAC algorithm, Aeronet stations, and measurements of PM10 at the selected sites were also considered. In a numerical domain that spans the Mediterranean and the northern Saharan desert, two different dust emission schemes, namely Gocart-AFWA and the Shao-2001, were tested and compared with multiplatform observations for simulation period covering the dust outbreak. Actual results indicate that both emission schemes would benefit from replacing the static erodibility map and soil particle distribution with remote sensed and in-situ observational data.

TI  - Landsat and Sentinel-2 Based Burned Area Mapping Tools in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Four burned area tools were implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), to obtain regular processes related to burned area (BA) mapping, using medium spatial resolution sensors (Landsat and Sentinel-2). The four tools are (i) the BA Cartography tool for supervised burned area over the user-selected extent and period, (ii) two tools implementing a BA stratified random sampling to select the scenes and dates for validation, and (iii) the BA Reference Perimeter tool to obtain highly accurate BA maps that focus on validating coarser BA products. Burned Area Mapping Tools (BAMTs) go beyond the previously implemented Burned Area Mapping Software (BAMS) because of GEE parallel processing capabilities and preloaded geospatial datasets. BAMT also allows temporal image composites to be exploited in order to obtain BA maps over a larger extent and longer temporal periods. The tools consist of four scripts executable from the GEE Code Editor. The tools' performance was discussed in two case studies: in the 2019/2020 fire season in Southeast Australia, where the BA cartography detected more than 50,000 km(2), using Landsat data with commission and omission errors below 12% when compared to Sentinel-2 imagery; and in the 2018 summer wildfires in Canada, where it was found that around 16,000 km(2) had burned.

TI  - Shellfish Toxin Uptake and Depuration in Multiple Atlantic Canadian Molluscan Species: Application to Selection of Sentinel Species in Monitoring Programs
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shellfish toxin monitoring programs often use mussels as the sentinel species to represent risk in other bivalve shellfish species. Studies have examined accumulation and depuration rates in various species, but little information is available to compare multiple species from the same harvest area. A 2-year research project was performed to validate the use of mussels as the sentinel species to represent other relevant eastern Canadian shellfish species (clams, scallops, and oysters). Samples were collected simultaneously from Deadmans Harbour, NB, and were tested for paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and amnesic shellfish toxin (AST). Phytoplankton was also monitored at this site. Scallops accumulated PSTs and AST sooner, at higher concentrations, and retained toxins longer than mussels. Data from monitoring program samples in Mahone Bay, NS, are presented as a real-world validation of findings. Simultaneous sampling of mussels and scallops showed significant differences between shellfish toxin results in these species. These data suggest more consideration should be given to situations where multiple species are present, especially scallops.

TI  - A Review of Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation for Non-Specialists
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a critical component of aquatic ecosystems. It is however understudied and rapidly changing due to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Remote sensing (RS) can provide the efficient, accurate and large-scale monitoring needed for proper SAV management and has been shown to produce accurate results when properly implemented. Our objective is to introduce RS to researchers in the field of aquatic ecology. Applying RS to underwater ecosystems is complicated by the water column as water, and dissolved or suspended particulate matter, interacts with the same energy that is reflected or emitted by the target. This is addressed using theoretical or empiric models to remove the water column effect, though no model is appropriate for all aquatic conditions. The suitability of various sensors and platforms to aquatic research is discussed in relation to both SAV as the subject and to project aims and resources. An overview of the required corrections, processing and analysis methods for passive optical imagery is presented and discussed. Previous applications of remote sensing to identify and detect SAV are briefly presented and notable results and lessons are discussed. The success of previous work generally depended on the variability in, and suitability of, the available training data, the data's spatial and spectral resolutions, the quality of the water column corrections and the level to which the SAV was being investigated (i.e., community versus species.)

TI  - Ground Predator Activity-Density and Predation Rates Are Weakly Supported by Dry-Stack Cow Manure and Wheat Cover Crops in No-Till Maize
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Because it keeps land in production, conservation programs that focus on in-field habitat manipulations may help farmers better support predators than by building predator habitat around fields. We investigated two in-field habitat manipulations that benefit producers and soil quality: fertilizing with dry-stack cow manure and planting a wheat cover crop. We hypothesized that, compared with inorganic fertilizer and fallow plots, both treatments augment habitat and residue and support more small arthropods that can serve as alternative prey for larger predators. As a result, we expected manure and the cover crop to increase ground-active predators. In turn, these predators could provide biological control of pests. Each year in a 3-yr field experiment, we applied manure and in 2 yr planted a wheat cover crop. We found that both planting a cover crop and applying dry-stack manure increased the plant cover in May. In the last year, this translated to greater soil mite (Acari) density. At the end of the experiment, however, neither manure nor the wheat cover crop had increased residue on the soil surface. As a result, our treatments had inconsistent effects on predator activity-density, especially for carabids and spiders. We observed strong edge effects from neighboring grass alleys on carabid activity-density. Regardless of treatment, we observed high predation of sentinel prey. We conclude that even without cover crops or organic fertilizer, the stability of notill maize and increased weeds in fallow treatments generate sufficient habitat complexity and alternative prey to support robust predator communities.

TI  - Implications of Bioenergy Cropping for Soil: Remote Sensing Identification of Silage Maize Cultivation and Risk Assessment Concerning Soil Erosion and Compaction
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy transition strategies in Germany have led to an expansion of energy crop cultivation in landscape, with silage maize as most valuable feedstock. The changes in the traditional cropping systems, with increasing shares of maize, raised concerns about the sustainability of agricultural feedstock production regarding threats to soil health. However, spatially explicit data about silage maize cultivation are missing; thus, implications for soil cannot be estimated in a precise way. With this study, we firstly aimed to track the fields cultivated with maize based on remote sensing data. Secondly, available soil data were target-specifically processed to determine the site-specific vulnerability of the soils for erosion and compaction. The generated, spatially-explicit data served as basis for a differentiated analysis of the development of the agricultural biogas sector, associated maize cultivation and its implications for soil health. In the study area, located in a low mountain range region in Western Germany, the number and capacity of biogas producing units increased by 25 installations and 10,163 kW from 2009 to 2016. The remote sensing-based classification approach showed that the maize cultivation area was expanded by 16% from 7305 to 8447 hectares. Thus, maize cultivation accounted for about 20% of the arable land use; however, with distinct local differences. Significant shares of about 30% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that show at least high potentials for soil erosion exceeding 25 t soil ha(-1) a(-1). Furthermore, about 10% of the maize cultivation was done on fields that pedogenetically show an elevated risk for soil compaction. In order to reach more sustainable cultivation systems of feedstock for anaerobic digestion, changes in cultivated crops and management strategies are urgently required, particularly against first signs of climate change. The presented approach can regionally be modified in order to develop site-adapted, sustainable bioenergy cropping systems.

TI  - Detecting Degraded Arable Land on the Basis of Remote Sensing Big Data Analysis
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent development of precision farming technologies has necessitated the creation of the maps of sustainable intrafield heterogeneity of soil fertility on the basis of the analysis of remote sensing big data. To create such maps, thousands of remote sensing images for 35 years have been analyzed for each element of the earth surface to identify the areas of reduced fertility. The conducted analysis allows us to detect the areas of decreased fertility. In turn, such areas are indicative of the negative soil properties. Some of the negative properties are of the initial natural origin, and others appeared as a result of the development of degradation processes. It is possible to separate the zones of reduced fertility emerged due to the natural factors from those specified by the anthropogenic impacts on the basis of the analysis of morphometric parameters of surface topography coupled with technology of the spectral neighborhood of soil line. A combination of various methods of the analysis of big remote sensing data and landscape parameters has made it possible to create the maps of degraded lands with an accuracy sufficient for precision farming technologies. This study presents the results of identification of three natural and four anthropogenic factors of fertility decrease on arable land. The areas under the impact of particular degradation factors are identified with the help of remote sensing data. They have been verified by the ground soil survey. The results obtained are the direct consequence of the remote sensing big data analysis development. A soil cartographer, as well as a farmer, has now received a new method for detecting distribution patterns of degradation factors.

TI  - Analysis of Ly<sub>α</sub> Dielectronic Satellites to Characterize Temporal Profile of Intense Femtosecond Laser Pulses
T2  - CRYSTALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the paper, an X-ray spectroscopy-based approach on laser pulse temporal profile characterization is described. The structure of dielectronic satellites to H-like Ly(alpha) lines strongly depends on a plasma electron density, so it can be applied for diagnostics. These spectral lines are mainly emitted during initial stage of laser plasma expansion. It means that plasma parameters obtained via them characterizes matter conditions in a region surrounding a spot of laser-matter interaction. In the case when a laser contrast is high enough, the radiation interacts with cold matter, which had not been preliminary perturbed by a laser prepulse, and the satellites structure shape corresponding to high densities should be observed. It allows us to consider the satellites as a diagnostic tool for the laser temporal profile quality. In the paper dependencies of the dielectronic satellites structure on electron densities obtained from detailed kinetic calculations in the wide range of plasma parameter for different elements are under discussion. Fundamental theoretical aspects of plasma diagnostic based on the feature of satellite structures shape in hot dense plasma, which led to development of the proposed method, are also explained.

TI  - Aerosol properties, trends and classification of key types over the Middle East from satellite-derived atmospheric optical data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical properties have been analyzed to investigate seasonal and regional variability of aerosols and to classify their key types over the Middle East during the period 2001-2019. The collection 6.1 MODIS aerosol products are used, including daily values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom exponent (AE) data. The MODIS aerosol retrievals are verified using measurements from ten ground-based sunphotometers of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Overall, a good agreement between the two datasets is found. Nevertheless, an overestimation of the MODIS retrievals is found in most regions. Seasonal comparison reveals that aerosol loading ranges between 0 and 0.7, with a distinct geographical variability. The highest value of AOD is found over the Arabian Peninsula especially during warm seasons. The second maximum value of AOD is located over an area stretching from southeastern Iran to western Pakistan, with higher values during summer. The lowest AOD values are found over countries in the northern part of the studied region, including Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia, as well as some over parts of Turkey. Regions with the highest aerosol loads are accompanied with the lowest AE values. Coarse marine particles are dominant in coastal regions in southern Iran across the Persian Gulf. There is an increasing trend of AOD values, reaching to 0.05 per decade over the Arabian Peninsula and the northern coast of the Caspian Sea in all seasons, while negative trends are found in Pakistan, south Afghanistan, west coast of the Black Sea and northeast of Africa. During cold seasons, AOD does not vary as much as that in warm seasons. Aerosols have been classified using the critical values for AOD and AE. Results show the dominance of mixed type aerosols in all seasons over the region. In spring and summer, desert dust is the second-highest contributor to aerosol composition, followed by urban aerosols. Maritime-like aerosols transported from the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea are present mostly during autumn. Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and western parts of Kazakhstan commonly experience a relatively clean atmosphere during the whole year, except for episodic dust storms in summer. Smoke has a small undetectable contribution to the studied region.

In the present study, extensive surveys were conducted (during 2016-2017) followed with field experiments (2017 and 2019 kharif and 2018 rabi seasons) in the state of Chhattisgarh, India, comprising of three diverse agroecological zones, viz., northern hill zone, central plain zone and southern Bastar plateau zone, for understanding the distribution pattern of viruses and vector populations in prominent pulses and vegetable crops. Field experiments revealed that more than 90% incidence of yellow mosaic disease (YMD) was recorded in mungbean and urdbean, followed by YMD of ridge gourd and bitter gourd, leaf curl disease of tomato (ToLCD) and chilli and yellow vein mosaic disease of bhendi; however, only five per cent YMD was recorded in cow pea. Molecular and sequence analysis of viral genomic components revealed ToLCD in central plain zone of Chhattisgarh was caused by a consortium of begomoviruses, including Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), Tomato leaf curl Karnataka virus (ToLCKV), and Tomato leaf curl Kerala virus associated with satellite molecules. YMD of mungbean, cow pea and soybean was caused by Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV), while YMD of ridge gourd was caused by ToLCNDV. PCR analysis, using species-specific primers, of samples representing the three different regions revealed that YMD of mungbean, urdbean and cowpea was positive only for MYMIV and was unevenly distributed, while YMD of ridge gourd, bitter gourd, pumpkin and sponge gourd was positive only for ToLCNDV; however, ToLCD was positive for either ToLCNDV or ToLCKV or both, and some samples were also found associated with betasatellite molecules. Amaranthus and rice bean were identified as non-host species for the begomoviruses infecting tomato and MYMIV, as observed by surveys in the hot-spot-like areas, controlled whitefly transmission as well as agroinoculation. Compilation and analysis of available information on begomoviruses affecting these crops in India suggest that they are unevenly distributed in India. This is the first report of the begomovirus occurrence in pulses and vegetable crops in this agroecologically diverse region.

TI  - Scrutinizing Relationships between Submarine Groundwater Discharge and Upstream Areas Using Thermal Remote Sensing: A Case Study in the Northern Persian Gulf
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient input through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) often plays a significant role in primary productivity and nutrient cycling in the coastal areas. Understanding relationships between SGD and topo-hydrological and geo-environmental characteristics of upstream zones is essential for sustainable development in these areas. However, these important relationships have not yet been completely explored using data-mining approaches, especially in arid and semi-arid coastal lands. Here, Landsat 8 thermal sensor data were used to identify potential sites of SGD at a regional scale. Relationships between the remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and geo-environmental variables of upland watersheds were analyzed using logistic regression model for the first time. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) metric. A highly accurate model, with the AUC-ROC of 96.6%, was generated. Moreover, the results indicated that the percentage of karstic lithological formation and topographic wetness index were key variables influencing SGD phenomenon and spatial distribution in the northern coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. The adopted methodology and applied metrics can be transferred to other coastal regions as a rapid assessment procedure for SGD site detection. Moreover, the results can help planners and decision-makers to develop efficient environmental management strategies and the design of comprehensive sustainable development policies.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the backdrop of upward trend in anthropogenic aerosols over global hotspot regions, the air quality had improved worldwide post declaration of the Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic in mid March-2020. Present study using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) version-2 datasets however, demonstrates the regional variation in aerosol loading during peak of the lockdown period. Reduction in aerosol loading over majority of the aerosol hotspots is observed from mid-March/April2020 with highest percentage reduction in the month of May. Reduction in aerosol loading over global hot spots resulted in positive surface aerosol radiative forcing (ARF, up to 6 Wm(-2)). Albeit reduction in aerosol loading observed worldwide, the considerable above normal aerosol burden was identified during April-May 2020 over the Amazon river basin, northern parts of the South America, Mexico region, South-West parts of the Africa and South East Asian region. Analysis revealed that the wildfire emission contributed significantly in anomalous aerosol burden over these regions during the lockdown period. An appropriate mitigation measures to reduce wildfire emissions is essential in addition to controlled anthropogenic emissions as far as air quality, deforestation and ecosystem is concerned.

TI  - Monitoring of agricultural drought in semi-arid ecosystem of Peninsular India through indices derived from time-series CHIRPS and MODIS datasets
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable and consistent remote sensing-based drought indices along with Geographic Information System (GIS) play a significant role in the mapping, and monitoring of agricultural drought. The core objective of the present study is to monitor agricultural drought dynamics over the semi-arid Rayalaseema region of Peninsular India during the year 2000 to 2018 by using the Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI) derived from time-series remote sensing data products. NVSWI is the normalization of Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI), which was computed by integrating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The analysis of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) shows that in dry year (2001), majority of the study area experienced extreme dry conditions (SPI < -2.0) due to the deficit rainfall during the growing season. The spatio-temporal analysis of NVSWI reveals that the western, central, and northern parts of the study area were prone to frequent droughts of moderate to severe intensity. The high temperatures and below normal rainfall are found to be the major triggering factors for the droughts in the region. During the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018 worst droughts were observed in the study region. The Pearson correlation analysis between monthly NVSWI with 1-month SPI and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) for the growing season of dry (2001) and wet (2007) years clearly show a significant positive correlation. The study clearly demonstrates the potential of NVSWI as one of the robust indices in the assessment and monitoring of agricultural droughts.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Global Forest/Non-Forest Maps Derived from SAR and Optical Sensors. Case Studies from Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado Biomes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global-scale forest/non-forest (FNF) maps are of crucial importance for applications like biomass estimation and deforestation monitoring. Global FNF maps based on optical remote sensing data have been produced by the wall-to-wall satellite image analyses or sampling strategies. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) also made available their global FNF maps based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This paper attempted to answer the following scientific question: how comparable are the FNF products derived from optical and SAR data? As test sites we selected the Amazon (tropical rainforest) and Cerrado (tropical savanna) biomes, the two largest Brazilian biomes. Forest estimations from 2015 derived from TanDEM-X (X band; HH polarization) and ALOS-2 (L band; HV polarization) SAR data, as well as forest cover information derived from Landsat 8 optical data were compared with each other at the municipality and image sampling levels. The optical-based forest estimations considered in this study were derived from the MapBiomas project, a Brazilian multi-institutional project to map land use and land cover (LULC) classes of an entire country based on historical time series of Landsat data. In addition to the existing forest maps, a set of 1619 Landsat 8 RGB color composites was used to generate new independent comparison data composed of circular areas with 5-km diameter, which were visually interpreted after image segmentation. The Spearman rank correlation estimated the correlation among the data sets and the paired Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tested the hypothesis that the data sets are statistically equal. Results showed that forest maps derived from SAR and optical satellites are statistically different regardless of biome or scale of study (municipality or image sampling), except for the Cerrado ' s forest estimations derived from TanDEM-X and ALOS-2. Nevertheless, the percentage of pixels classified as forest or non-forest by both SAR sensors were 90% and 80% for the Amazon and Cerrado biome, respectively, indicating an overall good agreement.

TI  - Mapping Woody Volume of Mediterranean Forests by Using SAR and Machine Learning: A Case Study in Central Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at L- and C-bands (ALOS PALSAR and Envisat/ASAR) were used to estimate forest biomass in Tuscany, in Central Italy. The ground measurements of woody volume (WV, in m(3)/ha), which can be considered as a proxy of forest biomass, were retrieved from the Italian National Forest Inventory (NFI). After a preliminary investigation to assess the sensitivity of backscatter at C- and L-bands to forest biomass, an approach based on an artificial neural network (ANN) was implemented. The ANN was trained using the backscattering coefficient at L-band (ALOS PALSAR, HH and HV polarization) and C-band (Envisat ASAR in HH polarization) as inputs. Spatially distributed WV values for the entire test area were derived by the integration (fusion) of a canopy height map derived from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat GLAS) and the NFI data, in order to build a significant ground truth dataset for the training stage. The analysis of the backscattering sensitivity to WV showed a moderate correlation at L-band and was almost negligible at C-band. Despite this, the ANN algorithm was able to exploit the synergy of SAR frequencies and polarizations, estimating WV with average Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) = 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) similar or equal to 39 m(3)/ha when applied to the test dataset and average R = 0.86 and RMSE similar or equal to 75 m(3)/ha when validated on the direct measurements from the NFI. Considering the heterogeneity of the scenario (Mediterranean mixed forests in hilly landscape) and the small amount of available ground measurements with respect to the spatial variability of different plots, the obtained results can be considered satisfactory. Moreover, the successful use of WV from global maps for implementing the algorithm suggests the possibility to apply the algorithm to wider areas or even to global scales.

TI  - Integration of allometric equations in the water cloud model towards an improved retrieval of forest stem volume with L-band SAR data in Sweden
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Much attention is paid to the estimation of forest biomass-related variables (stem volume and above-ground biomass) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter images because of the increasing number of sensors in space providing global and repeated coverage and the sensitivity of the backscattered intensity to forest properties. One of the most popular models used to estimate a biomass-related variable from SAR backscatter observations is the Water Cloud Model (WCM) because of its simplicity allowing for a straightforward retrieval. Nonetheless, a common feature of these estimates is the tendency to over- or underestimate specific ranges due to simplifying assumptions in the model. In this study, the WCM has been revisited by exploring pathways for a physically-based, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-aided, model parameterization at larger scale with the overall aim to reduce systematic retrieval errors associated with empirical assumptions in the model. The study was undertaken in Sweden where repeated observations of backscatter by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) were available. The integration was prototyped in Sweden thanks to detailed allometries relating forest variables in the WCM. These were derived from spatially dense estimates of canopy density and vegetation height from observations by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and measurements of height and stem volume from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). The SAR backscatter predicted by the revisited WCM was in strong agreement with the observations. When evaluated against stem volumes estimated from the NFI data, the SAR-based stem volumes presented strong dispersion at the pixel level. Average stem volume at the level of five or more pixels, i.e., for an area larger than 0.3 ha, were instead unbiased and similar to the average values obtained from the NFI data (relative root mean square error: 21.4%, estimation bias: 0.9 m(3)/ha and coefficient of determination: 0.67). This study demonstrates that the integration of allometries in the WCM effectively reduces estimation errors. The method here prototyped in Sweden qualifies to provide large-scale estimates of biomass-related variables using multiple observations of L-band backscatter with potential application worldwide.

TI  - Understanding the dynamics of landscape of greater Sundarban area using multi-layer perceptron Markov chain and landscape statistics approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sundarban mangrove is the largest continuous mangrove forest in the world and is the habitat of an incredible amount of biodiversity. Biodiversity loss and degradation of this highly ecologically productive mangrove forest due to climate change will have a tremendous impact on the livelihood of the people living in the deltaic region. The present study was aimed to find out the dynamics of change in different land cover for the greater Sundarban region. The multi-temporal Landsat images were used to understand the dynamics in three decades from 1998 to 2018. The analysis revealed that Sundarban mangrove forest changed very insignificantly. The change between 1998 and 2008 was approximately 1.2%, i.e. around 26.2 km(2), and the change between the year 2008 and 2018 was approximately 1.27%, which consists of 28 km(2). However, the dynamics of open mangrove forest and dense mangrove forest were found very high. The human habitat and aquaculture were found as the most rapidly expanding land-use type in this landscape. Area under human habitat has increased approximately 80%, i.e. nearly 654 km(2) between 1998 and 2018; area under aquaculture has increased approximately 116% (i.e. around 231 km(2)) between 1998 and 2008. The MLP-Markov Chain based modelling of land-use has shown an overwhelming increase in human habitat in near future. However, being situated in the close vicinity of dense human population of the city Kolkata, the mangrove habitat remained intact, which is largely due to great amount of conservation efforts that have been exercised by the Govt. and the local forest department. The landscape statistical analysis for understanding the ecological dynamics of every land cover types showed that in 2018, the human habitat became second dominant category in this study area. The aquaculture practice for high economic value has pushed down the native agricultural practice in the region.

TI  - Comprehensive time-series analysis of bridge deformation using differential satellite radar interferometry based on Sentinel-1
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comprehensive methodological framework for structural deformation monitoring of critical infrastructure assets based on differential SAR interferometry. By employing persistent scatterer interferometry, deformation time series in line-of-sight are derived from freely available Sentinel-1 single look complex products. These raw time series are analysed and refined using an extensive post-processing chain to obtain daily rates for vertical and horizontal deformation components. The post-processing includes cleaning, smoothing and a temperature correction to account for different sensing times in ascending and descending orbits. Longitudinal clustering of time series is used to reveal spatial patterns in the single epoch deformation series. Seasonal trend decomposition of the aggregated time series is performed to separate deformation trends from seasonal deformations. The applicability of the framework is showcased at the example of an integral concrete bridge located in the port of Vienna. Results are validated against in situ deformation measurements. The presented framework constitutes a blueprint for the continuous monitoring of critical infrastructure assets using satellite interferometry, which may supplement conventional structural health monitoring.

TI  - FRENCH LINGUOCULTURE AND METHODS OF LANGUAGE AND DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION OF EMOTION "JOIE" (JOY)
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the identification of ethnocultural methods of linguistic representation of the emotion "joy" in the French language and culture. Any linguistic unit can convey certain emotion in the appropriate context and communicative situation. The analysis of linguistic material is based on a cognitive and functional-communicative approach to its interpretation. A linguistic understanding of the functioning of systemic discourse means within a specific culture, in particular the French linguoculture, occurs in terms of the anthropocentric paradigm. An integral component of spiritual culture, emotion discourse, being universal, presents a certain specificity of verbalization in different languages. This happens due to the speaker's inherent subjectivity of interpreting the reality, which is of interest for linguistics, in particular for cognitive science and communication science. The hypothesis is put forward that the semantics of linguistic units with an institutional component reflects the attitude of any linguoculture to the fundamental concepts of being and thinking; the ways of emotional verbalization can be considered elements of the national linguistic self-identification. Research perspectives are in the development of new synergistic cognitive-communicative approaches to the study of linguistic units with an emotional component.

TI  - Assimilation of SMAP and ASCAT soil moisture retrievals into the JULES land surface model using the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A land data assimilation system is developed to merge satellite soil moisture retrievals into the Joint U.K. Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (LSM) using the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). The system assimilates microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) after bias correction based on cumulative distribution function fitting. The soil moisture assimilation estimates are evaluated with ground-based soil moisture measurements over the continental U.S. for five consecutive warm seasons (May-September of 2015-2019). The result shows that both SMAP and ASCAT retrievals improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimates. Especially, the SMAP single-sensor assimilation experiment shows the best performance with the increase of temporal anomaly correlation by Delta R similar to 0.05 for surface soil moisture and Delta R similar to 0.03 for root-zone soil moisture compared with the LSM simulation without satellite data assimilation. SMAP assimilation is more skillful than ASCAT assimilation primarily because of the greater skill of the assimilated SMAP retrievals compared to the ASCAT retrievals. The skill improvement also depends significantly on the region; the higher skill improvement in the western U.S. compared to the eastern U.S. is explained by the Kalman gain in the two experiments. Additionally, the regional skill differences in the single-sensor assimilation experiments are attributed to the number of assimilated observations. Finally, the soil moisture assimilation estimates provide more realistic land surface information than model-only simulations for the 2015 and the 2016 western U.S. droughts, suggesting the advantage of using satellite soil moisture retrievals in the current drought monitoring system.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Model Design with Multispectral and Infrared Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with a soil moisture retrieval model design with airborne measurements for remote monitoring of soil moisture level in large crop fields. A small quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered as a remote sensing platform for high spatial resolutions of airborne images and easy operations. A combination of multispectral and infrared (IR) sensors is applied to overcome the effects of canopies convering the field on the sensor measurements. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to take the measurement images directly as inputs for the soil moisture retrieval model without loss of information. The procedures to obtain an input image corresponding to a certain soil moisture level measurement point are addressed, and the overall structure of the proposed CNN-based model is suggested with descriptions. Training and testing of the proposed soil moisture retrieval model are conducted to verify and validate its performance and address the effects of input image sizes and errors on input images. The soil moisture level estimation performance decreases when the input image size increases as the ratio of the pixel corresponding to the point to estimate soil moisture level to the total number of pixels in the input image, whereas the input image size should be large enough to include this pixel under the errors in input images. The comparative study shows that the proposed CNN-based algorithm is advantageous on estimation performance by maintaining spatial information of pixels on the input images.

TI  - Use time series NDVI and EVI to develop dynamic crop growth metrics for yield modeling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery are widely used for crop yield analysis. However, the growth metrics derived from the MODIS NDVI or EVI have so far not been explored and applied to crop yield yet. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to design NDVI- and EVI-based crop growth metrics, which biometrically capture the status and trend of crop growth and thus could be more powerful for growth yield management. We developed 19 NDVI- and EVI-based growth metrics, respectively, to monitor crop growth and yield, which is based on a time series of MODIS Terra 16-day 250 m data product from 2000 to 2018. Among the NDVI- and EVI-based vegetation growth metrics (VGM), the maximum (VGMmax), the integrated (VGMinteg), the sum of green-up (VGMsumgrn), the 70 days growth stage (VGM70), 85 days growth stage (VGM85), and 98 days growth stage (VGM98), the sum of 85 days growth stage (VGM85total), and the sum of 98 days growth stage (VGM98total) are mentionable. In this study, we implemented these crop growth metrics for soybean crop yield modeling at Mississippi Delta, Mississippi, USA. Soybean is a major crop cultivated in this region that is consisted of a total of 18 counties with similar agricultural cropping patterns. We observed that NDVI- and EVI-based VGMmax, VGM70, VGM85, VGM98total fitted models best with R-Square about 0.95. Using cross-validation of 80% train and 20% test size, we found NDVI-based VGM85 (e.g., normalized mean prediction error (NMPE) = 0.034) and EVI-based VGMmax (NMPE = 0.033) were the best fit linear yield models for this region. Designing novel crop growth indices based on crop phenological and ecological characteristics, this study further showed NDVI- and EVI-based growth metrics for crop growth monitoring and yield modeling. These growth metrics can be applied to other types of crop monitoring in different climate zones.

TI  - Self-Supervised Learning of Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices for Clustering and Visualization of Vegetation Types
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices are commonly used techniques for the retrieval of biophysical and chemical attributes of vegetation. This paper presents the potential of an Autoencoders (AEs) and Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs)-based self-supervised learning approach for the decorrelation and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional vegetation indices derived from satellite observations. This research was implemented in Mt. Zao and its base in northeast Japan with a cool temperate climate by collecting the ground truth points belonging to 16 vegetation types (including some non-vegetation classes) in 2018. Monthly median composites of 16 vegetation indices were generated by processing all Sentinel-2 scenes available for the study area from 2017 to 2019. The performance of AEs and CAEs-based compressed images for the clustering and visualization of vegetation types was quantitatively assessed by computing the bootstrap resampling-based confidence interval. The AEs and CAEs-based compressed images with three features showed around 4% and 9% improvements in the confidence intervals respectively over the classical method. CAEs using convolutional neural networks showed better feature extraction and dimensionality reduction capacity than the AEs. The class-wise performance analysis also showed the superiority of the CAEs. This research highlights the potential of AEs and CAEs for attaining a fine clustering and visualization of vegetation types.

TI  - Glacier albedo reduction and drought effects in the extratropical Andes, 1986-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo typically dominates the mass balance of mountain glaciers, though long-term trends and patterns of glacier albedo are seldom explored. We calculated broadband shortwave albedo for glaciers in the central Chilean Andes (33-34 degrees S) using end-of-summer Landsat scenes between 1986 and 2020. We found a high inter-annual variability of glacier-wide albedo that is largely a function of the glacier fractional snow-covered area and the total precipitation of the preceding hydrological year (up to 69% of the inter-annual variance explained). Under the 2010-2020 'Mega Drought' period, the mean albedo, regionally averaged ranging from similar to 0.25-0.5, decreased by -0.05 on average relative to 1986-2009, with the greatest reduction occurring 3500-5000 m a.s.l. In 2020, differences relative to 1986-2009 were -0.14 on average as a result of near-complete absence of late summer snow cover and the driest hydrological year since the Landsat observation period began (similar to 90% reduction of annual precipitation relative to the 1986-2009 period). We found statistically significant, negative trends in glacier ice albedo of up to -0.03 per decade, a trend that would have serious implications for the future water security of the region, because glacier ice melt acts to buffer streamflow shortages under severe drought conditions.

TI  - Estimation of Field-Level NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions from Crop Residue Burning Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Hubei, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue burning is the major biomass burning activity in China, strongly influencing the regional air quality and climate. As the cultivation pattern in China is rather scattered and intricate, it is a challenge to derive an accurate emission inventory for crop residue burning. In this study, we proposed a remote sensing-based method to estimate nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions related to crop residue burning at the field level over Hubei, China. The new method considers differences in emission factors and the spatial distribution for different crop types. Fire radiative power (FRP) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to quantify NOx emissions related to agricultural biomass combustion. The spatial distribution of different crops classified by multisource remote sensing data was used as an a priori constraint. We derived a new NOx emission database for Hubei from 2014 to 2016 with spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km. Significant seasonal patterns were observed from the NOx emission database. Peak NOx emission occurring in October was related to the residue burning in late autumn harvesting. Another peak was observed between January and April, which was due to the frequent burning of stubble before spring sowing. Our results were validated by comparing our emission inventory with geostationary satellite observations, previous studies, global fire emission database (GFED), NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite observations, and measurements from environmental monitoring stations. The comparisons showed NOx emission from GFED database was 47% lower than ours, while the evaluations from most of the statistical studies were significantly higher than our results. The discrepancies were likely related to the differences of methodology and data sources. The spatiotemporal variations of NOx emission in this study showed strong correlations with NO2 VCDs, which agreed well with geostationary satellite observations. A reasonable correlation between in situ NO2 observations and our results in agricultural regions demonstrated that our method is reliable. We believe that the new NOx emission database for crop residue burning derived in this study can potentially improve the understanding of pollution sources and can provide additional information for the design of pollution control measures.

AB  - In view of the low spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture (SM) data, statistical and physical models including random forest (RF), polynomial fitting and DISPATCH are utilized to disaggregate the FY3B microwave SM product from 25 km to 1 km with the synergistic application of Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations and surface elevation parameters. Meanwhile, considering different overpass times of FY3B and other relevant input data source observations, four data combinations are separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SM with above three downscaling method, and the optimized data combination of FY-3B downscaling is proposed by comparison and analysis. Validation is performed from April 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016 with the in-situ measurements of REMEDHUS network and the precipitation time series of ECA&D meteorological site. Experimental results show that RF-based method can achieve the highest comprehensive downscaling accuracy and the best model fitting effect. In addition, the effect of applying FY-3B ascending data to downscale turns out to be better.

TI  - First Level 1 Product Results of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Instrument on the GaoFen-5 Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Instrument (GMI) is a short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral-resolution spectrometer onboard the Chinese satellite GaoFen-5 that uses a spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS) interferometer to acquire interferograms. The GMI was designed to measure and study the source and sink processes of carbon dioxide and methane in the troposphere where the greenhouse effect occurs. In this study, the processing and geometric correction algorithms of the GMI Level 1 product (radiance spectrum) are introduced. The spectral quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) inversion ability of the Level 1 products are analyzed, and the results illustrate that the specifications meet the missions requirements. An initial evaluation of the resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and stability of the radiance spectrum reveals that the overall function and performance are within the design objectives. A comparison between our Level 1 products and the theoretical spectrum shows that the root mean square (rms) of the residual is approximately 0.8, and the Level 1 products of the GMI captured within five months after observations have good spectral stability characteristics (less than 0.005 cm(1) for Band 1, 0.003 cm(1) for Band 2, 0.002 cm(1) for Band 3, and 0.004 cm(1) for Band 4). These results demonstrate that the GMI payload and the processing algorithm all work well and reliably. Furthermore, based on the Level 1 products, a GHG retrieval experiment is carried out, and the results are compared with data from Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON) stations. The initial comparison of the XCO<sub>2</sub> results yields a value of 0.869 for ${R}<^>{2}$ (goodness of fit), 0.51 ppm for bias (mean of absolute error), and 0.53 ppm for ${\sigma }$ (standard deviation of error). Similarly, the XCH<sub>4</sub> comparison yields values of 0.841 for ${R}<^>{2}$ , 4.64 ppb for bias, and 4.66 ppb for $ {\sigma}$ .

TI  - Discrete Ordinate Adding Method (DOAM), a new solver for Advanced Radiative transfer Modeling System (ARMS)
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data assimilation requires a computationally fast and accurate radiative transfer model. Currently, three fast models are commonly used in the Numerical Weather Prediction models (NWP) for satellite data assimilation, including Radiative Transfer for TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV), Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), and Advanced Radiative transfer Modeling System (ARMS). ARMS was initiated in 2018 and is now becoming the third pillar supporting many users in NWP and remote sensing fields. Its radiative transfer solvers (e.g. Doubling Adding method) is inherited from CRTM. In this study, we propose a Discrete Ordinate Adding Method (DOAM) to solve the radiative transfer equation including both solar and thermal source terms. In order to accelerate the DOAM computation, the single scattering approximation is used in the layer with an optical depth less than 10(-8) or a single scattering albedo less than 10(-10). From principles of invariance, the adding method is then applied to link the radiances between the layers. The accuracy of DOAM is evaluated through four benchmark cases. It is shown that the difference between DOAM and DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) decreases with an increase of stream number. The relative bias of the 4-stream DOAM ranges from -5.03 % to 5.92 % in the triple layers of a visible wavelength case, while the maximum bias of the 8-stream DOAM is only about 1 %. The biases can be significantly reduced by the single scattering correction. Comparing to the visible case, the accuracy of the 4-stream DOAM is much higher in the thermal case with a maximum bias -1.69 %. Similar results are also shown in two multiple-layer cases. In the MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) laptop, the 2-stream DOAM only takes 1.68 seconds for calculating azimuthally independent radiance of 3000 profiles in the hyper-spectral oxygen A-band (wavelength ranges from 0.757 mu m to 0.775 mu m), while the 4-stream DOAM takes 4.06 seconds and the 16-stream DOAM takes 45.93 seconds. The time of the 2-, 4- and 16- stream DOAM are 0.86 seconds, 1.09 seconds and 4.34 seconds for calculating azimuthally averaged radiance. DISORT with 16 streams takes 1521.56 seconds and 127.64 seconds under the same condition. As a new solver, DOAM has been integrated into ARMS and is used to simulate the brightness temperatures at MicroWave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) as well as MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) frequencies. The simulations by DOAM are compared to those by Doubling Adding method and accuracy of both solvers shows a general agreement. All the results show that the DOAM is accurate and computational efficient for applications in NWP data assimilation and satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Trends in Axillary Surgery for Treating Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i>: A Korean Population-based Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is common in South Korea. We evaluated the patterns of axillary surgery among patients with DCIS to highlight the need for compliance with the updated national guidelines. We also evaluated whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed in accordance with the national guidelines.Methods: The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Inpatient Sample database was searched for patients with DCIS (2009-2015) to identify axillary surgery patterns by breast surgery type, year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and the location and volume of surgeries for DCIS at the hospital. The rates of SLNB and axillary dissection were compared using descriptive statistics and univariate analyses. Analyses were also conducted using the chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression analysis.Results: We identified 16,315 Korean women who underwent surgery for DCIS, including 11,292 cases of SLNB (69.2%) and 131 cases of axillary lymph node dissection (0.8%). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was performed in 10,323 patients (63.3%) with an SLNB rate of 56.0 %, while total mastectomy (TM) was performed in 5,992 patients (36.7%), with an SLNB rate of 92.0%. During 2009-2015, the SLNB rate during TM increased from 88.23% to 92.80%. SLNB was influenced by hospital region and surgical volume, and hospitals performing low volumes of surgeries were significantly more likely to perform SLNB regardless of the surgery type (odds ratio, 1.372; 95% confidence interval, 1.265-1.488).Conclusion: Although the Korean guidelines recommend SLNB for all TM procedures and select BCS procedures for DCIS, relatively high rates of SLNB were performed for BCS, and there was inter-hospital variability in performing SLNB. Improved compliance with the guidelines by the surgeons is critical for Korean patients with DCIS.

TI  - Proposing an effective and inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities.

TI  - Fusing simulated GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data for regional aboveground biomass mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for better understanding the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.

TI  - Biliary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and enzymatic biomarkers in <i>Eugerres brasilianus</i> along four tropical estuaries
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in bile and biochemical biomarkers were evaluated in Brazilian mojarra Eugerres brasilianus along four estuaries in northeastern Brazil. Bile PAHs naphthalene, phenanthrene chrysene, pyrene and benzo [al pyrene were lowest at Formoso River Estuarine System (FRES), an area with low population density focused on tourism. Fish sampled in Suape Estuarine Complex (SEC), where a growing industrial port complex is established indicated higher naphthalene and pyrene concentrations compared with FRES. Fish sampled in highly urbanized and populated Bacia do Pina Estuarine Complex (BPEC) and Barra de Jangada Estuarine System (BJES) indicated an increase in all PAHs compared to FRES. Activities of phase 1 Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, phase 2 glutathione-S-transferase and antioxidant defense catalase were induced up to 20, 2 and 2-fold in BJES and BPEC compared to FRES. This study confirms E. brasilianus as an important sentinel species, providing baseline information for these tropical estuaries with different degrees of anthropogenic pressure.

TI  - Glacier change and glacier runoff variation in the Himalayan Baspa river basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the changes in glaciers and their impact on melt runoff is significant to assess the availability of water resources in the Himalayan basins. In this study, the spatial processes in Hydrology (SPHY) model has been incorporated with variable degree-day factors coupled with temperature index model in the Baspa river basin, a major tributary of Satluj River, located in Western Himalaya. The temporal glacier maps derived from the LANDSAT satellite sensors and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived snow covered area (SCA) maps have been used to compute the snow and glacier melt runoff separately. The SCA maps generated through the model were found comparable to the MODIS derived SCA maps for the years 2010 and 2018. Model simulation results showed that SPHY based computed flow at the outlet i.e. Sangla gauge was found satisfactory when compared to the observed flow and R-2 computed >0.7. The contribution from Glacier melt has been found to be reduced from 18 to 12% while Snow melt contribution increased from 58 to 64% from 2000 to 2018. On the basis of analysis of the 17 watersheds (i.e. dominated by snow and glaciers) out of 30 watersheds created in the basin, the flow from Glacier melt in glacier dominated watersheds is increasing while in other watersheds it is reducing due to reduced glacier cover. On an average, Glacier melt has decreased 14% and 44%, Snow melt increased 24 and 42% and Rain flow (rainfall induced runoff) 31 and 40% for the year 2011 to 2018 with respect to the year 2003 from these 17 watersheds. As per SPHY, corresponding to glacier map of the year 2000, the glacier ice volume has been computed around 13.41 km(3), while for the glacier map of 2018, it has been reduced around 10.99 km(3).

TI  - Traceability of the Sentinel-3 SLSTR Level-1 Infrared Radiometric Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing uncertainties in satellite datasets used for Earth observation can be a daunting prospect because of the many processing stages and input data required to convert raw detector counts to calibrated radiances. The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) was designed to provide measurements of the Earth's surface for operational and climate applications. In this paper the authors describe the traceability chain and derivation of uncertainty estimates for the thermal infrared channel radiometry. Starting from the instrument model, the contributing input quantities are identified to build up an uncertainty effects tree. The characterisation of each input effect is described, and uncertainty estimates provided which are used to derive the combined uncertainties as a function of scene temperature. The SLSTR Level-1 data products provide uncertainty estimates for fully random effects (noise) and systematic effects that can be mapped for each image pixel, examples of which are shown.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of the Covid-19 Lockdown Measures on Nitrogen Dioxide Levels throughout Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the effect of the lockdown measures on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Europe is analysed by a statistical model approach based on a generalised additive model (GAM). The GAM is designed to find relationships between various meteorological parameters and temporal metrics (day of week, season, etc.) on the one hand and the level of pollutants on the other. The model is first trained on measurement data from almost 2000 monitoring stations during 2015-2019 and then applied to the same stations in 2020, providing predictions of expected concentrations in the absence of a lockdown. The difference between the modelled levels and the actual measurements from 2020 is used to calculate the impact of the lockdown measures adjusted for confounding effects, such as meteorology and temporal trends. The study is focused on April 2020, the month with the strongest reductions in NO2, as well as on the gradual recovery until the end of July. Significant differences between the countries are identified, with the largest NO2 reductions in Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain and Portugal and the smallest in eastern countries (Poland and Hungary). The model is found to perform best for urban and suburban sites. A comparison between the found relative changes in urban surface NO2 data during the lockdown and the corresponding changes in tropospheric vertical NO2 column density as observed by the TROPOMI instrument on Sentinel-5P revealed good agreement despite substantial differences in the observing method.

TI  - Combined Geometric Positioning and Performance Analysis of Multi-Resolution Optical Imageries from Satellite and Aerial Platforms Based on Weighted RFM Bundle Adjustment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined geometric positioning using images with different resolutions and imaging sensors is being increasingly widely utilized in practical engineering applications. In this work, we attempt to perform the combined geometric positioning and performance analysis of multi-resolution optical images from satellite and aerial platforms based on weighted rational function model (RFM) bundle adjustment without using ground control points (GCPs). Firstly, we introduced an integrated image matching method combining least squares and phase correlation. Next, for bundle adjustment, a combined model of the geometric positioning based on weighted RFM bundle adjustment was derived, and a method for weight determination was given to make the weights of all image points variable. Finally, we conducted experiments using a case study in Shanghai with ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imagery, GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, and Digital Mapping Camera (DMC) aerial imagery to validate the effectiveness of the proposed weighted method, and to investigate the positioning accuracy by using different combination scenarios of multi-resolution heterogeneous images. The experimental results indicate that the proposed weighted method is effective, and the positioning accuracy of different combination scenarios can give a good reference for the combined geometric positioning of multi-stereo heterogeneous images in future practical engineering applications.

TI  - Spatial variation of aquaculture ponds in the Bohai Rim region during 1989-2019
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture pond is an important form of mariculture. Studying the temporal and spatial changes of aquaculture ponds in the Bohai Sea region is of significant reference for evaluating the development of mariculture in the region. Based on a total of 44 Landsat images from 1989 to 2019, the vector distribution data of aquaculture ponds were obtained by visual interpretation. On this basis, the spatial variation characteristics of aquaculture ponds in the Bohai Sea region in the past 30 years were analyzed by average center analysis and standard deviation ellipse. The results show that: (1) from 1989 to 2019, the area of aquaculture pond showed a trend of increasing year by year, with a total increase of 450.15 km(2). (2) The average center of the pond gradually shifts from the vicinity of Bohai Bay to the northeast along the line from Laizhou Bay to Liaodong Bay. (3) The centripetal distribution of the culture ponds is becoming more and more obvious, and its distribution area gradually moves from land to sea. (4) Obvious spatial variation were mainly in Laizhou Bay, Bohai Bay and Liaoning Bay.

TI  - Analysis of variations and controls of evapotranspiration over major Indian River Basins (1982-2014)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses long-term (1982-2014) estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) over four major river basins of India with the primary objective of understanding the factors controlling its space-time variability. Here we utilize terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) estimates, computed from WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) simulations, in monthly water balance computations to obtain the best available estimates of long-term ET for the study region. Trend analysis shows significant increase in annual ET over Ganga (2.72 mm/year) and Krishna (3.90 mm/year) River Basins, while in Godavari and Mahanadi River Basins the observed trends are insignificant. The relative contribution of potential factors (represented by precipitation, soil moisture, temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) that affect the variability of monthly ET is assessed using Hierarchical Partitioning Analysis (HPA). Results reveal that ET variance is largely controlled by the availability of water (represented by precipitation and soil moisture) in all the river basins. Precipitation (soil moisture) accounts for 65% (16%), 70% (20%), 77% (15%) and 67% (18%) of the variability in monthly ET over the Ganga, Godavari, Krishna and Mahanadi River Basins, respectively. Similarly, highest contributions from precipitation are also observed in annual scale variations of ET in all the river basins. Multiple regression analysis performed to assess the overall influence of controlling variables demonstrate that precipitation, soil moisture, temperature and NDVI explain 84% (Ganga), 86% (Godavari), 91% (Krishna) and 82% ( Mahanadi) of variations observed in monthly ET over the respective basins. Results presented in this study have major implications for the understanding of ET variability, appropriateness and discrepancies in different ET products and compliment the contemporary efforts of extending GRACE-based ET estimates in space and time.

TI  - An influenza A (H3N2) virus outbreak in the Kingdom of Cambodia during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Global influenza virus circulation decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly due to widespread community mitigation measures. Cambodia eased some COVID-19 mitigation measures in June and July 2020. On 20 August a cluster of respiratory illnesses occurred among residents of a pagoda, including people who tested positive for influenza A but none who were positive for SARS-CoV-2.Methods: A response team was deployed on 25 August 2020. People with influenza-like illness (ILI) were asked questions regarding demographics, illness, personal prevention measures, and residential arrangements. Respiratory swabs were tested for influenza and SARS-Cov-2 by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and viruses were sequenced. Sentinel surveillance data were analyzed to assess recent trends in influenza circulation in the community.Results: Influenza A (H3N2) viruses were identified during sentinel surveillance in Cambodia in July 2020 prior to the reported pagoda outbreak. Among the 362 pagoda residents, 73 (20.2%) ILI cases were identified and 40 were tested, where 33/40 (82.5%) confirmed positive for influenza A (H3N2). All 40 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 73 residents with ILI, none were vaccinated against influenza, 47 (64%) clustered in 3/8 sleeping quarters, 20 (27%) reported often wearing a mask, 27 (36%) reported often washing hands, and 11 (15%) reported practicing social distancing. All viruses clustered within clade 3c2. A1 close to strains circulating in Australia in 2020.Conclusions: Circulation of influenza viruses began in the community following the relaxation of national COVID-19 mitigation measures, and prior to the outbreak in a pagoda with limited social distancing. Continued surveillance and influenza vaccination are required to limit the impact of influenza globally. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - Even More Rapidly Rotating Pre-main-sequence M Dwarfs with Highly Structured Light Curves: An Initial Survey in the Lower Centaurus-Crux and Upper Centaurus-Lupus Associations
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Using K2, we recently discovered a new type of periodic photometric variability while analyzing the light curves of members of Upper Sco. The 23 exemplars of this new variability type are all mid-M dwarfs, with short rotation periods. Their phased light curves have one or more broad flux dips or multiple arcuate structures which are not explicable by photospheric spots or eclipses by solid bodies. Now, using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we have searched for this type of variability in the other major sections of Sco-Cen, Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC). We identify 28 stars with the same light curve morphologies. We find no obvious difference between the Upper Sco and the UCL/LCC representatives of this class in terms of their light curve morphologies, periods, or variability amplitudes. The physical mechanism behind this variability is unknown, but as a possible clue we show that the rapidly rotating mid-M dwarfs in UCL/LCC have slightly different colors from the slowly rotating M dwarfs-they either have a blue excess (hot spots?) or a red excess (warm dust?). One of the newly identified stars (TIC242407571) has a very striking light curve morphology. At about every 0.05 in phase are features that resemble icicles. The icicles arise because there is a second periodic system whose main feature is a broad flux dip. Using a toy model, we show that the observed light curve morphology results only if the ratio of the two periods and the flux-dip width are carefully arranged.

TI  - Outcomes from international field trials with Male <i>Aedes</i> Sound Traps: Frequency-dependent effectiveness in capturing target species in relation to bycatch abundance
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryThe continued global expansion of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which transmit viruses causing dengue and Zika, necessitates the further development of effective mosquito traps for monitoring and predicting transmission risk. Mosquito sound traps attract male mosquitoes by producing a frequency which mimics the wingbeat sound of female mosquitoes. As few insects will respond to such sounds, these traps can be highly species-specific, saving significant person-time to sort samples, potentially paving the way for more accurate smart-trap systems and reduced surveillance costs. To date, limited research has occurred within field-settings investigating the capture rates of male mosquitoes in sound traps set to different frequencies. To this point, we performed trials in dengue endemic environments to quantify capture rates of mosquitoes in Male Aedes Sound Traps set to different frequencies in Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Belize. We found that both male Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus responded positively to frequencies between 450 and 600 Hz. Additionally, male Culex mosquitoes were also caught, but at lower abundances in traps set to higher sound frequencies. These traps, when set to 550 Hz, effectively capture male Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus with limited bycatch.Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus vector dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. With both species expanding their global distributions at alarming rates, developing effective surveillance equipment is a continuing priority for public health researchers. Sound traps have been shown, in limited testing, to be highly species-specific when emitting a frequency corresponding to a female mosquito wingbeat. Determining male mosquito capture rates in sound traps based on lure frequencies in endemic settings is the next step for informed deployment of these surveillance tools. We field-evaluated Male Aedes Sound Traps (MASTs) set to either 450 Hz, 500 Hz, 550 Hz or 600 Hz for sampling Aedes aegypti and/or Aedes albopictus and compared catch rates to BG-Sentinel traps within Pacific (Madang, Papua New Guinea) and Latin American (Molas, Mexico and Orange Walk Town, Belize) locations. MASTs set to 450-550 Hz consistently caught male Ae. aegypti at rates comparable to BG-Sentinel traps in all locations. A peak in male Ae. albopictus captures in MASTs set at 550 Hz was observed, with the lowest mean abundance recorded in MASTs set to 450 Hz. While significantly higher abundances of male Culex were sampled in MASTs emitting lower relative frequencies in Molas, overall male Culex were captured in significantly lower abundances in the MASTs, relative to BG-Sentinel traps within all locations. Finally, significant differences in rates at which male Aedes and Culex were positively detected in trap-types per weekly collections were broadly consistent with trends in abundance data per trap-type. MASTs at 550 Hz effectively captured both male Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus while greatly reducing bycatch, especially male Culex, in locations where dengue transmission has occurred. This high species-specificity of the MAST not only reduces staff-time required to sort samples, but can also be exploited to develop an accurate smart-trap system-both outcomes potentially reducing public health program expenses.

TI  - Agricultural Crop Change in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, from 2004 to 2017
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Willamette Valley, bounded to the west by the Coast Range and to the east by the Cascade Mountains, is the largest river valley completely confined to Oregon. The fertile valley soils combined with a temperate, marine climate create ideal agronomic conditions for seed production. Historically, seed cropping systems in the Willamette Valley have focused on the production of grass and forage seeds. In addition to growing over two-thirds of the nation's cool-season grass seed, cropping systems in the Willamette Valley include a diverse rotation of over 250 commodities for forage, seed, food, and cover cropping applications. Tracking the sequence of crop rotations that are grown in the Willamette Valley is paramount to answering a broad spectrum of agronomic, environmental, and economical questions. Landsat imagery covering approximately 25,303 km(2) were used to identify agricultural crops in production from 2004 to 2017. The agricultural crops were distinguished by classifying images primarily acquired by three platforms: Landsat 5 (2003-2013), Landsat 7 (2003-2017), and Landsat 8 (2013-2017). Before conducting maximum likelihood remote sensing classification, the images acquired by the Landsat 7 were pre-processed to reduce the impact of the scan line corrector failure. The corrected images were subsequently used to classify 35 different land-use classes and 137 unique two-year-long sequences of 57 classes of non-urban and non-forested land-use categories from 2004 through 2014. Our final data product uses new and previously published results to classify the western Oregon landscape into 61 different land use classes, including four majority-rule-over-time super-classes and 57 regular classes of annually disturbed agricultural crops (19 classes), perennial crops (20 classes), forests (13 classes), and urban developments (5 classes). These publicly available data can be used to inform and support environmental and agricultural land-use studies.

TI  - Estimating Coastal Chlorophyll-A Concentration from Time-Series OLCI Data Based on Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) is an important parameter of water quality and its concentration can be directly retrieved from satellite observations. The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), a new-generation water-color sensor onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, is an excellent tool for marine environmental monitoring. In this study, we introduce a new machine learning model, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), for estimating time-series chl-a concentration in Fujian's coastal waters using multitemporal OLCI data and in situ data. We applied the Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) processor to obtain OLCI band reflectance and constructed four spectral indices based on OLCI feature bands as supplementary input features. We also used root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-2 as performance indicators. The results indicate that the addition of spectral indices can easily improve the prediction accuracy of the model, and normalized fluorescence height index (NFHI) has the best performance, with an RMSE of 0.38 mu g/L, MAE of 0.22 mu g/L, MAPE of 28.33%, and R-2 of 0.785. Moreover, we used the well-known band ratio and three-band methods for chl-a estimation validation, and another two OLCI chl-a products were adopted for comparison (OC4Me chl-a and Inverse Modelling Technique (IMT) Neural Net chl-a). The results confirmed that the LightGBM model outperforms the traditional methods and OLCI chl-a products. This study provides an effective remote sensing technique for coastal chl-a concentration estimation and promotes the advantage of OLCI data in ocean color remote sensing.

TI  - A High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) for Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data: Development and verification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of land cover and aerosol types, the high-precision retrieval of land aerosol properties is challenging. A land general aerosol (LaGA) algorithm called the High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) is proposed for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor over East Asia. In this algorithm, a monthly spectral base reflectance ratio library was constructed to obtain a pixel-by-pixel spectral reflectance relationship model. Statistical methods were used to obtain aerosol types in China, and a linearization scheme for the aerosol types was proposed based on sensitivity analysis. Based on these techniques, HiPARA achieved a completely dynamic determination of the surface reflectance and aerosol types. The new multiband aerosol characteristic retrieval strategy can return two parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA). The AOD retrieved from HiPARA showed high consistency with AERONET AOD measurements, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.939, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.082, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.113, ratios that meet an expected error (EE) of 0.825, and ratios that meet a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) error of 0.339. Comparison of the HiPARA retrieved AOD with other operational aerosol products revealed that the accuracy of the HiPARA product was better than those of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) product (R < 0.9, RMSE > 0.175), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products (Dark Target (DT) algorithm, R = 0.907, RMSE = 0.203; Deep Blue (DB) algorithm, R = 0.909, RMSE = 0.139) and Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AERDB product (R = 0.932, RMSE = 0.117). The HiPARA fitting line was close to 1:1 (i.e., y = x). The aerosol products were further evaluated for four extreme aerosol events: a smoke aerosol event, a haze aerosol event, a dust aerosol event, and a continuous aerosol variation event. Observation of the true-color images and AOD retrievals showed that the HiPARA AOD distribution matched the true-color images very well. The JAXA product had abnormal values and spatial discontinuities. The MODIS and VIIRS products were not as good as the HiPARA product in terms of spatial coverage. In the application to continuous monitoring of a dust event, the HiPARA AOD captured the variations in and intensity of the dust aerosols very well. These results suggested the robustness of HiPARA and its potential for monitoring extreme pollution events with high precision and high temporal resolution.

TI  - Disparities in Care Outcomes in Atlanta Between Black and White Men Who Have Sex With Men Living With HIV: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study (Engage[men]t)
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The US HIV epidemic is driven by infections in men who have sex with men and characterized by profound disparities in HIV prevalence and outcomes for Black Americans. Black men who have sex with men living with HIV are reported to have worse care outcomes than other men who have sex with men, but the reasons for these health inequities are not clear. We planned a prospective observational cohort study to help understand the reasons for worse HIV care outcomes for Black versus White men who have sex with men in Atlanta.Objective: The aim of this study is to identify individual, dyadic, network, neighborhood, and structural factors that explain disparities in HIV viral suppression between Black and White men who have sex with men living with HIV in Atlanta.Methods: Black and White men who have sex with men living with HIV were enrolled in a prospective cohort study with in-person visits and viral suppression assessments at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months; additional surveys of care and risk behaviors at 3, 6, and 18 months; analysis of care received outside the study through public health reporting; and qualitative interviews for participants who experienced sentinel health events (eg, loss of viral suppression) during the study. The study is based on the Bronfenbrenner socioecological theoretical model.Results: Men who have sex with men (n=400) were enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017 in Atlanta. Follow-up was completed in June 2019; final study retention was 80% at 24 months.Conclusions: Health disparities for Black men who have sex with men are hypothesized to be driven by structural racism and barriers to care. Observational studies are important to document and quantify the specific factors within the socioecological framework that account for disparities in viral suppression. In the meantime, it is also critical to push for steps to improve access to care, including Medicaid expansion in Southern states, such as Georgia, which have not yet moved to expand Medicaid.

TI  - Orographic Factors as a Predictor of the Spread of the Siberian Silk Moth Outbreak in the Mountainous Southern Taiga Forests of Siberia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is dedicated to solving an urgent problem associated with the large-scale destruction of taiga forests by Siberian silk moth (Dendrolimus sibiricus) outbreaks. The dynamics of the damage to dark coniferous forest stands induced by the Siberian silk moth outbreaks in mid-altitude mountains were studied. A hypothesis was formulated based on the fundamental influence of the orography on the phytophage's dispersal within the landscape, along with the climate, which acts as a secondary predictor-a catalyst for outbreaks. The study was carried out using Landsat-8 satellite imagery time-series (from 2018 to 2020). The data were verified using a field forest pathological survey of the territory. An assessment of the defoliated forest area and damage association with the landscape was carried out using an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model. The assessment was aimed to detail the forecast parameters for an outbreak development in mid-altitude mountains using the orographic features-altitude, terrain slope, and slope aspect. Early warnings of phytophagous insect outbreaks in mountain southern taiga should be focused on the permanent monitoring of dark coniferous stands of the mossy group of forest types, covering altitude levels from 400 to 600 m, located on gentle terrains and slopes of up to 15 degrees. The greatest vulnerability to phytophage impacts was characterized as areas located at altitudes from 400 to 600 m. The upper limit of D. sibiricus distribution was 900 m above sea level. The results obtained provide comprehensive information on the Siberian silk moth potential reserves within the study area with the possibility of extrapolation to similar territories. The data will make it possible to model pest outbreaks based on orography and improve the forest pathological monitoring methods at the regional level.

TI  - Reconstructing daily 30 m NDVI over complex agricultural landscapes using a crop reference curve approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor remote sensing data fusion technologies have been developed and widely applied in recent years, providing a feasible and economical solution to increase the availability of high spatial and temporal resolution data. These methods, however, have been challenging to apply in highly heterogeneous areas, especially in complex agricultural landscapes where there are rapid changes at small scales, while features at larger scales change more slowly. In this study, we developed a novel method to reconstruct daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat and Landsat-like platforms, and the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). This method utilizes a crop reference curve (CRC) approach, in which a set of NDVI time series are extracted from pure MODIS pixels (250 m resolution) identified using the CDL, and then used to fit Landsat-like observations (30 m). The CRC based method was applied over a complex agricultural landscape in the Choptank River watershed on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Landsat data from 2013 and 2014 and Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data from 2018 were used to reconstruct 30 m daily NDVI maps for major crop types. Results show that the relative error (RE) in reconstructed NDVI is around 6-8% during periods of rapid crop growth, and 3-5% during peak periods when growth is slow. The accuracy of the CRC method outperforms a standard image pair-based data fusion algorithm (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model; STARFM), which yields RE of 4-9% in slow-growth periods and 10-16% in fast-growth periods when clear Landsat images are scarce. The CRC method was also compared with time-series data fusion methods, including a harmonic fitting model and the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) model. The results show that CRC gives similar results when the Landsat-like image availability is high (around 27 images per year), but outperforms other methods when availability is limited (less than 15 images per year). The reconstructed NDVI time series for corn, soybean, winter wheat/soybean and forest at 30-m resolution show clear phenological patterns at the sub-field scale. The resulting 30-m NDVI timeseries data provide useful information for mapping crop phenology and monitoring crop condition in complex agricultural landscapes, especially for complex double-cropping areas. However, the input requirement of an accurate 30-m crop classification map constrains its application to areas and periods where classifications are available.

TI  - Improving the Retrieval of Crop Canopy Chlorophyll Content Using Vegetation Index Combinations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of crop canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) can be used to monitor vegetation productivity, manage crop resources, and control disease and pests. However, making these estimates using conventional ground-based methods is time-consuming and resource-intensive when deployed over large areas. Although vegetation indices (VIs), derived from satellite sensor data, have been used to estimate CCC, they suffer from problems related to spectral saturation, soil background, and canopy structure. A new method was, therefore, proposed for combining the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and LAI-related vegetation indices (LAI-VIs) to increase the accuracy of CCC estimates for wheat and soybeans. The PROSAIL-D canopy reflectance model was used to simulate canopy spectra that were resampled to match the spectral response functions of the MERIS carried on the ENVISAT satellite. Combinations of the MTCI and LAI-VIs were then used to estimate CCC via univariate linear regression, binary linear regression and random forest regression. The accuracy using the field spectra and MERIS data was determined based on field CCC measurements. All the MTCI and LAI-VI combinations for the selected regression techniques resulted in more accurate estimates of CCC than the use of the MTCI alone (field spectra data for soybeans and wheat: R-2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 77.10 mu g cm(-2); MERIS satellite data for soybeans: R-2 = 0.24 and RMSE = 136.54 mu g cm(-2)). The random forest regression resulted in better accuracy than the other two linear regression models. The combination resulting in the best accuracy was the MTCI and MTVI2 and random forest regression, with R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 37.76 mu g cm(-2) (field spectra data) and R-2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 47.96 mu g cm(-2) (MERIS satellite data). Combining the MTCI and a LAI-VI represents a further step towards improving the accuracy of estimation CCC based on multispectral satellite sensor data.

TI  - Establishing a prediction model of axillary nodal burden based on the combination of CT and ultrasound findings and the clinicopathological features in patients with early-stage breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node (ALN) management in early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) patients has become less invasive during the past decades. Here, we tried to explore whether high nodal burden (HNB) in ESBC patients could be predicted preoperatively, so as to avoid unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: The clinicopathological and imaging data of patients with early invasive breast cancer (cT(1-2)N(0)M(0)) were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the risk factors of axillary HNB in ESBC patients, and a risk prediction model of HNB was established.Results: HNB was identified in 105 (8.0%) of 1,300 ESBC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that estrogen receptors (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, number of abnormal lymph nodes (LNs) on computed tomography (CT), and axillary score on ultrasound (US) were the risk factors of HNB (all P<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the prediction model was 0.914, with the sensitivity being 85.7% and the specificity being 82.4%. The calibration curve showed that the prediction model had good performance.Conclusions: As a valuable tool for predicting HNB in ESBC patients, this newly established model helps clinicians to make reasonable axillary surgery decisions and thus avoid unnecessary SLNB.

TI  - Developing geographic weighted regression (GWR) technique for monitoring soil salinity using sentinel-2 multispectral imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a widespread natural hazard that negatively influences soil fertility and crop productivity. Using the potential of earth observation data and remote sensing technologies provides an opportunity to address this environmental issue and makes it possible to identify salt-affected regions accurately. While most of the utilized methods and model development techniques for monitoring soil salinity to date have been globally considered and tried to detect salinity and create predictive maps with a single regression algorithm, fewer studies have investigated the potential of local models and weighted regression techniques for estimating soil salinity. Accordingly, this research deals with monitoring surface soil salinity by the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery using the geographic weighted regression (GWR) technique. The field study was conducted in an area that has suffered from salinization, and the salinity of several soil samples was measured to be used as a source of ground truth data. The most efficient satellite features, which accurately predict surface soil salinity by its higher spectral reflectance, were derived from the Sentinel-2 data to be used as explanatory variables in the analysis. The GWR algorithm was then implemented with a fixed Gaussian kernel, and the optimized bandwidth was calculated in a calibration process using the cross-validation score (CV score). The results of the analysis proved that the GWR method has a great capability to predict soil salinity with an accuracy of two decimal places. The visual interpretation of the local estimates of coefficients and local t-values for each predictor variable has also been provided, which highlights the local variations in the study site. Finally, the achieved results were compared with the outcomes obtained from implementing two global regression techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which confirmed the higher performance of the GWR algorithm.

TI  - Consistent Long-Term Monthly Coastal Wetland Vegetation Monitoring Using a Virtual Satellite Constellation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monthly coastal wetland vegetation monitoring is the key to quantifying the effects of natural and anthropogenic events, such as severe storms, as well as assessing restoration efforts. Remote sensing data products such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), alongside emerging data analysis techniques, have enabled broader investigations into their dynamics at monthly to decadal time scales. However, NDVI data suffer from cloud contamination making periods within the time series sparse and often unusable during meteorologically active seasons. This paper proposes a virtual constellation for NDVI consisting of the red and near-infrared bands of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer. The virtual constellation uses time-space-spectrum relationships from 2014 to 2018 and a random forest to produce synthetic NDVI imagery rectified to Landsat 8 format. Over the sample coverage area near Apalachicola, Florida, USA, the synthetic NDVI showed good visual coherence with observed Landsat 8 NDVI. Comparisons between the synthetic and observed NDVI showed Root Mean Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination (R-2) values of 0.0020 sr(-1) and 0.88, respectively. The results suggest that the virtual constellation was able to mitigate NDVI data loss due to clouds and may have the potential to do the same for other data. The ability to participate in a virtual constellation for a useful end product such as NDVI adds value to existing satellite missions and provides economic justification for future projects.

M3  - Review
AB  - Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has been increasingly used in patients with atrial fibrillation who are poor candidates for long-term oral anticoagulation. The presence of a left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus is a contraindication for percutaneous LAAC. Despite oral anticoagulation, persistent thrombus is not uncommon. We describe the use of transcatheter cerebral embolic protection with the Sentinel cerebral protection system during LAAC using WATCHMAN in two atrial fibrillation patients who had persistent LAA thrombus despite oral anticoagulation.

TI  - Geological hazard risk assessment of line landslide based on remotely sensed data and GIS
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of economy, a large number of human development activities in the natural environment have directly or indirectly increased the possibility of geological disasters. Every year a large number of geological disasters pose a serious threat to the safety of human life and property, and the effective management of geological disasters has become one of the major difficulties facing our country. This paper mainly studies the risk assessment of geological hazards of the line landslide based on remote sensing and GIS. Combined with detailed survey items of geological disasters in a certain area, this paper evaluates and analyzes the distribution and development characteristics of landslide geological disasters in the study area. Disaster assessment is an important part of disaster prevention and mitigation, and provides important references for local infrastructure construction, tourism development, urban planning and regional economic development. It can be known from the experiments in this paper that the evaluation results based on the hierarchical entropy variable weight method are more accurate, and the accuracy rate is 67%. The hierarchical entropy variable weight method can not only synthesize the rich experience of experts, but also reduce the subjective impact by introducing an entropy algorithm, thereby obtaining more accurate evaluation results.

TI  - A Novel Unsupervised Classification Method for Sandy Land Using Fully Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification based on polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is an emerging technology, and recent years have seen the introduction of various classification methods that have been proven to be effective to identify typical features of many terrain types. Among the many regions of the study, the Hunshandake Sandy Land in Inner Mongolia, China stands out for its vast area of sandy land, variety of ground objects, and intricate structure, with more irregular characteristics than conventional land cover. Accounting for the particular surface features of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, an unsupervised classification method based on new decomposition and large-scale spectral clustering with superpixels (ND-LSC) is proposed in this study. Firstly, the polarization scattering parameters are extracted through a new decomposition, rather than other decomposition approaches, which gives rise to more accurate feature vector estimate. Secondly, a large-scale spectral clustering is applied as appropriate to meet the massive land and complex terrain. More specifically, this involves a beginning sub-step of superpixels generation via the Adaptive Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (ASLIC) algorithm when the feature vector combined with the spatial coordinate information are employed as input, and subsequently a sub-step of representative points selection as well as bipartite graph formation, followed by the spectral clustering algorithm to complete the classification task. Finally, testing and analysis are conducted on the RADARSAT-2 fully PolSAR dataset acquired over the Hunshandake Sandy Land in 2016. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments compared with several classification methods are conducted to show that proposed method can significantly improve performance on classification.

TI  - A review of current air quality indexes and improvements under the multi-contaminant air pollution exposure
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The air quality is one of the major concerns in the urban environment due to the rapid changes in pollutant emissions driven by complex and intensive human activities. Therefore, quantification of the urban air quality has become an essential need for both urban residents and authorities to quickly assess air quality conditions. To reach this aim, the air quality index (AQI) is the primary way to better understand the urban air quality. However, the varied AQIs in different countries are difficult to directly compare due to the varied calculation methods. Thus, this research presents an updated review of the major AQIs worldwide by dividing them into two categories: single- and multi-contaminant-oriented AQIs. Single-contaminant-oriented AQIs are based on the maximum value of individual pollutants and are applied in most countries with location-dependent standards, such as the United States, China, the United Kingdom and New South Wales, Australia. However, these may greatly underestimate the impact of multiple contaminants, be difficult to dynamically update or to be compared internationally. Moreover, multi-contaminant-oriented AQIs are available in the literature, which consider the combined effects of exposure to multiple contaminants. Among these AQIs, arithmetic pollutant aggregation simply integrates pollutants in a linear or nonlinear way, and weighted pollutant aggregation further assigns varied weights from different perspectives. Combining the advantages and disadvantages of the existing AQIs, the general air quality health index (GAQHI) is proposed as a pollutant-aggregated, local health-based AQI paradigm suitable for the present complex multi-contaminant situation. It provides a direction for the construction of a more accurate, consistent and comparable AQI system and can help both researchers and governments improve human well-being and achieve sustainable development.

TI  - Mapping Center Pivot Irrigation Systems in the Southern Amazon from Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation systems play an important role in agriculture. Center pivot irrigation systems are popular in many countries as they are labor-saving and water consumption efficient. Monitoring the distribution of center pivot irrigation systems can provide important information for agricultural production, water consumption and land use. Deep learning has become an effective method for image classification and object detection. In this paper, a new method to detect the precise shape of center pivot irrigation systems is proposed. The proposed method combines a lightweight real-time object detection network (PVANET) based on deep learning, an image classification model (GoogLeNet) and accurate shape detection (Hough transform) to detect and accurately delineate center pivot irrigation systems and their associated circular shape. PVANET is lightweight and fast and GoogLeNet can reduce the false detections associated with PVANET, while Hough transform can accurately detect the shape of center pivot irrigation systems. Experiments with Sentinel-2 images in Mato Grosso achieved a precision of 95% and a recall of 95.5%, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, with the accurate shape of center pivot irrigation systems detected, the area of irrigation in the region was estimated.

TI  - Advanced Fully Convolutional Networks for Agricultural Field Boundary Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. On the other hand, the automated detection of field boundaries is a challenging task due to their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems making field boundaries vaguely defined. In this paper, we propose a strategy for field boundary detection based on the fully convolutional network architecture called ResU-Net. The benefits of this model are two-fold: first, residual units ease training of deep networks. Second, rich skip connections within the network could facilitate information propagation, allowing us to design networks with fewer parameters but better performance in comparison with the traditional U-Net model. An extensive experimental analysis is performed over the whole of Denmark using Sentinel-2 images and comparing several U-Net and ResU-Net field boundary detection algorithms. The presented results show that the ResU-Net model has a better performance with an average F-1 score of 0.90 and average Jaccard coefficient of 0.80 in comparison to the U-Net model with an average F-1 score of 0.88 and an average Jaccard coefficient of 0.77.

TI  - Monitoring of Power Towers' Movement Using Persistent Scatterer SAR Interferometry in South West of Tehran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tehran basin has been increasingly affected by subsidence during the last few decades due to groundwater withdrawal. Hence, the study of the strength of the power towers (PTs) of transmission lines, as vital structures, is an important subject. In this paper, the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method was applied on data stacks from two satellites (i.e., X-band COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and C-band Sentinel-1A (S-1A)) obtained between 2014 and 2016 to investigate the deformation and the exact amount of displacement in each PT of the area of interest. Based on the results, during the same time interval (between October 2014 and February 2016), the vertical velocities calculated using CSK and S-1A were about -86 and -79 mm/y, respectively. Although the CSK data analysis resulted in a better displacement interpretation of PTs, due to its high resolution and shorter wavelength, the S-1 data analysis also demonstrated sufficient persistent scatterer (PS) points. The research proves that most of the PTs along a transmission line are affected by high land subsidence, which puts them in a serious jeopardy. They must be constantly monitored to ensure their safety and accurate operation. The results are in complete agreement with information of the existing global positioning system (GPS) station in our study area and also the observations of two piezometric wells with declining trends in the groundwater reservoir, which has the greatest effect on the subsidence rate in this area. The analysis revealed that the strength of PTs is at a high risk.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Formosat-2 and Landsat-8 Satellite Images: A Comparison of "Super Resolution-Then-Blend" and "Blend-Then-Super Resolution" Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal fusion technique has the advantages of generating time-series images with high-spatial and high-temporal resolution from coarse-resolution to fine-resolution images. A hybrid fusion method that integrates image blending (i.e., spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, STARFM) and super-resolution (i.e., very deep super resolution, VDSR) techniques for the spatiotemporal fusion of 8 m Formosat-2 and 30 m Landsat-8 satellite images is proposed. Two different fusion approaches, namely Blend-then-Super-Resolution and Super-Resolution (SR)-then-Blend, were developed to improve the results of spatiotemporal fusion. The SR-then-Blend approach performs SR before image blending. The SR refines the image resampling stage on generating the same pixel-size of coarse- and fine-resolution images. The Blend-then-SR approach is aimed at refining the spatial details after image blending. Several quality indices were used to analyze the quality of the different fusion approaches. Experimental results showed that the performance of the hybrid method is slightly better than the traditional approach. Images obtained using SR-then-Blend are more similar to the real observed images compared with images acquired using Blend-then-SR. The overall mean bias of SR-then-Blend was 4% lower than Blend-then-SR, and nearly 3% improvement for overall standard deviation in SR-B. The VDSR technique reduces the systematic deviation in spectral band between Formosat-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images. The integration of STARFM and the VDSR model is useful for improving the quality of spatiotemporal fusion.

TI  - <i>'&I/&you'</i> An Innovative Research Instrument for Youngsters to Explore Their Life Orientation
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this contribution, we explore youngsters' positionality regarding religion and present an example to facilitate them to 'research' their own beliefs and their affective commitments to their faith. We start with a short general introduction in Fowler's theory of faith development. This is followed by findings from research in England, Estonia, Ghana, the Netherlands, and Malawi. From these findings, we conclude that youngsters need to be guided in their exploration of religious and secular worldview traditions. For this, we developed an instrument in particular for Muslim youngsters 'at risk' for radicalization: '&I/&you'. It is along the lines of religious tradition(s), citizenship, discrimination, and environmental concerns that students explore their convictions, broaden their horizons, and further develop their own (religious or secular) life orientation. Our innovative and explorative instrument ('&I/&you')-part of the PIREd (PIREd: Playful Islamic Religious Education) module of seven lessons-is described in detail. Preliminary results of pilot studies are promising. Students see this instrument as a 'space' for dialogue and love to share their ideas and sharpen their mind 'in the presence of the other'.

TI  - Co-exposures to trace elements and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) impacts North American river otter (<i>Lontra canadensis</i>) baculum
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental loadings of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) and trace elements are increasing in areas with marked oil and gas extraction, such as in the Athabasca oil sands region, Alberta, Canada. Some of these chemicals are recognized as potent endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The impacts of co-exposure to PACs and metals on free-ranging wildlife is of considerable concern. River otters (Lontra canadensis) are sentinel species of aquatic ecosystem health. The baculum (penile bone) is an important part of the reproductive system in otters that ensures successful copulation. Although baculum health is critical to male reproductive success and is sensitive to exposure to EDCs, there is no information available regarding the impact of PAC and metal exposures on measures of baculum health. River otter baculum and livers were dissected from carcasses obtained from the fur trade. Trace element and PAC analyses were carried out in liver with matching baculums subjected to dimensional analysis, bone mineral density (BMD) and mechanical loading testing. Trace elements and select PACs exhibited both protective and deleterious effects on baculum bone health metrics. Alkylated four ring PACs were negatively associated with baculum bone material properties (ex: C4-Chrysene and C4-pyrene). The same compounds have been shown to exhibit strong anti-androgenic activities. Few comparable studies exist related to contamination and adverse effects of PACs in wild terrestrial mammals. Baculum health metrics may be an important tool to include in biomonitoring studies as to date, there are limited means to assess male reproductive performance in wildlife biomonitoring programs.

TI  - Archaeological Surveying of Subarctic and Arctic Landscapes: Comparing the Performance of Airborne Laser Scanning and Remote Sensing Image Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - What can remote sensing contribute to archaeological surveying in subarctic and arctic landscapes? The pros and cons of remote sensing data vary as do areas of utilization and methodological approaches. We assessed the applicability of remote sensing for archaeological surveying of northern landscapes using airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and satellite and aerial images to map archaeological features as a basis for (a) assessing the pros and cons of the different approaches and (b) assessing the potential detection rate of remote sensing. Interpretation of images and a LiDAR-based bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM) was based on visual analyses aided by processing and visualizing techniques. 368 features were identified in the aerial images, 437 in the satellite images and 1186 in the DTM. LiDAR yielded the better result, especially for hunting pits. Image data proved suitable for dwellings and settlement sites. Feature characteristics proved a key factor for detectability, both in LiDAR and image data. This study has shown that LiDAR and remote sensing image data are highly applicable for archaeological surveying in northern landscapes. It showed that a multi-sensor approach contributes to high detection rates. Our results have improved the inventory of archaeological sites in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner.

TI  - Estimation of BRDF model kernel weights under an <i>a priori</i> knowledge-aided constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflectance anisotropy of land surface serves as an important bridge between surface biophysical parameters and remote sensing observations. It can characterize by the linear kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which is the combination of several kernel functions and kernel weights. These kernel weights can be estimated by remote sensing; however, the stability of current kernel weights products is still challenging, especially in urban areas with complex aerosol properties and heterogeneous surfaces. In this paper, we propose a method for robust estimation of kernel weights from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface spectral reflectance products (MxD09GA) data based on the constrained least-squares method (CLSM) and a priori knowledge. The kernel weights data were obtained by the CLSM from 2014 to 2017 in Beijing region of China. Validations were carried out using the MxD09GA and BRDF/Albedo products (MCD43A1). The results show that the time series of kernel weights by the CLSM show small variability over different land cover types. The kernel weights estimated by the CLSM can clearly show the phenological signal and fitting ability of surface spectral reflectance is better than that of the MCD43A1 products in Beijing urban area. Experimental results demonstrate that the CLSM has the potential for the robust estimation of kernel weights in urban areas.

TI  - Time Evolution of Storms Producing Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes Using ERA5 Reanalysis Data, GPS, Lightning and Geostationary Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we report the first investigation over time of the atmospheric conditions around terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) occurrences, using GPS sensors in combination with geostationary satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. The goal is to understand which characteristics are favorable to the development of these events and to investigate if any precursor signals can be expected. A total of 9 TGFs, occurring at a distance lower than 45 km from a GPS sensor, were analyzed and two of them are shown here as an example analysis. Moreover, the lightning activity, collected by the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), was used in order to identify any links and correlations with TGF occurrence and precipitable water vapor (PWV) trends. The combined use of GPS and the stroke rate trends identified, for all cases, a recurring pattern in which an increase in PWV is observed on a timescale of about two hours before the TGF occurrence that can be placed within the lightning peak. The temporal relation between the PWV trend and TGF occurrence is strictly related to the position of GPS sensors in relation to TGF coordinates. The life cycle of these storms observed by geostationary sensors described TGF-producing clouds as intense with a wide range of extensions and, in all cases, the TGF is located at the edge of the convective cell. Furthermore, the satellite data provide an added value in associating the GPS water vapor trend to the convective cell generating the TGF. The investigation with ERA5 reanalysis data showed that TGFs mainly occur in convective environments with unexceptional values with respect to the monthly average value of parameters measured at the same location. Moreover, the analysis showed the strong potential of the use of GPS data for the troposphere characterization in areas with complex territorial morphologies. This study provides indications on the dynamics of con-vective systems linked to TGFs and will certainly help refine our understanding of their production, as well as highlighting a potential approach through the use of GPS data to explore the lightning activity trend and TGF occurrences.

TI  - Use of Time-Series NDWI to Monitor Emerging Archaeological Sites: Case Studies from Iraqi Artificial Reservoirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 50 years, countries across North Africa and the Middle East have seen a significant increase in dam construction which, notwithstanding their benefits, have endangered archaeological heritage. Archaeological surveys and salvage excavations have been carried out in threatened areas in the past, but the formation of reservoirs often resulted in the permanent loss of archaeological data. However, in 2018, a sharp fall in the water level of the Mosul Dam reservoir led to the emersion of the archaeological site of Kemune and allowed for its brief and targeted investigation. Reservoir water level change is not unique to the Mosul Dam, but it is a phenomenon affecting most of the artificial lakes of present-day Iraq. However, to know in advance which sites will be exposed due to a decrease in water level can be a challenging task, especially without any previous knowledge, field investigation, or high-resolution satellite image. Nonetheless, by using time-series medium-resolution satellite images, combined to obtain spectral indexes for different years, it is possible to monitor "patterns" of emerging archaeological sites from three major Iraqi reservoirs: Mosul, Haditha and Hamrin lake. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), generated from annual composites of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, allow us to distinguish between water bodies and other land surfaces. When coupled with a pixel analysis of each image, the index can provide a mean for highlighting whether an archaeological site is submerged or not. Moreover, using a zonal histogram algorithm in QGIS over polygon shapefiles that represent a site surface, it is possible to assess the area of a site that has been exposed over time. The same analyses were carried out on monthly composites for the year 2018, to assess the impact of monthly variation of the water level on the archaeological sites. The results from both analyses have been visually evaluated using medium-resolution true colour images for specific years and locations and with 3 m resolution Planetscope images for 2018. Understanding emersion "patterns" of known archaeological sites provides a useful tool for targeted rescue excavation, while also expanding the knowledge of the post-flooding impact on cultural heritage in the regions under study.

TI  - Detection of Forest Windstorm Damages with Multitemporal SAR Data-A Case Study: Finland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop methods to localize forest windstorm damages, assess their severity and estimate the total damaged area using space-borne SAR data. The development of the methods is the first step towards an operational system for near-real-time windstorm damage monitoring, with a latency of only a few days after the storm event in the best case. Windstorm detection using SAR data is not trivial, particularly at C-band. It can be expected that a large-area and severe windstorm damage may affect backscatter similar to clear cutting operation, that is, decrease the backscatter intensity, while a small area damage may increase the backscatter of the neighboring area, due to various scattering mechanisms. The remaining debris and temporal variation in the weather conditions and possible freeze-thaw transitions also affect observed backscatter changes. Three candidate windstorm detection methods were suggested, based on the improved k-nn method, multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine classification. The approaches use multitemporal ESA Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data and were evaluated in Southern Finland using wind damage data from the summer 2017, together with 27 Sentinel-1 scenes acquired in 2017 and other geo-referenced data. The stands correctly predicted severity category corresponded to 79% of the number of the stands in the validation data, and already 75% when only one Sentinel-1 scene after the damage was used. Thus, the damaged forests can potentially be localized with proposed tools within less than one week after the storm damage. In this study, the achieved latency was only two days. Our preliminary results also indicate that the damages can be localized even without separate training data.

TI  - Oncological Results of Laparoscopically Assisted Radical Vaginal Hysterectomy in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: Should We Really Abandon Minimally Invasive Surgery?
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummarySome recently published studies in early-stage cervical cancer patients have shown that minimally invasive surgery (MIS), including laparoscopic and robotic approaches, might offer lower survival rates than classic open surgery. We evaluated the oncological results of a series of patients treated by laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH), an infrequently used MIS technique. We included 115 patients with early-stage cervical cancer (IA1 with lymphovascular invasion, IA2, IB1, and IIA < 2 cm; International Federation of Gynecology (FIGO), 2008). The 3- and 4.5-year disease-free survival rates were 96.7% and 93.5%, respectively, and the overall survival was 97.8% and 94.8%, respectively. These survival data are comparable with those reported with the open radical hysterectomy but presented the advantages of MIS. LARVH offers excellent disease control in women with early-stage cervical cancer and can be considered as an adequate MIS alternative to open radical hysterectomy.Background: Recent evidence indicates that some minimally invasive surgery approaches, such as laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy, offer lower survival rates to patients with early-stage cervical cancer than open radical hysterectomy. We evaluated the oncological results of a different minimally invasive surgery approach, that of laparoscopically assisted radical vaginal hysterectomy (LARVH) in this setting. Methods: From January 2001 to December 2018, patients with early-stage cervical cancer were treated by LARVH. Colpotomy and initial closure of the vagina were performed following the Schauta operation, avoiding manipulation of the tumor. Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy was performed in all cases. Women treated between 2001 and 2011 also underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy. Results: There were 115 patients included. Intraoperative complications occurred in nine patients (7.8%). After a median follow-up of 87.8 months (range 1-216), seven women (6%) presented recurrence. Four women died (mortality rate 3.4%). The 3- and 4.5-year disease-free survival rates were 96.7% and 93.5%, respectively, and the overall survival was 97.8% and 94.8%, respectively. Conclusion: LARVH offers excellent disease-free and overall survival in women with early-stage cervical cancer and can be considered as an adequate minimally invasive surgery alternative to open radical hysterectomy.

TI  - Landsat 8 OLI Broadband Albedo Validation in Antarctica and Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The albedo is a fundamental component of the processes that govern the energy budget, and particularly important in the context of climate change. However, a satellite-based high-resolution (30 m) albedo product which can be used in the polar regions up to 82.5 degrees latitude during the summer seasons is lacking. To cover this gap, in this study we calculate satellite-based broadband albedo from Landsat 8 OLI and validate it against broadband albedo measurements from in situ stations located on the Antarctic and Greenland icesheets. The model to derive the albedo from raw satellite data includes an atmospheric and topographic correction and conversion from narrow-band to broadband albedo, and at each step different options were taken into account, in order to provide the best combination of corrections. Results, after being cleaned from anomalous data, show a good agreement with in situ albedo measurements, with a mean absolute error between in situ and satellite albedo of 0.021, a root mean square error of 0.026, a standard deviation of 0.015, a correlation coefficient of 0.995 (p < 0.01) and a bias estimate of -0.005. Considering the structure of the model, it could be applied to data from previous sensors of the Landsat family and help construct a record to analyze albedo variations in the polar regions.

TI  - Coastal protection assessment: a tradeoff between ecological, social, and economic issues
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine coastal ecosystems are crucial to human populations in reducing disaster risk. Least Developed Countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea-level rise and storm surges. The Mauritanian coast, West Africa, ranks among the most vulnerable worldwide to sea-level rise, and coastal communities in the National Park of Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) are particularly at risk. Here, we assessed the service of coastal protection in PNBA by (1) mapping the coastal marine ecosystems with Sentinel-2 imagery and determining their spatial wave height attenuation rates; (2) assessing the vulnerability of villages and natural habitats to coastal hazard risk; and (3) assessing the applicability of coastal protection measures in the PNBA. We found that a total of 83% of the populated coastline presents a moderate to high risk of flooding and erosion, with Iwik and R'Gueiba being the most threatened villages in the PNBA. As for the ecological risk, two low-elevated islands, which support breeding colonies of birds, are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. However, in other areas, the rupture in the dune cord created new lagoons that present valuable ecological and economic interests like the Lagoon of Bellaat. Improving the comprehension of wave attenuation provided by coastal habitats, combined with identifying the vulnerability and applicability of coastal protection measures, is essential for achieving the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction goals. In the PNBA, relocation of identified villages at risk is probably the best cost-effective solution with the least disturbance to both breeding and wintering birds. Protection of coastal ecosystems will also ensure a continued provision of other ecosystem services, including food supply for sea dependent populations, and contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET and <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT in Vulvar Cancer A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThe aims of this study were to determine the role of F-18-FDG PET/CT in vulvar cancer patients and to extract summary estimates of its diagnostic performance for preoperative lymph node staging. Patients and MethodsPubMed/Medline and Embase databases were searched to identify studies evaluating F-18-FDG PET/CT in vulvar cancer patients. The assessment of methodological quality of the included articles was performed. Per-patient and per-groin pooled estimates, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. ResultsTen articles were included in the systematic review, 7 among which evaluated the diagnostic performance of preoperative F-18-FDG PET/CT for lymph node staging. Qualitative per-patient analysis (72 patients from 4 studies) resulted in estimated pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and DOR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.44-0.95), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.76-1.04), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.66-1.06), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.56-0.97), and 10.49 (95% CI, 1.68-65.50), respectively. Qualitative per-groin analysis (245 groins from 5 studies) resulted in estimated pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and DOR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.57-0.94), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.94), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.85), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), and 19.43 (95% CI, 6.40-58.95), respectively. ConclusionsDespite limited literature data, this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that a negative preoperative PET/CT scan may exclude groin metastases in at least early-stage vulvar cancer patients currently unfit for sentinel node biopsy and select those eligible for a less invasive surgical treatment. A positive PET/CT result should otherwise be interpreted with caution. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate the diagnostic value of standardized semiquantitative analysis compared with the qualitative one.

TI  - Geoinformation Technologies in Support of Environmental Hazards Monitoring under Climate Change: An Extensive Review
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Human activities and climate change constitute the contemporary catalyst for natural processes and their impacts, i.e., geo-environmental hazards. Globally, natural catastrophic phenomena and hazards, such as drought, soil erosion, quantitative and qualitative degradation of groundwater, frost, flooding, sea level rise, etc., are intensified by anthropogenic factors. Thus, they present rapid increase in intensity, frequency of occurrence, spatial density, and significant spread of the areas of occurrence. The impact of these phenomena is devastating to human life and to global economies, private holdings, infrastructure, etc., while in a wider context it has a very negative effect on the social, environmental, and economic status of the affected region. Geospatial technologies including Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing-Earth Observation as well as related spatial data analysis tools, models, databases, contribute nowadays significantly in predicting, preventing, researching, addressing, rehabilitating, and managing these phenomena and their effects. This review attempts to mark the most devastating geo-hazards from the view of environmental monitoring, covering the state of the art in the use of geospatial technologies in that respect. It also defines the main challenge of this new era which is nothing more than the fictitious exploitation of the information produced by the environmental monitoring so that the necessary policies are taken in the direction of a sustainable future. The review highlights the potential and increasing added value of geographic information as a means to support environmental monitoring in the face of climate change. The growth in geographic information seems to be rapidly accelerated due to the technological and scientific developments that will continue with exponential progress in the years to come. Nonetheless, as it is also highlighted in this review continuous monitoring of the environment is subject to an interdisciplinary approach and contains an amount of actions that cover both the development of natural phenomena and their catastrophic effects mostly due to climate change.

TI  - Estimation of sugar beet biomass and yield comparing NDVI measurements and physical soil parameters
T2  - SUGAR INDUSTRY-ZUCKERINDUSTRIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to estimate the relationship of soil sample analysis and satellite imagery with sugar beet yield (BY). The red NDVI obtained monthly from Landsat OLI satellite images during the 2017 and 2018 sugar beet growing seasons were used to establish relationships between imagery and georeferenced soil sample analyses and sugar beet harvest sites. The study was carried out in the field of Sugar Institute Ilgin Experiment Station, Turkey, in 2017 and 2018. Soil samples were obtained in a 0.4 ha grid, and sugar beet yield and recoverable sugar yield (RSY) were obtained from the same sampling areas. The results showed that there were relationships between some soil analysis factors and BY and beet quality. The overall results showed that the amount of clay, electric conductivity (EC), and organic matter in the field might be indicators of BY and beet quality. A statistically significant moderate positive correlation was also obtained between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images and BY and RSY values in all images obtained by satellite near the harvest date.

TI  - Trends of Aerosol Optical Thickness Using VIIRS S-NPP during Fog Episodes in Pakistan and India
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) is one of the important parameters for assessing regional and global level of climate change. Fog episodes have considerably increased in south Asia because of environmental factors, and the burning of agricultural residue leads to major social and economic problems. In present study, Mann-Kendall trend analysis of AOT and active fire events was done, and their significance were assessed using long-term (October 2012-February 2020) remote sensing data derived smog maps. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite National Polar Partnership (VIIRS N-PP) was used to map AOT episodes over the northern region of Pakistan and India. Results reveal that AOT displays a significantly decreasing trend over the northern and eastern region of Pakistan and a similar decreasing trend from the Western to Eastern region of India. Furthermore, active fire events have a significantly increasing trend at the Northern region of Pakistan. However, fire events have a significantly decreasing trend over the southern and southeastern region of India. Additionally, statistically significant decreasing trends were observed for AOT over Chakwal (p-value = 0.2, Z_MK = -2.3) and Patiala (p-value = 0.15, Z_MK = -3.2). Fire events have a significantly increasing trend for Dera Ismail Khan (p-value = 0.01, Z_MK = 1.9), Jhang (p-value = 0.01, Z_MK = 1.9), and Chakwal (p-value = 0.01, Z_MK = 1.8), while they are significantly decreasing trend near New Delhi (p-value = 0.2, Z_MK = -0.9), Aligarh (p-value = 0.15, Z_MK = -0.9) and Patiala (p-value = 0.2, Z_MK = -0.8).

T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: This trial intended to identify patient- and therapy-specific risk factors influencing the genesis of seroma and the extent of its formation. Patients and Methods: Within a prospective randomized controlled trial, 70 patients (n=35 TissuGlu (R); n=35 drain) underwent a mastectomy with or without sentinel lymphonodectomy. Specific seroma-associated risk factors were recorded. Regular outpatient aftercare was performed during a 90-day postoperative follow-up. Results: A statistically significant increase in the postoperative seroma rate was demonstrated for those with pre-adiposity compared to normal body weight (p=0.016), as well as for the state of health evaluated by the score of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) (ASA III compared to I; p=0.046), the presence of diabetes mellitus (p<0.001) and the reduction of the length of the surgical procedure (p=0.044). Conclusion: A high body mass index, a poor state of health (ASA score), and diabetes mellitus, as well as a shorter duration of surgery, favor the incidence of postoperative seroma.

TI  - Evaluating the Near and Mid Infrared Bi-Spectral Space for Assessing Fire Severity and Comparison with the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity, defined as the degree of environmental change caused by a fire, is a critical fire regime attribute of interest to fire emissions modelling and post-fire rehabilitation planning. Remotely sensed fire severity is traditionally assessed by the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). This spectral index captures fire-induced reflectance changes in the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions. This study evaluates a spectral index based on a band combination including the NIR and mid infrared (MIR) spectral regions, the differenced normalized difference vegetation index with mid infrared (dNDVI(MID)), to assess fire severity. This evaluation capitalized upon the unique opportunity stemming from the pre- and post-fire airborne acquisitions over the Rim (2013) and King (2014) fires in California with the MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) instrument. The field data consist of 85 Geometrically structured Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) plots. In addition, six different index combinations, respectively three with a NIR-SWIR combination and three with a NIR-MIR combination, were evaluated based on the optimality of fire-induced spectral displacements. The optimality statistic ranges between zero and one, with values of one representing pixel displacements that are unaffected by noise. The results show that the dNBR demonstrated a stronger relationship with GeoCBI field data when field measurements over the two fire scars were combined than the dNDVI(MID) approaches. The results yielded an R-2 of 0.68 based on a saturated growth model for the best performing dNBR index, whereas the performance of the dNDVI(MID) indices was lower with an R-2 = 0.61 for the best performing dNDVI(MID) index. The dNBR also outperformed the dNDVI(MID) in terms of spectral optimality across both fires. The best performing dNBR index yielded median optimality statistics of 0.56 over the Rim and 0.60 over the King fire. The best performing dNDVI(MID) index recorded optimality values of 0.49 over the Rim and 0.46 over the King fire. We also found that the dNBR approach led to considerable differences in the form of the relationship with the GeoCBI between the two fires, whereas the dNDVI(MID) approach yielded comparable relationships with the GeoCBI over the two fires. This suggests that the dNDVI(MID) approach, despite its slightly lower performance than the dNBR, may be a more robust method for estimating and comparing fire severity over large regions. This premise needs additional verification when more air- or spaceborne imagery with NIR and MIR bands will become available with a spatial resolution that allows ground truthing of fire severity.

TI  - The New Hyperspectral Satellite PRISMA: Imagery for Forest Types Discrimination
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Different forest types based on different tree species composition may have similar spectral signatures if observed with traditional multispectral satellite sensors. Hyperspectral imagery, with a more continuous representation of their spectral behavior may instead be used for their classification. The new hyperspectral Precursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) sensor, developed by the Italian Space Agency, is able to capture images in a continuum of 240 spectral bands ranging between 400 and 2500 nm, with a spectral resolution smaller than 12 nm. The new sensor can be employed for a large number of remote sensing applications, including forest types discrimination. In this study, we compared the capabilities of the new PRISMA sensor against the well-known Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) in recognition of different forest types through a pairwise separability analysis carried out in two study areas in Italy, using two different nomenclature systems and four separability metrics. The PRISMA hyperspectral sensor, compared to Sentinel-2 MSI, allowed for a better discrimination in all forest types, increasing the performance when the complexity of the nomenclature system also increased. PRISMA achieved an average improvement of 40% for the discrimination between two forest categories (coniferous vs. broadleaves) and of 102% in the discrimination between five forest types based on main tree species groups.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present state of agriculture and its demand is very much different than what it used to be two decades back. Hence, Precision Agriculture (PA) is more in demand to address this challenging demand. With consistent pressure to develop multiple products over the same agricultural land, farmers find PA's adoption the best rescue-based solution with restricted resources. PA accelerates the yield and potentially assists in catering up the demand of scarcity of demands of food. With the increasing adoption of PA- based technologies over farming, there are best possibilities to explore efficient farming practices and better decision-making facilitated by real-time data availability. There isan evolution of various novel technologies to boost agricultural performance, i.e. variable rate technology, Geomapping, remote sensing, automated steering system, and satellite positioning system. Apart from this, it is also observed that Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have been slowly penetrating this area to acceleratePA's technological advancement. It is noticed that the adoption of sensing technology is a common factor in almost all the techniques used in PA. However, there is no clear idea about the most dominant approach in this regard. Therefore, this paper discusses existing approaches concerning standard conventional PA and sensing-based PA using WSN. The study contributes towards some impressive learning outcomes to state that WSN and IoT are extensive to boost PA.

TI  - Assessing Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Spatiotemporal Patterns Combining In Situ Continuous Fluorometry Measurements and Landsat 8/OLI Data across the Barataria Basin (Louisiana, USA)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of reliable and accurate data to assess environmental changes over large spatial scales is one of the main limitations to determine the impact of eutrophication, and the effectiveness of management strategies in coastal systems. Here, we used a continuous in situ Chl-a fluorometry sensor and L8/OLI satellite data to develop an algorithm and map Chl-a spatial distribution to assess the impact of freshwater diversions and associated high nutrient loading rates in the Barataria Basin (BB) complex, a coastal system in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We collected water quality samples at 24 sampling stations and high-frequency continuous fluorometry in situ [Chl-a] data along a similar to 87 km transect from 2019-2020. Field [Chl-a] values were highly correlated (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001) with continuous in situ [Chl-a] fluorometry values. These continuous in situ [Chl-a] values were significantly related to a surface reflectance ratio ([B1 + B4]/B3) estimated using L8/OLI data (exponential model; R-2 = 0.46; RMSE = 4.8, p < 0.0001). The statistical model replicated [Chl-a] spatial patterns across the BB complex. This work shows the utility of high-frequency continuous Chl-a fluorometry sampling coupled with L8/OLI image analysis to increase the frequency and number of field data sets to assess water quality conditions at large spatial scales in highly dynamic deltaic regions.

TI  - Stand Delineation of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. Plantations Suffering Decline Processes Based on Biophysical Tree Crown Variables: A Necessary Tool for Adaptive Silviculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many planted Pinus forests are severely affected by defoliation and mortality processes caused by pests and droughts. The mapping of forest tree crown variables (e.g., leaf area index and pigments) is particularly useful in stand delineation for the management of declining forests. This work explores the potential of integrating multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data for stand delineation based on selected tree crown variables in Pinus sylvestris plantations in southern Spain. Needle pigments (chlorophyll and carotenes) and leaf area index (LAI) were quantified. Eight vegetation indices and ALS-derived metrics were produced, and seven predictors were selected to estimate and map tree crown variables using a Random Forest method and Gini index. Chlorophylls a and b (Chla and Chlb) were significantly higher in the non-defoliated and moderately defoliated trees than in severely defoliated trees (F = 14.02, p < 0.001 for Chla; F = 13.09, p < 0.001 for Chlb). A similar response was observed for carotenoids (Car) (F = 14.13, p < 0.001). The LAI also showed significant differences among the defoliation levels (F = 26.5, p < 0.001). The model for the chlorophyll a pigment used two vegetation indices, Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI) and Carotenoid Reflectance Index (CRI); three WV-2 band metrics, and three ALS metrics. The model built to describe the tree Chlb content used similar variables. The defoliation classification model was established with a single vegetation index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI); two metrics of the blue band, and two ALS metrics. The pigment contents models provided R-2 values of 0.87 (Chla, RMSE = 12.98%), 0.74 (Chlb, RMSE = 10.39%), and 0.88 (Car, RMSE = 10.05%). The cross-validated confusion matrix achieved a high overall classification accuracy (84.05%) and Kappa index (0.76). Defoliation and Chla showed the validation values for segmentations and, therefore, in the generation of the stand delineation. A total of 104 stands were delineated, ranging from 6.96 to 54.62 ha (average stand area = 16.26 ha). The distribution map of the predicted severity values in the P. sylvestris plantations showed a mosaic of severity patterns at the stand and individual tree scales. Overall, the findings of this work underscore the potential of WV-2 and ALS data integration for the assessment of stand delineation based on tree health status. The derived cartography is a relevant tool for developing adaptive silvicultural practices to reduce Pinus sylvestris mortality in planted forests at risk due to climate change.

TI  - Mapping spatial variability of foliar nitrogen and carbon in Indian tropical moist deciduous sal (Shorea robusta) forest using machine learning algorithms and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliar Nitrogen (N) and Carbon (C) are two vital leaf biochemical components that can indicate forest health. In this study, the spatial distribution of foliar N and C was mapped using Sentinel-2 data in a tropical moist deciduous sal (Shorea robusta) forest of northwest Himalayan foothills of India. Empirical relationships were established between satellite data-derived spectral indices, band reflectance and ground measured foliar N and C using machine learning algorithm (MLA). Performance of MLAs viz. Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were assessed. Using all the independent spectral variables, RF performed better than ANN and SVM in explaining the variation in foliar N and C. RF was further used to optimize the independent variables for identifying the best predictor variables. It was found that foliar N is strongly related to shortwave infrared-1 (SWIR-1) band and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE). Foliar C was found to be strongly related to SWIR-1 band and spectral vegetation indices: Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Ratio of Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MCARI/OSAVI). Using these best predictor variables, the spatial variability of foliar N and C was mapped using RF algorithm. On validation of the predicted N and C with ground measured foliar N and C, R (2) of 0.85 (RMSE = 0.04%) for N and R (2) of 0.86 (RMSE = 0.26%) for C were observed. It can be concluded that MLAs have great potential to map the spatial variability of foliar N and C in the tropical forests using the broad bands of Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - ATTITUDES OF MEDICAL STUDENTS TOWARDS ARTIFICIAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY AND EUTHANASIA IN THE CONTEXT OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Medical students' attitudes towards issues associated with the beginning and end of human life are analyzed using interdisciplinary approaches and empirical material (statistics, sociological surveys). The purpose of this article is to determine the peculiarities of Christian morality's influence on the attitudes of contemporary Ukrainian medical students towards the issues of artificial termination of pregnancy and euthanasia. Based on a comparative analysis of the evaluative judgments of three groups of respondents (group 1 - those who consider themselves Christians; group 2 - respondents who are undecided about religious belief; group 3 - those who consider themselves non-believers), a complex relationship between religious identification of respondents and their attitude towards abortion and euthanasia was revealed. The attitudes of medical students who have identified themselves as Christians differ from the more liberal approaches of respondents in the second and third groups and, at the same time, the evaluative judgments of a large part of this group of respondents significantly diverge from Christian approaches towards artificial termination of pregnancy and euthanasia. It is substantiated that the attitudes of medical students towards these issues depend on the influence of religion on their worldview, family upbringing, and duration of study in a medical school. The relationship between the peculiarities of religiousness in contemporary Ukrainian society and a nature of religious identification of medical students is analyzed. Two groups of believers are distinguished: people who are characterized by internal religiousness and believers who are dominated by "external" religiousness, i. e., a significant dependence of the motivation of religious activity on the values and norms of secular culture.

TI  - The role of indocyanine green fluorescence in sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The current practice in sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer is the radioisotope and blue dye dual labelling technique, however, other mapping methods are also available. Indocyanine green fluorescence is one of the best alternatives of the standard technique, with detection rates comparable to those of the radioisotope method.Method: Between 31. 03. 2020 and 15. 04. 2020, a total of 10 sentinel lymph node biopsies for breast cancer were performed using the indocyanine green fluorescence and blue dye dual technique.Results: 17 sentinel lymph nodes were detected and removed in total, from which 16 showed explicit fluorescence activity (detection rate: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.99), whilst 9 where blue (detection rate: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31-0.74). During histopathological examination, 2 sentinel lymph nodes proved to be metastatic, from which 1 was fluorescent and blue, the other was blue only.Conclusion: Regarding our early experience based on a small number of patients, indocyanine green fluorescence, used together with blue dye as part of a dual technique, is a usable method for sentinel lymph node mapping. Based on data from the literature, the detection rate and the false-negative rate of the indocyanine green fluorescence method shows no significant difference from the radioisotope mapping technique.

TI  - Early Monitoring of Exotic Mangrove <i>Sonneratia</i> in Hong Kong Using Deep Convolutional Network at Half-Meter Resolution
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sonneratia have posed a threat to native mangrove species in Hong Kong. Early detection of individual Sonneratia when they are introduced and naturalized before invasion is essential for native mangrove species protection, especially for Sonneratia with a strong ability of propagation. This letter aims to provide an effective way to the accurate detection of individual Sonneratia. Specifically, using very high spatial resolution remotely sensed data, we adapt the RetinaNet, incorporating multiscale features for sapling detection and convolutional neural networks for detecting the Sonneratia distributed scatteredly among native species. The Sonneratia were detected with a higher mean average precision (mAP) 0.50 of 0.3891 with a precision of 0.5465 than that from the deformable part model. In addition, 3678 Sonneratia were detected at early stage. This letter can support the government for mangrove forest management and offer a scientific guidance for adequate response to the species invasion, like annual removal of Sonneratia, and then reduce the consumption of labor and time over a large scale. In addition, it can provide a quantitative survey for Sonneratia management.

TI  - Characterizing soil salinity at multiple depth using electromagnetic induction and remote sensing data with random forests: A case study in Tarim River Basin of southern Xinjiang, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tarim River Basin is experiencing heavy soil degeneration in a long term because of the extreme natural conditions, added with improper human activities such as reclamation and rejected field repeatedly, which hindered the soil health. One of the mainly form is soil salinization. Spatial distribution and variation of soil salinity is essential both for agricultural resource management and local economic development. However, knowledge of the spatial distribution of soil salinization in this region has not been updated since 1980s while land use and climate have undergone major changed. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) has been successfully used to directly measurement the spatial distribution of targeting soil property at field- scale, and apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS m(-1)) has become a surrogate of soil salinity (EC, dS m(-1)) studied by many researchers at local scale. However, the effectiveness of this equipment has not been verified in the typical soil salinization areas in southern Xinjiang, especially on a large scale. This study was aimed to test the performance of ECa jointed with Random Forest (RF) for soil salinity regional-scale mapping at a typical arid area, taking Tarim River Basin as an example. The result showed that ECa together with environmental derivative variables and with RF were suited for regional-scale soil salinity mapping. Predicted accuracy of EC was higher at surface (0-20 cm, R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 5.59) and deeper soil depth (60-80 cm, R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 2.00, and 80-100 cm, R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 1.73), lower at transitional zone (20-40 cm, R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 2.66, and 40-60 cm, R-2 = 0.51, RMSE = 2.49). When ECa is involved in modeling, the prediction accuracy of multiple depths of EC is improved by 13.33%-61.54%, of which the most obvious depths are 60-80 cm and 0-20 cm. The results of variable importance show that SoilGrids were also favored the power EC model. Hence, we strongly recommended to joint EMI reads with remote sensing imagery for soil salinity monitoring at large scale in southern Xinjiang. These EC and ECa map can provide a data source for environmental modeling, a benchmark against which to evaluate and monitor water and salt dynamics, and a guide for the design of future soil surveys.

TI  - The Impact of Shale Oil and Gas Development on Rangelands in the Permian Basin Region: An Assessment Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental impact of shale energy development is a growing concern in the US and worldwide. Although the topic is well-studied in general, shale development's impact on drylands has received much less attention in the literature. This study focuses on the effect of shale development on land cover in the Permian Basin region-a unique arid/semi-arid landscape experiencing an unprecedented intensity of drilling and production activities. By taking advantage of the high-resolution remote sensing land cover data, we develop a fixed-effects panel (longitudinal) data regression model to control unobserved spatial heterogeneities and regionwide trends. The model allows us to understand the land cover's dynamics over the past decade of shale development. The results show that shale development had moderate negative but statistically significant impacts on shrubland and grassland/pasture. The effect is more strongly associated with the hydrocarbon production volume and less with the number of oil and gas wells drilled. Between shrubland and grassland/pasture, the impact on shrubland is more pronounced in terms of magnitude. The dominance of shrubland in the region likely explains the result.

TI  - China's Land Cover Fraction Change during 2001-2015 Based on Remote Sensed Data Fusion between MCD12 and CCI-LC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New types of remote sensed land cover datasets provide key evidence for understanding global environmental change. However, low data consistency makes understanding the changes unclear. China has become a hot spot of land cover change in the world due to climate change and a series of human measures, such as ecological engineering, land consolidation, and urbanization. However, due to the inconsistencies in interpretation of signs and thresholds, the understanding of yearly-continued land cover changes in China is still unclear. We aim to produce China's land cover fraction dataset from 2001 to 2015 by weighted consistency analysis. We compare the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover dataset (MCD12Q1), the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) datasets, and a new land cover fraction dataset named China-LCFMCD-CCI, produced with a 1 km resolution. The obvious increased forest areas only accounted for 4.6% of the total forest areas, and were mainly distributed in northeast China. Approximately 75.8% of the grassland and shrubland areas decreased in size, and these areas were relatively concentrated in northeast and south China. The obvious increased areas of cropland (3.7%) were equal to the obvious decreased areas (3.6%), and the increased cropland areas were in northwest China. The change in bare land was not obvious, as the obvious increased areas only accounted for 0.75% of the bare land areas. The results not only prove that the data fusion of the weighted consistency method is feasible to form a land cover fraction dataset, but also helps to fully reveal the trends in land cover fraction change in China.

TI  - Optimization Algorithm for Polarization Remote Sensing Cloud Detection Based on Machine Learning
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarization remote sensing experience threshold cloud detection algorithm is strongly affected by subjective factors,and it is very easy to have the problem of inaccurate cloud detection over bright ground. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a machine learning cloud detection algorithm that combines active and passive remote sensing satellites. The algorithm is based on the multichannel multi-angle polarization characteristics of the POLDER3 payload and the high-precision cloud vertical characteristics of the CALIOP payload. It uses POLDER3 payload and CALIOP. The load observation overlaps the regional data, and the BP neural network optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is built to train the cloud detection model. Based on the cloud detection training model, a cloud detection experiment was carried out using POLDER3 level-1 data. The experiment showed that the cloud detection result of this algorithm is 92.46% consistent with the MODIS cloud detection product,which is higher than the consistency between the official POLDER3 cloud detection product and the MODIS cloud detection product 83.13%. By comparing the experimental results of thealgorithm in this paper with the optical characteristics of different pixels from the official POLDER3 cloud detection product,it is found that compared with the official POLDER3 algorithm,this algorithm is more sensitive to thin clouds over the bright surface and can perform cloud detection more effectively.

TI  - SSS-YOLO: towards more accurate detection for small ships in SAR image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the low detection rate and high false alarm in small ship detection in SAR images, we propose a small-scale ship detection algorithm based on convolutional neural network in this paper. First, we redesign the feature extraction network according to the characters of ship targets in SAR images. The modified network can enrich the spatial and semantics information of small ships. Then, we propose the Path Argumentation Fusion Network (PAFN) to improve the fusion of different feature maps. PAFN uses bottom-up and top-down ways to fuse more location information and semantic information. Both these two optimizations can enhance the detection for small ships. We evaluate our model based on the open SAR-Ship-Dataset and Gaofen-3 SAR images. The experiment results show that our method has excellent performance for small ship detection compared with other deep learning models. Our model improves AP by 6.5% and has higher detection efficiency compared with the baseline YOLOv3 model.

TI  - Simulation of Lake Water Volume in Ungauged Terminal Lake Basin Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining the water volume of small- and medium-sized lakes in enclosed watersheds with scarce data is a global focus of research. River flow into a lake is an important factor affecting the water volume. However, most river flow measurement methods involve long cycles, low efficiency, and transdisciplinary expertise, making rapid assessments in ungauged basins impossible. This paper proposes a remote sensing flow estimation method based on multi-source remote sensing data, which quickly assesses river flow and provides important input data for lake water volume simulation. The cross-section flow was estimated by extracting the river width. The calculated results were consistent with the measured data, with accuracy greater than 90%. The results compared with daily data measured at hydrological stations, and the Nash coefficient was greater than 0.9. Additionally, the simulation method for lake area, water volume, and water level was constructed using river inflow input data, greatly reducing the parameters required by the conventional lake water volume simulation method. Based on the remote sensing discharge estimation method, we quickly and conveniently obtained changes in river flow into the lake, simulated lake water volume, and provided the basis for water resource management in terminal lake basins with scarce data.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Salt and Ion Contents Based on Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Baidunzi Basin, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity due to irrigation diversion affects regional agriculture, and the development of soil composition estimation models for the dynamic monitoring of regional salinity is important for salinity control. In this study, we evaluated the performance of hyperspectral data measured using an analytical spectral device (ASD) field spec standard-res hand-held spectrometer and satellite sensor visible shortwave infrared advanced hyperspectral imager (AHSI) in estimating the soil salt content (SSC). First derivative analysis (FDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to the data using the raw spectra (RS) to select the best model input data. We tested the ability of these three groups of data as input data for partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal component regression (PCR), and multiple linear regression (MLR). Finally, an estimation model of the SSC, Na+, Cl-, and SO42- contents was established using the best input data and modeling method, and a spatial distribution map of the soil composition content was drawn. The results show that the soil spectra obtained from the satellite hyperspectral data (AHSI) and laboratory spectral data (ASD) were consistent when the SSC was low, and as the SSC increased, the spectral curves of the ASD data showed little change in the curve characteristics, while the AHSI data showed more pronounced features, and this change was manifested in the AHSI images as darker pixels with a lower SSC and brighter pixels with a higher SSC. The AHSI data demonstrated a strong response to the change in SSC; therefore, the AHSI data had a greater advantage compared with the ASD data in estimating the soil salt content. In the modeling process, RS performed the best in estimating the SSC and Na+ content, with the R-2 reaching 0.79 and 0.58, respectively, and obtaining low root mean squared error (RMSE) values. FDA and PCA performed the best in estimating Cl- and SO42-, while MLR outperformed PLSR and PCR in estimating the content of the soil components in the region. In addition, the hyperspectral camera data used in this study were very cost-effective and can potentially be used for the evaluation of soil salinization with a wide range and high accuracy, thus reducing the errors associated with the collection of individual samples using hand-held hyperspectral instruments.

TI  - Current Status and Variation since 1964 of the Glaciers around the Ebi Lake Basin in the Warming Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of the glaciers in the Ebi Lake basin during the period 1964 to 2019, based on the 1st and 2nd Chinese Glacier Inventories (CGI) and remote sensing data; this is believed to be the first long-term comprehensive remote sensing investigation on the glacier change in this area, and it also diagnosed the response of the glaciers to the warming climate by analyzing digital elevation modeling and meteorology. The results show that there are 988 glaciers in total in the basin, with a total area of 560 km(2) and average area of 0.57 km(2) for a single glacier. The area and number of the glaciers oriented north and northeast are 205 km(2) (327 glaciers) and 180 km(2) (265 glaciers), respectively. The glaciers are categorized into eight classes as per their area, which are less than 0.1, 0.1-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-5.0, 5.0-10.0, 10.0-20.0, and greater than 20.0 km(2), respectively. The smaller glaciers between 0.1 km(2) and 10.0 km(2) account for 509 km(2) or 91% in total area, and, in particular, the glaciers smaller than 0.5 km(2) account for 74% in the total number. The glacial area is concentrated at 3500-4000 m in altitude (512 km(2) or 91.4% in total). The number of glaciers in the basin decreased by 10.5% or 116, and their area decreased by 263.29 km(2) (-4.79 km(2) a(-1)) or 32% (-0.58% a(-1)) from 1964 to 2019; the glaciers with an area between 2.0 km(2) and 5.0 km(2) decreased by the largest, -82.60 km(2) or -40.67% in the total area at -1.50 km(2) a(-1) or -0.74% a(-1)), and the largest decrease in number (i.e., 126 glaciers) occurs between 0.1 km(2) and 0.5 km(2). The total ice storage in the basin decreased by 97.84-153.22 km(3) from 1964 to 2019, equivalent to 88.06-137.90 km(3) water (taking 0.9 g cm(-3) as ice mass density). The temperature increase rate in the basin was +0.37 degrees C decade(-1), while the precipitation was +13.61 mm decade(-1) during the last fifty-five years. This analysis shows that the increase in precipitation in the basin was not sufficient to compensate the mass loss of glaciers caused by the warming during the same period. The increase in temperature was the dominant factor exceeding precipitation mass supply for ruling the retreat of the glaciers in the entire basin.

TI  - Land cover target mapping at subpixel scale for Landsat 8 OLI image by using multiscale-infrared information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land remote-sensing satellite (System, Landsat) 8 operational land imager (OLI) can provide land cover target mapping (LCTM) information. Due to the limitation of hardware and complexity of environment, Landsat 8 OLI image sometimes contains a large number of mixed pixels, which brings a challenge for LCTM. Super-resolution mapping (SM) handles the mixed pixels to obtain LCTM at subpixel scale. However, the scale information is single and the infrared information is not rich in the existing SM methods. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes SM based on multiscale-infrared information (MII). There are two terms (i.e. multiscale and infrared terms) in MII. The multiscale term with multiscale information is produced through deep Laplacian pyramid network (DLPN), multiresolution segmentation, and extended random walker in turn. The infrared term with infrared information is derived by calculating the normalized difference target index (NDTI). The two terms are combined to generate a minimization term with multiscale-infrared information. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to the minimization term to obtain the LCTM result. The experimental results on four Landsat 8 OLI images show that the MII provides better LCTM results than the traditional SM methods.

TI  - Adopting "Difference-in-Differences" Method to Monitor Crop Response to Agrometeorological Hazards with Satellite Data: A Case Study of Dry-Hot Wind
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid changing climate has increased the risk of natural hazards and threatened global and regional food security. Near real-time monitoring of crop response to agrometeorological hazards is fundamental to ensuring national and global food security. However, quantifying crop responses to a specific hazard in the natural environment is still quite challenging, especially over large areas, due to the lack of tools to separate the independent impact of the hazard on crops from other confounding factors. In this study, we present a general difference-in-differences (DID) framework to monitor crop response to agrometeorological hazards at near real-time using widely accessible remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DID framework, we applied it in quantifying the dry-hot wind impact on winter wheat in northern China as a case study using the VIs calculated from the MODIS data. The monitoring results for three years with varying severity levels of dry-hot events (i.e., 2007, 2013, and 2014) demonstrated that the framework can effectively detect winter wheat growing areas affected by dry-hot wind hazards. The estimated damage shows a notable relationship (R-2 = 0.903, p < 0.001) with the dry-hot wind intensity calculated from meteorological data, suggesting the effectiveness of the method when field data on a large scale is not available for direct validation. The main advantage of this method is that it can effectively isolate the impact of a specific hazard (i.e., dry-hot wind in the case study) from the mixed signals caused by other confounding factors. This general DID framework is very flexible and can be easily extended to other natural hazards and crop types with proper adjustment. Not only can this framework improve the crop yield forecast but also it can provide near real-time assessment for farmers to adapt their farming practice to mitigate impacts of agricultural hazards.

TI  - Evaluation of crop coefficient and evapotranspiration data for sugar beets from landsat surface reflectances using micrometeorological measurements and weighing lysimetry
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - In California and other agricultural regions that are facing challenges with water scarcity, accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) can support agricultural entities in ongoing efforts to improve on-farm water use efficiency. Remote sensing approaches for calculating ETc can be used to support wide area mapping of crop coefficients and ETc with the goal of increasing access to spatially and temporally distributed information for these variables, and advancing the use of evapotranspiration (ET) data in irrigation scheduling and management. We briefly review past work on the derivation of crop coefficients and ETc data from satellite-derived vegetation indices (VI) and evaluate the accuracy of a VI-based approach for calculation of ETc using a well instrumented, drip irrigated sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) field in the California Central Valley as a demonstration case. Sugar beets are grown around the world for sugar production, and are also being evaluated in California as a potential biofuel crop as well as for their ability to scavenge nitrogen from the soil, with important potential benefits for reduction of nitrate leaching from agricultural fields during the winter months. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of ETc data from the Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) framework for sugar beets using ET data from a weighing lysimeter and a flux station instrumented with micrometeorological instrumentation. We used the Allen and Pereira (A&P) approach, which was developed to estimate single and basal crop coefficients from crop fractional cover (fc) and height, and combined with satellite-derived fc data and grass reference ET (ETo) data as implemented within SIMS to estimate daily ETc from SIMS (ETc-SIMS) for the sugar beet crop. The accuracy of the daily ETc-SIMS data was evaluated against daily actual ET data from the weighing lysimeter (ETa-lys) and actual ET calculated using an energy balance approach from micrometeorological instrumentation (ETa-eb). Over the course of the 181-day production cycle, ETc-SIMS totaled 737.1 mm, which was within 7.7% of total ETa-lys and 3.7% of ETa-eb. On a daily timestep, SIMS mean bias error was-0.31 mm/day relative to ETa-lys, and 0.15 mm/ day relative to ETa-eb. The results from this study highlight the potential utility of applying satellite-based fc data coupled with the A&P approach to estimate ETc for drip-irrigated crops.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment

TI  - Effect of Tracer Staining Technology Based on Nano-Carbon Suspension on Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
T2  - Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma has the characteristics of high malignancy, strong invasiveness and special anatomical location. The prognosis of patients is generally poor. Invasion and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is a complex process involving multiple levels and factors. In order to explore the value of sentinel lymph node biopsy tracked by nano-carbon suspension in the treatment of early oral squamous cell carcinoma, 58 patients with early oral squamous cell carcinoma were selected in this paper. The pathological results of sentinel lymph nodes were analyzed after operation. In this study, the detection rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and false negative rate of the sentinel lymph nodes with the nano-carbon suspension were 95.6%, 86.4%, 92.2%, and 11.4%, respectively. The results show that sentinel lymph node biopsy traced by nano-carbon suspension has certain application value in guiding the treatment of early oral squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - A Classification Scheme for Sediments and Habitats on Exposed Intertidal Flats with Multi-Frequency Polarimetric SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed an extension of a previously proposed classification scheme that is based upon Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier decompositions of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, along with a Double-Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (DERD) parameter, and a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The extension was done, firstly, by using dual-copolarization SAR data acquired at shorter wavelengths (C- and X-band, in addition to the previously used L-band) and, secondly, by adding indicators derived from the (polarimetric) Kennaugh elements. The performance of the newly developed classification scheme, herein abbreviated as FCDK-RF, was tested using SAR data of exposed intertidal flats. We demonstrate that the FCDK-RF scheme is capable of distinguishing between different sediment types, namely mud and sand, at high spatial accuracies. Moreover, the classification scheme shows good potential in the detection of bivalve beds on the exposed flats. Our results show that the developed FCDK-RF scheme can be applied for the mapping of sediments and habitats in the Wadden Sea on the German North Sea coast using multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR from ALOS-2 (L-band), Radarsat-2 (C-band) and TerraSAR-X (X-band).

TI  - A Dual-Channel Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Algorithm Incorporating the BRDF Effect from AVHRR over Eastern Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A NOAA/AVHRR dual-channel method over land is proposed to simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0.55 mu m, and surface reflectance at 0.63 and 0.85 mu m. Compared with previous well-established one-channel retrieval algorithms, this algorithm takes advantage of the surface reflectance ratio between 0.63 and 0.85 mu m in an attempt to account for the effect induced by the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This effect cannot be negligible due to the orbit drift and phasing running of NOAA satellites, both of which potentially cause large solar angular variation. Meanwhile, the observation posture change of AVHRR would cause large sensor angular variation in time series measurements. The used surface reflectance ratio based on dual channels at 0.63 and 0.85 mu m is found more reasonable to be assumed as unchanged during a certain period of time, compared to the traditional ratio when addressing the BRDF issue. AOD retrievals have been carried out over Eastern Asia. Validation against aerosol robotic network (AERONET) measurements shows that up to 83% of AOD validation collocations are within error lines (+/- 0.15 +/- 0.15 tau, tau is AOD) with an R of 0.88 and an root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.15. The dual-channel algorithm taking into account the surface BRDF effect is proved outperforming the conventional 0.63 mu m-channel method. It indicates that our algorithm has the potential to be applied to the retrieval of long series of AOD, especially to the AOD retrieval of the sensors which lack a shortwave infrared channel required in the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dark target AOD algorithm.

TI  - Influence of Urban Sprawl on Microclimate of Abbottabad, Pakistan
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban centers are expanding rapidly due to quickly-increasing population which results in microclimate change due to lack of urban planning. Factors like degradation of green areas, trees, and vegetation are defining a new regime of urban environment giving rise to a lack of drinking water and lowering water tables. Consequently, unplanned urban sprawl with all its varied facets is having adverse impacts on the environment. Rapid variations in some of its climatic factors in the immediate vicinity are alarming and need to redress at war footings. This paper is an endeavor to present a hypothesis that urban sprawl plays a vital role in impacting and the influencing the microclimate of the city or the area. In this research, geospatial approaches were adopted to identify urban sprawl. Rise in land surface temperature (LST) for the last 25 years (from 1990 to 2016) has been highlighted using Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 TIRS) satellite images. Weather data collected from Meteorological Department is used to identify temperature rising trends. Result of the research clearly indicates that rapid urban sprawl has adverse impacts on microclimate by increasing LST. Built-up area has been changed from 178 to 477 sq. km within the years of 1990 to 2016. Vegetated area has decreased from 770 to 602 sq. km. Water areas have been decreased from 524 to 360 sq. km within the span of last 26 years. The bare land has increased from 494 sq. km to 742 sq. km. LST in winters has risen from 17 degrees C to 23 degrees C and at times shot up to 31 degrees C, which is alarming. Annual mean air temperature increased by 3 degrees C to 4 degrees C from the 1980s to 2016. During summers, the average air temperature rose to a startling 33 degrees C from 28 degrees C and LST has had a steady rise from 28.4 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The alarming urban sprawl in relation to temperature rise warrants measures which are required to plan the urban planning, forestation, and ecological measures to mitigate the disastrous trends which may result in flash floods, landslides, soil erosion and sediment transport endangering downstream reservoirs, water quality and depletion in ground water table in the valley.

TI  - Reconstruction of Snow Depth Data at Moderate Spatial Resolution (1 km) from Remotely Sensed Snow Data and Multiple Optimized Environmental Factors: A Case Study over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth distribution in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau is important for atmospheric circulation and surface water resources. In-situ observations at meteorological stations and remote observation by passive microwave remote sensing technique are two main approaches for monitoring snow depth at regional or global levels. However, the meteorological stations are often scarce and unevenly distributed in mountainous regions because of inaccessibility, so are the in-situ snow depth measurements. Passive microwave remote sensing data can alleviate the unevenness issue, but accuracy and spatial (e.g., 25 km) and temporal resolutions are low; spatial heterogeneity in snow depth is thus hard to capture. On the other hand, optical sensors such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites can monitor snow at moderate spatial resolution (1 km) and high temporal resolution (daily) but only snow area extent, not snow depth. Fusing passive microwave snow depth data with optical snow area extent data provides an unprecedented opportunity for generating snow depth data at moderate spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. In this article, a linear multivariate snow depth reconstruction (LMSDR) model was developed by fusing multisource snow depth data, optical snow area extent data, and environmental factors (e.g., spatial distribution, terrain features, and snow cover characteristics), to reconstruct daily snow depth data at moderate resolution (1 km) for 16 consecutive hydrological years, taking Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) as a case study. We found that snow cover day (SCD) and environmental factors such as longitude, latitude, slope, surface roughness, and surface fluctuation have a significant impact on the variations of snow depth over the QTP. Relatively high accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.26 cm) was observed in the reconstructed snow depth when compared with in-situ data. Compared with the passive microwave remote sensing snow depth product, constructing a nonlinear snow depletion curve product with an empirical formula and fusion snow depth product, the LMSDR model (RMSE = 2.28 cm, R-2 = 0.63) demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy of snow depth reconstruction. The overall spatial accuracy of the reconstructed snow depth was 92%. Compared with in-situ observations, the LMSDR product performed well regarding different snow depth intervals, land use, elevation intervals, slope intervals, and SCD and performed best, especially when the snow depth was less than 3 cm. At the same time, a long-time snow depth series reconstructed based on the LMSDR model reflected interannual variations of snow depth well over the QTP.

TI  - Trends and Variability of Atmospheric Downward Longwave Radiation Over China From 1958 to 2015
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) is a major component of the energy budget. Although studies have reported the spatiotemporal variations of SDLR in China, the spatiotemporal coverage of the situ measurements used is always limited. In this study, the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) was developed to reconstruct SDLR based on air temperature (T-a), relative humidity (RH), and downward shortwave radiation (DSR). Ground measurements collected at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the Arid and Semi-arid Region Collaborative Observation Project (ASRCOP) were used to build and evaluate the GBRT model. The evaluation results showed that the daily SDLR estimates are correlated well with the SDLR in situ, with an overall root mean square errors (RMSE) of 16.5 Wm(-2) and a correlation coefficient (R) value of 0.91 for the validation data set. Comparison with existing SDLR products showed that accuracy and trends of the SDLR estimates based on the GBRT method are reasonable. To obtain long-term SDLR data for spatiotemporal analysis over China, densely distributed reconstructed DSR and ground measured T-a and RH collected at 756 Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations were used as input to estimate the SDLR based on the GBRT method over China during 1958-2015. The long-term estimated SDLRs at the selected 563 stations showed that SDLR increased at an average rate of 1.3 Wm(-2) per decade over China from 1958 to 2015. The trend of SDLR is positively correlated with the trend in T-a and water vapor pressure, whereas negatively correlated with the trend in DSR.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Optical Signatures within and around Floating Tonga-Fiji Pumice Rafts Using MODIS, VIIRS, and OLCI Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An underwater volcanic eruption off the Vava'u island group in Tonga on 7 August 2019 resulted in the creation of floating pumice on the ocean's surface extending over an area of 150 km(2). The pumice's far-reaching effects from its origin in the Tonga region to Fiji and the methods of automatic detection using satellite imagery are described, making it possible to track the westward drift of the pumice raft over 43 days. Level 2 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), and Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) imagery of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, quasi-surface (i.e., Rayleigh-corrected) reflectance, and remote sensing reflectance were used to distinguish consolidated and fragmented rafts as well as discolored and mesotrophic waters. The rafts were detected by a 1 to 3.5 degrees C enhancement in the MODIS-derived "sea surface temperature" due to the emissivity difference of the raft material. Large plumes of discolored waters, characterized by higher satellite reflectance/backscattering of particles in the blue than surrounding waters (and corresponding to either submersed pumice or associated white minerals), were associated with the rafts. The discolored waters had relatively lower chlorophyll-a concentration, but this was artificial, resulting from the higher blue/red reflectance ratio caused by the reflective pumice particles. Mesotrophic waters were scarce in the region of the pumice rafts, presumably due to the absence of phytoplanktonic response to a silicium-rich pumice environment in these tropical oligotrophic environments. As beach accumulations around Pacific islands surrounded by coral shoals are a recurrent phenomenon that finds its origin far east in the ocean along the Tongan trench, monitoring the events from space, as demonstrated for the 7 August 2019 eruption, might help mitigate their potential economic impacts.

TI  - Polish Cadastre Modernization with Remotely Extracted Buildings from High-Resolution Aerial Orthoimagery and Airborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic building extraction from remote sensing data is a hot but challenging research topic for cadastre verification, modernization and updating. Deep learning algorithms are perceived as more promising in overcoming the difficulties of extracting semantic features from complex scenes and large differences in buildings' appearance. This paper explores the modified fully convolutional network U-Shape Network (U-Net) for high resolution aerial orthoimagery segmentation and dense LiDAR data to extract building outlines automatically. The three-step end-to-end computational procedure allows for automated building extraction with an 89.5% overall accuracy and an 80.7% completeness, which made it very promising for cadastre modernization in Poland. The applied algorithms work well both in densely and poorly built-up areas, typical for peripheral areas of cities, where uncontrolled development had recently been observed. Discussing the possibilities and limitations, the authors also provide some important information that could help local authorities decide on the use of remote sensing data in land administration.

TI  - iCOR Atmospheric Correction on Sentinel-3/OLCI over Land: Intercomparison with AERONET, RadCalNet, and SYN Level-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To validate the iCOR atmospheric correction algorithm applied to the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) observations over land, globally retrieved Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Top-of-Canopy (TOC) reflectance, and Vegetation Indices (VIs) were intercompared with (i) AERONET AOT and AERONET-based TOC reflectance simulations, (ii) RadCalNet surface reflectance observations, and (iii) SYN Level 2 (L2) AOT, TOC reflectance, and VIs. The results reveal that, overall, iCOR's statistical and temporal consistency is high. iCOR AOT retrievals overestimate relative to AERONET, but less than SYN L2. iCOR and SYN L2 TOC reflectances exhibit a negative bias of similar to-0.01 and -0.02, respectively, in the Blue bands compared to the simulations. This diminishes for RED and NIR, except for a +0.02 bias for SYN L2 in the NIR. The intercomparison with RadCalNet shows relative differences < +/- 6%, except for bands Oa02 (Blue) and Oa21 (NIR), which is likely related to the reported OLCI "excess of brightness". The intercomparison between iCOR and SYN L2 showed R-2 = 0.80-0.93 and R-2 = 0.92-0.96 for TOC reflectance and VIs, respectively. iCOR's higher temporal smoothness compared to SYN L2 does not propagate into a significantly higher smoothness for TOC reflectance and VIs. Altogether, we conclude that iCOR is well suitable to retrieve statistically and temporally consistent AOT, TOC reflectance, and VIs over land surfaces from Sentinel-3/OLCI observations.

TI  - Modelling the impact of a sex work crackdown on syphilis transmission among female sex workers and their clients in South China
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To estimate the potential effects of an intense sex work crackdown on syphilis transmission in Guangdong Province, China.Methods We developed a deterministic compartmental model of syphilis transmission among female sex workers (FSW) and their male clients in Guangdong Province, China. We based model assumptions on census data and scientific literature, and we fitted the model to sentinel surveillance estimates of syphilis prevalence (positive results in both treponemal and non-treponemal tests) among FSW between 2009 and 2013. We estimated the impact of an intense sex work crackdown in 2014 by comparing the number of new syphilis infections between 2014 and 2020 in crackdown versus basecase (no crackdown) scenarios. In modelling scenarios, we examined main crackdown mechanisms of impact, including changed number of FSW engaging in sex work, reduction of weekly transactions, condom usage rate and syphilis diagnosis rate.Results In the basecase, predicted syphilis prevalence in FSW decreased from 2% in 2014 to 0.4% in 2020. In crackdown scenarios, syphilis incidence was predicted to transiently decrease and then to rebound relative to basecase levels a few years later. Shorter crackdowns led to higher, faster rebounds.Conclusions Short-term intense crackdowns may exacerbate syphilis transmission among FSW and further marginalise an already vulnerable group. This study provides a quantitative, infection-related basis for changing sex work policies to reduce harms.

TI  - Modeling Community-Scale Natural Resource Use in a Transboundary Southern African Landscape: Integrating Remote Sensing and Participatory Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing analyses focused on non-timber forest product (NTFP) collection and grazing are current research priorities of land systems science. However, mapping these particular land use patterns in rural heterogeneous landscapes is challenging because their potential signatures on the landscape cannot be positively identified without fine-scale land use data for validation. Using field-mapped resource areas and household survey data from participatory mapping research, we combined various Landsat-derived indices with ancillary data associated with human habitation to model the intensity of grazing and NTFP collection activities at 100-m spatial resolution. The study area is situated centrally within a transboundary southern African landscape that encompasses community-based organization (CBO) areas across three countries. We conducted four iterations of pixel-based random forest models, modifying the variable set to determine which of the covariates are most informative, using the best fit predictions to summarize and compare resource use intensity by resource type and across communities. Pixels within georeferenced, field-mapped resource areas were used as training data. All models had overall accuracies above 60% but those using proxies for human habitation were more robust, with overall accuracies above 90%. The contribution of Landsat data as utilized in our modeling framework was negligible, and further research must be conducted to extract greater value from Landsat or other optical remote sensing platforms to map these land use patterns at moderate resolution. We conclude that similar population proxy covariates should be included in future studies attempting to characterize communal resource use when traditional spectral signatures do not adequately capture resource use intensity alone. This study provides insights into modeling resource use activity when leveraging both remotely sensed data and proxies for human habitation in heterogeneous, spectrally mixed rural land areas.

TI  - The Global Burden of Meningitis in Children: Challenges with Interpreting Global Health Estimates
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global roadmap to defeat meningitis by 2030. To advocate for and track progress of the roadmap, the burden of meningitis as a syndrome and by pathogen must be accurately defined. Three major global health models estimating meningitis mortality as a syndrome and/or by causative pathogen were identified and compared for the baseline year 2015. Two models, (1) the WHO and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) group's Child Mortality Estimation (WHO-MCEE) and (2) the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2017), identified meningitis, encephalitis and neonatal sepsis, collectively, to be the second and third largest infectious killers of children under five years, respectively. Global meningitis/encephalitis and neonatal sepsis mortality estimates differed more substantially between models than mortality estimates for selected infectious causes of death and all causes of death combined. Estimates at national level and by pathogen also differed markedly between models. Aligning modelled estimates with additional data sources, such as national or sentinel surveillance, could more accurately define the global burden of meningitis and help track progress against the WHO roadmap.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of surface velocities of monsoon temperate glaciers in the Kangri Karpo Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - Influenced by the Indian monsoon, the Kangri Karpo Mountains (KKM) of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau is the most humid part of the plateau, and one of the most important regions with numerous monsoon temperate glaciers. Glacier mass balance estimates have been strongly negative in the KKM over recent decades, but the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface velocity are poorly understood. Using phase-correlation feature tracking on Landsat images, this study estimates spatiotemporal variabilities of monsoon temperate glaciers for the period of 1988-2019. Results show that a significant slowdown was observed below an elevation of 4900 m, while an accelerated ice flow was found at an elevation of 4900-5800 m over the past 30 years. The trend of slowdown was -0.1 m a(-1) dec(-1) during 1988-2000, and then it increased to -0.5 m a(-1) dec(-1) during 2001-2019.

TI  - Integrating the JRC Monthly Water History Dataset and Geostatistical Analysis Approach to Quantify Surface Hydrological Connectivity Dynamics in an Ungauged Multi-Lake System
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the dynamics of surface hydrological connectivity in a landscape of multiple lakes with different sizes and depths is challenging. This is especially the case for ungagged, large areas of multi-lake systems. Integrated use of remote sensing and geostatistical analysis can be a useful approach for developing metrics that can be used to identify the hydrological connectivity and their changes. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis of 18 wet and dry binary state rasters derived from Landsat images over a large ungauged multi-lake system, the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. Our goal was to investigate applicability and dynamics of three surface hydrological connectivity metrics, namely, geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), and surface water extent (SWE) of the top 10 largest connectomes (i.e., seasonally connected water bodies). We found that, during a dry year, the reduction rate of the GCF curve was slower along the west-east (W-E) direction than along the north-south (N-S) direction, which was contrary to the patterns exhibited in a normal or wet year. The minimum values of the MDC in W-E and N-S directions in the dry year were 22.4 km and 6.3 km, respectively, while the maximum values of the MDC along the above two directions in the wet year were 50.7 km and 65.1 km, respectively. The components and spatial distribution of the top 10 largest connectomes changed dramatically in different months of each hydrological year, resulting in a huge change in the monthly SWE of the top 10 largest connectomes. Overall, this study validated the usefulness of combining remote sensing image analysis with geostatistical methods to quantify the surface hydrological connectivity from different perspectives in an ungauged area. The approach may be applicable to studies in other geographical regions, to guide water resources and wetland management practices.

TI  - A Classification of Tidal Flat Wetland Vegetation Combining Phenological Features with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition and distribution of wetland vegetation is critical for ecosystem diversity and sustainable development. However, tidal flat wetland environments are complex, and obtaining effective satellite imagery is challenging due to the high cloud coverage. Moreover, it is difficult to acquire phenological feature data and extract species-level wetland vegetation information by using only spectral data or individual images. To solve these limitations, statistical features, temporal features, and phenological features of multiple Landsat 8 time-series images obtained via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were compared to extract species-level wetland vegetation information from Chongming Island, China. The results indicated that (1) a harmonic model obtained the phenological characteristics of wetland vegetation better than the raw vegetation index (VI) and the Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing method; (2) classification based on the combination of the three features provided the highest overall accuracy (85.54%), and the phenological features (represented by the amplitude and phase of the harmonic model) had the greatest impact on the classification; and (3) the classification result from the senescence period was more accurate than that from the green period, but the annual mapping result on all seasons was the most accurate. The method described in this study can be applied to overcome the impacts of the complex environment in tidal flat wetlands and to effectively classify wetland vegetation species using GEE. This study could be used as a reference for the analysis of the phenological features of other areas or vegetation types.

TI  - Identification of the Characteristic Scale of Fine Ground Objects: A Case Study of the Core Observation Area in the Middle Reaches of the Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing the spatial heterogeneity and characteristic scale is the key to determining the spatial patterns of land surfaces. In this research, the core observation area of the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin was selected as the study area, and the scale identification of several typical objects was carried out by implementing experiments on moderate- and high-resolution remotely sensed ASTER and CASI NDVI images. The aim was to evaluate the potential of the local variance and semivariance analysis to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of objects, track their changes with scale, and obtain their scales. Our results show that natural objects have multiscale structures. For a single object with a recognizable size, the results of the two methods are relatively consistent. For continuously distributed samples of indistinctive size, the scale obtained by the local variance is smaller than that obtained by the semivariance. As the image resolution becomes coarser and the research scopes expand, the scales of objects are also increasing. This article also indicates that with a small research area of uniform objects, the local variance and semivariance are easy to facilitate researchers to quickly select the appropriate spatial resolution of remote sensing data according to the research area.

TI  - Analyzing the Probability of Acquiring Cloud-Free Imagery in China with AVHRR Cloud Mask Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing data are used widely in many fields (such as agriculture, resource management and the environment), especially for the vast territory of China; however, the application of these data is usually limited by clouds. Although it is valuable to analyze the probability of acquiring cloud-free imagery (PACI), PACI using different sensors at the pixel level across China has not been reported. In this study, the PACI of China was calculated with daily Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) cloud mask data from 1990 to 2019. The results showed that (1) PACI varies dramatically in different regions and months in China. The value was larger in autumn and winter, and the largest figure reached 49.55% in October in Inner Mongolia (NM). In contrast, relatively small values occurred in summer, and the minimum value (5.26%) occurred in June in South China (SC). (2) As the climate changes, the PACI has increased significantly throughout the country and most regions, especially in North China (NC), with a growth rate of 1.9% per decade. The results can be used as a reference for selecting appropriate optical sensors and observation times in areas of interest.

TI  - Assessment of machine learning classifiers for global lake ice cover mapping from MODIS TOA reflectance data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The topic of satellite remote sensing of lake ice has gained considerable attention in recent years. Optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) allow for the monitoring of lake ice cover (an Essential Climate Variable or ECV), and dates associated with ice phenology (freeze-up, break-up, and ice cover duration) over large areas in an era where ground-based observational networks have nearly vanished in many northern countries. Ice phenology dates as well as dates of maximum and minimum ice cover extent (for lakes that do not form a complete ice cover in winter or do not totally lose their ice cover in summer) are useful for assessing long-term trends and variability in climate, particularly due to their sensitivity to changes in near-surface air temperature. Existing knowledge-driven (threshold-based) retrieval algorithms for lake ice cover mapping that use top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance products do not perform well under lower solar illumination conditions (i.e. large solar zenith angles), resulting in low TOA reflectance. This research assessed the capability of four machine learning classifiers (i.e. multinomial logistic regression, MLR; support vector machine, SVM; random forest, RF; gradient boosting trees, GBT) for mapping lake ice cover, water and cloud cover during both break-up and freeze-up periods using the MODIS/Terra L1B TOA (MOD02) product. The classifiers were trained and validated using samples collected from 17 large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America); lakes that represent different characteristics with regards to area, latitude, freezing frequency, and ice duration. Following an accuracy assessment using random k-fold cross-validation (k = 100), all machine learning classifiers using a 7-band combination (visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared) were found to be able to produce overall classification accuracies above 94%. Both RF and GBT provided overall and class-specific accuracies above 98% and a more visually accurate depiction of lake ice, water and cloud cover. The two tree-based classifiers offered the most robust spatial transferability over the 17 lakes and performed consistently well across ice seasons. However, only RF was relatively insensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters compared to the other three classifiers. The results demonstrate the potential of RF for mapping lake ice cover globally from MODIS TOA reflectance data.

TI  - Mapping Impacts of Human Activities from Nighttime Light on Vegetation Cover Changes in Southeast Asia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - It is commonly believed that the impacts of human activities have decreased the natural vegetation cover, while some promotion of the vegetation growth has also been found. In this study, negative or positive correlations between human impacts and vegetation cover were tested in the Southeast Asia (SEA) region during 2012-2018. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite-Day/Night Band (VIIRS/DNB) nocturnal data were used as a measure of human activities and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)/normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) diurnal data were used as a measure of vegetation cover. The temporal segmentation method was introduced to calculate features of two sets of time series with spatial resolution of about 500 m, including the overall trend, maximum trend, start date, and change duration. The regions with large variation in human activities (V-change region) were first extracted by the Gaussian fitted method, and 8.64% of the entire SEA (VIIRS overall trend 0.4) was set as the target analysis area. According to statistics, the average overall VIIRS trend for the V-change region in SEA was about 2.12, with a slight NDVI increment. The time lag effect was also found between vegetation cover and human impacts change, with an average of 10.26 months. Our results indicated a slight green overall trend in the SEA region over the most recent 7 years. The spatial pattern of our trend analysis results can be useful for vegetation management and regional planning.

TI  - Changes of lymphatic flow caused by core needle biopsy of axillary sentinel lymph node in a rabbit model
T2  - ANNALS OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Core needle biopsy (CNB) plays an important role in the preoperative axillary lymph node (ALN) assessment in breast cancer (BC) patients with the development of treatment, but little is known about the axillary lymph flow after CNB of ALNs. This study aimed to investigate the changes of lymphatic flow after CNB of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in a rabbit model.Methods: The axillary SLN was biopsied in a rabbit model, and the changes of sentinel lymph flow were observed by methylthioninium chloride imaging at 1 and 12 days after the biopsy. Furthermore, the afferent lymphatic vessel was ligated and imaged once every 3 days to assess the changes of lymphatic flow.Results: The SLN biopsied was characterized by disorganized medullary sinus containing erythrocytes, whereas clean medullary sinus containing a normal population of circulating lymphoid cells was observed in the contralateral normal SLN. At 1 day after biopsy, the sentinel lymphatic drainage was blocked. At 12 days after biopsy, the sentinel lymphatic flow was reconstructed or repaired. Ligation of afferent lymphatic vessel further confirmed the reconstruction of lymphatic flow.Conclusions: The sentinel lymphatic flow changes after CNB in a rabbit model, but it can be reconstructed or repaired.

TI  - Carbon Storage Change Analysis and Emission Reduction Suggestions under Land Use Transition: A Case Study of Henan Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant spatial heterogeneity among river basin ecosystems makes it difficult for local governments to carry out comprehensive governance for different river basins in a special administrative region spanning multi-river basins. However, there are few studies on the construction of a comprehensive governance mechanism for multi-river basins at the provincial level. To fill this gap, this paper took Henan Province of China, which straddles four river basins, as the study region. The chord diagram, overlay analysis, and carbon emission models were applied to the remote sensing data of land use to analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage caused by land-use changes in Henan Province from 1990 to 2018 to reflect the heterogeneity of the contribution of the four basins to human activities and economic development. The results revealed that food security land in the four basins decreased, while production and living land increased. Ecological conservation land was increased over time in the Yangtze River Basin. In addition, the conversion from food security land to production and living land was the common characteristic for the four basins. Carbon emission in Henan increased from 134.46 million tons in 1990 to 553.58 million tons in 2018, while its carbon absorption was relatively stable (1.67-1.69 million tons between 1990 and 2018). The carbon emitted in the Huai River Basin was the main contributor to Henan Province's total carbon emission. The carbon absorption in Yellow River Basin and Yangtze River Basin had an obvious spatial agglomeration effect. Finally, considering the current need of land spatial planning in China and the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060 set by the Chinese government, we suggested that carbon sequestration capacity should be further strengthened in Yellow River Basin and Yangtze River Basin based on their respective ecological resource advantages. For future development in Hai River Basin and Huai River Basin, coordinating the spatial allocation of urban scale and urban green space to build an ecological city is a key direction to embark upon.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatial Variation of Aerosol Optical Depth and Its Correlation with Land Use/Land Cover in Wuhan, China: A Perspective of Urban Planning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols significantly affect environmental conditions, air quality, and public health locally, regionally, and globally. Examining the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on aerosol optical depth (AOD) helps to understand how human activities influence air quality and develop suitable solutions. The Landsat 8 image and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products in summer in 2018 were used in LULC classification and AOD retrieval in this study. Spatial statistics and correlation analysis about the relationship between LULC and AOD were performed to examine the impact of LULC on AOD in summer in Wuhan, China. Results indicate that the AOD distribution expressed an obvious "basin effect" in urban development areas: higher AOD values concentrated in water bodies with lower terrain, which were surrounded by the high buildings or mountains with lower AOD values. The AOD values were negatively correlated with the vegetated areas while positively correlated to water bodies and construction lands. The impact of LULC on AOD varied with different contexts in all cases, showing a "context effect". The regression correlations among the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and AOD in given landscape contexts were much stronger than those throughout the whole study area. These findings provide sound evidence for urban planning, land use management and air quality improvement.

TI  - Crop Height Estimation of Corn from Multi-Year RADARSAT-2 Polarimetric Observables Using Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a demonstration of the applicability of machine learning techniques for the retrieval of crop height in corn fields using space-borne PolSAR (Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data. Multi-year RADARSAT-2 C-band data acquired over agricultural areas in Canada, covering the whole corn growing period, are exploited. Two popular machine learning regression methods, i.e., Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are adopted and evaluated. A set of 27 representative polarimetric parameters are extracted from the PolSAR data and used as input features in the regression models for height estimation. Furthermore, based on the unique capability of the RFR method to determine variable importance contributing to the regression, a smaller number of polarimetric features (6 out of 27 in our study) are selected in the final regression models. Results of our study demonstrate that PolSAR observables can produce corn height estimates with root mean square error (RMSE) around 40-50 cm throughout the growth cycle. The RFR approach shows better overall accuracy in corn height estimation than the SVR method in all tests. The six selected polarimetric features by variable importance ranking can generate better results. This study provides a new perspective on the use of PolSAR data in retrieving agricultural crop height from space.

TI  - Exploratory Survey of Spotted Lanternfly (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) and Its Natural Enemies in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An invasive population of spotted lanternfly (SLF), Lycorma delicatula White, was first noted in North America in Pennsylvania in 2014, and by September 2020 populations had spread to six additional states. To develop a biocontrol program to aid in the management of the pest, exploratory surveys for SLF natural enemies in its native range were carried out in 27 provinces and other administrative regions of China from 2015 to 2019. Naturally laid egg masses were collected and sentinel SLF egg masses were deployed to attract egg parasitoids, and yellow sticky traps were used to collect SLF nymphs to discover and determine the parasitism rates of nymphal parasitoids. Results show that SLF is widely distributed in China (22 provinces and regions) and that the population densities in northeast China are higher than in southern and western China. An egg parasitoid, Anastatus orientalisYang (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), and a nymphal parasitoid, Dryinus sinicus Olmi (Hymenoptera: Dryinidae), were collected. Anastatus orientalis was reared from SLF eggs in seven provinces in China with parasitoid emergence rates ranging from 4.0 to 15.5% (or 17.6 to 37.3% if including only egg masses that had at least some parasitism). There were significant differences in parasitoid emergence rates between sites associated with factors including habitat and host plants. Dryinus sinicus was discovered in eight cities across six provinces.The percentage of SLF nymphs parasitized by D. sinicus were 31.1, 23.3, and 0% in Tai'an, Shandong Province, Beijing City, and Yan'an, Shaanxi Province, respectively. These two parasitoids are promising natural enemies that are being considered as potential biocontrol agents of invasive populations of SLF.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Time-Series Analysis on Persistent Scatter-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) Derived Displacements of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) from Sentinel-1A Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique has been applied in monitoring the deformation of infrastructures, such as bridges, highways, railways and subways. Persistent scatterer (PS)-InSAR is one of the InSAR techniques, which utilises persistent scatterers to derive long-term displacements. This study applied time-series methods to post-process the PS-InSAR-derived time-series displacements with the use of 86 Sentinel-1A acquisitions spanning from 6 January 2018 to 27 November 2020. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and seasonal and trend decomposition using loess (STL) were combined to estimate the seasonal component of the total time-series displacements. Then, a temperature correlation map was generated by correlating the seasonal component with the temperature variation. Results show that the thermal expansion phenomenon is pronounced on the buildings of the Zhuhai-Macao Passenger Terminal as well as the bridge and road connecting to the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), while it is less obviously observed at the main Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB). In addition, sudden changes between subsidence and uplift can be detected through the p-values derived by applying the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to the residual signals after removing the linear and seasonal components from the original ones.

TI  - Integrating a Three-Level GIS Framework and a Graph Model to Track, Represent, and Analyze the Dynamic Activities of Tidal Flats
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats (non-vegetated area) are soft-sediment habitats that are alternately submerged and exposed to the air by changeable tidal levels. The tidal flat dynamics research mainly utilizes the cell-level comparisons between the consecutive snapshots, but the in-depth study requires more detailed information of the dynamic activities. To better track, represent, and analyze tidal flats' dynamic activities, this study proposes an integrated approach of a three-level Geographic Information Science (GIS) framework and a graph model. In the three-level GIS framework, the adjacent cells are assembled as the objects, and the objects on different time steps are linked as lifecycles by tracking the predecessor-successor relationships. Furthermore, eleven events are defined to describe the dynamic activities throughout the lifecycles. The graph model provides a better way to represent the lifecycles, and graph operators are utilized to facilitate the event analysis. The integrated approach is applied to tidal flats' dynamic activities in the southwest tip of Florida Peninsula from 1984 to 2018. The results suggest that the integrated approach provides an effective way to track, represent, and analyze the dynamic activities of tidal flats, and it offers a novel perspective to examine other dynamic geographic phenomena with large spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - Comprehensive Risk Assessment of Schistosomiasis Epidemic Based on Precise Identification of <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> Breeding Grounds-A Case Study of Dongting Lake Area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal epidemic simulation, assessment, and risk monitoring serve as the core to establishing and improving the national public health emergency management system. In this study, we investigated Oncomelania hupensis breeding grounds and analyzed the locational and environmental preferences of snail breeding in Dongting Lake (DTL), Hunan, China. Using geographic information systems and remote sensing technology, we identified schistosomiasis risk areas and explored the factors affecting the occurrence and transmission of the disease. Several key conclusions were drawn. (1) From 2006 to 2016, the spatial change of potential O. hupensis breeding risk showed a diminishing trend from the eastern and northern regions to southwest DTL. Environmental changes in the eastern DTL region resulted in the lakeside and hydrophilic agglomerations of the O. hupensis populations. The shift in snail breeding grounds from a fragmented to centralized distribution indicates the weakening mobility of the O. hupensis population, the increasing independence of solitary groups, and the growing dependence of the snail population to the local environment. (2) The spatial risk distribution showed a descending gradient from west Dongting area to the east and an overall pattern of high in the periphery of large lakes and low in other areas. The cold-spot areas had their cores in Huarong County and Anxiang County and were scattered throughout the peripheral areas. The hot-spot areas had their center at Jinshi City, Nanxian County, and the southern part of Huarong County. The areas with increased comprehensive risks changed from centralized and large-scale development to fragmented shrinkage with increased partialization in the core area. The risk distribution's center shifted to the northwest. The spatial risk distribution exhibited enhanced concentricity along the major axis and increased dispersion along the minor axis.

TI  - Dynamic Threshold of Carbon Phenology in Two Cold Temperate Grasslands in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology, especially the timing of the start and the end of the vegetation growing season (SOS and EOS), plays a major role in grassland ecosystem carbon cycles. As the second-largest grassland country in the world, China's grasslands are mainly distributed in the northern cold temperate climate zone. The accuracies and relations of plant phenology estimations from multialgorithms and data resources are poorly understood. Here, we investigated vegetation phenology in two typical cold temperate grasslands, Haibei (HB) and Inner Mongolia (NM) grasslands, in China from 2001 to 2017. Compared to ground vegetation phenology observations, we analyzed the performance of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer MODIS phenology products (MCD12Q2) and two remote sensing-based vegetation phenology algorithms from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series (five satellite-based phenology algorithms). The optimal algorithm was used to compare with eddy covariance (EC)-based carbon phenology, and to calculate the thresholds of carbon phenology periods (SOSt and EOSt) in each site. Results showed that satellite-based phenology estimations (all five algorithms in this study) were strongly coupled with the temporal variation of the observed phenological period but significantly overestimated the SOS, predicting it to be over 21 days later than the field data. The carbon phenology thresholds of HB grassland (HB_SOSt and HB_EOSt) had a significant upward trend, with the multiyear average values being 0.14 and 0.29, respectively. In contrast, the thresholds of NM grasslands (NM_SOSt and NM_EOSt) also showed a certain upward trend, but it was not significant (p > 0.05), with the multiyear average values being 0.17 and 0.2, respectively. Our study suggested the thresholds of carbon phenology periods (SOSt and EOSt, %) could be simply and effectively estimated based on their significant relationship with the EC-based maximum of gross primary productivity observations (GPPmax) at a specific site and time. Therefore, this study suggested the thresholds of carbon phenology were not fixed even in a specific ecosystem, which also provided simple bridges between satellite-based vegetation phenology and EC-based carbon phenology in similar grasslands.

TI  - Intelligent Reflecting Surface Enabled Secure Cooperative Transmission for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) empowered secure cooperative transmission strategy for satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. In such networks, an IRS is deployed near the satellite user to reflect the common-spectrum friendly interference from the terrestrial network to help protect the satellite downlink transmission from being eavesdropped. We seek to minimize the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the eavesdropper required to guarantee the reliable communication at the terrestrial network user and to limit the maximum tolerable interference at the satellite user. Then, an alternation optimization scheme is developed. Simulation results verify that the proposed IRS enabled cooperative jamming scheme can reduce the target SINR at the eavesdropper significantly, thus achieving a great secrecy gain.

TI  - Inferring Near-Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations from the VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Product in China: A Spatiotemporally Weighted Random Forest Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the population is exposed to PM2.5 (particulate matter) pollution in China, and establishing a high-precision PM2.5 grid dataset will be very valuable for air pollution and related studies. However, limited by the traditional models themselves and input data sources, PM2.5 estimations are of low accuracy with narrow spatial coverage. Therefore, we develop a new spatiotemporally weighted random forest (SWRF) model to improve the estimation accuracy and expand the spatial coverage of PM2.5 concentrations using the latest release of the Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) Deep Blue (DB) aerosol product, along with meteorological variables, and socioeconomic data. Compared with traditional methods and the results of previous similar studies, our satellite-derived PM2.5 distribution shows better consistency with surface-measured records, having a high out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation (CV) coefficient of determination (CV-R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.87 (0.85), 11.23 (11.53) mu g m(-3) and 8.25 (8.78) mu g m(-3), respectively. The monthly, seasonal, and annual mean PM2.5 were also successfully captured (CV-R-2 = 0.91-0.92, RMSE = 4.35-6.72 mu g m(-3)). Then, the spatial characteristics of PM2.5 pollution in 2018 were investigated, showing that although air pollution has diminished in recent years, China still faces a high PM2.5 pollution risk overall, especially in winter (average = 50.43 + 16.81 mu g m(-3)). In addition, 19 provinces or administrative regions have annual PM2.5 concentrations >35 mu g m(-3), particularly the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (similar to 55.25 mu g m(-3)), Tianjin (similar to 49.65 mu g m(-3)), and Henan Province (similar to 48.60 mu g m(-3)). Our estimated surface PM2.5 concentrations are accurate, which could benefit further research on air pollution in China.

TI  - Assessment of red-edge vegetation descriptors in a modified water cloud model for forward modelling using Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of different vegetation descriptors (V) in the modified water cloud model (MWCM), with a focus on comparing the Red - Edge vegetation indices (VI) based and other vegetation descriptors using Sentinel - 1A and Sentinel - 2 satellite data. In order to reduce the influences of vegetation and roughness effectively, a soil geometrical model of equivalent roughness was coupled with a MWCM for the simulation in forward modelling. The optimum value of vegetation extinction coefficient (K-VI) and dense vegetation indices (VI infinity) of modified Beer's law were calculated using non-linear least square optimization technique. After the parameterization of MWCM, the five different types of V for wheat crop were tested for the simulation of backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)(dB)) at VV polarization. The higher statistical performance indices like coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.96), root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.17 (dB)) and Nash sutcliffe efficiency (NSE = 0.93) were found for the case of Red-Edge-based vegetation descriptors (for VI = NDVIRE) than others in MWCM. Therefore, this methodology reveals that the VI = NDVIRE by modified Beer's law can be used effectively as the vegetation parameter in the MWCM for accurate simulation in forward direction over vegetation-covered areas.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, industrialization and urbanization in large cities cause an increase in the surfaces covered with manmade objects such as concrete and asphalt. The expansion of urban areas and increase in the using materials with high heat storage properties, directly affect the Land Surface Temperature (LST), which shows an increase in the sensible temperature of the region. LST is directly connected to the natural green vegetation of the land and varies widely in large urban areas, these differences related to the temperature is defined as the `urban heat island'. In this study, it was investigated the temporal variation of land surface temperature due to urbanization. Bursa, which is considered as a study area, has shown a rapid population increase since 1990 and a rapid increase in the number of buildings with the impact of urbanization and industrialisation. To determine the effect of this urbanization and industrialisation on land surface temperature, temporal change analysis of the surface temperature in the Bursa was observed with Landsat satellite images of 1988, 1998, 2008 and 2018. From produced maps, it was observed that the amount of green vegetation in urban areas decreased and as a consequence of this decrease, the surface temperature increased in the urban areas.

TI  - Radiometric Calibration Evaluation for FY3D MERSI-II Thermal Infrared Channels at Lake Qinghai
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The absolute radiometric accuracy of the Fengyun 3D advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (FY3D MERSI-II) thermal infrared bands was evaluated using the collected field measurements and atmospheric transfer simulations during 16-22 August 2019 at Lake Qinghai. A thermal infrared radiometer equipped on an unmanned surface vehicle was used to continuously collect the water temperature. Atmospheric conditions, surface emissivity, and aerosol optical depth measured near the field experiment site were adopted by the atmospheric transfer code to calculate the parameters about the influence of atmosphere on long-wave radiation, including the path radiance and the transmittance propagated from land surface to the satellite. The radiometric calibration accuracy analysis suggests that the differences between the simulated brightness temperature and satellite-based brightness temperature are -0.346 K and -0.722 K for channel 24 on 18 and 20 August, respectively, while it reaches -0.460 K and -1.036 K for channel 25 on 18 and 20 August, respectively. The vicarious calibration coefficients were found to be in good agreement with the internal onboard calibration coefficient in channel 24 and 25 of the FY3D MERSI-II according to the validation analysis in selected regions. The thermal infrared bands of the FY3D have a good in-orbit operational status according to our vicarious calibration experiments.

TI  - A New Individual Tree Species Recognition Method Based on a Convolutional Neural Network and High-Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species surveys are crucial to forest resource management and can provide references for forest protection policy making. The traditional tree species survey in the field is labor-intensive and time-consuming, supporting the practical significance of remote sensing. The availability of high-resolution satellite remote sensing data enable individual tree species (ITS) recognition at low cost. In this study, the potential of the combination of such images and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize ITS was explored. Firstly, individual tree crowns were delineated from a high-spatial resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) image and manually labeled as different tree species. Next, a dataset of the image subsets of the labeled individual tree crowns was built, and several CNN models were trained based on the dataset for ITS recognition. The models were then applied to the WV3 image. The results show that the distribution maps of six ITS offered an overall accuracy of 82.7% and a kappa coefficient of 0.79 based on the modified GoogLeNet, which used the multi-scale convolution kernel to extract features of the tree crown samples and was modified for small-scale samples. The ITS recognition method proposed in this study, with multi-scale individual tree crown delineation, avoids artificial tree crown delineation. Compared with the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches, this method can automatically extract features and outperform RF and SVM in the classification of six tree species.

TI  - Rapid Urbanization Induced Extensive Forest Loss to Urban Land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced rapid urbanizations with dramatic land cover changes since 1978. Forest loss is one of land cover changes, and it induces various eco-environmental degradation issues. As one of China's hotspot regions, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has undergone a dramatic urban expansion. To better understand forest dynamics and protect forest ecosystem, revealing the processes, patterns and underlying drivers of forest loss is essential. This study focused on the spatiotemporal evolution and potential driving factors of forest loss in the GBA at regional and city level. The Landsat time-series images from 1987 to 2017 were used to derive forest, and landscape metrics and geographic information system (GIS) were applied to implement further spatial analysis. The results showed that: 1) 14.86% of the total urban growth area of the GBA was obtained from the forest loss in 1987-2017; meanwhile, the forest loss area of the GBA reached 4040.6 km(2), of which 25.60% (1034.42 km(2)) was converted to urban land; 2) the percentages of forest loss to urban land in Dongguan (19.14%), Guangzhou (18.35%) and Shenzhen (15.81%) were higher than those in other cities; 3) the forest became increasingly fragmented from 1987-2007, and then the fragmentation decreased from 2007 to 2017); 4) the landscape responses to forest changes varied with the scale; and 5) some forest loss to urban regions moved from low-elevation and gentle-slope terrains to higher-elevation and steep-slope terrains over time, especially in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Urbanization and industrialization greatly drove forest loss and fragmentation, and, notably, hillside urban land expansion may have contributed to hillside forest loss. The findings will help policy makers in maintaining the stability of forest ecosystems, and provide some new insights into forest management and conservation.

TI  - Co-Seismic Inversion and Post-Seismic Deformation Mechanism Analysis of 2019 California Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In July 2019, a series of seismic events, including a magnitude (Mw) 7.1 mainshock and Mw 6.4 foreshock, occurred in Eastern California. Studying these seismic events can significantly improve our understanding of the Eastern California tectonic environment. Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2 PALSAR images were utilized to obtain co-seismic deformation fields, including mainshock and foreshock deformation. The Okada elastic dislocation model and ascending and descending orbit results were used to invert the co-seismic slip distribution and obtain a co-seismic focal mechanism solution. Using ascending Sentinel-1A images, a time-series deformation was obtained for 402 d after the earthquake, and the deformation evolution mechanism was analyzed. The maximum uplift caused by the co-seismic mechanism reached 1.5 m in the line of sight (LOS), and the maximum subsidence reached 1 m in the LOS. For 402 d after the earthquake, the area remained active, and its deformation was dominated by after-slip. The co-seismic inversion results illustrated that California earthquakes were mainly strike-slip. The co-seismic inversion magnitude was approximately Mw 7.08. The Coulomb stress change illustrated that the seismic moment caused by the co-seismic slip was 4.24 x 10(26) N x m, which is approximately Mw 7.06. This finding is consistent with the co-seismic slip distribution inversion results.

TI  - Improving the Selection of Vegetation Index Characteristic Wavelengths by Using the PROSPECT Model for Leaf Water Content Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Equivalent water thickness (EWT) is a major indicator for indirect monitoring of leaf water content in remote sensing. Many vegetation indices (VIs) have been proposed to estimate EWT based on passive or active reflectance spectra. However, the selection of the characteristics wavelengths of VIs is mainly based on statistical analysis for specific vegetation species. In this study, a characteristic wavelength selection algorithm based on the PROSPECT-5 model was proposed to obtain characteristic wavelengths of leaf biochemical parameters (leaf structure parameter (N), chlorophyll a + b content (Cab), carotenoid content (Car), EWT, and dry matter content (LMA)). The effect of combined characteristic wavelengths of EWT and different biochemical parameters on the accuracy of EWT estimation is discussed. Results demonstrate that the characteristic wavelengths of leaf structure parameter N exhibited the greatest influence on EWT estimation. Then, two optimal characteristics wavelengths (1089 and 1398 nm) are selected to build a new ratio VI (nRVI = R1089/R1398) for EWT estimation. Subsequently, the performance of the built nRVI and four optimal published VIs for EWT estimation are discussed by using two simulation datasets and three in situ datasets. Results demonstrated that the built nRVI exhibited better performance (R-2 = 0.9284, 0.8938, 0.7766, and RMSE = 0.0013 cm, 0.0022 cm, 0.0030 cm for ANGERS, Leaf Optical Properties Experiment (LOPEX), and JR datasets, respectively.) than that the published VIs for EWT estimation. It is demonstrated that the built nRVI based on the characteristic wavelengths selected using the physical model exhibits desirable universality and stability in EWT estimation.

TI  - Analysis of the Monthly and Spring-Neap Tidal Variability of Satellite Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter in a Turbid Coastal Ocean Using the DINEOF Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing spatial data is one of the major concerns associated with the application of satellite data. The Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) method has been proven to be an effective tool for filling spatial gaps in various satellite data products. The Ariake Sea, which is a turbid coastal sea, shows the large spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM). However, ocean color satellite data for this region usually have large gaps, which affects the accurate analysis of Chl-a and TSM variability. In this study, we applied the DINEOF method to fill the missing pixels from the regionally tuned Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua (hereafter, MODIS) Chl-a and MODIS-derived TSM datasets for the period 2002-2017. The validation results showed that the DINEOF reconstructed data were accurate and reliable. Furthermore, the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis based on the reconstructed data was used to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variability of Chl-a and TSM at both monthly and individual events of spring-neap tidal scales. The first three EOF modes of Chl-a showed seasonal variability mainly caused by precipitation, the sea surface temperature (SST), and river discharge for the first EOF mode and the sea level amplitude for the second. The first three EOF modes of TSM exhibited both seasonal and spring-neap tidal variability. The first and second EOF modes of TSM displayed spring-neap tidal variability caused by the sea level amplitude. The second EOF mode of TSM also showed seasonal variability caused by the sea level amplitude. In this study, we first applied the DINEOF method to reconstruct the satellite data and to capture the major spatial and temporal variability of Chl-a and TSM for the Ariake Sea. Our results demonstrate that the DINEOF method can reconstruct patchy oceanic color datasets and improve spatio-temporal variability analysis.

TI  - The relationship between land surface temperature and artificial impervious surface fraction in 682 global cities: spatiotemporal variations and drivers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The artificial impervious surface (AIS) counts among the most important components of the urban surface, and understanding how temperature changes with the AIS fraction (AISF) is crucial for urban ecology and sustainability. Considering the high heterogeneity among existing local studies, this study systematically analyzed the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and AISF in 682 global cities. The LST-AISF relation was quantified by the coefficient (delta LST, Delta LST/Delta AISF) of a linear regression model, which measures the LST change by 1 unit (1%) increase in AISF. The LST was acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily products during 2014-2016, while the AISF was calculated as the proportion of AIS in each MODIS pixel according to the high-resolution Global Artificial Imperious Area (GAIA) product in 2015. Major results can be summarized as follows: (a) LST shows an increasing trend along AISF gradients (positive delta LST) in most cities, with annually average daytime and nighttime delta LST of 0.0219 (0.0205, 0.0232) degrees C/% (values in parenthesis define the 95% confidence interval, hereinafter) and 0.0168 (0.0166, 0.0169) degrees C/%, respectively, for global cities. (b) Daytime delta LST varies substantially among cities, with generally stronger values in tropical and temperate cities, but weaker or even negative values in arid cities; while at night, cities located in the cold climate zone tend to have larger delta LST. (c) The LST-AISF relation is also season-dependent, characterized by a greater delta LST in warm months, especially for cities located in temperate and cold climate zones. (d) Driver analyses indicate that changes in surface biophysical properties, including vegetation conditions and albedo, are main contributors to the spatiotemporal variation of daytime and nighttime delta LST, respectively. These results help us to get a quantitative and systematic understanding of the climatic impacts of urbanization.

TI  - Transferability of Convolutional Neural Network Models for Identifying Damaged Buildings Due to Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of buildings caused by earthquakes can lead to a large loss of life and property. Rapid assessment of building damage with remote sensing image data can support emergency rescues. However, current studies indicate that only a limited sample set can usually be obtained from remote sensing images immediately following an earthquake. Consequently, the difficulty in preparing sufficient training samples constrains the generalization of the model in the identification of earthquake-damaged buildings. To produce a deep learning network model with strong generalization, this study adjusted four Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for extracting damaged building information and compared their performance. A sample dataset of damaged buildings was constructed by using multiple disaster images retrieved from the xBD dataset. Using satellite and aerial remote sensing data obtained after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, we examined the geographic and data transferability of the deep network model pre-trained on the xBD dataset. The result shows that the network model pre-trained with samples generated from multiple disaster remote sensing images can extract accurately collapsed building information from satellite remote sensing data. Among the adjusted CNN models tested in the study, the adjusted DenseNet121 was the most robust. Transfer learning solved the problem of poor adaptability of the network model to remote sensing images acquired by different platforms and could identify disaster-damaged buildings properly. These results provide a solution to the rapid extraction of earthquake-damaged building information based on a deep learning network model.

TI  - Continuous Multi-Angle Remote Sensing and Its Application in Urban Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the limitations of hardware devices, such as the sensors, processing capacity, and high accuracy altitude control equipment, traditional optical remote sensing (RS) imageries capture information regarding the same scene from mostly one single angle or a very small number of angles. Nowadays, with video satellites coming into service, obtaining imageries of the same scene from a more-or-less continuous array of angles has become a reality. In this paper, we analyze the differences between the traditional RS data and continuous multi-angle remote sensing (CMARS) data, and unravel the characteristics of the CMARS data. We study the advantages of using CMARS data for classification and try to capitalize on the complementarity of multi-angle information and, at the same time, to reduce the embedded redundancy. Our arguments are substantiated by real-life experiments on the employment of CMARS data in order to classify urban land covers while using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. They show the superiority of CMARS data over the traditional data for classification. The overall accuracy may increase up to about 9% with CMARS data. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of directly using the CMARS data, and how such data can be better utilized through the extraction of key features that characterize the variations of spectral reflectance along the entire angular array. This research lay the foundation for the use of CMARS data in future research and applications.

TI  - Global trends in vegetation seasonality in the GIMMS NDVI3g and their robustness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysing changes in vegetation seasonality of terrestrial ecosystems is important to understand ecological responses to global change. Based on over three decades of observations by the series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors, the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset has been widely used for monitoring vegetation trends. However, it is not well known how robust long-term trends in vegetation seasonality derived from GIMMS NDVI are, given inevitable influences from sensor and processing artefacts. Here we analyse long-term seasonality trends in the GIMMS third generation (NDVI3g) record (1982-2013). Changes in vegetation seasonality are decomposed into changes in duration (related to growing season length) and timing (related to peak growing season). We compare seasonality trends from the previous version (NDVI3g v0) with those in the subsequently released version (NDVI3g v1) and, for their common period, with those derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 NDVI. We find that NDVI3g v0 shows marked seasonality trends for 1982-2013 over more than one-third of the global vegetated area. Long-term trends based on v1 are generally consistent with v0, but v1 shows a strong trend towards earlier timing across the Arctic regions that is absent in v0. NDVI3g v0, v1, and MODIS all point towards an increased duration across the tundra of North Asia and later timing across North Africa. However, several discrepancies are also found between the NDVI datasets. For example, for the North-American tundra, MODIS shows earlier and v0 later timing, while MODIS shows an increased duration and v1 a reduced duration. For North Africa, v0 and v1 exhibit a reduced duration that is absent in MODIS. We conclude that both the primary observations and the subsequent processing can have a marked influence on inferred seasonality trends, and propose that the robustness of trends should be examined and corroborated using alternative data sources wherever possible.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Atmospheric Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) over Hefei, China with Ground-Based High-Resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of atmospheric hydrogen fluoride (HF) is challenging because it has weak absorption signatures in the atmosphere and is surrounded by strong absorption lines from interfering gases. In this study, we first present a multi-year time series of HF total columns over Hefei, China by using high-resolution ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Both near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) solar spectra suites, which are recorded following the requirements of Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), respectively, are used to retrieve total column of HF (T-HF) and column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of HF (X-HF). The NIR and MIR observations are generally in good agreement with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87, but the NIR observations are found to be (6.90 +/- 1.07 (1 sigma)) pptv, which is lower than the MIR observations. By correcting this bias, the combination of NIR and MIR observations discloses that the X-HF over Hefei showed a maximum monthly mean value of (64.05 +/- 3.93) pptv in March and a minimum monthly mean value of (45.15 +/- 2.93) pptv in September. The observed X-HF time series from 2015 to 2020 showed a negative trend of (-0.38 +/- 0.22) % per year. The variability of X-HF is inversely correlated with the tropopause height, indicating that the variability of tropopause height is a key factor that drives the seasonal cycle of HF in the stratosphere. This study can enhance the understanding of ground-based high-resolution remote sensing techniques for atmospheric HF and its evolution in the stratosphere and contribute to forming new reliable remote sensing data for research on climate change.

TI  - Framework for Reconstruction of Pseudo Quad Polarimetric Imagery from General Compact Polarimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo quad polarimetric (quad-pol) image reconstruction from the hybrid dual-pol (or compact polarimetric (CP)) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a category of important techniques for radar polarimetric applications. There are three key aspects concerned in the literature for the reconstruction methods, i.e., the scattering symmetric assumption, the reconstruction model, and the solving approach of the unknowns. Since CP measurements depend on the CP mode configurations, different reconstruction procedures were designed when the transmit wave varies, which means the reconstruction procedures were not unified. In this study, we propose a unified reconstruction framework for the general CP mode, which is applicable to the mode with an arbitrary transmitted ellipse wave. The unified reconstruction procedure is based on the formalized CP descriptors. The general CP symmetric scattering model-based three-component decomposition method is also employed to fit the reconstruction model parameter. Finally, a least squares (LS) estimation method, which was proposed for the linear pi/4 CP data, is extended for the arbitrary CP mode to estimate the solution of the system of non-linear equations. Validation is carried out based on polarimetric data sets from both RADARSAT-2 (C-band) and ALOS-2/PALSAR (L-band), to compare the performances of reconstruction models, methods, and CP modes.

TI  - Comparisons of ICG-fluorescence with conventional tracers in sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients with early-stage breast cancer: A meta-analysis
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radioisotopes (RI) and blue dye (BD) are routinely used markers for staining during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer. Compared with traditional tracers, tracer performance of indocyanine green (ICG) has been controversial. A total of 21 studies were selected from the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Detection ability was judged based on four endpoints: i) The identification rate (IR) of the patients; ii) the IR of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs); iii) the IR of the positive SLNs; and iv) the false negative rate (FNR). Compared with BD, ICG was superior in terms of the IR of the patients [odds ratio (OR)=7.17; 95% CI, 3.98-12.94), the IR of the SLNs (OR=8.84; 95% CI, 6.71-11.66) and FNR (OR=0.20; 95% CI, 0.08-0.48) using a fixed-effects model. There was a significant difference in both the IR of the positive SLNs (OR=21.32; 95% CI, 2.84-160.14) and FNR (OR=0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.91) in the ICG vs. RI group. Furthermore, when using ICG at the recommended dose, a significant difference was found in the IR of the patients (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.09-2.85) and the IR of the SLNs (OR=21.62; 95% CI, 5.23-89.43) using a fixed-effects model. In the ICG vs. BD combined with RI group, there were no differences in either the IR of the patients (OR=5.10; 95% CI, 0.24-107.48) or the IR of SLNs (OR=5.10; 95% CI, 0.60-256.66). In conclusion, ICG was a better tracer compared with BD or RI alone and was not a worse tracer compared with BD combined with RI. The use of the recommended dose of ICG had an improved tracer effect. ICG is expected to be widely used in SLNB in view of its clinical advantages.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Land Surface Temperature Based on a Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions commonly encountered in remote sensing, no single satellite sensor can provide fine spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST) products with frequent coverage. This situation greatly limits applications that require LST data with fine spatiotemporal resolution. Here, a deep learning-based spatiotemporal temperature fusion network (STTFN) method for the generation of fine spatiotemporal resolution LST products is proposed. In STTFN, a multiscale fusion convolutional neural network is employed to build the complex nonlinear relationship between input and output LSTs. Thus, unlike other LST spatiotemporal fusion approaches, STTFN is able to form the potentially complicated relationships through the use of training data without manually designed mathematical rules making it is more flexible and intelligent than other methods. In addition, two target fine spatial resolution LST images are predicted and then integrated by a spatiotemporal-consistency (STC)-weighting function to take advantage of STC of LST data. A set of analyses using two real LST data sets obtained from Landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were undertaken to evaluate the ability of STTFN to generate fine spatiotemporal resolution LST products. The results show that, compared with three classic fusion methods [the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), the spatiotemporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM), and the two-stream convolutional neural network for spatiotemporal image fusion (StfNet)], the proposed network produced the most accurate outputs [average root mean square error (RMSE) 1.40 C and average structural similarity (SSIM) 0.971].

TI  - Preliminary Study on Water Quality Parameter Inversion for the Yuqiao Reservoir Based on Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Satellite Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of suspended matter and water clarity are basic parameters for water quality investigations and important indexes to evaluate the quality of water environments. Remote sensing technologies can be used to realize the inversion of the main water quality parameters in a large range, quickly, and at low cost; however, those same technologies cannot be applied to inland water bodies that extend over small areas and have complex and variable water qualities. The Zhuhai-1 satellite constellation is composed of new hyperspectral satellites launched by the Zhuhai Orbita Aerospace Technology Company. Such satellites possess high spatial, temporal, and hyperspectral resolutions; moreover, they have considerable potential for the monitoring of inland water quality. The applicability of remote sensing to the monitoring of inland water quality parameters using data from the Zhuhai-1 satellites has not been studied in detail, and satellite ground synchronization experiments need to be carried out to test its effectiveness. In this paper, we considered remote sensing data collected from those hyperspectral satellites to study the Yuqiao reservoir: based on water surface synchronous data, we constructed inversion models of suspended matter and water clarity using the empirical regression method, and subsequently tested their accuracy. The test results showed that the best band combinations for the inversion models, in order to obtain the concentration of suspended matter and the water clarity in the Yuqiao reservoir, were R-rs (684)/R-rs (540) (relative error=8. 6%; root mean square error=1. 0 mg . L-1) and R-rs (656)/R-rs (556) (relative error = 11. 7%; root mean square error = 18. 2 cm), respectively. The distribution map of the water quality parameters in the Yugiao Reservoir on November 22, 2018 was obtained by using the modeling formula: suspended matter was found to be more abundant in the north than in the south, while water clarity was lower in the north and higher in the south. These spatial distributions mainly depended on the configuration of the Yuqiao reservoir, in which the water depth increases from north to south ; in the case of a deeper water column, sediments are less likely to be resuspended. According to the inversion modeling of the water quality parameters and to the test results of the measurements conducted on the Yuqiao Reservoir, we conclude that the hyperspectral remote sensing data of Zhuhai-1 can be used to retrieve the water quality parameters quantitatively. These results have important implications for the monitoring of inland water quality; still, more satellite-ground synchronization experiments are needed to improve further the preprocessing of data and the correspondent inversion models.

TI  - Automatic Generation of Aerial Orthoimages Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery with a Context-Based Deep Learning Approach
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial images are an outstanding option for observing terrain with their high-resolution (HR) capability. The high operational cost of aerial images makes it difficult to acquire periodic observation of the region of interest. Satellite imagery is an alternative for the problem, but low-resolution is an obstacle. In this study, we proposed a context-based approach to simulate the 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery to produce 2.5 and 5.0 m prediction images using the aerial orthoimage acquired over the same period. The proposed model was compared with an enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR), which has excellent performance among the existing super-resolution (SR) deep learning algorithms, using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Our context-based ResU-Net outperformed the EDSR in all three metrics. The inclusion of the 60 m resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery performs better through fine-tuning. When 60 m images were included, RMSE decreased, and PSNR and SSIM increased. The result also validated that the denser the neural network, the higher the quality. Moreover, the accuracy is much higher when both denser feature dimensions and the 60 m images were used.

TI  - Surface deformation and landslides caused by the 6<SUP>th</SUP> nuclear test of North Korea on September 3, 2017 detected by satellite SAR and InSAR techniques
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The 6(th) nuclear test of North Korea on September 3, 2017 produced an m(b) 6.1 artificial earthquake and significant surface deformations detectable from satellite observations. Wang et al. (2018) have reported the surface displacement of the Mt. Mantap caused by the explosion by applying offset-tracking method to TerraSAR-X SAR images. Based on the assumption of elastic behaviour of the mountain body, they have modelled the rise and collapse of the mountain and suggested the location, depth and energy of the explosion. However, we suspect that the surface displacement might be caused by landslide in which case the elastic modelling would be misleading. In this paper, we use both SAR interferometry and offset-tracking method to quantify the elastic and random deformation caused by the explosion. The 3-D displacement vectors around the rim of the explosion, where the inter-ferometric coherence is maintained, were obtained by using three ALOS-2 interferograms acquired in different orbits. Only east-west component of the displacement vector was valid due to orbital characteristics, which indicates the explosive tendency of the bedrock of up to 25 cm in the rim of the mountain. Deformation on the ruptured zone, where the interferometric coherence is lost, was detected through visual inspection and offset tracking by using two pairs of high-resolution ALOS-2 and TerraSAR-X images. It showed up to 3.5 m displacement on the mountain slope towards the direction of gravity, which is similar to the results of Wang et al. (2018). However, we have visually identified many stable points and features that have not moved at all in the mountain flank surrounded by active surface deformation, which is believed to be stable bedrocks and outcrops. This implies that the displacements observed by the offset method in the mountain flank of the ruptured zone were mostly of landslides caused by the topsoil and boulder stones. It is suggested that elastic behaviour of the mountain body due to the 6(th) nuclear test of North Korea is unidentifiable and the subsequent modelling might be invalid in the mountain flank of the ruptured zone where surface motion from landslides is dominant.

TI  - Gap Filling for Historical Landsat NDVI Time Series by Integrating Climate Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series are essential in studying vegetation phenology, dynamic monitoring, and global change. Gap filling is the most important issue in reconstructing NDVI time series from satellites with high spatial resolution, e.g., the Landsat series and Chinese GaoFen-1/6 series. Due to the sparse revisit frequencies of high-resolution satellites, traditional reconstruction approaches face the challenge of dealing with large gaps in raw NDVI time series data. In this paper, a climate incorporated gap-filling (CGF) method is proposed for the reconstruction of Landsat historical NDVI time series data. The CGF model considers the relationship of the NDVI time series and climate conditions between two adjacent years. Climate variables, including downward solar shortwave radiation, precipitation, and temperature, are used to characterize the constrain factors of vegetation growth. Radial basis function networks (RBFNs) are used to link the NDVI time series between two adjacent years with variabilities in climatic conditions. An RBFN predicted a background NDVI time series in the target year, and the observed NDVI values in this year were used to adjust the predicted NDVI time series. Finally, the NDVI time series were recursively reconstructed from 2018 to 1986. The experiments were performed in a heterogeneous region in the Qilian Mountains. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct and generate continuous 30 m 8-day NDVI time series using Landsat observations. The CGF method outperforms traditional time series reconstruction methods (e.g., the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) and Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter methods) when the raw time series is contaminated with large gaps, which widely exist in Landsat images.

TI  - Improving Soil Moisture Estimation by Identification of NDVI Thresholds Optimization: An Application to the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy soil moisture estimation at a relevant spatiotemporal scale is scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and improving weather forecasting and climate models, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions like the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). This study proposed Criterion 2, a new method to improve relative soil moisture (RSM) estimation by identification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds optimization based on our previously proposed iteration procedure of Criterion 1. Apparent thermal inertia (ATI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) were applied to subregional RSM retrieval for the CLP throughout 2017. Three optimal NDVI thresholds (NDVI0 was used for computing TVDI, and both NDVIATI and NDVITVDI for dividing the entire CLP) were firstly identified with the best validation results (R over bar ) of subregions for 8-day periods. Then, we compared the selected optimal NDVI thresholds and estimated RSM with each criterion. Results show that NDVI thresholds were optimized to robust RSM estimation with Criterion 2, which characterized RSM variability better. The estimated RSM with Criterion 2 showed increased accuracy (maximum R over bar of 0.82 +/- 0.007 for Criterion 2 and of 0.75 +/- 0.008 for Criterion 1) and spatiotemporal coverage (45 and 38 periods (8-day) of RSM maps and the total RSM area of 939.52 x 10(4) km(2) and 667.44 x 10(4) km(2) with Criterion 2 and Criterion 1, respectively) than with Criterion 1. Moreover, the additional NDVI thresholds we applied was another strategy to acquire wider coverage of RSM estimation. The improved RSM estimation with Criterion 2 could provide a basis for forecasting drought and precision irrigation management.

TI  - Wind direction retrieval from Sentinel-1 SAR images using ResNet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the wind direction over the sea from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images without any external information. The method employs deep residual network (ResNet), a variant of Convolutional Neural Network, to obtain high resolution (2 km by 2 km) aliased wind direction fields. Forty-seven SAR images of the European Space Agency satellites Sentinel-1 have been processed with ResNet, previously trained with other fifteen images. The areas of interest are the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, two regional seas where the SAR images often present complex patterns associated to the wind field spatial structure reporting traces of the interaction with coastal orography, hence valuable test sites to evaluate the performance of the methodology here proposed. Statistical analysis was carried out comparing the SAR-derived wind directions with those from ECMWF atmospheric model, ASCAT scatterometer and in-situ gauges. It reports biases beta of -1.1 degrees, 2.4 degrees and -4.6 degrees respectively, and centered root mean square difference cRMSd<21 degrees, consistent with the benchmark obtained comparing scatterometer with ECMWF wind directions over the areas imaged by SAR (beta 2.1 degrees, cRMSd=19 degrees). These results are relevant because they include the coastal data not accounted in the benchmark. Analysis of selected cases showed that SAR-derived wind fields reproduce meteorological situations characterized by strong divergence. Notably, our ResNet is able to estimate the wind direction even in the absence of wind streaks on the SAR images and in presence of convective turbulence structures, atmospheric lee waves, and ships. Furthermore, the model is also able to derive the wind field over small areas, as the example of Venice lagoon has shown. Detailed analysis of selected cases raised the issue of the lack of data with true spatial resolution of approximate to 2 km and within half hour from the satellite pass time necessary for exhaustive comparisons.

TI  - A tale of two regions: methane emissions from oil and gas production in offshore/onshore Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use atmospheric observations to quantify methane (CH4) emissions from Mexico's most important onshore and offshore oil and gas production regions which account for 95% of oil production and 78% of gas production. We use aircraft-based top-down measurements at the regional and facility-levels to determine emissions. Satellite data (TROPOMI CH4 data and VIIRS night-time flare data) provide independent estimates of emissions over 2 years. Our airborne estimate of the offshore region's emissions is 2800 kg CH4 h(-1) (95% confidence interval (CI): 1700-3900 kg CH4 h(-1)), more than an order of magnitude lower than the Mexican national greenhouse gas inventory estimate. In contrast, emissions from the onshore study region are 29 000 kg CH4 h(-1) (95% CI: 19 000-39 000 kg CH4 h(-1)), more than an order of magnitude higher than the inventory. One single facility-a gas processing complex that receives offshore associated gas-emits 5700 kg CH4 h(-1) (CI: 3500-7900 kg CH4 h(-1)), with the majority of those emissions related to inefficient flaring and representing as much as half of Mexico's residential gas consumption. This facility was responsible for greater emissions than the entirety of the largest offshore production region, suggesting that offshore-produced associated gas is being transported onshore where it is burned and in the process some released to the atmosphere. The satellite-based data suggest even higher emissions for the onshore region than did the temporally constrained aircraft data (>20 times higher than the inventory). If the onshore production region examined is representative of Mexican production generally, then total CH4 emissions from Mexico's oil and gas production would be similar to, or higher than, the official inventory, despite the large overestimate of offshore emissions. The main driver of inaccuracies in the inventory is the use of generic, non-Mexican specific emission factors. Our work highlights the need for local empirical characterization of emissions if effective emissions mitigation is to be undertaken.

TI  - A scattering law based cirrus correction method for Landsat 8 OLI visible and near-infrared images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds are commonly distributed in the atmosphere, and can lead to degradation of the ground information in optical remotely sensed images obtained using airborne and spaceborne sensors. A cirrus band on the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), i.e., Band 9, is designed to precisely detect cirrus cloud, providing a reference basis for the radiance calculation of cirrus cloud in other bands. Therefore, based on a scattering law, a cirrus cloud correction method is proposed in this paper to restore the ground information for Landsat 8 OLI visible and near-infrared (VNIR) images by comprehensively using the visible and cirrus bands. The scattering law and the high correlation between the two adjoining blue bands are combined to estimate each VNIR band's cirrus radiance. The relationship among the bands is constrained to comply with the scattering law. The differences between the ocean and land surfaces are also considered when determining the parameter in the scattering law. In the experiments conducted in this study, both simulated and acquired images contaminated with cirrus cloud were used to evaluate the proposed method, and both visual and quantitative evaluations were carried out to verify the performance. The results suggest that the cirrus cloud in the VNIR bands can be removed by the use of the proposed method. The ground information can also be adequately restored, with a mean absolute error of less than 0.7757 for the simulated data and a structural similarity index measure of greater than 0.8621 for the acquired data. When compared with three existing correction methods, the proposed method was able to obtain clearer and more accurate results over various land and ocean scenes. Furthermore, this method's applicability to other sensors with similar bands, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, was also investigated and validated.

TI  - A Novel Squeeze-and-Excitation W-Net for 2D and 3D Building Change Detection with Multi-Source and Multi-Feature Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building Change Detection (BCD) is one of the core issues in earth observation and has received extensive attention in recent years. With the rapid development of earth observation technology, the data source of remote sensing change detection is continuously enriched, which provides the possibility to describe the spatial details of the ground objects more finely and to characterize the ground objects with multiple perspectives and levels. However, due to the different physical mechanisms of multi-source remote sensing data, BCD based on heterogeneous data is a challenge. Previous studies mostly focused on the BCD of homogeneous remote sensing data, while the use of multi-source remote sensing data and considering multiple features to conduct 2D and 3D BCD research is sporadic. In this article, we propose a novel and general squeeze-and-excitation W-Net, which is developed from U-Net and SE-Net. Its unique advantage is that it can not only be used for BCD of homogeneous and heterogeneous remote sensing data respectively but also can input both homogeneous and heterogeneous remote sensing data for 2D or 3D BCD by relying on its bidirectional symmetric end-to-end network architecture. Moreover, from a unique perspective, we use image features that are stable in performance and less affected by radiation differences and temporal changes. We innovatively introduced the squeeze-and-excitation module to explicitly model the interdependence between feature channels so that the response between the feature channels is adaptively recalibrated to improve the information mining ability and detection accuracy of the model. As far as we know, this is the first proposed network architecture that can simultaneously use multi-source and multi-feature remote sensing data for 2D and 3D BCD. The experimental results in two 2D data sets and two challenging 3D data sets demonstrate that the promising performances of the squeeze-and-excitation W-Net outperform several traditional and state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, both visual and quantitative analyses of the experimental results demonstrate competitive performance in the proposed network. This demonstrates that the proposed network and method are practical, physically justified, and have great potential application value in large-scale 2D and 3D BCD and qualitative and quantitative research.

TI  - Unsupervised Multitemporal Building Change Detection Framework Based on Cosegmentation Using Time-Series SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building change detection using remote sensing images is essential for various applications such as urban management and marketing planning. However, most change detection approaches can only detect the intensity or type of change. The aim of this study is to dig for more change information from time-series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, such as the change frequency and the change moments. This paper proposes a novel multitemporal building change detection framework that can generate change frequency map (CFM) and change moment maps (CMMs) from multitemporal SAR images. We first give definitions of CFM and CMMs. Then we generate change feature using four proposed generators. After that, a new cosegmentation method combining raw images and change feature is proposed to divide time-series images into changed and unchanged areas separately. Secondly, the proposed cosegmentation and the morphological building index (MBI) are combined to extract changed building objects. Then, the logical conjunction between the cosegmentation results and the binarized MBI is performed to recognize every moment of change. In the post-processing step, we use fragment removal to increase accuracy. Finally, we propose a novel accuracy assessment index for CFM. We call this index average change difference (ACD). Compared to the traditional multitemporal change detection methods, our method outperforms other approaches in terms of both qualitative results and quantitative indices of ACD using two TerraSAR-X datasets. The experiments show that the proposed method is effective in generating CFM and CMMs.

TI  - Simulation of Land Use Pattern Evolution from a Multi-Scenario Perspective: A Case Study of Suzhou City in Anhui Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover change is a frontier issue in the field of geography research. Taking Suzhou City in Anhui Province as the research case, based on thematic mapper /enhanced thematic mapper+ (TM/ETM+) remote sensing data from 1998 to 2018, through the transfer matrix model and modified conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent (CLUE-S) model, the simulation of the land use landscape pattern evolution was studied from a multi-scenario perspective. The results showed that in the past 20 years, landscape patterns have undergone spatial-temporal conversion, which was mainly manifested as the evolution from a cultivated land landscape and other agricultural land to construction land, and there was some transformation between other landscape types, but the transformation degree was not significant. The spatial autocorrelation factor was introduced to correct the CLUE-S model, and the Kappa index reached 0.83, indicating that the modified CLUE-S model had a good simulation accuracy. (I) In the cultivated land protection scenario, limiting the conversion of basic farmland use, and by 2028, the proportion of cultivated land increased by 5.23%, distributed in eastern Suzhou City; (II) in the economic development scenario, by 2028, the construction land area increased by 14.58%, and was distributed in the surrounding regions of the built-up areas; and (III) in the ecological protection scenario, by 2028, wood land, water, and other ecological protection land area increased, and were distributed in the central and eastern part of Suzhou City. Research can provide useful decision-making support for land use optimization and remediation.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1 and-2 Images in Measuring the Deformation of Kuh-e-Namak (Dashti) Namakier, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Kuh-e-Namak (Dashti) namakier is one of the most active salt diapirs along the Zagros fold-thrust belt in Iran. Its surface deformation should be measured to estimate its long-term kinematics. Ten Sentinel-2 optical images acquired between October 2016 and December 2019 were processed by using Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) method. Forty-seven Sentinel-1 ascending Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired between April 2017 and December 2019 were processed by using Small Baseline Subset Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method. The deformation of Kuh-e-Namak (Dashti) namakier was measured using both methods. Then, meteorological data were utilized to explore the relationship between the kinematics of the namakier and weather conditions and differences in macrodeformation behavior of various rock salt types. The advantages and disadvantages of COSI-Corr and SBAS-InSAR methods in measuring the deformation of the namakier were compared. The results show that: (1) The flank subsides in the dry season and uplifts in the rainy season, whereas the dome subsides in the rainy season and uplifts in the dry season. Under extreme rainfall conditions, the namakier experiences permanent plastic deformation. (2) The "dirty" rock salt of the namakier is more prone to flow than the "clean" rock salt in terms of macrodeformation behavior. (3) In the exploration of the kinematics of the namakier via the two methods, COSI-Corr is superior to SBAS-InSAR on a spatial scale, but the latter is superior to the former on a time scale.

TI  - A Fine-Scale Mangrove Map of China Derived from 2-Meter Resolution Satellite Observations and Field Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are important ecosystems in the coastal intertidal zone, but China's mangroves have experienced a large reduction in area from the 1950s, and the remaining mangrove forests are exhibiting increased fragmentation. A detailed mangrove dataset of China is crucial for mangrove ecosystem management and protection, but the fragmented mangrove patches are hardly mapped by medium resolution satellite imagery. To overcome these difficulties, we presented a fine-scale mangrove map for 2018 using the 2-meter resolution Gaofen-1 and Ziyuan-3 satellite imagery together with field data. We employed a hybrid method of object-based image analysis (OBIA), interpreter editing, and field surveying for mangrove mapping. The field survey route reached 9500 km, and 2650 patches were verified during the field work. Accuracy assessment by confusion matrix showed that the kappa coefficient reached 0.98, indicating a highly thematic accuracy of the mangrove dataset. Results showed the total area of mangrove forest in China for 2018 was 25,683.88 hectares, and approximately 91% of mangroves were found in the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. About 64% of mangroves were distributed in or near the nature reserves established by national or local governments, which indicated that China's mangroves were well protected in recent years. The new fine-scale mangrove dataset was freely shared together with this paper, and it can be used by local authorities and research groups for mangrove management and ecological planning.

TI  - WTS: A Weakly towards Strongly Supervised Learning Framework for Remote Sensing Land Cover Classification Using Segmentation Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of remote sensing. In recent years, fully supervised fully convolutional network (FCN)-based semantic segmentation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the semantic segmentation task. However, creating pixel-level annotations is prohibitively expensive and laborious, especially when dealing with remote sensing images. Weakly supervised learning methods from weakly labeled annotations can overcome this difficulty to some extent and achieve impressive segmentation results, but results are limited in accuracy. Inspired by point supervision and the traditional segmentation method of seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm, a weakly towards strongly (WTS) supervised learning framework is proposed in this study for remote sensing land cover classification to handle the absence of well-labeled and abundant pixel-level annotations when using segmentation models. In this framework, only several points with true class labels are required as the training set, which are much less expensive to acquire compared with pixel-level annotations through field survey or visual interpretation using high-resolution images. Firstly, they are used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Once fully trained, the SVM is used to generate the initial seeded pixel-level training set, in which only the pixels with high confidence are assigned with class labels whereas others are unlabeled. They are used to weakly train the segmentation model. Then, the seeded region growing module and fully connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used to iteratively update the seeded pixel-level training set for progressively increasing pixel-level supervision of the segmentation model. Sentinel-2 remote sensing images are used to validate the proposed framework, and SVM is selected for comparison. In addition, FROM-GLC10 global land cover map is used as training reference to directly train the segmentation model. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other methods and can be highly recommended for land cover classification tasks when the pixel-level labeled datasets are insufficient by using segmentation models.

TI  - ICENETv2: A Fine-Grained River Ice Semantic Segmentation Network Based on UAV Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate ice segmentation is one of the most crucial techniques for intelligent ice monitoring. Compared with ice segmentation, it can provide more information for ice situation analysis, change trend prediction, and so on. Therefore, the study of ice segmentation has important practical significance. In this study, we focused on fine-grained river ice segmentation using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. This has the following difficulties: (1) The scale of river ice varies greatly in different images and even in the same image; (2) the same kind of river ice differs greatly in color, shape, texture, size, and so on; and (3) the appearances of different kinds of river ice sometimes appear similar due to the complex formation and change procedure. Therefore, to perform this study, the NWPU_YRCC2 dataset was built, in which all UAV images were collected in the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River. Then, a novel semantic segmentation method based on deep convolution neural network, named ICENETv2, is proposed. To achieve multiscale accurate prediction, we design a multilevel features fusion framework, in which multi-scale high-level semantic features and lower-level finer features are effectively fused. Additionally, a dual attention module is adopted to highlight distinguishable characteristics, and a learnable up-sampling strategy is further used to improve the segmentation accuracy of the details. Experiments show that ICENETv2 achieves the state-of-the-art on the NWPU_YRCC2 dataset. Finally, our ICENETv2 is also applied to solve a realistic problem, calculating drift ice cover density, which is one of the most important factors to predict the freeze-up data of the river. The results demonstrate that the performance of ICENETv2 meets the actual application demand.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation based on the Distributed Scatterers Adaptive Filter over the QTP Permafrost Region using Sentinel-1 and High-resolution TerraSAR-X Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been widely and primarily used for soil-moisture estimation. The original radar backscattering coefficients show great noise and temporal-spatial decorrelation due to complex surface features and seasonal vegetation changes, which increase the difficulty of soil-moisture estimation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To overcome these limitations, a soil-moisture retrieval method based on the Distributed Scatterers Adaptive Filter (DSAF) is proposed and applied in this paper. First, the statistically homogeneous pixels (SHP) with similar scatter behaviour are identified using the Anderson-Darling (AD) test method. Then, the Distributed Scatterers (DSs) are selected according to the SHPs threshold, and the backscattering coefficients of DSs are filtered using the SHPs distribution and coherences. In order to eliminate the negative influence of vegetation and roughness, the filtered backscattering coefficients are further processed by coupling the Water Cloud Model (WCM) and the images acquired in the winter season. The response of soil moisture to backscattering coefficients is greatly improved. Finally, the backscatter coefficients (sigma(0)) are transformed into soil-moisture units by using the Least Square Regression (LSR) model and multi-temporal Change Detection (CD) method, respectively. The 15 scenes of TerraSAR-X images and 18 scenes of Sentinel-1 images in Northern Piedmont river, Northern Tibet, were used for experimental study. The results reveal that the response of the filtered backscattering coefficients to in-situ soil moisture is greatly improved. The soil-moisture content estimated by LSR and CD model using TerraSAR-X data is consistent with in-situ measurements, with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.52 and 0.56, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.08 and 0.06, respectively. The results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of soil-moisture estimation, especially over the complex surface features of the QTP permafrost region.

TI  - Assessing of Urban Vegetation Biomass in Combination with LiDAR and High-resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban vegetation ecosystem is a vegetation ecosystem that is deeply influenced by human beings. The rapid urbanization process brings a great influence on the growth environment of urban vegetation. Urban vegetation has a certain mitigating effect on the urbanization process. It is irreplaceable by other urban ecosystems in functions such as maintaining atmospheric carbon-oxygen balance, reducing heat island effects, purifying, and beautifying the urban environment. At present, the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) mainly focuses on the original forest, grassland, desertification vegetation and crops, and the data sources are mostly medium- and low-resolution data such as Land Remote-Sensing Satellite Thematic Map (Landsat TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Compared with the research objects such as forest and grassland, urban vegetation has higher heterogeneity of underlying surface within the city scope, and there are more mixed pixels of medium- and low-resolution data. Therefore, high-resolution data are needed for classification and estimation. This study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to expand the sample size, combines high-resolution image data to classify urban vegetation areas, and quantitatively estimates and inverts biomass. The spatial and temporal variation of urban vegetation biomass was analysed by comparing the inversion accuracy of five different models and the advantages and disadvantages of the research models. The research results show that: (1) In the absence of urban forest sample points, the biomass background data are expanded with the help of LiDAR data and more data is provided for further inversion; (2) Through five model method comparison experiments, the optimal method for estimation is based on the Random Forest (RF) model; (3) Analysed the changes of urban vegetation in the study area in the past 10 years, the development of different types of urban vegetation has experienced a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. Due to the high heterogeneity of features in urban areas, this study improved the inversion accuracy of estimating urban vegetation biomass by classification, and provided reference value and the basis for urban ecological management and regional planning.

TI  - Wind Effects for Floating Algae Dynamics in Eutrophic Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind-speed decline is an important impact of climate change on the eastern Asian atmospheric circulation. Although wind does not determine algae biomass in eutrophic lakes, it is a decisive factor in the formation and severity of algae blooms. Based on 2000-2018 MODIS images, this study compared the effects of wind speed on algal blooms in three typical eutrophic lakes in China: Lake Taihu, Lake Chaohu and Lake Dianchi. The results indicate that climate change has different effects on the wind speed of the three lakes, but a common effect on the vertical distribution of algae. A wind speed of 3.0 m/s was identified as the critical threshold in the vertical distribution of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the three study lakes. The basic characteristics of the periodic variation of wind speed were different, but there was a significant negative correlation between wind speed and floating algal bloom area in all three lakes. In addition, considering lake bathymetry, wind direction could be used to identify locations that were particularly susceptible to algae blooms. We estimated that algal bloom conditions will worsen in the coming decades due to the continuous decline of wind, especially in Lake Taihu, even though the provincial and national governments have made major efforts to reduce eutrophication drivers and restore lake conditions. These results suggest that early warning systems should include a wind-speed threshold of 3.0 m/s to improve control and mitigation of algal blooms on these intensively utilized lakes.

TI  - Terrestrial aerosol retrieval over Beijing from Chinese GF-1 data based on the blue/red correlation.
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide field imager (WFV) cameras are Chinese high-resolution optical sensors in the GF-1 satellite, and the data from WFV cameras have been applied to environmental monitoring. In this paper, for wide swath observation of WFV, the blue/red correlation is more suitable for retrieving Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). the blue/red correlation of surface reflectance was analysed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance products for each pixel over the Beijing area. A significant linear relationship was found between red and blue bands in most of the area, corresponding to urban, farmland, forest, and water areas. Assisted by geographic blue/red correlation, the aerosol inversion method for WFV data was developed. After selecting the data between July 2016 and August 2017, the AOD was obtained using our method and was compared with the ground results from three Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Beijing sites. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between the AOD of our method and that of the ground measurements was about 0.9, and approximately 53% of the points were within the expected error (0.05 +/- 0.20 tau), and the results are better than MODIS 10 km aerosol product.

TI  - Dynamic Response of <i>Phragmites australis</i> and <i>Suaeda salsa</i> to Climate Change in the Liaohe Delta Wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of its unique geographical location and ecological function, the Liaohe Delta Wetland is important in maintaining regional ecological balance and security. Monitoring and evaluating changes in the wetland are therefore of great importance. We used medium- and high-resolution satellite data, meteorological station data, and site measurement data to analyze changes in the area and spatial distribution of Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa in the Liaohe Delta Wetland from 1998 to 2017, as well as their growth response to the climate change. The results showed that during 1998-2017, the areas of both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands alternated through periods of decreasing, increasing, and then decreasing trends. The annual change in the area and spatial distribution range of S. salsa fluctuated more than that of P. australis. The annual variation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in P. australis wetland showed an upward trend from 1998 to 2017. The area of P. australis cover that was improved, unchanged, and decreased accounted for 81.8%, 12.3%, and 5.9%, respectively, of the total area; evaporation and wind speed were the main meteorological factors affecting the NDVI; and contribution rates of the climate change and human activities to the NDVI were 73.2% and 26.8%, respectively. The area with vegetation cover being mainly S. salsa that was improved, unchanged, and decreased accounted for 63.3%, 18.3%, and 18.4%, respectively, of the total area; and no meteorological factors significantly affected the NDVI of S. salsa in the region. The interaction between vegetation growth and meteorological factors may help to explain the increasing trend in vegetation cover. The improvement in wetland vegetation also led to carbon sequestration and an increase in sequestration capacity.

TI  - Assessment of Annual Composite Images Obtained by Google Earth Engine for Urban Areas Mapping Using Random Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas represent the primary source region of greenhouse gas emissions. Mapping urban areas is essential for understanding land cover change, carbon cycles, and climate change (urban areas also refer to impervious surfaces, i.e., artificial cover and structures). Remote sensing has greatly advanced urban areas mapping over the last several decades. At present, we have entered the era of big data. Long time series of satellite data such as Landsat and high-performance computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offer new opportunities to map urban areas. The objective of this research was to determine how annual time series images from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) can effectively be composed to map urban areas in three cities in China in support of GEE. Three reducer functions, ee.Reducer.min(), ee.Reducer.median(), and ee.Reducer.max() provided by GEE, were selected to construct four schemes to synthesize the annual intensive time series Landsat 8 OLI data for three cities in China. Then, urban areas were mapped based on the random forest algorithm and the accuracy was evaluated in detail. The results show that (1) the quality of annual composite images was improved significantly, particularly in reducing the impact of cloud and cloud shadows, and (2) the annual composite images obtained by the combination of multiple reducer functions had better performance than that obtained by a single reducer function. Further, the overall accuracy of urban areas mapping with the combination of multiple reducer functions exceeded 90% in all three cities in China. In summary, a suitable combination of reducer functions for synthesizing annual time series images can enhance data quality and ensure differences between characteristics and higher precision for urban areas mapping.

TI  - Downscaling Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Based on Convolutional Neural Network Method to Monitor Agricultural Drought
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is a frequent global phenomenon. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a by-product of photosynthesis that can be used to monitor vegetation growth and agricultural drought. The global 0.05 spatial resolution data set has been obtained using the data-driven algorithm method. However, the broken farmland is not conducive to regional agricultural drought monitoring. Hence, 0.05 SIF products should be downscaled. On this basis, a convolutional neural network (CNN) downscaled work was conducted in this article to obtain 0.008 spatial resolution SIF results. The downscaled SIF and land surface temperature (LST) data were used to establish the temperature fluorescence dryness index (TFDI). The new TFDI was subsequently used for monitoring agricultural drought in Henan province (China) during the corn-growing season (from June to October 20132017). Results showed that the downscaled SIF data exhibit a good correlation with gross primary productivity (GPP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) than 0.05 SIF products. During the study period, the soil moisture fluctuation corresponded well with precipitation, and the value of TFDI had an opposite fluctuation with soil moisture. Meanwhile, the annual averaged TFDI had a high correlation with summer corn yield ($R = -0.84$ ). In conclusion, the SIF results through the CNN-based downscaled method were reliable, and the new TFDI was suitable for region agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - 3D mineral exploration targeting with multi-dimensional geoscience datasets, Tongling Cu(-Au) District, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tongling Cu(--Au) district is the most important magma-skarn type Cu(--Au) polymetallic districts in the Middle-Lower Yangtze metallogenic belt of China. The previous studies in the Tongling Cu(-Au) district compiled available digital geological, geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing datasets. As the discovery of near-surface Cu(--Au) deposits becomes more and more difficult in the Tongling Cu(--Au) district, we face the challenge of exploring for blind mineral deposits in the subsurface. Three-dimensional (3D) mineral potential mapping can provide effective exploration targeting by integrating multi-source and multi-dimension geoscience datasets. In this paper, firstly, a 3D district-scale geological model was constructed from multiple geoscience datasets. Secondly, multi-level (0 m,-300 m,-600 m,-900 m,-1200 m) exploration criteria were extracted by spatial analyses. Thirdly, the weights-of-evidence method, discrete smooth interpolation, and ordinary kriging interpolation were used to integrate multi-level exploration criteria including two-dimensional (2D) surface geochemical and remote sensing data into a 3D posterior-probability model. Finally, the concentration-area and concentration-volume fractal methods were used to define posterior-probability thresholds to outline 2D and 3D targets, respectively. The results indicated that the integrating performance of ordinary kriging interpolation is better than that of discrete smooth interpolation in 3D posterior-probability modeling. The whole procedure yielded a series of high-potential Cu(--Au) targets. The methodology discussed here can be used in other magma-skarn districts in the world.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clarifying the spatial heterogeneity of urban heat island (UHI) effect is of great significance for promoting sustainable urban development. A GeoDetector was used to detect the influential natural and society factors. Natural factors (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-regulating vegetation index (SAVI), normalized building index (NDBI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI)) as well as society factors (road density (RDD), and population density (POPD)) were selected as driving factors to be tested for their explanatory power for land surface temperature (LST). Results indicated that the Moran's I index value for the LST of the built-up area is 0.778. The top three factors influencing the LST were NDBI, NDVI, and SAVI, the explanatory power of which was 0.7593, 0.6356, and 0.6356, respectively. The interactive explanatory power for NDBI and MNDWI was 0.8108 and for NDBI and RDD was 0.8002, these two interactions are double enhanced interaction relationships. The results of this study play a guiding role in the development of urban thermal environment regulation schemes and ecological environment planning.

Despite their respective values in aerosol-related studies, the two AOD products compromise between their spatial resolution and spatial coverage, which limits their utilities in studies that require fine-scale resolution AOD over large geographical areas (e.g., continental or global scale). This study proposes a SParse representation-based Gap Filling model (SPGF) to blend the higher spatial resolution of DT3K AOD and the broader spatial coverage of DB10K AOD, i.e., fill the gaps in DT3K AOD data. Specifically, this model downscales DB10K AOD based on a resolved sparse representation matrix of a learned overcomplete AOD dictionary pair (10 km and 3 km), which introduces the spatial information from DT3K AOD and the spatial coverage from DB10K AOD. To validate the fused 3 km AOD products, we conduct accuracy assessments based on two types of criteria that are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate the contribution of our data fusion method. The results show that the proposed method accurately blends the spatial resolution of DT3K AOD and the spatial coverage of DB10K AOD. The improved 3 km AOD products extend the spatial coverage over the original DT3K AOD and contain more information content and spatial details than the original DB10K AOD. Consequently, the proposed data fusion model can compensate for the deficiency of existing MODIS C6.1 AOD products in a low-cost manner, which is of great significance for increasing the usage and benefit for more detailed studies related to AOD dynamics.

TI  - Intraday Variation Mapping of Population Age Structure via Urban-Functional-Region-Based Scaling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of the population is uneven for various reasons, such as urban-rural differences and geographical conditions differences. As the basic element of the natural structure of the population, the age structure composition of populations also varies considerably across the world. Obtaining accurate and spatiotemporal population age structure maps is crucial for calculating population size at risk, analyzing populations mobility patterns, or calculating health and development indicators. During the past decades, many population maps in the form of administrative units and grids have been produced. However, these population maps are limited by the lack of information on the change of population distribution within a day and the age structure of the population. Urban functional regions (UFRs) are closely related to population mobility patterns, which can provide information about population variation intraday. Focusing on the area within the Beijing Fifth Ring Road, the political and economic center of Beijing, we showed how to use the temporal scaling factors obtained by analyzing the population survey sampling data and population dasymetric maps in different categories of UFRs to realize the intraday variation mapping of elderly individuals and children. The population dasymetric maps were generated on the basis of covariates related to population. In this article, 50 covariates were calculated from remote sensing data and geospatial data. However, not all covariates are associate with population distribution. In order to improve the accuracy of dasymetric maps and reduce the cost of mapping, it is necessary to select the optimal subset for the dasymetric model of elderly and children. The random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) algorithm was introduced to obtain the optimal subset of different age groups of people and generate the population dasymetric model in this article, as well as to screen out the optimal subset with 38 covariates and 26 covariates for the dasymetric models of the elderly and children, respectively. An accurate UFR identification method combining point of interest (POI) data and OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network data is also introduced in this article. The overall accuracy of the identification results of UFRs was 70.97%, which is quite accurate. The intraday variation maps of population age structure on weekdays and weekends were made within the Beijing Fifth Ring Road. Accuracy evaluation based on sampling data found that the overall accuracy was relatively high-R-2 for each time period was higher than 0.5 and root mean square error (RMSE) was less than 0.05. On weekdays in particular, R-2 for each time period was higher than 0.61 and RMSE was less than 0.02.

TI  - Artificial Light at Night Advances Spring Phenology in the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is closely related to light availability as diurnal and seasonal cycles are essential environmental cues for organizing bio-ecological processes. The natural cycles of light, however, have been dramatically disrupted by artificial light at night (ALAN) due to recent urbanization. The influence on plant phenology of ALAN and its spatial variation remain largely unknown. By analyzing satellite data on ALAN intensity across the United States, here, we showed that ALAN tended to advance the start date of the growing season (SOS), although the overall response of SOS to ALAN was relatively weak compared with other potential factors (e.g., preseason temperature). The phenological impact of ALAN showed a spatially divergent pattern, whereby ALAN mainly advanced SOS at climatically moderate regions within the United States (e.g., Virginia), while its effect was insignificant or even reversed at very cold (e.g., Minnesota) and hot regions (e.g., Florida). Such a divergent pattern was mainly attributable to its high sensitivity to chilling insufficiency, where the advancing effect on SOS was only triggered on the premise that chilling days exceeded a certain threshold. Other mechanisms may also play a part, such as the interplay among chilling, forcing and photoperiod and the difference in species life strategies. Besides, urban areas and natural ecosystems were found to suffer from similar magnitudes of influence from ALAN, albeit with a much higher baseline ALAN intensity in urban areas. Our findings shed new light on the phenological impact of ALAN and its relation to space and other environmental cues, which is beneficial to a better understanding and projection of phenology changes under a warming and urbanizing future.

TI  - Machine Learning Comparison and Parameter Setting Methods for the Detection of Dump Sites for Construction and Demolition Waste Using the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning has been successfully used for object recognition within images. Due to the complexity of the spectrum and texture of construction and demolition waste (C&DW), it is difficult to construct an automatic identification method for C&DW based on machine learning and remote sensing data sources. Machine learning includes many types of algorithms; however, different algorithms and parameters have different identification effects on C&DW. Exploring the optimal method for automatic remote sensing identification of C&DW is an important approach for the intelligent supervision of C&DW. This study investigates the megacity of Beijing, which is facing high risk of C&DW pollution. To improve the classification accuracy of C&DW, buildings, vegetation, water, and crops were selected as comparative training samples based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Sentinel-2 was used as the data source. Three classification methods of typical machine learning algorithms (classification and regression trees (CART), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)) were selected to classify the C&DW from remote sensing images. Using empirical methods, the experimental trial method, and the grid search method, the optimal parameterization scheme of the three classification methods was studied to determine the optimal method of remote sensing identification of C&DW based on machine learning. Through accuracy evaluation and ground verification, the overall recognition accuracies of CART, RF, and SVM for C&DW were 73.12%, 98.05%, and 85.62%, respectively, under the optimal parameterization scheme determined in this study. Among these algorithms, RF was a better C&DW identification method than were CART and SVM when the number of decision trees was 50. This study explores the robust machine learning method for automatic remote sensing identification of C&DW and provides a scientific basis for intelligent supervision and resource utilization of C&DW.

TI  - Remotely sensed water turbidity dynamics and its potential driving factors in Wuhan, an urbanizing city of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of turbidity, an indicator of water quality, is of great importance in cities and can have significant implications for human society. Many users are interested in mapping turbidity using remote sensing tools for long-term and large-scale monitoring. This study aims to derive turbidity maps in an urbanizing city and to identify the driving factors for better decision-making and water quality management. Taking Wuhan, the most rapidly urbanizing metropolis in central China, as an instance, the water turbidity is monitored using Landsat observations from 1987 to 2019, and the relationships of turbidity and climatic/human factors are examined. Climatic factors are represented by meteorological conditions (rainfall, wind speed, temperature, and water vapor pressure) and human factors are characterized by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and impervious surface area (ISA). The results demonstrated that: (1) the seasonal mean turbidity increased from spring to summer (34.28 NTU to 36.27 NTU), decreased in autumn (25.04 NTU), and increased again in winter (37.20 NTU), and the variations were related to changes in rainfall; and (2) the annual mean turbidity was fluctuatingly stable during 1987-2004 and decreased by 1 NTU/yr. since 2005. The decline of water turbidity was highly correlated to the increase of NDVI and ISA with p values < 0.01. The study indicates that meteorological conditions affect seasonal variations in turbidity, while human factors have long-term impacts. A cautious approach to human activities during urbanization is needed to achieve a balance between water quality protection and the city's developments.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Vegetation Dynamics and Their Relationships with Climatic, Anthropogenic, and Hydrological Factors in the Amur River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the growth, productivity, and distribution of vegetation, which are highly relied on and sensitive to natural and anthropogenic factors, is essential for agricultural production management and eco-environmental sustainability in the Amur River Basin (ARB). In this paper, the spatial-temporal trends of vegetation dynamics were analyzed at the pixel scale in the ARB for the period of 1982-2013 using remotely sensed data of long-term leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). The spatial autocorrelation characteristics of the vegetation indexes were further explored with global and local Moran's I techniques. The spatial-temporal relationships between vegetation and climatic factors, land use/cover types and hydrological variables in the ARB were determined using a geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) model based on the observed meteorological data, remotely sensed vegetation information, while the simulated hydrological variables were determined with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model. The results suggest that the variation in area-average annual FVC was significant with an increase rate of 0.0004/year, and LAI, FVC, and GPP all exhibited strong spatial heterogeneity trends in the ARB. For LAI and FVC, the most significant changes in local spatial autocorrelation were recognized over the Sanjiang Plain, and the low-low agglomeration in the Sanjiang Plain decreased continuously. The GTWR model results indicate that natural and anthropogenic factors jointly took effect and interacted with each other to affect the vegetated regime of the region. The decrease in the impact of precipitation to vegetation growth over the Songnen Plain was determined as having started around 1991, which was most likely attributed to dramatic changes in water use styles induced by local land use changes, and corresponded to the negative correlation between pasture areas and vegetation indexes during the same period. The analysis results presented in this paper can provide vital information to decision-makers for use in managing vegetation resources.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of grassland aboveground biomass based on high accuracy surface modeling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and effective accounting of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for grassland carbon storage accounting and pastoral agriculture sustainability. In this study, we combined AGB field survey data and remote sensing data to build a suitable model to estimate the grassland AGB in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of China. Three machine learning models were used to simulate the grassland AGB from 2001 to 2019, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and high accuracy surface modeling (HASM). The results show that (1) the HASM achieved better results than the RF and SVM models (R-2 = 0.8459 > 0.72 > 0.5858; RMSE = 29 < 41 < 56), and the HASM results reproduce the spatial distribution characteristics of the biomass well. The subsequent spatiotemporal analysis of the AGB conducted in this study was based on the results of the HASM. (2) The highest AGB was located in the eastern and central-southern parts of the TRSR, and the lowest AGB was distributed in the western region. (3) The overall change in the AGB revealed that the percentage of the area that experienced a significant increase in AGB (21%) was larger than that of the area that experienced a significant decrease (13%), and the stable areas accounted for 66% of the total area. The grassland AGB increased by 1 g/m(2)/yr during 2001-2019. (4) The factors driving the changes in the AGB were analyzed. Overall, the warm and wet climate conditions promoted grass growth in most regions of the TRSR. (5) However, the biomass decreased in some regions with warm and wet conditions. For example, overgrazing and increased populations of grazing led to significant biomass decreases in the towns of Ziketang and Heka in Xinghai County. In this study, the grassland AGB was simulated based on the HASM model, with a high accuracy and a spatial resolution of 500 m. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for grassland resource protection and the highly effective implementation of grassland restoration projects in China.

TI  - Evaluation of Cloud and Precipitation Simulations in CAM6 and AM4 Using Observations Over the Southern Ocean
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses cloud and radiative properties collected from in situ and remote sensing instruments during two coordinated campaigns over the Southern Ocean between Tasmania and Antarctica in January-February 2018 to evaluate the simulations of clouds and precipitation in nudged-meteorology simulations with the CAM6 and AM4 global climate models sampled at the times and locations of the observations. Fifteen SOCRATES research flights sampled cloud water content, cloud droplet number concentration, and particle size distributions in mixed-phase boundary layer clouds at temperatures down to -25 degrees C. The 6-week CAPRICORN2 research cruise encountered all cloud regimes across the region. Data from vertically pointing 94 GHz radars deployed was compared with radar simulator output from both models. Satellite data were compared with simulated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes. Both models simulate observed cloud properties fairly well within the variability of observations. Cloud base and top in both models are generally biased low. CAM6 overestimates cloud occurrence and optical thickness while cloud droplet number concentrations are biased low, leading to excessive TOA reflected shortwave radiation. In general, low clouds in CAM6 precipitate at the same frequency but are more homogeneous compared to observations. Deep clouds are better simulated but produce snow too frequently. AM4 underestimates cloud occurrence but overestimates cloud optical thickness even more than CAM6, causing excessive outgoing longwave radiation fluxes but comparable reflected shortwave radiation. AM4 cloud droplet number concentrations match observations better than CAM6. Precipitating low and deep clouds in AM4 have too little snow. Further investigation of these microphysical biases is needed for both models.

TI  - UAV Data as an Alternative to Field Sampling to Monitor Vineyards Using Machine Learning Based on UAV/Sentinel-2 Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pests and diseases affect the yield and quality of grapes directly and engender noteworthy economic losses. Diagnosing "lesions" on vines as soon as possible and dynamically monitoring symptoms caused by pests and diseases at a larger scale are essential to pest control. This study has appraised the capabilities of high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data as an alternative to manual field sampling to obtain sampling canopy sets and to supplement satellite-based monitoring using machine learning models including partial least squared regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and extreme learning regression (ELR) with a new activation function. UAV data were acquired from two flights in Turpan to determine disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) and compared with field visual assessments. The UAV-derived canopy structure including canopy height (CH) and vegetation fraction cover (VFC), as well as satellite-based spectral features calculated from Sentinel-2A/B data were analyzed to evaluate the potential of UAV data to replace manual sampling data and predict DI. It was found that SVR slightly outperformed the other methods with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.89%. Moreover, the combination of canopy structure (CS) and vegetation index (VIs) improved prediction accuracy compared with single-type features (RMSEcs of 2.86% and RMSEVIs of 1.93%). This study tested the ability of UAV sampling to replace manual sampling on a large scale and introduced opportunities and challenges of fusing different features to monitor vineyards using machine learning. Within this framework, disease incidence can be estimated efficiently and accurately for larger area monitoring operation.

TI  - Variations of Water Transparency and Impact Factors in the Bohai and Yellow Seas from Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency, measured with Secchi disk depth (SDD), is an important parameter for describing the optical properties of a water body. This study evaluates variations of SDD and related impact factors in the Bohai and Yellow Seas (BYS). Based on a new mechanistic model proposed by Lee et al. (2015) applied to MODIS remote sensing reflectance data, climatological SDD variation from 2003 to 2019 was estimated. The annual mean images showed an increasing trend from the coastal zone to the deep ocean. Lower values were found in the Bohai Sea (BHS), while higher values observed in the center of the southern Yellow Sea (SYS). Additionally, the entire sea has shown a decreasing temporal tend, with the variation rate lowest in the BHS at 0.003 m y(-1), and highest in the SYS at 0.015 m y(-1). However, the weak increasing trend that appeared since 2017 suggests that water quality seems to have improved. Further, it displayed seasonal patterns of low in winter and spring and high in summer and autumn. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of SDD variations over the BYS, shows that the first SDD EOF mode is the highest, strongly correlated with total suspended matter. With the high correlation coefficients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter, it illustrates that the SDD variation is mainly dominated by the optical components in the seawater, although correlation with chlorophyll-a is the weakest. The second and third EOF modes show that photosynthetically available radiation, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and wind speed are the main covariates that cause SDD changes. Water transparency evaluation on a long-term scale is essential for water quality monitoring and marine ecosystem protection.

TI  - A Regional Maize Yield Hierarchical Linear Model Combining Landsat 8 Vegetative Indices and Meteorological Data: Case Study in Jilin Province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite remote sensing could effectively predict maize yield. However, many statistical prediction models using remote sensing data cannot extend to the regional scale without considering the regional climate. This paper first introduced the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method to solve maize-yield prediction problems over years and regions. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated by the spectrum of the Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI), and meteorological data were introduced as input parameters in the maize-yield prediction model proposed in this paper. We built models using 100 samples from 10 areas, and used 101 other samples from 34 areas to evaluate the model's performance in Jilin province. HLM provided higher accuracy with an adjusted determination coefficient equal to 0.75, root mean square error (RMSEV) equal to 0.94 t/ha, and normalized RMSEV equal to 9.79%. Results showed that the HLM approach outperformed linear regression (LR) and multiple LR (MLR) methods. The HLM method based on the Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and meteorological data could flexibly adjust in different regional climatic conditions. They had higher spatiotemporal expansibility than that of widely used yield estimation models (e.g., LR and MLR). This is helpful for the accurate management of maize fields.

TI  - Feasibility of Super-Resolution Reconstruction in Satellite Platform Jitter Detection
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The centroid positioning accuracy is not only one of the key factors that affect the attitude accuracy of the spaceborne laser altimeter, but also a new type of technical means for satellite platform jitter detection. Aiming at the problems that the laser spot data of geo-science laser altimeter system(GLAS) satellite platform has noise, low spatial resolution, multiple maximum energy values, etc. , which affect the centroid positioning accuracy, the feasibility of improving the spatial resolution of spaceborne laser spots in satellite platform jitter detection is mainly studied in this paper. First, a non-spot dark channel template denoising method is proposed to denoise long-sequence laser spots. Second, the collaborative deconvolution and super-resolution reconstruction methods are used to improve the "tailing" phenomenon of laser spots while increasing its spatial resolution. Finally, a gray-weighted sub-pixel centroid method for centroid tracking is proposed to track and locate the long-time laser spot to achieve the preliminary detection of the satellite platform flutter. Experimental results show that the proposed residual fitting accuracy of centroid positioning method is about 0.08 pixel higher than gray-weighted method, 0.08 pixel higher than Gaussian surface fitting method, and 0.1 pixel higher than ellipse fitting method. It is preliminarily detected that there is a 94 min attitude change rule of glas satellite platform.

TI  - Preliminary Identification of Geological Hazards from Songpinggou to Feihong in Mao County along the Minjiang River Using SBAS-InSAR Technique Integrated Multiple Spatial Analysis Methods
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides and collapses are common geological hazards in mountainous areas, posing significant threats to the lives and property of residents. Therefore, early identification of disasters is of great significance for disaster prevention. In this study, we used Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to process C-band Sentinel-1A images to monitor the surface deformation from Songpinggou to Feihong in Maoxian County, Sichuan Province. Visibility analysis was used to remove the influence of geometric distortion on the SAR images and retain deformation information in the visible area. Hot spot and kernel density analyses were performed on the deformation data, and 18 deformation clusters were obtained. Velocity and slope data were integrated, and 26 disaster areas were interpreted from the 18 deformation clusters, including 20 potential landslides and 6 potential collapses. A detailed field investigation indicated that potential landslides No. 6 and No. 8 had developed cracks and were severely damaged, with a high probability of occurrence. Potential collapse No. 22 had developed fissures, exposing a dangerous rock mass and posing significant threats to the lives and property of residents. This study shows that the proposed method that combines visibility analysis, InSAR deformation rates, and spatial analysis can quickly and accurately identify potential geological disasters and provide guidance for local disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Using Superpixel Cosegmentation
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of cosegmentation in remote sensing image change detection can effectively overcome the salt and pepper phenomenon and generate multitemporal changing objects with consistent boundaries. Cosegmentation considers the image information, such as spectrum and texture, and mines the spatial neighborhood information between pixels. However, each pixel in the minimum cut/maximum flow algorithm for cosegmentation change detection is regarded as a node in the network flow diagram. This condition leads to a direct correlation between computation times and the number of nodes and edges in the diagram. It requires a large amount of computation and consumes excessive time for change detection of large areas. A superpixel segmentation method is combined into cosegmentation to solve this shortcoming. Simple linear iterative clustering is adopted to group pixels by using the similarity of features among pixels. Two-phase superpixels are overlaid to form the multitemporal consistent superpixel segmentation. Each superpixel block is regarded as a node for cosegmentation change detection, so as to reduce the number of nodes in the network flow diagram constructed by minimum cut/maximum flow. In this study, the Chinese GF-1 and Landsat satellite images are taken as examples, the overall accuracy of the change detection results is above 0.80, and the calculation time is only one-fifth of the original.

TI  - Downscaling Snow Depth Mapping by Fusion of Microwave and Optical Remote-Sensing Data Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high spatial resolution snow depth mapping in arid and semi-arid regions is of great importance for snow disaster assessment and hydrological modeling. However, due to the complex topography and low spatial-resolution microwave remote-sensing data, the existing snow depth datasets have large errors and uncertainty, and actual spatiotemporal heterogeneity of snow depth cannot be effectively detected. This paper proposed a deep learning approach based on downscaling snow depth retrieval by fusion of satellite remote-sensing data with multiple spatial scales and diverse characteristics. The (Fengyun-3 Microwave Radiation Imager) FY-3 MWRI data were downscaled to 500 m resolution to match Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover, meteorological and geographic data. A deep neural network was constructed to capture detailed spectral and radiation signals and trained to retrieve the higher spatial resolution snow depth from the aforementioned input data and ground observation. Verified by in situ measurements, downscaled snow depth has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) (8.16 cm, 4.73 cm respectively) among Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China Snow Depth (WESTDC_SD, 9.38 cm and 5.36 cm), the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) Ascend Snow Depth (MWRI_A_SD, 9.45 cm and 5.49 cm) and MWRI Descend Snow Depth (MWRI_D_SD, 10.55 cm and 6.13 cm) in the study area. Meanwhile, downscaled snow depth could provide more detailed information in spatial distribution, which has been used to analyze the decrease of retrieval accuracy by various topography factors.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node for endometrial cancer treatment: review of the literature
T2  - MINERVA MEDICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy and in two thirds of patients it is apparently uterine confined at presentation. Lymph nodal status represents one of the main prognostic factors. Nodal evaluation with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has gained more ground in clinical practice after the publication of different studies demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of this technique. However, at the moment there are no RCTs available evaluating the long-term oncologic safety of SLN technique compared to LND. This review aims at summarizing the available evidence on oncologic outcomes between SLN mapping alone and LND. Differences in operative complications and long-term complications were also analyzed.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The literature search was conducted in the PubMed database and it focused on comparative studies published from inception to September 2020 analyzing differences in oncological outcomes or complications between nodal evaluation with SLN technique alone and nodal evaluation with lymphadenectomy. Comparative studies with more than 10 cases, published in English, were included.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 5 retrospective comparative studies have been identified reporting data on oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent SLN mapping alone vs. LND. Non significative difference has been reported in terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival between the two groups. Six studies evaluated differences in terms of complications between the two techniques. A total of 2302 patients were identified. Postoperative complications were detected in 9.6% and 7.7% of patients who underwent lymphadenectomy and SLN mapping respectively and no significant difference was noted (P=0.3). Looking at major postoperative complications the rate in the LND group was significantly higher than in the SLN group (3.6% vs. 1.5%, P=0.02). Two of these six studies reported data on lymphatic long-term complications. The prevalence of lymphedema ranged from 0% to 1.3% in the SLN group and from 10% to 18% in the LND group. The absolute difference reported (13.35%) was similar to the one found in literature.CONCLUSIONS: SLN mapping in apparently uterine confined disease has been demonstrated to be a feasible and accurate technique for nodal evaluation and high-quality evidence support this. Moreover, SLN mapping resulted to be associated with less major postoperative and long-term complications when compared to LDN. Conversely, high-quality evidence is not available on long-term oncologic safety of this technique compared to the standard LND. Randomized trials are requested to provide reliable data on this aspect.

TI  - Studies of FY-3 Observations over the Past 10 Years: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the rapid advances and abundant observations from Chinese Fengyun-3 (FY-3) meteorological satellites, it is of great interest to summarize a decade of quality assessments of FY-3 observations. The topics covered are noise characterization, bias estimation, striping noise detection and mitigation of striping noise, radio frequency interference detection, geolocation accuracy estimation and improvement, data assimilation cloud detection and quality control for observations from the MicroWave Temperature Sounder (MWTS), the MicroWave Humidity Sounder (MWHS), the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) instruments on board FY-3A/B/C/D. Whether and how much FY-3 data assimilation could improve the numerical weather forecast skill strongly depends on how well the FY-3 data characteristics and errors listed above are known. This review article shall contribute to promoting internal and national usages of FY-3 observations for weather and climate studies.

TI  - Recent land deformation detected by Sentinel-1A InSAR data (2016-2020) over Hanoi, Vietnam, and the relationship with groundwater level change
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), one of the most commonly used remote sensing methods for observing and monitoring land subsidence, has been applied in Hanoi, Vietnam in several studies with results showing deformation up to 2014. However, freely accessible Sentinel-1 InSAR data have not been investigated thoroughly to date. Here, we investigate the most recent land surface deformation in Hanoi for the period 20162020 using Sentinel-1A SAR data. The analysis is conducted on 114 SAR scenes with both the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) methods. The GPS-based deformation time series are used to verify InSAR results and borehole groundwater level measurements are employed to evaluate the relationship between groundwater depletion and surface subsidence. The results show that observed deformation from SBAS and PSInSAR is consistent in both spatial patterns and statistics, in which two high-rate subsiding bowls were detected in Dan Phuong/Hoai Duc and Ha Dong/Thanh Tri districts with the mean subsiding rates of similar to 5 mm per year. GPS and InSAR deformation generally agree well except for the comparison at the JNAV station after 2017, which can be attributable to the local deformation detected by GPS and the average movement of a 100-m radius area captured by InSAR. An agreement in the drawdown trend between borehole groundwater and InSAR-derived deformation was found at four wells located within or in proximity to the two bowls. The declining rates of groundwater level at about 0.31 m per year were found at the two wells Q57a and Q58a located within the Dan Phuong/Hoai Duc bowl, corresponding to the surface subsidence rates found at 6-8 mm per year. The Q68a well was found to experience groundwater level declining at the highest rate of similar to 0.9 m per year corresponding to the subsidence rate of similar to 7 mm per year found by InSAR.

TI  - Geostatistical approach to assess mangrove spatial variability: a bi-decadal scenario over Raigarh coast of Maharashtra
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at assessing the bi-decadal scenario related to the spatial variability of Mangroves over Raigarh district by adopting Geostatistical approach. Landsat TM/OLI data for the year 2000 and 2019 were employed for the study. Methodology adopted, involve computation and plotting of Semi-variogram (in 'R') with NDVI data, which was extracted for 28 homogeneous mangrove patches. These patches, based on similarity of Semi-variogram components, were further classified into clusters. Semi-variogram pattern for the year 2000 revealed a low range and high sill, indicating greater variation in the dataset that was correlated for a shorter distance. While in the year 2019, the Semi-variogram obtained for the same mangrove patches, exhibited high range and low sill. This clearly indicates a high spatial correlation associated with relatively low variation within the data. During the year 2019, some patches have shown evidences of exponential growth of mangroves that were represented by higher NDVI values, which were more similar, correlated and dependent. Overall rise in NDVI value indicates that the health status of mangroves has increased in 2019 along with natural expansion of mangrove colony. Over bi-decadal time span, mangrove ecology has also improved corresponding to higher NIR reflectance. The present research can be implemented to mangrove management and conservation purpose as this technique reveals the spatial dependency in the dataset.

TI  - Estimation of missing hydrological data in monthly rainfall series using meteorological satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing data in historical rainfall series are common in Brazilian conditions, making unfeasible several hydrological studies that rely on these data. In this context, orbital sensor products represent a potential tool for estimating rainfall. As a result, this study aims to assess the applicability of data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission to estimate missing hydrological data in monthly rainfall series from surface rain gauges, testing its estimation's accuracy. Three rain gauges located in the Doce river watershed were selected to simulate and estimate missing hydrological data using linear regression and regional weighting techniques, using historical series of neighboring gauges and TRMM/GPM's pixels. Although the estimations using TRMM/GPM data were not the most accurate for all the rain gauges, their performance evaluation, done with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Ratio (NSE) and the Wilmott Concordance Index (d), showed that the estimations obtained are considered good and satisfactory (NSE>0.75 and 0.36<NSE<0.75, respectively), with d higher than 0.9. The results show that the TRMM/GPM missions' historical series can be used to estimating missing hydrological data in the study area, with great potential for application in Brazilian conditions, characterized by low density of rain gauges without long historical series and missing data.

TI  - Markets are constantly collapsing: Reconceptualizing 'the market' as a quantum social wavefunction
T2  - COMPETITION & CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantum moment in International Relations theory challenges the taken for granted Newtonian assumptions of conventional theories, while offering a novel physical imaginary grounded in quantum mechanics. As part of the special issue on reconceptualizing markets, this article questions if prior efforts to conceptualize 'the market' have been unsuccessful at capturing the paradoxical microfoundational/macrostructural because of the Newtonian worldview within which much social science operates. By developing a new, quantum perspective on the market, taking the physical paradigm of the wavefunction, I seek to explore the connections between entanglement, nonlocality, interference and invisible social structures. To demonstrate the applicability of quantum thinking, I explore how global value chains and open economy politics might be 'quantized', through the mobilization of core concepts of quantum social theory, within the broad framework of the market as a quantum social wavefunction.

TI  - Mass balance, accumulation dynamics and high-altitude warfare: the Siachen Glacier as a battlefield
T2  - SMALL WARS AND INSURGENCIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1984 the Indian and Pakistani armies have been locked in the world's highest war on Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram Himalaya. This remote location is the world's only nuclear trijunction as well as a source of drinking water for significant portions of India and Pakistan, and its possession is considered by both governments to be key to their national security. In the past, alpine battles were fought predominantly on glaciers with a precipitation-dominated accumulation type; Siachen, however, gains most of its new ice mass from avalanches and icefalls. This has presented unique challenges in tactics and logistics, rendering many of the strategies of modern conventional warfare useless, and the style of mountain warfare these challenges have produced has impacted both the combatants and the glacier itself. Existing literature on Siachen, while it discusses the verticality of the conflict, has done little to analyze the singular nature of warfare on a high-altitude glacier with an avalanche-heavy accumulation type. This paper draws on USGS Landsat data, glaciological mass balance studies, hydrological studies, firsthand combat accounts and historical reviews of the region to examine the unique tactics, logistics and impact of warfare on Siachen Glacier.

TI  - Predictive and prognostic value of total tumor load in sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant treatment using one-step nucleic acid amplification: the NEOVATTL study
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of total tumor load (TTL) in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with infiltrating breast cancer after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Methods This retrospective multicenter study used data from a Spanish Sentinel Lymph Node database. Patients underwent intraoperative SLN biopsy after NST. TTL was determined from whole nodes using a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay and defined as the total sum of CK19 mRNA copies in all positive SLNs. Cox-regression models identified independent predictive variables, which were incorporated into a nomogram to predict axillary non-SLN metastasis, and identified prognostic variables for incorporation into a disease-free survival (DFS) prognostic score. Results A total of 314 patients were included; most had no lymph node involvement prior to NST (cN0; 75.0% of patients). Most received chemotherapy with or without biologic therapy (91.7%), and 81 patients had a pathologic complete response. TTL was predictive of non-SLN involvement (area under the concentration curve = 0.87), and at a cut-off of 15,000 copies/mu L had a negative predictive value of 90.5%. Nomogram parameters included log (TTL + 1), maximum tumor diameter and study-defined NST response. TTL was prognostic of disease recurrence and DFS at a cut-off of 25,000 copies/mu L. After a 5-year follow-up, DFS was higher in patients with <= 25,000 copies/mu L than those with > 25,000 (89.9% vs. 70.0%; p = 0.0017). Conclusions TTL > 15,000 mRNA copies/mu L was predictive of non-SLN involvement and TTL > 25,000 mRNA copies/mu L was associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence in breast cancer patients who had received NST.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> invasion: linking invasion pattern to meteorological conditions
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial information on the invasion of alien plant species is considered necessary to develop policies aimed at management since there are significant threats to local biodiversity. The present study was conducted in the Salalah plains, located in the Southern part of Oman, and is severely affected by the invasion of Prosopis juliflora. Spatial analyses of the extent of invasive colonies along with the rate of spread were carried out. The impact of the meteorological parameters, precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity, on the growth dynamics of P. juliflora was also carried out. During the study period of approximately three decades from 1984 to 2013, more than 100 hectares of the natural land cover were converted into mono-dominant stands of P. juliflora. Although different programs to cut the P. juliflora were organized in the study area between 2000 and 2002, these programs have contributed unintentionally to the spread of the seeds and cuttings over larger areas amplifying the rate of increase from 1 ha per year to more than 9 ha. The photosynthetic activity of P. juliflora is directly affected by relative humidity and precipitation. Linear regression analysis showed a significant negative relationship between cumulative monthly precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with an r-squared value of 0.59 (r = - 0.77) and between mean monthly relative humidity and NDVI with an r-squared value of 0.63 (r = - 0.80). At the same time, there was no relationship between mean monthly temperature and NDVI. Cross-correlation analysis showed that P. juliflora's vigor was sensitive to the previous month's high relative humidity and precipitation in a negative way. The adverse effects of precipitation and relative humidity on the growth dynamics of P. juliflora, especially during the monsoon season, should be taken into consideration when planning for integrated prevention and control programs of the invasive species.

TI  - Appraisal of environment quality in the capital district of Cameroon using Landsat-8 images
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to apply remote sensing techniques to properly address the questions of sustainability, environment quality as well as life comfort, in capital district of Cameroon, Yaounde. The effects of urban heat island were highlighted with LST ranging from 14 ?C in the vegetated and less developed southern area, to 34 ?C in the high built-up and overpopulated northern zone. Results reveal that the LST amplitude is greater than the minimum temperature in the city. LST values are strongly correlated to the normalised difference built-up index and to the normalised difference vegetation index positively (r = +0.8529) and negatively (r = -0.8452) respectively. The derived urban thermal field variance index classifies 50.54 % of the city in the category of worst environment quality. The spatial distribution of the later index is analogic to the global solar radiation in the city, and indicates that populations living in the most part of the study area are likely to be at risk of several health issues. Several suburbs are advised. The Government has to immediately redesign Yaounde as well as other cities, by giving an important part to the urban forest and vegetation cover.

TI  - The comparison of AOD-based and non-AOD prediction models for daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation in Guangdong province, China with poor AOD coverage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The large amount of missing values has challenged the application of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) in mapping surface PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, we developed a non-AOD random forest model to estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Guangdong Province, China, where more than 80% of AOD data were missing. The predictive ability of the non-AOD model was compared with that of a AOD-based model. Daily ground-based measurements of PM2.5 were obtained from 148 ground-monitoring sites in Guangdong with a 60 km rectangle buffer from January 2016 to December 2018. Daily MODIS MAIAC AOD were downloaded from NASA at a resolution of approximately 1 km. Two random forest models were developed to predict ground-level PM2.5 with one included AOD as a predictor and the other one without AOD. The two random forest models were developed using the same dataset and their predictive abilities were compared. The results of 10-fold cross validation (CV) showed that the non-AOD and AOD-based random forest models yielded similar performance. The CV R-2 (RMSE) for the non-AOD model in 2016-2018 were 0.82 (8.4 mu g/m(3)), 0.81 (9.5 mu g/m(3)) and 0.78 (9.4 mu g/m(3)), and those for AOD-based model were 0.83 (8.2 mu g/m(3)), 0.82 (9.2 mu g/m(3)) and 0.80 (9.0 mu g/m(3)), respectively. Higher consistency of estimated PM2.5 were observed in areas close to monitoring sites than those far away from sites, and in southern coastal than northern areas. As the non-AOD random forest model is not affected by AOD missingness, it can be used for epidemiological studies to estimate individual-level exposure to PM2.5 at a high resolution without spatial or temporal gaps.

TI  - Channel dynamics and geomorphological adjustments of Kaljani River in Himalayan foothills
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Channel dynamics is a significant geomorphological process that involves the channel migration, erosion-deposition and meandering of an alluvial river channel within its floodplain region. This geomorphic process is often accelerated by climatic condition and human activities which changes this natural process to a quasi-natural hazard. Current research work tries to evaluate the changing behaviour or dynamic nature of alluvial channel by enlightening average length and shape migration. Finally, state of the art techniques in Arc GIS has been adopted to prepare the mouza (village) wise erosion-deposition map by considering highly fluctuating mouzas of the Kaljani River and its adjacent village at the Himalayan foothill region. The primary data source was a series of time-sequential Landsat data of the years 1972, 1980, 1987, 1993, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2019 spanning 47 years. Furthermore, we divided total study time into eight groups i.e. 1972-1980, 1980-1987, 1987-1993, 1993-1998, 1998-2002, 2002-2008, 2008-2013, and 2013-2019 for better understanding. During the study period (1972-2019) the average length of migration of the Kaljani River was 742.05 m and the annual rate was 15.79 m/year. Within this time frame of 1972-2019, the shape area migration of the channel was 66.79 km(2) and the annual rate was 1.42 km(2)/year. The total area of bank erosion from 1972 to 2019 equaled 62.74 km(2), out of which, 30.07 km(2) were on the right bank and 32.67 km(2) were at the left bank. Present analysis helps to enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of land resources and ecological balances in these 45 adjacent Mouzas of the Kaljani River. Among the various important causes, tectonic activity, rainfall, floods, and human intervention especially constriction of the embankment along the Kaljani River are the most significant causes for this dynamic changes of River Kaljani. The results of this study therefore, can be used as an important indicator of the vulnerability of the Kaljani River and also provides information about geomorphological instabilities of the study area.

TI  - WAVERYS: a CMEMS global wave reanalysis during the altimetry period
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the Copernicus Marine Service, WAVERYS is the multi-year wave reanalysis that provides global wave data with a fine grid resolution of 1/5 degrees. This wave reanalysis covers the period 1993-2019 and disseminates 3-h integrated wave parameters describing the sea state at the ocean surface. The wave model used is the version 4 of the model MFWAM, which is driven by sea ice fraction and wind provided by the atmospheric reanalysis ERA5. The WAVERYS includes the assimilation of altimeter wave data and directional wave spectra provided by Sentinel-1. The wave reanalysis includes also wave-current interactions by using 3-h surface current forcing provided by the ocean reanalysis GLORYS. This paper highlights the assessment of wave parameters provided by the WAVERYS. The validation has been performed with independent altimeter significant wave heights and buoy wave data. The results show the good accuracy of scatter index of SWH (significant wave height) which is 8.7% in comparison with HY-2A altimeter. Moreover, we point out that scatter index of SWH from the WAVERYS is improved by about 9% with respect to the ERA5 wave dataset. We also indicate the good accuracy of swell propagation thanks to the assimilation of directional wave spectra. An analysis has been conducted for wave-current interactions and also discussions about extreme values and trend of time series are suggested.

TI  - Satellite observation of a newly developed light-fishing "hotspot" in the open South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Distribution patterns of lit fisheries in the South China Sea (SCS) were investigated using seasonally averaged nighttime light remote sensing data from 2016. Light-fishing activities clearly showed spatial and seasonal patterns and a newly developed "hotspot" with the presence of many intensive lights observed in the open ocean during spring. These satellite observations are consistent with seasonal changes in the fishing grounds of a Chinese large-sized, falling-net fishing fleet based on catch monitoring records for a typical commercial fishing vessel and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data from this fleet. Catch monitoring records show that this type of vessel operates both on the northern shelf and in the oceanic waters, with apparent seasonal fishing patterns in the SCS. Dominant catches on the shelf include Carangids, Trichiurus japonicus, and Loligo spp., while Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis and Auxis spp. overwhelm catches in the oceanic waters. Furthermore, we compared VMS and Day Night Band (DNB) data to study fishing behaviors of this type of vessel, including match rates between VMS and nightly satellite images and the DNB radiance characteristics of the vessels. This study is valuable for delineating squid fishing grounds in the open SCS and provides an important basis for differentiating light fishing vessels of China from those of other countries, which may be useful for detecting illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. Findings of this study may also shed light on mitigating the emerging threat of light pollution to the local ecosystem of the SCS.

TI  - Fate control and ingroup bias in donation for the fight with the coronavirus pandemic: The mediating role of risk perception of COVID-19
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ingroup bias could be a significant hindrance in a context where intergroup collaboration is crucial, which makes it essential to investigate ingroup bias during pandemics. This research investigated the influence of individuals' belief in fate control on ingroup bias in helping with COVID-19, and the mediating role of risk perception of COVID-19. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the data from a community sample (n = 318) collected at the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We found that fate control was positively associated with ingroup bias in donation to the patients with COVID-19 and the frontline healthcare professionals. Moreover, the mediating role of risk perception of COVID-19 was significant. A higher level of fate control was associated with higher risk perception of COVID-19, which was, in turn, related to stronger ingroup bias in donation across individuals. These findings highlight the substantial role of general worldview in shaping individuals' responses to pandemics.

TI  - The turning point between urban vegetation and artificial surfaces for their competitive effect on land surface temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the two most common types of land cover in cities, vegetation (Veg) and artificial surfaces (AS) often exhibit competitive effects, i.e., cooling effect and warming effect, on land surface temperature (LST). Hitherto, the change of this competitive effect along the proportion gradient of AS within urban areas and their implications for urban construction still lacks adequate attention and discussion. To fill this gap, we made a quantitative analysis of the relationship between Veg (trees or grassland), AS and LST in 35 major cities of China by using Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) high-resolution satellite observations. Results found that: (1) in each city, there exists a certain threshold (or "turning point") along the proportion gradient of AS, exceeds which AS replaces Veg as the variable that have dominant effect on LST (i.e., the warming effect of AS is always stronger than the cooling effect of Veg); (2) for most cities, the turning points of AS for grassland and trees are 60% and 70%, respectively; (3) the turning point for cities at a higher development level is lower, indicating that even a relatively low AS coverage (similar to 50-60%) in these areas can lead to an evident rise in LST; 4) compared to cities in temperate and tropical climate zones, the turning point for arid/semi-arid cities is higher, implying that their urban Veg shows a better performance in mitigating urban heat stress. This study represents a systematic investigation of the competitive effect of urban Veg and AS on LST, and the understanding of turning point provides a new perspective for stakeholders to integrate urban development and temperature regulation in planning initiatives.

TI  - Put your mask on first to help others: Attachment and sentinel behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to learn whether attachment style is related to the ways people try to warn, protect, and care for others during the pandemic and what kinds, if any, personal protective measures they are taking. Data were collected in early May 2020 from 200 Amazon MTurk (AMT) workers who participated in exchange for payment. People who were high in attachment-related anxiety were more likely to behave as "sentinels" (i.e., warning loved ones to engage in safe practices such as hand washing, wearing a face mask), whereas those high in attachment avoidance were less likely to do so. These findings suggest that insecure attachment may contribute to peoples' willingness to protect themselves and others during the pandemic.

TI  - Surgeon Bias in the Management of Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging data suggest that not every node-positive patient requires an axillary dissection. This is a single-institution retrospective reviewing which factors guided surgical decision-making in performing an axillary dissection in node-positive mastectomy patients. Young age, lobular histology, tumor size, number of positive sentinel nodes, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion influenced decisions on axillary dissection.Background: The standard of care for clinically node-negative (cN0) patients following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was completion axillary lymph node dissection (CALND). Publication of ACOSOG Z0011 in 2010 changed this standard for patients undergoing lumpectomy. Clinicians have since expanded this practice to mastectomy patients, and ongoing prospective studies are seeking to validate this practice. Here, we evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that led surgeons to forego a second surgery for CALND in cN0 mastectomy patients with positive SLNB. Patients and Methods: A single institution, retrospective review of cN0 patients with invasive primary breast cancer and positive SLNB from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Patients with T4 disease, positive preoperative axillary biopsy, prior neoadjuvant therapy or axillary surgery were excluded. Patients with positive SLNB undergoing CALND were compared with patients for whom CALND was omitted. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and x(2) tests or Fischer exact tests for categorical variables. Results: Of 259 patients with positive SLNB, 180 (69.4%) patients underwent mastectomy. CALND was performed at the time of mastectomy in 54 (30%) patients, at time of second operation in 22 (12.2%) patients, and not performed in 104 (57%) patients. Delayed CALND was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumors, increased number of positive sentinel nodes, invasive lobular carcinoma, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion. Conclusions: The management of cN0 patients with positive SLNB that do not meet ACOSOG Z0011 criteria is evolving and is influenced by tumor and patient characteristics in an attempt to balance the morbidity of CALND with the low rate of local regional recurrence.

TI  - Analyzing the extent of drought in the Rajasthan state of India using vegetation condition index and standardized precipitation index
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the most complex but least understood of all natural hazards that impacts around 55 million people globally every year. A hydrological drought (drought here after) is when the lack of rainfall goes on long enough to empty rivers and lower water tables and causes severe water shortage. In recent years, Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) have played a crucial role in studying different hazards either natural or man-made. This study stresses upon the use of RS technique for drought risk assessment in Rajasthan state of India for the year 2002 and 2019. In this study, an effort has been made to analyze the extent of drought using two drought indices, namely vegetation-based vegetation condition index (VCI) and meteorology-based standardized precipitation index (SPI). For VCI calculation, which indicates impact of soil moisture on vegetation, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from year 2000 to 2019. Monthly SPI was calculated using rainfall data obtained from the Rajasthan water resource department. SPI values were interpolated to get the spatial pattern of meteorological drought. Whole area categorised into five drought classes including extreme drought, severe drought, moderate drought, mild drought and no drought, following the recommended value breaks. The results revealed that about 83.87% area was under drought in the year 2002 thus considered as drought year. It has also been calculated that only 15.62% area was showing drought condition in year 2019 especially in the western part of Rajasthan. Correlation analysis performed between VCI and SPI resulted in a coefficient of correlation of 0.92 and 0.79 in year 2002 and 2019, respectively. The high correlation endorses the reliability of RS data for drought-related analysis.

TI  - Monitoring field establishment of the emerald ash borer biocontrol agent <i>Oobius agrili</i> Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae): Sampling methods, sample size, and phenology
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring Oobius agrili Zhang and Huang (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), an egg parasitoid being released for biological control of emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is challenging due to its small size and the cryptic placement of host eggs. We compared four O. agrili recovery methods: 1) rearing adults from bark (bark rearing); 2) sifting parasitized eggs from bark (bark sifting); 3) placing sentinel EAB eggs in screened envelopes on ash trees (sentinel eggs); and, 4) placing yellow pan traps on ash trees to capture adult parasitoids. In 2016, we sampled 40 trees within 0.25-ha-plots at each of 4 sites in Michigan with each recovery method. In 2017 and 2018, methods were applied to 10 trees within 0.25-ha-plots at each of 3 sites. Sentinel eggs were not included in 2018. Yellow pan traps and bark sifting recovered O. agrili in all sites and years, had higher percentages of O. agrili-positive trees, and required fewer trees sampled for > 95% probability of O. agrili recovery compared to bark rearing and sentinel eggs. When sampling only trees with fresh woodpecker-feeding holes, a sign of recent EAB attack, the probability of O. agrili recovery increased substantially for bark sifting and bark rearing, increased slightly for yellow pan traps, but decreased for sentinel eggs compared to sampling all trees. Peak recovery using yellow pan traps and sentinel eggs occurred between 400 and 1200 growing degree days (base 10 degrees C, January 1 start date), revealing when most O. agrili adults were active. The type of information each of these parasitoid-recovery methods provides and their relative efficiencies are discussed.

T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, sustainable forms of collective resilience help societies coping cohesively with unprecedented challenges. In our empirical contribution, we framed collective resilience and cohesion in terms of prosociality. A study carried out in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (N = 399) articulated basic individual values, ideological orientations (i.e., authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and core political values in a comprehensive framework to predict bonding and bridging forms of prosocial intentions, and prosocial behaviors directed towards vulnerable groups. According to our findings, people whose worldview incorporates collective and collaborative principles cared more about others' welfare. Jointly, self-transcendence, equality, and accepting immigrants predicted more prosociality, whereas social dominance orientation predicted less prosociality. Over and beyond all other predictors, self-transcendence uniquely predicted prosocial intentions and behaviors alike. To conclude, we suggest interventions to promote and sustain prosociality among people motivated by a larger array of life goals and worldviews.

TI  - Benchmarking and inter-comparison of Sentinel-1 InSAR velocities and time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Different InSAR algorithms and methods produce velocities and times series that are not identical, even using the same data for the same area. This inconsistency can cause confusion and be a barrier to uptake and widespread use of the data in the commercial sector. With the widespread availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data and a suite of new algorithms in the commercial and academic sectors, it is timely to develop a method for comparison of different results. In this study, we focus on developing and testing an independent and robust methodology for assessment of different InSAR processing results. Our proposed method is adapted from the Terrafirma Process Validation project; we compare geocoded line-of-sight velocities and time series, density and coverage, as well as some qualitative metrics. We use Sentinel-1 data from an area in Glasgow (UK) processed using 4 different approaches modified RapidSAR, SqueeSAR, GAMMA-IPTA and conventional StaMPS. The main areas of ground motion are detected using all approaches, with the average standard deviation of velocity differences for all inter comparison pairs in all polygons equal to 1.1 mm/yr. Sentinel-1 InSAR therefore provides comparable results that are independent of processing approaches. However, there are considerable differences in some aspects of the results, in particular in their density and coverage. We discuss the reasons for these differences and suggest a framework for validation that could be used in future national or pan-national ground motion services.

TI  - An ET-Based Two-Phase Method for the Calibration and Application of Distributed Hydrological Models
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameter calibration is a core process for the application of distributed hydrological models, which depends strongly on river runoff records. However, the sparse distribution of hydrological gauging stations has largely limited the application of hydrological modeling. Remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) data open a new avenue for the calibration of hydrological models. In this study, we used MOD16 ET, a data product from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), to calibrate a hydrological model in a two-phased approach. A simulated runoff time series was created with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that was automatically calibrated for ET in the first phase. The simulated runoff time series was then used in the second phase as the "observed" variable for a semiautomatic calibration in which runoff composition was further refined based on a comprehensive understanding of the local hydrological cycle. The results indicate that the output of simulated ET to MOD16 ET was acceptable and produced a reasonable runoff time series compared to the actual observed runoff, yet the composition of runoff was unsatisfactory for the different runoff components (e.g., surface runoff and base flow) after only automatic calibration. The runoff components were improved by semimanual calibration of the runoff sensitive parameters and resulted in a well calibrated distributed hydrological model. The increasing availability and improving quality of global ET datasets provide an alternative way to calibrate hydrological models, especially in ungauged meso- and large-scale basins. Even though the runoff gauging series is not a prerequisite for the method, some in situ observations are still valuable for the optimization of water cycle components.

TI  - A model framework to reduce bias in ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations inferred from satellite-retrieved AOD
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new method to infer ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from satellite remote sensing observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD). The conventional method generally uses a range of modelling approaches to determine PM2.5:AOD relationships that are subsequently used to infer ground-level PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-retrieved AOD. Here, we use a high-resolution atmospheric chemistry simulation to explore how changes in the vertical distribution of aerosol extinction coefficients affects the PM2.5:AOD relationship and how we can use that information to improve the robustness of inferred estimates of ground-level PM2.5 over eastern China. We define a metric, Gamma AODPBL, that describes the fraction of AOD that resides in the planetary boundary layer compared with the total columnar AOD. We determine physically-meaningful PM2.5: AOD relationships using data for which Gamma AODPBL >= 50%, a criterion based on sensitivity analyses on data clusters that we identify using a hierarchical clustering method. We use statistical and machine learning methods to develop independent models that describe these PM2.5:AOD relationships, and use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify the improvement after our selection of more physically relevant data records. Benefiting from the improved representativeness of AOD for ground-level PM2.5, our method effectively reduces bias in inferred estimates of ground-level PM2.5 by 10-15% (9-12%) for space-borne sensors passing over in the morning (afternoon). It also captures more variations in ground-level PM2.5 by up to 8% (5%) for space-borne sensors passing over in the morning (afternoon), particularly over areas dominated by natural aerosols such as dust. Accordingly, our method improves the seasonal ground-level PM2.5 maps, e.g. the bias of the autumn (winter) mean of ground level PM2.5 estimates over Qinghai and Gansu (Shaaxi, Shanxi, and Henan) provinces reduces from-8% to-5% (11%-6%).

TI  - The use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imageries in detecting and mapping rubber trees
T2  - JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) areas and stages of rubber tree growth is needed in making decisions to maximise land use and for efficient farm management. The use of conventional methods in collecting this information requires a long time, high costs, and constraints to access certain areas. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 images in detecting and mapping the rubber tree area. This study presents a pixel-based supervised classification approach to obtain an accurate map of land cover and rubber tree growth stage distribution using resampled 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 and pansharpened 15 m Landsat-8 OLI. Seven land cover classes (bare soil, water, mature rubber, immature rubber, oil palm, forest, and built-up area) were classified using support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and spectral angle mapper (SAM). The results showed that the highest classification accuracy was obtained using SVM, 87.22% for Sentinel-2 and 85.74% for Landsat-8. Next, the classification accuracies of ANN were almost similar with 86.17% and 82.39% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively. SAM has produced less than 60% of acceptable accuracy for both datasets. The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was statistically tested using a McNemar test. The test showed that the p-value between SVM and ANN was not significant and thus, ANN and SVM produced similar accuracies and outperformed SAM for both cases. In this study, the best output produced via SVM from Sentinel-2 was selected to produce the thematic map due to the spatial accuracy advantage of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat-8. The calculated areas of immature and mature rubber from the thematic map were 7.79 km(2) and 10.93 km(2), respectively, which then used to estimate the number of tappers needed for the management of rubber. It is concluded that the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data can be recommended to be used in rubber cultivation area assessment.

TI  - Optimization of three-dimensional multi-level surface deformation in mining areas through integration of deformation fusion model and Lagrange multiplier method based on single high resolution OTD-InSAR pair
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground longwall mining activities usually induce three-dimensional (3-D) multi-level surface deformation, which could lead to serious natural hazards. Offset-tracking (OT) and differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technology (referred to as OTD-InSAR) can be used to observe the large-level and smalllevel mining deformations based on single InSAR pair, but the measured deformation is only along the radar lineof-sight (LOS) or the azimuth directions rather than in the 3-D directions. The conventional InSAR-based methods to resolve 3-D mining deformation have the strict restrictions and low south-north accuracy. In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed to utilize a multi-level deformation fusion model and the Lagrange multiplier method based on single OTD-InSAR pair (hereafter called MAOTD-InSAR) to estimate and optimize the 3-D multi-level surface deformation. The Daliuta coal mining area of China was selected to verify the feasibility and precision of the proposed method using high resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) SAR images with six pairs. Results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of MAOTD-InSAR against in-situ measured data are less than 0.2214 m, 0.1612 m and 0.1880 m in the east, north and vertical directions, respectively. The minimum RMSE in the horizontal direction could reach 0.0361 m with an improvement of about 82.6%, which particularly improve the accuracy in the south-north direction for the TSX satellite since its direction of azimuth deformation is approximately north direction, and this is also adequate for the other satellites in the near-polar orbit. In addition, an empirical model was generated with respect to the gradients of ground fissures on horizontal deformation, and this model enabled us to remove large errors caused by ground fissures. The verification results show that the proposed method provides higher precision and reliability for the resolved 3-D multi-level surface deformation, which presents 3-D mining deformation with more details from the edge to the center of the subsidence basin and will show some possibilities for new findings and interpretations in the process of coal mining.

TI  - Diurnal patterns in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure over India using MERRA-2 reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling of ambient PM2.5 exposure has improved in recent years with the application of satellite data, but in India, where the ground-based measurements are still inadequate, satellite-based assessment cannot provide temporal continuity. In this work, we analyze MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis aerosol products to estimate PM2.5 at an hourly scale over India to fill the temporal sampling gap. MERRA-2 PM2.5 calibrated using reference-grade monitors from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) network show a statistically significant (at 95% CI) correlation (r = 0.9) against coincident in-situ measurements. Analyzing 18-years (2000-2017) data, we report the first detailed account of multi-year ambient PM2.5 diurnal patterns in India. Diurnal amplitude is found to be quite large (>30 mu gm(-3)) in the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) and western arid regions. We find a decrease in ambient PM2.5 over the western dust source region and an increase over the parts of IGB and central India, primarily in the morning and evening hours. The annual trend is strongly governed by the trend during the dry season (October-February), attributed to a combination of the changing emission and meteorology. Our results suggest that the satellite-based exposure estimates that typically represent late morning to early afternoon hours are usually lower than the 24-h average exposure in most parts of India. Therefore, we call for the integration of reanalysis data that provide better temporal resolution with satellite data that provide better spatial resolution to further improve exposure estimates in data void regions like India for air quality studies.

TI  - A time-series analysis of testing and COVID-19 outbreaks in Canadian federal prisons to inform prevention and surveillance efforts.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 14,000 adults are currently incarcerated in federal prisons in Canada. These facilities are vulnerable to disease outbreaks and an assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing and outcomes is needed. The objective of this study was to examine outcomes of COVID-19 testing, prevalence, case recovery and death within federal prisons and to contrast these data with those of the general population.METHODS: Public time-series outcome data for prisoners and the general population were obtained on-line from the Correctional Service of Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada, respectively, from March 30 to May 27, 2020. Prison, province and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. A total of 50 facilities were included in this study.RESULTS: Of these 50 facilities, 64% reported fewer individuals tested per 1,000 population than observed in the general population and 12% reported zero tests in the study period. Testing tended to be reactive, increasing only once prisons had recorded positive tests. Six prisons reported viral outbreaks, with three recording over 20% cumulative COVID-19 prevalence among prisoners. Cumulatively, in prisons, 29% of individuals tested received a positive result, compared to 6% in the general population. Two of the 360 cases died (0.6% fatality). Four outbreaks appeared to be under control (more than 80% of cases recovered); however, sizeable susceptible populations remain at risk of infection. Female prisoners (5% of the total prisoner population) were over-represented among cases (17% of cases overall).CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that prison environments are vulnerable to widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Gaps in testing merit public health attention. Symptom-based testing alone may not be optimal in prisons, given observations of widespread transmission. Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate. Increased testing, along with rigorous infection prevention practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb future outbreaks.

TI  - Adverse events of interest following influenza vaccination, a comparison of cell culture-based with egg-based alternatives: English sentinel network annual report paper 2019/20
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The cell-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVc) is now offered as an alternative to eggbased quadrivalent (QIVe) and adjuvanted trivalent (aTIV) influenza vaccines in the UK. While post-licensure studies show non-inferiority of cell-based vaccines, it is not known how its safety profile compares to other types of vaccines in real-world use.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using computerised medical records from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network database. We used a self-controlled case series design and calculated the relative incidence (RI) of adverse events of interest (AEIs) over different risk periods. We then compared the RIs of AEIs within seven days of vaccination overall and between QIVc and QIVe in the 18-64 years age group, and between QIVc and aTIV in the >= 65 years age group.Findings: The majority of AEIs occurred within seven days of vaccination, and a seasonal effect was observed. Using QIVc as the reference group, QIVe showed similar incidence of AEIs whereas live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and aTIV had lower incidence of AEIs. In the stratified analyses, QIVe and aTIV were associated with a 16% lower incidence of AEIs in the seven days post-vaccination in both the 18-64 years and >= 65 years age groups.Interpretation: Routine sentinel network data allow comparisons of safety profiles of equally suitable seasonal influenza vaccines. The higher incidence of AEIs associated with QIVc suggest monitoring of several seasons would allow robust comparisons to be made. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - New generation geostationary satellite observations support seasonality in greenness of the Amazon evergreen forests
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the seasonal patterns of the Amazon rainforests has been difficult because of the paucity of ground observations and persistent cloud cover over these forests obscuring optical remote sensing observations. Here, we use data from a new generation of geostationary satellites that carry the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) to study the Amazon canopy. ABI is similar to the widely used polar orbiting sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but provides observations every 10-15min. Our analysis of NDVI data collected over the Amazon during 2018-19 shows that ABI provides 21-35 times more cloud-free observations in a month than MODIS. The analyses show statistically significant changes in seasonality over 85% of Amazon forest pixels, an area about three times greater than previously reported using MODIS data. Though additional work is needed in converting the observed changes in seasonality into meaningful changes in canopy dynamics, our results highlight the potential of the new generation geostationary satellites to help us better understand tropical ecosystems, which has been a challenge with only polar orbiting satellites. Cloud cover and scarcity of ground-based validation hinder remote sensing of forest dynamics in the Amazon basin. Here, the authors analyse imagery from a high-frequency geostationary satellite sensor to study monthly NDVI patterns in the Amazon forest, finding support for spatially extensive seasonality.

TI  - DaPeCa-8: drawing the map of lymphatic drainage in patients with invasive penile cancer - evidence from SPECT/CT and sentinel node surgery
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAnatomy of the lymphatic drainage guides the extent of inguinal lymph node dissection in penile cancer.ObjectiveTo prospectively assess the lymphatic drainage of penile cancer with single-photon emission computed tomography CT (SPECT-CT) and implications for the extent of inguinal lymph node dissection.MethodsWe assessed the lymphatic drainage of 62 patients with at least unilateral clinical lymph node-negative (cN0) status with SPECT-CT at our tertiary referral centre. We evaluated 122 cN0 inguinal basins and compared them to the histopathological outcome. The inguinal regions were divided into ten different Daseler zones on SPECT-CT. The surgical team filled in a corresponding scheme at sentinel node biopsy and sent lymph nodes from each Daseler zone individually for histopathological examination.ResultsSPECT-CT successfully visualized lymphatic drainage in 116 of the 122 cN0 inguinal basins (95.1%). The vast majority of sentinel nodes and all metastatic nodes were located in central and superior inguinal zones, including six metastatic nodes in lateral superior zones. Minimal lymphatic drainage was seen to the inferior Daseler zones and no metastatic deposits were located here. No direct pelvic drainage was observed.ConclusionsPenile cancer lymphatic drainage is primarily to sentinel in the superior and central zones of Daseler. Colleagues practicing a modified inguinal lymph node dissection as a standard in cN0 patients are encouraged to include all these zones, while the inferior zones can be omitted. This study confirms the absence of lymphatic drainage directly to the pelvic region and supports the practice of omitting pelvic nodes from sentinel node biopsy.

TI  - Performance of Indocyanine-Green Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Lymph Node Metastasis in Esophageal Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives Lymphatic mapping with indocyanine-green (ICG) and near-infrared light fluorescent imaging is widely used for sentinel lymph node staging in different types of cancer but is not fully accepted for all procedures because studies have reported heterogeneous results. This study aimed to assess the detection rate (DR) of ICG imaging for sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) and lymph node metastases (LNMs) in esophageal cancer. Methods A systematic search was performed to identify relevant studies examining the use of ICG imaging for SLNM in patients with esophageal cancer. Extracted results were pooled in a single-proportion meta-analysis, with a random-effects model, presented as forest plots. Results Six studies were included in the analysis. The ICG DR for SLNM was 89% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71%-96%]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for the detection of LNMs were 84% (95% CI 64%-94%) and 15% (95% CI 3%-45%), respectively. A trend towards a lower DR was found with increasing mean latency time between ICG injection and SLNM. Conclusions ICG imaging is a technique that potentially could improve lymph node yield excision and, as a consequence, improve the detection of lymph node metastases.

TI  - Evaluation of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Susceptibility Using Multi-Criteria Assessment Framework in Mahalangur Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing recession of glaciers in the Himalaya in response to global climate change has far-reaching impacts on the formation and expansion of glacial lakes. The subsequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a significant threat to lives and livelihoods as they can cause catastrophic damage up to hundreds of kilometres downstream. Previous studies have reported the rapid expansion of glacial lakes and several notable destructive past GLOF events in the Mahalangur Himalaya, suggesting a necessity of timely and updated GLOF susceptibility assessment. Here, an updated inventory of glacial lakes across the Mahalangur Himalaya is developed based on 10-m Sentinel-2 satellite data from 2018. Additionally, the GLOF susceptibilities of glacial lakes (>= 0.045 km(2)) are evaluated using a multi-criteria-based assessment framework where six key factors are selected and analyzed. Weight for each factor was assigned from the analytical hierarchy process. Glacial lakes are classified into very low, low, medium, high, and very high GLOF susceptibility classes depending upon their susceptibility index based on analysis of three historical GLOF events in the study area. The result shows the existence of 345 glacial lakes (>0.001 km(2)) with a total area of 18.80 +/- 1.35 km(2) across the region in 2018. Furthermore, out of the 64 glacial lakes (>= 0.045 km(2)) assessed, seven were identified with very high GLOF susceptibility. We underline that pronounced glacier-lake interaction will likely increase the GLOF susceptibility. Regular monitoring and more detailed fieldworks for these highly susceptible glacial lakes are necessary. This will benefit in early warning and disaster risk reduction of downstream communities.

TI  - Constrained Functional Regression of National Forest Inventory Data Over Time Using Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The USDA Forest Service uses satellite imagery, along with a sample of national forest inventory field plots, to monitor and predict changes in forest conditions over time throughout the United States. We specifically focus on a 230,400 ha region in north-central Wisconsin between 2003 and 2012. The auxiliary data from the satellite imagery of this region are relatively dense in space and time, and can be used to learn how forest conditions changed over that decade. However, these records have a significant proportion of missing values due to weather conditions and system failures that we fill in first using a spatiotemporal model. Subsequently, we use the complete imagery as functional predictors in a two-component mixture model to capture the spatial variation in yearly average live tree basal area, an attribute of interest measured on field plots. We further modify the regression equation to accommodate a biophysical constraint on how plot-level live tree basal area can change from one year to the next. Findings from our analysis, represented with a series of maps, match known spatial patterns across the landscape. for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

TI  - Testing the causal mechanism of the peninsular effect in passerine birds from South Korea
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The peninsular effect is a geographical phenomenon that explains patterns of species richness. Given that spatial variation in species richness along a peninsular may be driven by multiple processes, we aimed to identify the sources of latitudinal patterns in passerine species richness and test hypotheses regarding (1) recent deterministic processes (climate, primary productivity, forest area, and habitat diversity), (2) anthropogenic processes (habitat fragmentation), and (3) stochastic processes (migration influence) in the Korean peninsula. We used the distribution data of 147 passerine species from 2006 to 2012. Single regression between passerine species richness and latitude supported the existence of the peninsular effect. Mean temperature increased with decreasing latitude, as did habitat diversity but leaf area index and forest area decline. However, mean temperature and forest area only influenced passerine species richness. Although habitat diversity influenced passerine species richness, it was counter to the expectations associated with peninsular effect. The number of habitat patches decreased as latitude increased but it had no effect on passerine species richness. Ratio of migrant species richness showed no significant relationship with leaf area index, forest area, and habitat diversity. However, the ratio of migrant species richness increased with decreasing mean temperature and that contributed to the increase in passerine species. Overall, our finding indicate that the observed species richness pattern in peninsulas with the tip pointing south (in the northern hemisphere) counter to the global latitudinal gradient. These results were caused by the peninsular effect associated with complex mechanism that interact with climate, habitat area, and migrant species inflow.

TI  - Shipborne measurements of XCO<sub>2</sub>, XCH<sub>4</sub>, and XCO above the Pacific Ocean and comparison to CAMS atmospheric analyses and S5P/TROPOMI
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of atmospheric column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2), methane (XCH4), and carbon monoxide (XCO) have been collected across the Pacific Ocean during the Measuring Ocean REferences 2 (MORE-2) campaign in June 2019. We deployed a shipborne variant of the EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) on board the German RN Sonne which, during MORE-2, crossed the Pacific Ocean from Vancouver, Canada, to Singapore. Equipped with a specially manufactured fast solar tracker, the FTS operated in direct-sun viewing geometry during the ship cruise reliably delivering solar absorption spectra in the shortwave infrared spectral range (4000 to 11000 cm(-1)). After filtering and bias correcting the dataset, we report on XCO2, XCH4, and XCO measurements for 22 d along a trajectory that largely aligns with 30 degrees N of latitude between 140 degrees W and 120 degrees E of longitude. The dataset has been scaled to the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) station in Karlsruhe, Germany, before and after the MORE-2 campaign through side-by-side measurements. The la repeatability of hourly means of XCO2, XCH4, and XCO is found to be 0.24 ppm, 1.1 ppb, and 0.75 ppb, respectively. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) models gridded concentration fields of the atmospheric composition using assimilated satellite observations, which show excellent agreement of 0.52 +/- 0.31 ppm for XCO2, 0.9 +/- 4.1 ppb for XCH4, and 3.2 +/- 3.4 ppb for XCO (mean difference +/- SD, standard deviation, of differences for entire record) with our observations. Likewise, we find excellent agreement to within 2.2 +/- 6.6 ppb with the XCO observations of the TROPOspheric MOnitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite (S5P). The shipborne measurements are accessible at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.917240 (Knapp et al., 2020).

TI  - National influenza mid-season report, 2020-2021.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Canada's national influenza season typically starts in the latter half of November (week 47) and is defined as the week when at least 5% of influenza tests are positive and a minimum of 15 positive tests are observed. As of December 12, 2020 (week 50), the 2020-2021 influenza season had not begun. Only 47 laboratory-confirmed influenza detections were reported from August 23 to December 12, 2020; an unprecedentedly low number, despite higher than usual levels of influenza testing. Of this small number of detections, 64% were influenza A and 36% were influenza B. Influenza activity in Canada was at historically low levels compared with the previous five seasons. Provinces and territories reported no influenza-associated adult hospitalizations. Fewer than five hospitalizations were reported by the paediatric sentinel hospitalization network. With little influenza circulating, the National Microbiology Laboratory had not yet received samples of influenza viruses collected during the 2020-2021 season for strain characterization or antiviral resistance testing. The assessment of influenza vaccine effectiveness, typically available in mid-March, is expected to be similarly limited if low seasonal influenza circulation persists. Nevertheless, Canada's influenza surveillance system remains robust and has pivoted its syndromic, virologic and severe outcomes system components to support coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the threat of influenza epidemics and pandemics persists. It is imperative 1) to maintain surveillance of influenza, 2) to remain alert to unusual or unexpected events and 3) to be prepared to mitigate influenza epidemics when they resurge.

TI  - MACU-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images plays an important role in land resource management, yield estimation, and economic assessment. U-Net, a deep encoder-decoder architecture, has been used frequently for image segmentation with high accuracy. In this letter, we incorporate multiscale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multiscale skip connected and asymmetric-convolution-based U-Net (MACU-Net), for segmentation using fine-resolution remotely sensed images. Our design has the following advantages: (1) the multiscale skip connections combine and realign semantic features contained in both low-level and high-level feature maps; (2) the asymmetric convolution block strengthens the feature representation and feature extraction capability of a standard convolution layer. Experiments conducted on two remotely sensed data sets captured by different satellite sensors demonstrate that the proposed MACU-Net transcends the U-Net, U-Netpyramid pooling layers (PPL), U-Net 3+, among other benchmark approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/MACU-Net.

TI  - A case of lymph node dissection for contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after identifying the primary lymphatic drainage by lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CANCER CONFERENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a case of total mastectomy and contralateral axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in a patient with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), with lymphoscintigraphy, confirming that the primary lymphatic flow was directed to the contralateral ALNM. The patient in the present case study is a 63-year-old woman. At the age of 46 years, the patient underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for left breast cancer. After surgery, she underwent whole-breast irradiation and hormone therapy (tamoxifen) for 5 years. On follow-up, she did not have recurrence. When she underwent breast ultrasound examination at the 17-year checkup after the initial surgery, she was diagnosed with tumor recurrence in the left conserved breast and with contralateral ALNM, without distant metastasis to any other organ. When re-SLNB is performed in patients with IBTR, the primary lymphatic flow is directed toward a lymph node other than the ipsilateral axillary lymph node (ALN). Therefore, it is necessary to discuss whether or not the contralateral ALNM in our case should be treated as stage IV. Therefore, we performed ALND after confirming that the primary lymphatic flow was directed toward the contralateral ALN as observed on lymphoscintigraphy and considering the contralateral ALNM as a localized lesion. Lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative fluorescence imaging aid in the identification of the primary lymphatic flow. Lymph node metastases beyond the altered primary lymphatic flow are treated as localized lesions, and aggressive surgery is expected to be effective. There is a need to formulate guidelines on the treatment of IBTR considering changes in primary lymphatic flow.

TI  - Forest Cover Change and Ecosystem Services: A Case Study of Community Forest in Mechinagar and Buddhashanti Landscape (MBL), Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The community-based forest management program has been successful in the conservation of forest cover in Nepal. We investigated forest cover change for the Mechinagar and Buddhashanti Landscape (MBL) area within the Jhapa district, Nepal, during 1990-2019 using Landsat images and GIS tools and valuated the major ecosystem services (ES) of Kalika Community-managed Forest (KCF) within the MBL landscape using the economic approach-market price method (revealed price). Land cover analysis of the MBL area indicated that over the study period, there were increases in urban/built-up areas, forest, and tea plantations, and declines in cultivated land, shrub, barren land, water body, and grassland areas. In particular, forest cover increased by 8.6% from 41.5 sq.km to 45.1 sq.km, due to the conversion of 3.9 sq.km cultivated land and 2.4 sq.km shrub into forest cover. KCF, the selected case study area for ES valuation, has been successful in providing noticeable economic benefits from provisioning and cultural services. Of the provisioning services, wood and timber make the largest contribution with an average revenue collection of Nepali Rupees (NRs) 3091.4 thousands followed by non-timber forest products (NRs 883.1 thousands) and firewood (NRs 524.3 thousands), respectively, while ecotourism-based income is also important (NRs 458.4 thousands) and is increasing in later years. As monitoring forest cover in a rapidly changing landscape and evaluating the ES of the community-managed forest cover are imperative for sustainable environmental planning and policy formulation, these research outputs are expected to be a significant benchmark for planners, policy makers, and future researchers.

TI  - Management of the axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer- A change in practice
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Chemotherapy in the neo adjuvant setting has allowed downsizing of breast tumours thus allowing patients to benefit from breast conservation surgery. The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has also been observed in the axilla but most units are still treating the axilla with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).Materials and methods: A prospective database of breast cancer patients receiving NAC between 2007 and 2016 at a single breast unit was reviewed. The management of the axilla and outcomes was studied.Results: 165 patients received NAC, 123 (74.5%) were clinically/radiologically node positive and 42 were negative. Median age was 50 years. 26.7% had triple negative disease and 34.5% were HER2 positive. 56/123 (45.5%) patients with positive nodes at the outset responded completely to NAC. 40 patients with positive nodes pre-NAC had post NAC SLNB with 37 requiring adjuvant radiotherapy only. 83/123 went directly to ALND post NAC and of these 27 were node negative and therefore may be considered to have had an unnecessary ALND. Overall mortality was 20.6% (34), local recurrence in the breast or mastectomy scar was 3.6% (6) but there was no recurrence in the axilla (0/165) with a median follow up of 67 months.Conclusion: There is no clear evidence for management of the axilla post NAC. We have used best available evidence to change our practice over the years and our results should encourage others to de-escalate treatment of the axilla in line with the recently published multidisciplinary guidance on axillary surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Quantifying the local cooling effects of urban green spaces: Evidence from Bengaluru, India
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid unplanned urbanization has led to a deterioration in green cover in Indian cities and an increase in urban temperatures due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. With India's urban population set to double from 400 million in 2011 to 800 million by 2050, it becomes critical to understand the role of urban green spaces (UGS) in mitigating the UHI. In this study, we have used high-resolution Landsat and Google Earth data and integrated it with spatial statistical analysis to quantify the cooling effects provided by UGS beyond their boundaries. We analyzed cooling effects at the level of individual UGS for 262 UGS in the megacity of Bengaluru, India. Our results showed that the average UGS provided local cooling effects till points 347 m (95% CI: 318 m to 376 m) beyond its boundary. The average UGS was 2.23 degrees C (95% CI: 2.13 degrees C to 2.33 degrees C) cooler than the point where it ceased to provide cooling effects. Cooling effects reduced with distance from the UGS, and were impacted by the greenness, size, and shape of the UGS. The findings of this study are important in the context of India's Smart Cities Mission that has been criticized for an inadequate focus on urban greening. Our study addresses a concern that most previous studies have used a small sample of UGS for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the role of UGS in localized surface temperature reduction for a large Indian city.

TI  - Mapping the spatial and temporal variability of flood susceptibility using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index and the forecasted changes in the future
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate runoff forecasting plays a considerable role in the appropriate water resource planning and management. The spatial and temporal evaluation of the flood susceptibility was explored in the Quebec basin, Canada. This study provides a new strategy for runoff modelling as one of the complicated variables by developing new machine learning techniques along with remote sensing. A novel scheme of the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) known as the generalized structure of GMDH (GSGGMDH) is developed to overcome this classical approach's limitation. A simple time series based scenario with exogenous variables including precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was introduced for runoff forecasting. MODIS data included MOD13Q1 product was employed and a JavaScript code was developed to preprocess collected data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Using different seasonal and non-seasonal lags of all input variables, the developed GSGMDH found the most optimum input combination for each station in terms of simplicity and accuracy, simultaneously (average values; SI = 0.554, RMSRE = 1.55, MAE = 5.076). The precipitation values are modelled with the CanEsm(2) climate change model. To apply NDVI for runoff forecasting, a simple spatial-temporal GSGMDH based model was developed (average values; SI = 0.27; RMSRE = 8.27, MAE = 0.08). The forecasting results indicated that the months in which the maximum runoff occurred have changed, and these months have increased compared to the historic period. In the historical period, the frequency of maximum runoff was in April and March. Still, for the two forecasting periods (i.e. 2020-2039 and 2040-2059), the months in which the maximum runoff has occurred have changed, and their amount has been reduced and added to other months, especially February and August.

TI  - Oxylipins at intermediate larval stages of damselfly <i>Coenagrion hastulatum</i> as biochemical biomarkers for anthropogenic pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic pollution resulting from anthropogenic activities requires adequate environmental monitoring strategies in sentinel organisms. Thus, biochemical biomarkers have been used as early-warning tools of biological effects in aquatic organisms. However, before using these markers for environmental monitoring, knowledge about their developmental variation is vital. In this study, we assessed baseline levels and developmental variations of a group of potential biomarkers, oxylipins, during the lifespan of the Northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Effects of wastewater exposure on baseline levels were studied in a subset of damselflies to investigate the responsiveness due to anthropogenic pollution. Thirty-eight oxylipins deriving from four polyunsaturated fatty acids via two enzymatic pathways were detected in damselflies at three larval stages and in the adult form. Overall, oxylipin baseline levels showed developmental variation, which was lowest in the intermediate larval stages. Effects of exposure to wastewater effluent on oxylipin baseline levels were dependent on the life stage and were greatest in the early and intermediate larval stages. The study provides first insights into oxylipin profiles of damselflies at different stages of development and their developmental variation. Based on our results, we propose further strategies for incorporating oxylipins in damselfly larvae as biochemical markers for anthropogenic pollution.

TI  - Fluorescent Ag-In-S/ZnS Quantum Dots for Tumor Drainage Lymph Node Imaging In Vivo
T2  - ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor drainage lymph node imaging is crucial for oncological surgery, where the complete dissection of sentinel lymph nodes could largely prevent/delay recurrence. However, current commercially used imaging reagents distinguish the lymph nodes by staining them dark, which might be seriously interfered with by blood and other tissues. Herein, we reported fluorescent Ag-In-S/ZnS quantum dots (AIS/ZnS QDs) with red emission for fast tumor drainage lymph node imaging. AIS/ZnS QDs were synthesized by solution reaction and then dispersed in poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) for in vivo applications. AIS/ZnS QDs were well dispersed in water with hydrodynamic radii of 295 nm, suitable for lymph node imaging. The fluorescent imaging capability of AIS/ZnS QDs was first established after subcutaneous injection in mice. AIS/ZnS QDs could migrate to sentinel lymph nodes after the interdermal injection to the extremities. Tumor drainage lymph node imaging was achieved within 10 min upon intratumoral injection to H460 tumor-bearing mice. However, intravenous injection did not lead to tumor uptake of AIS/ZnS QDs. The fast and efficient migration of AIS/ZnS QDs into tumor drainage lymph nodes resulted in AIS/ZnS QDs being a high-performance imaging reagent for tumor drainage lymph nodes in vivo.

T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tracks survey of people who inject drugs (PWID) collected data in 14 sentinel sites across Canada (2017-2019). These findings describe the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C and associated risk behaviours among Indigenous participants.METHODS: Information regarding socio-demographics, social determinants of health, use of prevention services and testing, drug use, risk behaviours, and HIV and hepatitis C testing, care and treatment was collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Biological samples were tested for HIV, hepatitis C antibodies and hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA). Descriptive statistics were calculated and reviewed by an Indigenous-led advisory group using the Two-Eyed Seeing approach.RESULTS: Of the 2,383 participants, 997 were Indigenous (82.9% First Nations, 14.9% Metis, 2.2% Inuit). Over half (54.5%) were cisgender male and the average age was 38.9 years. A large proportion (84.0%) reported their mental health as "fair to excellent". High proportions experienced stigma and discrimination (90.2%) and physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse in childhood (87.5%) or with a sexual partner (78.6%). Use of a needle/syringe distribution program (90.5%) and testing for HIV (87.9%) and hepatitis C (87.8%) were high. Prevalence of HIV was 15.4% (78.2% were aware of infection status) and 36.4% were hepatitis C RNA-positive (49.4% were aware of infection status).CONCLUSION: High rates of HIV and hepatitis C were identified. Challenges in access to and maintenance of HIV and hepatitis C care and treatment were noted. This information informs harm reduction strategies, including the need to scale-up awareness of prophylaxis in a culturally relevant manner.

TI  - System or Process? A Meta-theoretical Reflection on the Nature of the Firm
T2  - SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper revisits the fundamental question of the nature of the firm by contrasting two philosophic worldviews suggested by process philosophy and the Luhmannian systems theory. Whereas the former worldview takes reality to be internally related, the latter ones underscores the tendency of social systems, such as firms, to disregard much of this interrelatedness. The productive tension between these worldviews suggests that the firm provides a context where systemic imperatives meet the rich concrete reality of human life. The role of the firm is to house those aspects of this reality that are too organic to be accommodated by the abstract "language of prices" corresponding, in institutional economics terms, to the reliance on market governance. The major examples of these aspects explored in the paper are dynamic capabilities and business ethics, both of which hold the potential to improve the firm's sustainability, both economic and social. The proposed contrast between the process-philosophic and systems-theoretic worldviews thus illuminates not only the nature of the firm but also the managerial relevance of corporate sustainability instruments.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover estimation in southern African rangelands using spectral mixture analysis and Google Earth Engine
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are under continuous threat of conversion and subsequent degradation, which has a detrimental impact on grassland productivity and grazing capacity, affecting the livestock industry. Fractional vegetation cover as indicator of grassland condition and productivity has been extensively researched, however, existing approaches and products are limited with respect to accessibility, affordability, applicability, and transferability. This study evaluated the use of publicly available satellite imagery, spectral mixture analysis and cloud geoprocessing technologies for dynamic, continuous, and accurate estimation of FVC for sustainable management. A linear spectral mixture model was developed, calibrated, and implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery. Model accuracy and spatial and temporal transferability were evaluated using existing benchmark products and field data. It was found that Sentinel-2 performed the best using a feature combination of the SWIR2 band and the NDVI, EVI, MSAVI2 and DBSI indices. Accuracies were further improved by dividing the woody and bare endmembers into subclasses. The approach proved both spatially and temporally transferable, thus this research provides a robust approach to FVC estimation using limited field data and open source remote sensing imagery. The combination of this research with further grassland productivity modelling could prove valuable for sustainable environmental and economical rangeland planning and management.

TI  - Molecular Lymph Node Staging with One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification and its Prognostic Value for Patients with Colon Cancer: The First Follow-up Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Molecular lymph node workup with one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a validated diagnostic adjunct in breast cancer and also appealing for colon cancer (CC) staging. This study, for the first time, evaluates the prognostic value of OSNA in CC. Patients and methods The retrospective study includes patients with stage I-III CC from three centres. Lymph nodes were investigated with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and with OSNA, applying a 250 copies/mu L threshold of CK19 mRNA. Diagnostic value of H&E and OSNA was assessed by survival analysis, sensitivity, specificity and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. Results Eighty-seven patients were included [mean follow-up 53.4 months (+/- 24.9)]. Disease recurrence occurred in 16.1% after 19.8 months (+/- 12.3). Staging with H&E independently predicted worse cancer-specific survival in multivariate analysis (HR = 10.77, 95% CI 1.07-108.7, p = 0.019) but not OSNA (HR = 3.08, 95% CI 0.26-36.07, p = 0.197). With cancer-specific death or recurrence as gold standard, H&E sensitivity was 46.7% (95% CI 21.3-73.4%) and specificity 84.7% (95% CI 74.3-92.1%). OSNA sensitivity and specificity were 60.0% (95% CI 32.3-83.7%) and 75.0% (95% CI 63.4-84.5%), respectively. Conclusions In patients with CC, OSNA does not add relevant prognostic value to conventional H&E contrasting findings in other cancers. Further studies should assess lower thresholds for OSNA (< 250 copies/mu L).

TI  - The role of weather conditions in COVID-19 transmission: A study of a global panel of 1236 regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is believed that weather conditions such as temperature and humidity have effects on COVID-19 transmission. However, these effects are not clear due to the limited observations and difficulties in separating impact of social distancing. COVID-19 data and social-economic features of 1236 regions in the world (1112 regions at the provincial level and 124 countries with the small land area) were collected. Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore the effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles. The result shows that temperature and relative humidity are negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to decrease the new daily case ratio. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the mitigation of the spreading of the virus. So, it deserves a dynamic government policy to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in winter. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impacts of land covers on stormwater runoff and urban development: A land use and parcel based regression approach
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive studies have shown that stormwater yield and quality in a city are heavily influenced by its land uses and land covers (LULC). However, the majority of these studies have been done at the major watershed levels using remote sensing data with only a few urban LULC types and at lower resolutions. This empirical study uses the City of Corvallis, Oregon in the U.S. as a case to establish robust regression relations between existing urban LULC and stormwater yield or quality at the land parcel level by environmental models and high-resolution spatial data. The environmental models are based on parcel-level hydrological conditions and spatial analysis to assess the watersheds and land parcels suitable for minimal stormwater yield and highest quality for single and mixed-use urban development scenarios containing buildings, roads & driveways, sidewalks & paths, parking lots and open spaces. This study not only can provide a novel approach for local jurisdictions to evaluate the impacts of public urban development plans on a built environment but can assist private property owners to estimate the impacts of their private development projects. In addition to analysing hydrological conditions and conducting green infrastructure design upon the completed urban land use plan in previous studies, the present work indicates the necessity and possibility to apply parcel-level hydrological spatial analysis to assist local land use planners and watershed managers in making informed decisions with regard to land development scenarios at the initial stage.

TI  - Estimating muddy intertidal flat slopes under varied coastal morphology using sequential satellite data and spatial analysis
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Muddy intertidal flats are important resources for coastal development activities, such as coastal shoal reclamation and mudflat cultivation. Understanding changes in intertidal flat topography is essential for intertidal zone development, management, and protection. As an essential topographic factor, the slope of an intertidal flat can effectively express profile morphology in the cross-shore direction, reflect topographic undulation in the long-shore direction, and be indicative of intertidal flat erosion and deposition. Previously, intertidal flat slopes have been estimated by the two-temporal average gradient (TTAG) method using two spatially separated waterlines derived from satellite remote sensing data and their relevant water elevations. However, this method does not adequately reflect the profile morphology of different coastline types, especially sinuous coastlines, and is highly sensitive to the selected waterlines. This study proposes an effective strategy for estimating slope considering not only the characteristics of the vertical terrain undulation but also the horizontal plane-form shape of the coastline. Using waterlines extracted from sequential satellite images and their corresponding tidal height information, the slopes were estimated utilizing a profile morphology discriminant inferential (PMDI) method on straight coasts and a digital elevation model (DEM) method on sinuous coasts. We obtained the following results: (a) for straight coasts, by judging the various shapes of the coastal profiles and curve-fitting separately, the PMDI method achieved significant improvements in accuracy and robustness of slope estimates compared to results obtained using the TTAG method; and (b) for sinuous coasts, the DEM-based method performed better for addressing the intersecting waterline issue and accurately retrieved the slope, although this accuracy is strongly dependent on the areal coverage of the DEM and the precision of the terrain inversion. Using this new paired methodology, we estimated that the average slope of the intertidal flats in the Mid-Jiangsu Province between the Sheyang Estuary, the Liangduo Estuary, and the Lianxing Port was 0.96 parts per thousand. In general, the slopes from north to south in this coastal area exhibited a steep-gentle-steep pattern, which was consistent with in situ observed data. We conclude that stratifying the coastlines according to their plane-form shapes and applying different methods to straight and sinuous coastlines can result in a more robust estimation of coastal slope for muddy intertidal flats than previous TTAG methods. This work demonstrates the utility of satellite-based remote sensing for retrieving critical coastal geomorphological information in dynamic terrains where in situ data are difficult to obtain.

TI  - Detection and prediction of lake degradation using landscape metrics and remote sensing dataset
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in natural ecosystems is considered essential to natural resource management. Despite the global importance of the lakes' quality monitoring, there is currently a research gap in the simultaneous predictive modeling of lakes' land-use changes and ecosystem measurements. In the present study for projecting the water bodies of lakes and their surrounding ecosystems, the land-use changes and the landscape analysis of different periods, i.e., 1987, 2002, 2018, and 2030, are studied using remote sensing data and various metrics. The trend of land-use and landscape changes is projected for 2030. The results indicate significant degradation of rangelands and forests due to the conversion to agriculture and construction and the declining trend of lakes' water body and their transformation to salt lake and salt lands. The increase of agricultural lands and the overuse of groundwater wells upstream of the lakes could be one of the reasons for this decline. Decreasing the lakes' water body and subsequently increasing salt lands are considered a severe threat to human health and the ecosystem services of the lakes. Besides, the dust generated by salt lands could also decrease crop yield in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of decadal shoreline changes along the Parnaiba Delta (NE Brazil) using satellite images and statistical methods
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated changes of the shoreline position in the Parnaiba River Delta (PRD), which is in an underdeveloped and sparsely populated area. The general behavior of the shoreline between 1984 and 2017 was analyzed using 12 Landsat satellite images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. DSAS applied statistical methods, such as Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) and End Point Rate (EPR), to define whether the shoreline was retreating or accreting. Data analysis revealed that, on a decadal time scale (33 years), 52% of the PRD shoreline retreated under erosional conditions, while 48% accreted. Accretion mainly occurred at the vicinities of the river mouth, especially eastward where the highest progradation rate was observed (maximum of 29 m/year). Shoreline retreat, up to 9 m/year, occurred predominantly in the western part of the PRD and away from the river mouth. However, changes of the general behavior of the shoreline (retreat/accretion) were observed at an interdecadal time scale, which were positively related to variations in river discharge. Variations of river discharge are directly dependent on the rainfall amount along the drainage basin that, in this region, is controlled by climatic conditions such as El Nino and La Nina. Therefore, the reduced river discharge observed between 19951999 and 2009-2012 (El Nino periods), was the major cause the triggered the observed coastal retreat (>6 m/ year) on PRD shoreline during these periods. Consequently, the variability of natural factors, such as river discharge and rainfall, are the main drivers of shoreline changes on PRD, since anthropogenic impacts have hitherto only marginal effects on the delta region and on the drainage basin of the Parnaiba river.<comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment

TI  - The African Church's application of anointing oil: An expression of Christian spirituality or a display of fetish ancestral religion?
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The content of Christian spirituality that made waves since the inception of the early church soon took on different contours as the faith got adapted to different gentile contexts. The expression of this faith, along with its liturgical symbolism and sacramental observances, is still gaining momentum in African Christianity. The emerging practice of the use of 'anointing oil' in its religious expression is receiving more attention than the Christ of the Gospel. In this article, we argue that against its primitive intent, the use of the 'anointing oil' by the African Church is a mere display of fetish ancestral religion that expresses its unique African traditional religious root rather than a true expression of Christian spirituality. Our thesis is framed on the basis that the manner in which some African churches apply the purported 'anointing oil' is discriminatory vis-a-vis its ancient understanding and purpose. In our attempt to address this damaging practice to true Christian spirituality, also standing as a huge challenge for pastoral theology, we undertook a careful historical-theological analysis of the extant biblical data and its contextual interpretation vis-a-vis its distortion today. We concluded that what pastoral theologians have to deal with within the Christian community in Africa is offering the right biblical perspective against the distorted mode of the application of the contemporary purported 'anointing oil' that is falsely projecting the Christian faith and belief in a bad light.Contribution: The application of the anointing oil in contemporary Christian religion in Africa is, to say the least, not an inherent textually prescribed requisite criterion for Christian spirituality, but merely an outburst of fetish ancestral religious worldview that stands contra the hermeneutics of the biblical text and its ancient tradition. That no Old Testament prophet, not even Jesus nor Paul, mentioned the subject, makes its contemporary application textually and theologically suspect, and therefore, heretically infectious for the spiritual health of the community of faith. These insights sit quite well with the textual hermeneutics within the mainline transdisciplinary religious and mu Itidisplinaly theological perspective of this journal.

TI  - Improving the representation of cropland sites in the Community Land Model (CLM) version 5.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The incorporation of a comprehensive crop module in land surface models offers the possibility to study the effect of agricultural land use and land management changes on the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. It may help to improve the simulation of biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes on regional and global scales in the framework of climate and land use change. In this study, the performance of the crop module of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) was evaluated at point scale with site-specific field data focusing on the simulation of seasonal and inter-annual variations in crop growth, planting and harvesting cycles, and crop yields, as well as water, energy, and carbon fluxes. In order to better represent agricultural sites, the model was modified by (1) implementing the winter wheat subroutines following Lu et al. (2017) in CLM5; (2) implementing plant-specific parameters for sugar beet, potatoes, and winter wheat, thereby adding the two crop functional types (CFTs) for sugar beet and potatoes to the list of actively managed crops in CLM5; and (3) introducing a cover-cropping subroutine that allows multiple crop types on the same column within 1 year. The latter modification allows the simulation of cropping during winter months before usual cash crop planting begins in spring, which is an agricultural management technique with a long history that is regaining popularity as it reduces erosion and improves soil health and carbon storage and is commonly used in the regions evaluated in this study. We compared simulation re- sults with field data and found that both the new crop-specific parameterization and the winter wheat subroutines led to a significant simulation improvement in terms of energy fluxes (root-mean-square error, RMSE, reduction for latent and sensible heat by up to 57 % and 59 %, respectively), leaf area index (LAI), net ecosystem exchange, and crop yield (up to 87 % improvement in winter wheat yield prediction) compared with default model results. The cover-cropping subroutine yielded a substantial improvement in representation of field conditions after harvest of the main cash crop (winter season) in terms of LAI magnitudes, seasonal cycle of LAI, and latent heat flux (reduction of wintertime RMSE for latent heat flux by 42 %). Our modifications significantly improved model simulations and should therefore be applied in future studies with CLM5 to improve regional yield predictions and to better understand large-scale impacts of agricultural management on carbon, water, and energy fluxes.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present the results of satellite monitoring of wildfires in Australia for the period of 2001-2020. Annual and monthly dynamics of wildfire areas and CO and CO2 carbon-bearing trace gas emissions from wildfires have been analyzed for the whole territory of Australia based on satellite data. It was found that anomalous fires occurred in the territory of New South Wales during the 2019-2020 fire season. Values of burned-out areas exceeded the values of previous years 3.5-25.8-fold. Annual mean volumes of carbon-bearing gas emissions in this region exceeded the values of previous years 4-59-fold for carbon monoxide CO and 4.6-50-fold for carbon dioxide CO2. The spatial distribution of the excess concentrations of CO from wildfires in New South Wales was recorded according to the monthly mean data of the AIRS instrument (Aqua satellite). At the same time, the excess of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was estimated using the TANSO-FTS (GOSAT satellite) data. It was demonstrated that an anomalously high number of fires in this state of Australia was caused by extreme drought associated with abnormally high surface temperatures, low rainfall and humidity which created conditions for intense fires and emissions of carbon-bearing gases associated with the combustion of eucalyptus and tropical rain forests prevailing in this region.

TI  - Groundwater recharge to a structurally complex aquifer system on the island of Tobago (Republic of Trinidad and Tobago)
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Trinidad and Tobago is a developing two-island nation in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean. Tobago is the smaller island and has small highly heterogeneous aquifers composed of igneous and metamorphic crystalline rock with strong structural controls on the spatial distribution of permeability. Hydrogeologic analyses of the water budget and groundwater production suggest that portions of the island are underlain by prolific fractured-rock aquifer systems. This study quantifies the amount and spatial distribution of recharge, as well as the fraction of recharge captured by groundwater pumping, using historical data, new field data, remote sensing data, multiple storage quantification methods and stable isotope analysis. Despite extensive freshwater withdrawals, groundwater production reaches only similar to 10% of annual groundwater recharge. Groundwater capture zones are created using a first-order hydrologic balance approach and with backward particle tracking in a steady-state groundwater model. Both approaches to generating capture zones suggest that many wells capture water from outside their topographic watershed. The location of sustainable, high yield, fresh potable groundwater wells less than 1 km from the coast, that have fractured bedrock intakes well below sea level, supports the concept of a rigorous and active groundwater flow system. Understanding the hydrogeology of small bedrock island aquifers is critical to evaluating groundwater resources, especially in the Caribbean where there is strong seasonality in precipitation, finite surface-water storage and increases in potable water demand.

TI  - Exploring the Cloud Top Phase Partitioning in Different Cloud Types Using Active and Passive Satellite Sensors
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the largest uncertainties in numerical weather prediction and climate models is the representation of mixed-phase clouds. With the aim of understanding how the supercooled liquid fraction (SLF) in clouds with temperature from -40 degrees C to 0 degrees C is related to temperature, geographical location, and cloud type, our analysis contains a comparison of four satellite-based datasets (one derived from active and three from passive satellite sensors), and focuses on SLF distribution near-globally, but also stratified by latitude and continental/maritime regions. Despite the warm bias in cloud top temperature of the passive sensor compared to the active sensor and the phase mismatch in collocated data, all datasets indicate, at the same height-level, an increase of SLF with cloud optical thickness, and generally larger SLF in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere (up to about 20% difference), with the exception of continental low-level clouds, for which the opposite is true.Plain Language Summary In mixed-phase clouds, hydrometeors consisting of ice and supercooled liquid water (i.e., water below 0 degrees C) can exist simultaneously. In the mixed-phase temperature range (-40 degrees C to 0 degrees C), ice-nucleating particles (e.g., mineral dusts, biological aerosol particles) are needed for glaciation to be possible. The partitioning into liquid and ice depends not only on the ice-nucleating particles, but also, for example, on cloud dynamics and ice multiplication processes, influencing in turn the lifetime and the precipitation type of these clouds, and the Earth-atmosphere energy balance locally and globally. In this study, we show ice and liquid partitioning for different cloud types, comparing four satellite-based datasets. This allows us to identify robustly their common trends despite their differences. Our results show on average less ice in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere when considering all clouds together, and that the larger the cloud optical thickness, the less ice when treating the cloud types separately. The partitioning of cloud types over sea and over land in both hemispheres show less ice in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere for high-level and mid-level clouds, but the opposite for low-level clouds over land. This might be due to differences in aerosol composition and distribution.Key Points.Despite phase and temperature mismatches, the retrievals based on passive and active satellite sensors qualitatively agree on the followingSupercooled liquid fraction is larger in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, except for continental low-level cloudsIn clouds with temperatures from -40 degrees C to 0 degrees C at the same height-level, supercooled liquid fraction increases with cloud optical thickness

TI  - Evolution of debris cover on glaciers of the Eastern Alps, Austria, between 1996 and 2015
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris cover on glaciers is an important component of glacial systems as it influences climate-glacier dynamics and thus the lifespan of glaciers. Increasing air temperatures, permafrost thaw and rock faces freshly exposed by glacier downwasting in accumulation zones result in increased rockfall activity and debris input. In the ablation zone, negative mass balances result in an enhanced melt-out of englacial debris. Glacier debris cover thus represents a clear signal of climate warming in mountain areas. To assess the temporal development of debris on glaciers of the Eastern Alps, Austria, we mapped debris cover on 255 glaciers using Landsat data at three time steps. We applied a ratio-based threshold classification technique and analysed glacier catchment characteristics to understand debris sources better. Across the Austrian Alps, debris cover increased by more than 10% between 1996 and 2015 while glaciers retreated in response to climate warming. Debris cover distribution shows significant regional variability, with some mountain ranges being characterised by mean debris cover on glaciers of up to 75%. We also observed a general rise of the mean elevation of debris cover on glaciers in Austria. The debris cover distribution and dynamics are highly variable due to topographic, lithological and structural settings that determine the amount of debris delivered to and stored in the glacier system. Despite strong variation in debris cover, all glaciers investigated melted at increasing rates. We conclude that the retarding effects of debris cover on the mass balance and melt rate of Austrian glaciers is strongly subdued compared with other mountain areas. The study indicates that, if this trend continues, many glaciers in Austria may become fully debris covered. However, since debris cover seems to have little impact on melt rates, this would not lead to prolonged existence of debris-covered ice compared with clean ice glaciers.

AB  - In this contribution, we seek to identify points of contact between the conceptions about space, time, and Cosmos, carried out by thinkers and scientists throughout history, and the corresponding cosmogonic view of the Inka culture. We conclude that a proper understanding and interpretation of the Inka legacy in the fields of astronomy and archeoastronomy can only be carried out properly when inserted in the context of the Inka culture and its worldview.

TI  - Development of spontaneous vegetation on reclaimed land in Singapore measured by NDVI
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Population and economic growth in Asia has led to increased urbanisation. Urbanisation has many detrimental impacts on ecosystems, especially when expansion is unplanned. Singapore is a city-state that has grown rapidly since independence, both in population and land area. However, Singapore aims to develop as a 'City in Nature', and urban greenery is integral to the landscape. While clearing some areas of forest for urban sprawl, Singapore has also reclaimed land from the sea to expand its coastline. Reclaimed land is usually designated for future urban development, but must first be left for many years to stabilise. During the period of stabilisation, pioneer plant species establish, growing into novel forest communities. The rate of this spontaneous vegetation development has not been quantified. This study tracks the temporal trends of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as a proxy of vegetation maturity, on reclaimed land sensed using LANDSAT images. Google Earth Engine was used to mosaic cloud-free annual LANDSAT images of Singapore from 1988 to 2015. Singapore's median NDVI increased by 0.15 from 0.47 to 0.62 over the study period, while its land area grew by 71 km(2). Five reclaimed sites with spontaneous vegetation development showed variable vegetation covers, ranging from 6% to 43% vegetated cover in 2015. On average, spontaneous vegetation takes 16.9 years to develop to a maturity of 0.7 NDVI, but this development is not linear and follows a quadratic trajectory. Patches of spontaneous vegetation on isolated reclaimed lands are unlikely to remain forever since they are in areas slated for future development. In the years that these patches exist, they have potential to increase urban greenery, support biodiversity, and provide a host of ecosystem services. With this knowledge on spontaneous vegetation development trajectories, urban planners can harness the resource when planning future developments.

TI  - Winter surface salinity in the northeastern Gulf of Maine from five years of SMAP satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wintertime freshwater transport into the Gulf of Maine (GoM) is typically controlled by a seasonal velocity increase in the fresh upstream Nova Scotia Current (NSC). Repeat satellite observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission have mapped significant GoM surface salinity anomalies in four of five recent winters. These satellite data are used in combination with Jordan basin buoy and model datasets to investigate the likelihood that variable wind-forcing of the NSC contributed to these anomalies. This stems from regional ocean circulation studies suggesting that strengthening of alongshore southwesterly winds on the Scotian shelf weakens NSC transport into the GoM, while cross-shore southeasterly winds may also contribute to NSC weakening, and vice versa. A 17-year time series analysis of GoM buoy and satellite data shows that near-surface salinity in the eastern GoM can indeed be modulated by both alongshore and cross-shore winds through their impact on the NSC. The NSC geostrophic current modulation correlates with buoy-observed surface salinity anomalies when using a one month advective lead time. For a shorter 5-year period, a SMAP-derived salinity anomaly index in the eastern GoM indicates a similar relation to NSC variation and also correlates with Scotian Shelf wind anomalies. The relationships between winter wind and NSC transport variability are confirmed using output from a 19-year high resolution global ocean simulation. Attribution of these local wind anomalies to basin-scale atmospheric patterns shows that most years with strong winter GoM freshening coincide with weakening of a North Atlantic Oscillation-like wind pattern. But its reversals do not always correspond with a saline GoM. This contrast suggests that wind forcing more directly controls fresh winter GoM anomalies but not salty. Instead, they are partly due to density-driven advection from neighboring warm and saline Atlantic slope water including episodic Gulf Stream instabilities.

TI  - Improved BioGents® Sentinel trap with heat (BGSH) for outdoor collections of<i> Anopheline</i> species in Burkina Faso and Mali, West Africa
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSince the late 1990s, malaria control programmes have relied extensively on mass bednet distribution and indoor residual spraying. Both interventions use pesticides and target mosquitoes coming indoors either to feed or to rest. Unfortunately, these intensified vector control campaigns have resulted in mosquito populations with high levels of resistance to most of the chemical compounds used against them and which are increasingly exophagic and exophillic, hence difficult to monitor indoors. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel tools to sample outdoor anopheline populations for monitoring interventions and disease surveillance programmes.MethodologiesIn this study, we tested several modifications and configurations of the BioGents (R) Sentinel (BGS) trap, designed with the aim to increase its efficacy for sampling malaria vector species. Traps were used with chemical attractants and CO2, and the impacts of trap position, trap colour contrast combination and the addition of a heat source were tested in two studies conducted in the Sudano-Sahelian region of Burkina Faso and Mali.ResultsThe results show that of all the configurations tested, the addition of a heat source to the BGS trap with the original colour combination and an upward positioning resulted in a 1.8- and 5.9-fold increase in host-seeking Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) females in the experiments performed in Burkina Faso and Mali, respectively. BGS with heat traps, referred to as BGSH traps, captured An. gambiae (s.l.), An. pharoensis, An. coustani, Culex and Mansonia spp. Importantly, the results suggest that their efficacy does not depend on the close proximity of nearby hosts in houses.ConclusionsThe results suggest that BGSH traps can be an effective scalable tool for sampling outdoor anopheline vector populations. Further developments enabling CO2 and heat generation for longer periods of time would further improve the trap's versatility for large-scale surveillance programmes.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Intraoperative Touch Imprint Cytology for the Diagnosis of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis of Breast Cancer: Comparison With Intraoperative Frozen Section Evaluation
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe intraoperative frozen section is a recommended method to detect breast cancer metastasis to axillary sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs); however, frozen section is not widely available and requires an experienced staff. Alternatively, touch imprint cytology (TIC) is a simple and cost-effective technique to detect metastasis. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of TIC for detecting SLN metastasis and compared it with intraoperative frozen section evaluation.MethodologyA retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Histopathology, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, for a duration of two years. A total of 114 patients undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer were included in the study. All patients had clinically and radiologically negative axillary lymph nodes. SLN sampling was done using radioactive dye and sent for intraoperative consultation. The SLNs were sliced at 4-mm intervals and two TIC slides and three step-levels for frozen section were prepared, and the results were compared with final (paraffin) section histology.ResultsThe sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of TIC was 83.7%, 98.5%, and 92.1%, respectively. Alternatively, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of frozen section was 93.9%, 100%, and 97.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of TIC and frozen section for detecting micrometastasis was 14.3% and 57.1%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 90.3% and 95.8%, respectively. Alternatively, with respect to macrometastasis, the sensitivity and specificity of TIC were 95.2% and 98.5%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of frozen section were 100%.ConclusionTIC is a quick and effective technique for detecting breast cancer metastasis in axillary SLNs. Although frozen section had an overall higher sensitivity than TIC, the sensitivity of TIC for detecting macrometastasis was comparable to the frozen section. Therefore, we conclude that TIC is a good alternative to the frozen section in facilities where the frozen section is not available.

TI  - Urban host plant utilisation by the invasive <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae) in northern Utah
T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive and highly polyphagous brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), is a severe agricultural and urban nuisance pest in North America. Since its initial invasion into Utah in 2012, H. halys has become well established in urban and suburban locations along the western foothills of the Wasatch Front in northern Utah. Bordering the Great Basin Desert, this area is unique from other North American locations with H. halys due to its high elevation (> 1200 m), aridity (30-year mean RH = 53.1%; dew point = -1.9 degrees C) and extreme temperatures (the 30-year mean minimum and maximum in January and July in Salt Lake City range from -3.1 to 3.6 degrees C and 20.3 to 32.4 degrees C, respectively). To document which plant species harbour H. halys, surveys were conducted in 17 urban/suburban sites in four counties during 2017 and 2018. Halyomorpha halys was more abundant in Salt Lake and Utah counties than in the more northern counties of Davis and Weber and was found on 53 plant species, nine of which hosted two or more developmental stages in both years. The majority of hosts were in the families Fabaceae, Rosaceae and Sapindaceae. Northern catalpa, Catalpa speciosa (Warder), was the most consistent host, supporting a majority of H. halys detections in all life stages; thus we identify it as a sentinel host. Twenty-nine species were novel hosts for H. halys in North America; of these, Acer ginnalaMaxim, Populus tremuloides Michx., Prunus armeniaca X domestica 'Flavor King' and Prunus virginiana 'Schubert' were detected with two or more life stages of H. halys in both years. Peak populations of H. halys occurred from mid-June to midSeptember. We describe H. halys plant utilisation by life stage and seasonal period to aid future detection and management of this invasive insect in the greater Intermountain West region.

TI  - Analysing the influence of a large flood on eastern redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) distribution along the Missouri River using remote-sensing techniques
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River floodplains are among the world's most altered ecosystems due to flow regulation by dams, development, and agriculture. Dam construction and flow regulation along the Missouri River have reduced flooding, modified geomorphic processes and altered floodplain vegetation. Since the commencement of flow regulation, eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.), which is native to upland areas, has invaded the understorey of cottonwood (Populus deltoides) forests along the Missouri River. A major flood in 2011, however, resulted in a significant die-off of redcedar within the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR), South Dakota, and Nebraska, USA. The objectives of this study were to map and analyse the effects of the 2011 flood and soil drainage classes on redcedar distribution within the MNRR. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from winter scenes of Landsat satellite imagery was used to map the canopy cover of redcedar on pre- and post-flood dates. Logistic regression was used to analyse the effects of soil drainage and flooding status (flooded or non-flooded) on transitions between high (>20%) and low (<20%) canopy cover classes of redcedar. The odds of redcedar decline (from high to low canopy cover) were significantly greater in areas that flooded in 2011, and the odds of redcedar increase (low to high canopy cover) were greater on non-flooded surfaces with well-drained soils. This study produces evidence that large floods are important for constraining redcedar spread in floodplain habitats. In addition, soil drainage affects redcedar survival and spread within the study area, with colonization favoured on well-drained soils.

TI  - Reconsidering LINE-1's role in cancer: does LINE-1 function as a reporter detecting early cancer-associated epigenetic signatures?
T2  - EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only autonomously active retrotransposon in humans. While L1 has been implicated in several pathologies and the aging process, I present a model which challenges an understanding of L1 as predominantly antagonistic to human health. I hypothesize that L1 serves as a reporter in an early cancer alert system: a tripwire strung throughout the genome poised to trigger p53 and a type I interferon (IFN-1) response when the epigenetic landscape portends cancer. Cell proliferation and a shift to aerobic glycolysis cause dramatic changes in the epigenome which are permissive to L1's escape from suppression. L1 has several properties which make it particularly apt to fulfill this hypothesized sentinel function. Being present in many copies spread throughout the genome allows it to monitor many regions for epigenetic instability and renders it robust to deactivation by mutation. This proposed cancer alert system would alter the cancer cell fitness landscape discouraging the use of growth-favoring aerobic glycolysis by threatening the activation of tumor-suppressive mechanisms. It also imposes costs on a strategy of non-specific global transcriptional derepression aimed at activating oncogenes. Erroneous activations of this system are predicted to increase the rate of aging, suggesting this represents a case of antagonistic pleiotropy trading prolonged youth for cancer prevention. More research is needed to assess this model.Lay summary: During carcinogenesis the epigenome is remodeled by the Warburg effect and cellular proliferation. These processes globally relax chromatin. This epigenetic environment is permissive to the retrotransposon long interspersed nuclear element-1's (LINE-1 or L1) escape from suppression. I hypothesize and present evidence for the notion that L1 has been co-opted to serve as a reporter in an early cancer alert system, poised to trigger tumor suppressive mechanisms when the epigenetic landscape portends cancer. This hypothesis describes a potentially major means by which transformation is thwarted early on.

TI  - Subcultural, ideological, and valence-based differences in caregiver reminiscing functions
T2  - MEMORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have identified cultural differences in caregiver beliefs about the functions of parent-child reminiscing. However, this work has largely been limited to comparisons between Asian or Asian American and European American caregivers discussing autobiographical events, broadly. In the present study, 365 caregivers of 3- to 12-year-old children from four U.S. subcultures (African, Asian, European, and Hispanic/LatinX) reported about the functions of discussing positive and negative past events with their child, and about their collectivist values. Overall, positive events were discussed more often than negative events and all reminiscing functions were endorsed more strongly for positive events. European Americans endorsed directive functions for positive events least of the three primary functions, and endorsed them less than the other three subcultural groups. All four subculture groups endorsed directive functions equally and more strongly than other functions when discussing negative events. More collectivist attitudes predicted stronger endorsement of all conversation functions except directive functions for negative events. This research is poised to expand our understanding of how caregivers from different subcultural groups, and with different culture-based values, may attempt to shape their children's worldview through reminiscing and how the functions caregivers emphasise shift depending on the valence of the event under discussion.

M3  - Article
AB  - The OECD's PISA exercise has by now been widely critiqued. Whilst we agree with most concerns, we begin with the assumption that PISA will remain an enduring and powerful feature of the global educational landscape. Even if the PISA test itself were discontinued, a similar large-scale quantitative assessment exercise would soon arise to take its place. As such, we focus herein on strategies for rearticulating ILSAs such as PISA: the creative use of data to shift the exercise away from dissemination of one dominant worldview towards the recognition of alternatives. To do this, we discuss the approach and findings from our recent papers, and then suggest future directions. Rather than mere accommodation, re-articulation underscores an approach to critique that is generative for theory and practice, one that extends of the horizon of possibility beyond culturally saturated notions of 'good' education.

TI  - The optical river bathymetry toolkit
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed information on water depth is essential for many applications in river research and management and, under certain circumstances, can be inferred from remotely sensed data. Although fluvial remote sensing has emerged as a rapidly developing subdiscipline of the riverine sciences, more widespread adoption of these techniques has been hindered by a lack of accessible software. The Optical River Bathymetry Toolkit (ORByT) fills this void by providing a standalone package for mapping water depth from passive optical image data. The ORByT interface enables end users to import images and field-based depth measurements, create and refine water masks, and perform spectrally based depth retrieval via an Optimal Band Ratio Analysis algorithm. The resulting bathymetric map can be exported as an image file, point cloud, and/or cross section; a thorough accuracy assessment also is incorporated into the workflow. In addition, image-derived depth estimates can be subtracted from water surface elevations to obtain bed elevations suitable for input to a hydrodynamic model. Potential users of ORByT must bear in mind the inherent limitations of passive optical remote sensing: reliable bathymetry can only be inferred in clear-flowing, shallow streams; this approach is not appropriate for more turbid, deeper rivers.

TI  - Landsat-8 and Gaofen-1 image-based inversion method for the downscaled land surface temperature of rare earth mining areas
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is an important indicator for characterizing the habitat conditions and ecological disturbances of ion-adsorbed rare earth mining areas. Because the ions in an ion-adsorbed type rare earth mining area are scattered and the area of a single mining site is small, it is important to obtain practical surface temperature data for monitoring the ecological environment of the area. In this study, Landsat-8 and Gaofen-1(GF-1) satellite images were used as data sources. In view of the characteristics of rare earth mining areas, and the thermal infrared data were used to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST), a land surface temperature downscaling model TDFSU based on remote sensing data fusion and mixed pixel decomposition is proposed. ultimately verifying the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of the downscaled results. The results show that the model can effectively improve the spatial resolution of surface temperature and reflect the spatial differences of surface temperature. This model has high feasibility and applicability in ionic rare earth mining areas.

T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused viral pneumonia worldwide, posing a major threat to international health. Our study reports that city lockdown is an effective way to reduce the number of new cases and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration can be used as an environmental lockdown indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown measures. The airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas since the lockdown. The total number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point about two weeks since the lockdown and could be reduced by about 50% within 30 days of the lockdown. The stricter lockdown will help newly confirmed cases to decline earlier and more rapidly, and at the same time, the reduction rate of NO2 concentration will increase. Our research results show that NO2 satellite observations can help decision makers effectively monitor and manage non-pharmaceutical interventions in the epidemic.Plain Language Summary Since governments adopted epidemic control measures, NO2 levels in most of the affected regions dropped significantly, and NO2 satellite data can be used as an environmental indicator of lockdown and can help explain the implementation of government non-pharmaceutical interventions.Key Points.The global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areasThe total number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point about two weeks after the lockdownNO2 satellite measurement can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator

AB  - Recent developments in remote sensing are enabling automatic, high resolution, and non-destructive survey of agriculture fields, providing the key basis for advancing plant breeding. Among the used remote sensing modalities, LiDAR has attracted wide attention for its ability to directly provide accurate 3D information. Despite the increasing utilization of LiDAR technology in phenotyping, there is still a lack of effective quality control strategies, in particular, quality control of LiDAR data collected on a multi-temporal basis. This study proposes a targetless framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data quality control and crop characterization in mechanized agricultural fields. Features extracted from the fields ? terrain patches and row/alley locations ? are utilized for evaluating the vertical and planimetric relative accuracy of the point clouds. Row/alley locations in the field are automatically identified from the point clouds based on the assumption that higher point density and/or higher elevation correspond to plant locations. The performance of the proposed quality control strategies is evaluated using multi-temporal datasets collected in agricultural fields of different sizes, orientation, crops, and growth stages. The result shows that the net vertical and planimetric discrepancies between multi-temporal point clouds are ?3 cm and ?8 cm, respectively. While the former reflects the actual accuracy of the point clouds, the latter is a combined effect of the LiDAR point cloud accuracy, rasterization artifacts, crop type, growth pattern, and wind condition during data acquisition. In terms of row and alley detection, the result shows that the proposed strategy achieves high performance and can deal with different planting orientation, crop types, growth stages, canopy cover, and planting density. In conclusion, this study presents a quality control framework for multi-temporal LiDAR data. Moreover, the row and alley detection leads to automated extraction of plots, and hence facilitates the use of remotely sensed data for automated phenotyping.

TI  - Calibration of the space-borne microwave humidity sounder based on real-time thermal emission from lunar surface
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration is a key issue for quantitative application of meteorological satellite data. The complex space environment may cause many uncertainties in data calibration. A highly stable and reliable calibrator in flight is needed. Because the Moon has no atmosphere and no environmental variation, the physical and chemical properties of its surface are stable in the long term. The Moon might be an ideal candidate for in-flight thermal calibration. In advanced satellite-borne microwave remote sensing such as NOAA-18, the deep space view (DSV) of the microwave humidity sounder (MHS) has viewed the Moon many times every year. Using the thermal-physical properties of the lunar regolith derived from the Diviner infrared (IR) brightness temperature (TB) data, we solve the one-dimensional heat conduction equation to obtain the temperature profile of the near side of the lunar regolith medium. The loss tangents of the regolith medium are retrieved from microwave TB data of the Chinese satellite Chang'e-2. The integrated radiative transfer equation is used to simulate the weighted disk-average TB of the lunar surface for the MHS channels at 89, 157, and 183 GHz for the year 2011. The Moon is taken as an extended circular target. The simulated TBs are used to correct the full width at half maximum (FWHM) fitted with the MHS counts. We analyze the influences of the distance between the satellite and the Moon, the lunar phase angle, and the FWHM of the radiometer on the inverted FWHM. The corrected TB data are compared with the simulation. This paper presents a new method for thermal calibration of spaceborne in-flight microwave and millimeter-wave radiometers with the weighted disk-average TB of the lunar surface.

TI  - Methane retrieved from TROPOMI: improvement of the data product and validation of the first 2 years of measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5-P) satellite provides methane (CH4) measurements with high accuracy and exceptional temporal and spatial resolution and sampling. TROPOMI CH4 measurements are highly valuable to constrain emissions inventories and for trend analysis, with strict requirements on the data quality. This study describes the improvements that we have implemented to retrieve CH4 from TROPOMI using the RemoTeC full-physics algorithm. The updated retrieval algorithm features a constant regularization scheme of the inversion that stabilizes the retrieval and yields less scatter in the data and includes a higher resolution surface altitude database. We have tested the impact of three state-of-the-art molecular spectroscopic databases (HITRAN 2008, HITRAN 2016 and Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - Improved Atmospheric Spectroscopy Databases SEOM-IAS) and found that SEOM-IAS provides the best fitting results. The most relevant update in the TROPOMI XCH4 data product is the implementation of an a posteriori correction fully independent of any reference data that is more accurate and corrects for the underestimation at low surface albedo scenes and the overestimation at high surface albedo scenes. After applying the correction, the albedo dependence is removed to a large extent in the TROPOMI versus satellite (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite - GOSAT) and TROPOMI versus ground-based observations (Total Carbon Column Observing Network - TCCON) comparison, which is an independent verification of the correction scheme. We validate 2 years of TROPOMI CH4 data that show the good agreement of the updated TROPOMI CH4 with TCCON (-3.4 +/- 5.6 ppb) and GOSAT (-10.3 +/- 16.8 ppb) (mean bias and standard deviation). Low- and high-albedo scenes as well as snow-covered scenes are the most challenging for the CH(4 )retrieval algorithm, and although the a posteriori correction accounts for most of the bias, there is a need to further investigate the underlying cause.

TI  - Association of Axillary Lymph Node Evaluation With Survival in Women Aged 70 Years or Older With Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSurvival in elderly patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has not been specifically analyzed. This study aimed to explore the association between different types of axillary lymph node (ALN) evaluations and survival of elderly breast cancer patients.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted of invasive ductal breast cancer patients 70 years and older in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016). Analyses were performed to compare the characteristics and survival outcomes of patients who received surgical lymph node dissection and those who did not. Breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival were compared by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) methods to account for selection bias from covariate imbalance.ResultsOf the 75,950 patients analyzed, patients without ALN evaluation had a significantly worse prognosis, while there was no significant difference for BCSS between using a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after adjustment for known covariates [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.991, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.925-1.062, p = 0.800]. In the stratification analyses after PSM, the ALND did not show a significant BCSS advantage compared with SLNB in any subgroups except for the pN1 stage or above. Furthermore, after PSM of the pN1 stage patients, SLNB was associated with a significantly worse BCSS in hormone receptor negative (HR-) patients (HR = 1.536, 95%CI = 1.213-1.946, p < 0.001), but not in the hormone receptor positive (HR+) group (HR = 1.150, 95%CI = 0.986-1.340, p = 0.075).ConclusionIn our study, ALND does not yield superior survival compared with SLNB for elderly patients with pN1 stage HR+ breast cancer. Although our findings are limited by the bias associated with retrospective study design, we believe that in the absence of results from randomized clinical trials, our findings should be considered when recommending the omission of ALND for elderly breast cancer patients.

TI  - Corporate social responsibility and firms' financial performance: a multi-level serial analysis underpinning social identity theory
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to investigate how firms' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perception and disclosure derive accounting, market, and perception-based Firms' Financial Performance (FFP) through the serial mediation of individual-level organizational identification (OID) and employees' innovative job performance (EIJP). Philosophically, this research comes under the beliefs or worldview of postpositivism and employed a quantitative research design. And thus, the approach to theory development is deductive. Multi-method, multi-source and multilevel data with temporal breaks are collected from 60 manufacturing firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE). Primary data are collected by following the survey strategy and by conducting multiple surveys. While the secondary data are collected from the annual and sustainability reports published by selected firms on their official websites. This research found the serial mediation of OID and employees' innovative job performance on the CSR-FFP relationship. Our results will assist the management of the firms to understand the strategic implications of their CSR initiatives. In particular, this research contributed to understand why CSR is viewed to have strategic importance for the firms and how social identity theory (SIT) might be utilized in such endeavors.

TI  - The fate of rangelands: Revealing past and predicting future land-cover transitions from 1985 to 2036 in the drylands of Central Iran
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land serves as a vital production resource, and therefore land planning plays an important role in sustainable land-use design. Iran includes large areas of the world's drylands, many of which are used as rangelands, and where the population has increased by 60% from 1985 to 2016. Further population increase in Iran would probably require more land resources to be allocated for human needs. However, the pace and patterns of these changes remain unclear. The aim of this study was to map land-cover change from 1985 to 2016 and predict future land-cover change in the Zayandehrood ecologic sub-basins of Central Iran. By using multiseasonal LANDSAT imagery, we mapped land-cover change with a Random Forest classifier for 1985, 1998, and 2016 with an overall accuracy of 80% for each period. Classification results revealed that from 1985 to 2016 residential areas doubled and industrial areas increased at the expense of rangelands. Our study also revealed cropland expansion at the expense of rangelands, cropland abandonment, and contraction of croplands due to residential and industrial development. Prediction of changes by 2036 with a multilayer perceptron neural network and Markov chain analysis showed further expansion of industries and residencies, particularly near the Ghamashlu Wildlife Refuge. Despite the partial restoration of rangelands in some parts of the world, our study provides evidence of ongoing rangeland degradation in Iran due to conversion to other land uses. Therefore, the study underscores the importance of sustainable land management of already cultivated areas and the development of strategies for the protection of global rangelands.

TI  - Incidence and severity of pertussis hospitalisations in infants aged less than 1 year in 37 hospitals of six EU/EEA countries, results of PERTINENT sentinel pilot surveillance system, December 2015 to December 2018
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: PERTINENT is a pilot active surveillance systaem of infants hospitalised with pertussis in six European Union/European Economic Area countries (37 hospitals, seven sites). Aim: This observational study aimed to estimate annual pertussis incidence per site from 2016 to 2018 and respective trends between 2017 and 2018. Pertussis cases were described, including their severity. Methods: We developed a generic protocol and laboratory guidelines to harmonise practices across sites. Cases were hospitalised infants testing positive for Bordetella pertussis by PCR or culture. Sites collected demographic, clinical, laboratory data, vaccination status, and risk/protective factors. We estimated sites' annual incidences by dividing case numbers by the catchment populations. Results: From December 2015 to December 2018, we identified 469 cases (247 males; 53%). The median age, birthweight and gestational age were 2.5 months (range: 0-11.6; interquartile range (IQR): 2.5), 3,280g (range: 700-4,925; IQR: 720 and 39 weeks (range: 25-42; IQR: 2), respectively. Thirty cases (6%) had atypical presentation either with cough or cyanosis only or with absence of pertussis-like symptoms. Of 330 cases with information, 83 (25%) were admitted to intensive care units including five deceased infants too young to be vaccinated. Incidence rate ratios between 2018 and 2017 were 1.43 in Czech Republic (p = 0.468), 0.25 in Catalonia (p = 0.002), 0.71 in France (p = 0.034), 0.14 in Ireland (p=0.002), 0.63 in Italy (p--= 0.053), 0.21 in Navarra (p = 0.148) and zero in Norway. Conclusions: Incidence appeared to decrease between 2017 and 2018 in all but one site. Enhanced surveillance of hospitalised pertussis in Europe is essential to monitor pertussis epidemiology and disease burden.

TI  - Detecting Resource Limitation in a Large Herbivore Population Is Enhanced With Measures of Nutritional Condition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Resource limitation at the population level is a function of forage quality and its abundance relative to its per capita availability, which in turn, determines nutritional condition of individuals. Effects of resource limitation on population dynamics in ungulates often occur through predictable and sequential changes in vital rates, which can enable assessments of how resource limitation influences population growth. We tested theoretical predictions of bottom-up (i.e., resource limitation) forcing on moose (Alces alces) through the lens of vital rates by quantifying the relative influence of intrinsic measures of nutritional condition and extrinsic measures of remotely sensed environmental data on demographic rates. We measured rates of pregnancy, parturition, juvenile, and adult survival for 82 adult females in a population where predators largely were absent. Life stage simulation analyses (LSAs) indicated that interannual fluctuations in adult survival contributed to most of the variability in lambda. We then extended the LSA to estimate vital rates as a function of bottom-up covariates to evaluate their influence on lambda. We detected weak signatures of effects from environmental covariates that were remotely sensed and spatially explicit to each seasonal range. Instead, nutritional condition strongly influenced rates of pregnancy, parturition, and overwinter survival of adults, clearly implicating resource limitation on lambda. Our findings depart from the classic life-history paradigm of population dynamics in ungulates in that adult survival was highly variable and generated most of the variability in population growth rates. At the surface, lack of variation explained by environmental covariates may suggest weak evidence of resource limitation in the population, when nutritional condition actually underpinned most demographics. We suggest that variability in vital rates and effects of resource limitation may depend on context more than previously appreciated, and density dependence can obfuscate the relationships between remotely sensed data and demographic rates.

TI  - Air-Sea Interactions in the Cold Wakes of Tropical Cyclones
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones generate a large and wide cold wake along their trajectories, which conditions the subsequent evolution of the tropical cyclone themselves. The cold wakes persist for weeks, impacting both the upper ocean, the air-sea fluxes, and the atmosphere. The study by Z. Ma et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088873) for the first time analyzes a composite of remotely sensed data sets to show that cold wakes modify surface winds and reduce cloud coverage and rainfall. These results contribute to shedding light on the mechanisms at the origin of the air-sea feedbacks, which can differ at different latitudes depending on the stability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. The work stimulates further research to assess whether the cloud cover anomalies induced by tropical cyclones significantly modify the radiative budget of the Earth.

TI  - Determining Gravity Wave Sources and Propagation in the Southern Hemisphere by Ray-Tracing AIRS Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravity waves (GWs) are key drivers of atmospheric circulation. Understanding their sources and propagation is essential to improving weather and climate models. We apply a 3D Stockwell Transform to 1 month of stratospheric temperature data from NASA's Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder to obtain 3D GW measurements and parameters. We use ray-tracing methods to determine the sources and propagation characteristics of these GWs over the entire Southern Ocean. We trace 1.28 million GW measurements per day for the month of June 2010. Our analysis suggests that ground-based sources around the Andes, Antarctic Peninsula, and Kerguelen play major roles, and that the GWs generated by these and other sources travel large zonal distances. We show evidence that GWs propagate into the 60 degrees S belt, a possible source of "missing momentum flux" in GCMs at this latitude. These results emphasize the need for models to incorporate the possibility that GWs can exhibit large horizontal propagation.Plain Language Summary Gravity waves are atmospheric waves that transport large amounts of energy through the atmosphere. Understanding their sources and propagation characteristics is key to improving climate models. We trace 30 million wave measurements back to their sources over the Southern Ocean. We find that wave sources in this region are mainly small, mountainous islands and the Andes mountain range, a well-known gravity wave "hot spot." These waves propagate southwards, a feature that is not implemented in many climate models. Hence, the momentum carried by the gravity waves is deposited at the wrong place in these models. We also find that waves travel many hundreds of kilometers west to east. This evidence suggests that atmospheric models need to improve their handling of gravity waves, and more accurately model the way they travel.Key Points.We ray-trace 3 x 10(7) satellite gravity wave measurements over the Southern OceanWe see evidence of southward wave propagation into a band at similar to 60 degrees SOur evidence suggests that waves from near-surface sources in the Southern Ocean region are a plausible source of "missing" model momentum flux

TI  - Riverine landscape dynamics of the Upper Ganga River (Haridwar-Narora), India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data provides an exceptional opportunity to study the temporal dynamics of large rivers. The availability of spatially continuous, synoptic and temporally repetitive satellite data allows the reconstruction of historical dynamics of large rivers along with the identification of the causal factors. An absolute paucity of information on the effect of hydrogeomorphic processes on the dynamics of the Upper Ganga River (UGR), especially upon its entry in the plains, motivated this research. This study aims to analyse morphological changes in the river channel, map temporal changes in the land use/land cover (LULC) within the riverscape and thereby understand the landscape dynamics in the UGR (Haridwar to Narora) during 1993-2017 by means of earth observation data. The analysis showed that the river remains straight with a sinuosity index of <1; however, the braiding increased considerably (from 3.79 to 4.53). Erosion being more prominent on the left bank in comparison to the right bank with 85.89 km(2) eroded on the left bank in comparison to 59.21 km(2) eroded along the right bank. Riverine landscape has been observed to have a higher rate of accretion in comparison to erosion (8.09 km(2) yr(-1) and 6.04 km(2) yr(-1), respectively). Morphological change has brought a transition in the land use patterns with marked variation in vegetation and agriculture along with built-up. Significant changes in the composition of the LULC are largely due to the manifold increase in the agriculture extent (approximate to 12 times), built-up (5 times) and the decrease in vegetation cover from 43.9% in 1993 to just 10.94% in 2017.

TI  - FOSTER-An R package for forest structure extrapolation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The uptake of technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and more recently digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) enable the characterization of 3-dimensional (3D) forest structure. These forest structural attributes are widely applied in the development of modern enhanced forest inventories. As an alternative to extensive ALS or DAP based forest inventories, regional forest attribute maps can be built from relationships between ALS or DAP and wall-to-wall satellite data products. To date, a number of different approaches exist, with varying code implementations using different programming environments and tailored to specific needs. With the motivation for open, simple and modern software, we present FOSTER (Forest Structure Extrapolation in R), a versatile and computationally efficient framework for modeling and imputation of 3D forest attributes. FOSTER derives spectral trends in remote sensing time series, implements a structurally guided sampling approach to sample these often spatially auto correlated datasets, to then allow a modelling approach (currently k-NN imputation) to extrapolate these 3D forest structure measures. The k-NN imputation approach that FOSTER implements has a number of benefits over conventional regression based approaches including lower bias and reduced over fitting. This paper provides an overview of the general framework followed by a demonstration of the performance and outputs of FOSTER. Two ALS-derived variables, the 95th percentile of first returns height (elev_p95) and canopy cover above mean height (cover), were imputed over a research forest in British Columbia, Canada with relative RMSE of 18.5% and 11.4% and relative bias of -0.6% and 1.4% respectively. The processing sequence developed within FOSTER represents an innovative and versatile framework that should be useful to researchers and managers alike looking to make forest management decisions over entire forest estates.

TI  - Observing traveling waves in glaciers with remote sensing: new flexible time series methods and application to Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbrx), Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent influx of remote sensing data provides new opportunities for quantifying spatiotemporal variations in glacier surface velocity and elevation fields. Here, we introduce a flexible time series reconstruction and decomposition technique for forming continuous, time-dependent surface velocity and elevation fields from discontinuous data and partitioning these time series into short- and long-term variations. The time series reconstruction consists of a sparsity-regularized least-squares regression for modeling time series as a linear combination of generic basis functions of multiple temporal scales, allowing us to capture complex variations in the data using simple functions. We apply this method to the multitemporal evolution of Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbrx), Greenland. Using 555 ice velocity maps generated by the Greenland Ice Mapping Project and covering the period 2009-2019, we show that the amplification in seasonal velocity variations in 2012-2016 was coincident with a longer-term speedup initiating in 2012. Similarly, the reduction in post-2017 seasonal velocity variations was coincident with a longer-term slowdown initiating around 2017. To understand how these perturbations propagate through the glacier, we introduce an approach for quantifying the spatially varying and frequency-dependent phase velocities and attenuation length scales of the resulting traveling waves. We hypothesize that these traveling waves are predominantly kinematic waves based on their long periods, coincident changes in surface velocity and elevation, and connection with variations in the terminus position. This ability to quantify wave propagation enables an entirely new framework for studying glacier dynamics using remote sensing data.

TI  - Formaldehyde total column densities over Mexico City: comparison between multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy and solar-absorption Fourier transform infrared measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Formaldehyde (HCHO) total column densities over the Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) were retrieved using two independent measurement techniques: multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. For the MAX-DOAS measurements, the software QDOAS was used to calculate differential slant column densities (dSCDs) from the measured spectra and subsequently the Mexican MAX-DOAS fit (MMF) retrieval code to convert from dSCDs to vertical column densities (VCDs). The direct solar-absorption spectra measured with FTIR were analyzed using the PROFFIT (PROFile FIT) retrieval code. Typically the MAX-DOAS instrument reports higher VCDs than those measured with FTIR, in part due to differences found in the ground-level sensitivities as revealed from the retrieval diagnostics from both instruments, as the FTIR and the MAX-DOAS information do not refer exactly to the same altitudes of the atmosphere. Three MAX-DOAS datasets using measurements conducted towards the east, west or both sides of the measurement plane were evaluated with respect to the FTIR results. The retrieved MAX-DOAS HCHO VCDs where 6 %, 8 % and 28 % larger than the FTIR measurements which, supported with satellite data, indicates a large horizontal inhomogeneity in the HCHO abundances. The temporal change in the vertical distribution of this pollutant, guided by the evolution of the mixing-layer height, affects the comparison of the two retrievals with different sensitivities (total column averaging kernels). In addition to the reported seasonal and diurnal variability of HCHO columns within the urban site, background data from measurements at a high-altitude station, located only 60 km away, are presented.

TI  - Assessment of the TROPOMI tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> product based on airborne APEX observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P), launched in October 2017, carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nadir-viewing spectrometer, is the first mission of the Copernicus Programme dedicated to the monitoring of air quality, climate, and ozone. In the presented study, the TROPOMI tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level-2 (L2) product (OFFL v1.03.01; 3.5 km x 7 km at nadir observations) has been validated over strongly polluted urban regions by comparison with coincident high-resolution Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) remote sensing observations (similar to 75 m x 120 m). Satellite products can be optimally assessed based on (APEX) airborne remote sensing observations, as a large amount of satellite pixels can be fully mapped at high accuracy and in a relatively short time interval, reducing the impact of spatiotemporal mismatches. In the framework of the S-5P validation campaign over Belgium (S5PVAL-BE), the APEX imaging spectrometer has been deployed during four mapping flights (26-29 June 2019) over the two largest urban regions in Belgium, i.e. Brussels and Antwerp, in order to map the horizontal distribution of tropospheric NO2. For each flight, 10 to 20 TROPOMI pixels were fully covered by approximately 2700 to 4000 APEX measurements within each TROPOMI pixel. The TROPOMI and APEX NO2 vertical column density (VCD) retrieval schemes are similar in concept. Overall, for the ensemble of the four flights, the standard TROPOMI NO2 VCD product is well correlated (R = 0.92) but biased negatively by -1.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) or -14 +/- 12 %, on average, with respect to coincident APEX NO2 retrievals. When replacing the coarse 1 degrees x 1 degrees the massively parallel (MP) version of the Tracer Model version 5 (TM5) a priori NO2 profiles by NO2 profile shapes from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) regional chemistry transport model (CTM) ensemble at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees, R is 0.94 and the slope increases from 0.82 to 0.93. The bias is reduced to -0.1 +/- 1.0 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) or -1.0 +/- 12 %. The absolute difference is on average 1.3 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) (16 %) and 0.7 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) (9 %), when comparing APEX NO2 VCDs with TM5-MP-based and CAMS-based NO2 VCDs, respectively. Both sets of retrievals are well within the mission accuracy requirement of a maximum bias of 25 %-50 % for the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 product for all individual compared pixels. Additionally, the APEX data set allows the study of TROPOMI subpixel variability and impact of signal smoothing due to its finite satellite pixel size, typically coarser than fine-scale gradients in the urban NO2 field. For a case study in the Antwerp region, the current TROPOMI data underestimate localized enhancements and overestimate background values by approximately 12 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) (10 %-20 %).

TI  - Hot moments and hotspots of cyanobacteria hyperblooms in the Curonian Lagoon (SE Baltic Sea) revealed via remote sensing-based retrospective analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A temporally and spatially detailed historical (1985-2018) analysis of cyanobacteria blooms was performed in the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania, Russia), the largest coastal lagoon in the Baltic Sea. Satellite data allowed the mapping of cyanobacteria surface accumulations, so-called "scums", and of chlorophyll-a concentration. The 34-year time series shows a tendency towards later occurrence (October-November) of the cyanobacteria scum presence, whereas the period of its onset (June-July) remains relatively constant. The periods when scums are present, "hot moments", have been consistently increasing in duration since 2008. The differences in the starting, ending and annual duration of cyanobacteria blooms have been significantly altered by hydrometeorological conditions (river discharge, water temperature, and wind conditions) and their year-round patterns. The most important environmental factors that determined the temporal changes of the scum presence and area were the standing stock of cyanobacteria and the ambient wind conditions. The "hotspots", the areas where the blooms most likely occur, were distributed in the south-southwestern and central parts of the lagoon. The least affected areas were the northern part, which is connected to the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea and the Nemunas River delta region. The longstanding, well-established spatial patterns of cyanobacteria blooms were linked to hydrodynamic features, namely water renewal time and current patterns, and to potential nutrient sources that included muddy sediments and the locations of colonies of piscivorous birds. Our findings confirmed that the annual and seasonal variations of cyanobacteria blooms and their regulation are a complex issue due to interactions between multiple factors over spatially and temporally broad scales. Despite great progress in the prevention and control of eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, the lagoon is still considered to be in a poor ecological status. This work provides a new and missing understanding on the spatial and temporal extent of cyanobacteria blooms and the factors that govern them. Such an understanding can help in planning management strategies, forecasting the magnitude and severity of blooms under changing nutrient loads and potential climate scenarios.

TI  - Prioritization of sites for Managed Aquifer Recharge in a semi-arid environment in western India using GIS-Based multicriteria evaluation strategy
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, the droughts in India have affected a larger part of land due to its highly erratic nature of rainfall. A management strategy becomes essential in chronically prone semi-arid terrains when drought experience is felt in a falling water table and a lesser crop productivity. Depletion of finite groundwater (GW) resources pose a serious challenge to sustenance of watersheds with perpetual aridity in these regions. Projects of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) in degraded watersheds mostly as check dams or percolation ponds lead to improvement in drought resilience with increased recharge and rising ground water levels. Present study attempts to follow a mitigation plan and provides for some prioritized suitable sites with few recommended civil structure types. Extensive and integrated use of satellite data over a GIS platform is applied for an ideal semi-arid basin of river Bhadar flowing in western part of the country. The various reclassified thematic rasters are created accordingly and evaluated each relative to one another on a common ranking scale before being assigned the appropriate weights as per an AHP-drawn exercise. The entire basin is investigated for spatial distribution of suitability zones in augmenting GW recharge and prioritized in five classes. Preferences for a structure type is made in high priority zones with exact locations requiring further field-verifications. The results underline a crucial strategic planning of achieving optimum recharge in otherwise dried or depleting aquifers of a drought afflicted river basin.

TI  - Resilience of vegetation to drought: Studying the effect of grazing in a Mediterranean rangeland using satellite time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how resilient rangelands are to climatic disturbances such as drought is of major importance to land managers. The resilience of ecosystems can be reduced by livestock grazing and by environmental conditions. Most studies quantifying resilience are based on model simulations. However, natural time series from satellite data offer the possibility to infer aspects of resilience from real systems. The objective of this study was to investigate two aspects of ecological resilience, namely resistance to climate variability and recovery from drought, by applying a change detection method (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend; BFAST) spatially on a 28-year Landsat NDVI time series in a dry rangeland in southern Cyprus. First, we used the number of breakpoints fitted by the BFAST model as an inverted proxy for long-term vegetation resistance to climate variability (the ability to withstand change during a disturbance reduces the likelihood to trigger a breakpoint in the time series). Second, we used the linear slope of the BFAST model after a known drought as a proxy of the recovery rate of the vegetation. This information was then used to analyse the spatial distribution of the total number of breakpoints and of the NDVI recovery trend in relation to grazing and environmental properties. Our results show that high NDVI and a northern orientation (i.e. favourable environmental conditions) were associated with a highly resilient system, due to high resistance to climate variability and fast recovery after drought. Intermediate conditions were associated with low resistance. Unfavourable conditions and high grazing intensities were associated with an unresponsive ecosystem state characterised by high resistance and slow recovery after a drought event. Low grazing intensities positively affected the NDVI recovery trend, but did not improve resistance. On northern slopes, terrain slope had a positive effect on the NDVI recovery trend, while on southern slopes it had a negative effect. Our satellite-driven approach has a strong potential for resilience monitoring, because it can be applied on broad spatial and temporal scales in areas with low availability of field data. Moreover, it allows to jointly extract two important components of resilience: resistance and recovery rate.

TI  - Continuous Estimates of Glacier Mass Balance in High Mountain Asia Based on ICESat-1,2 and GRACE/GRACE Follow-On Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier melt in High Mountain Asia (HMA) is an indicator of climate change and has a major impact on the regional hydrology and freshwater supply. We determined the recent status of HMA glaciers based on the first analysis of Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data. We used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (FO) data to complement ICESat-1,2 data and validate them independently. We find a good agreement between ICESat-1,2 and GRACE/GRACE-FO data, which demonstrates the high reliability of results. Based on our results, the continuous glacier mass change from 2003 to 2019 is -28 6 Gt yr(-1), which is more negative than stereo imagery-based studies. The regional variability of the glaciers ranges from -1.07 0.10 m yr(-1) in southeastern Nyaingentanglha to +0.16 0.10 m yr(-1) in West Kunlun. ICESat-2 data enable new insight into the continuous measurement of HMA glacier elevation change.Plain Language Summary High Mountain Asia (HMA) is the largest ice-covered region outside the polar regions. Glaciers have been melting for the past decades due to global warming and will probably continue in the coming decades. This threatens the water availability in downstream basins and affects the regional or global climate. Thus, it is important to continuously monitor the states of the glaciers. In this study, the first analysis of data released after the launch of the second generation of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) is provided. The data were used to survey the glacier thickness and mass change in HMA. We used independent gravity satellite data to fill the gap of ICESat, and the two independent data sets agree with respect to the continuous glacier mass change, which indicates the high reliability of the results. We estimate a total mass change of HMA glaciers is -28 6 Gt yr(-1) (Gt = 109 t water) or -0.34 +/- 0.07 m yr(-1) from 2003 to 2019. The spatial variability of the glacier elevation change rates indicates rapid thinning in Nyaingentanglha, but a slight increase in West Kunlun.Key Points.We provide the first look of ICESat-2 data on glacier thickness and mass changes in High Mountain AsiaWe use independent data from satellite gravimetry to fill data gap of ICESat and obtain nearly continuous glacier mass changesThere is a quantitative agreement between satellite gravimetry and satellite altimetry, which show high reliability of result and data

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of a novel hexavalent group B streptococcus conjugate vaccine in healthy, non-pregnant adults: a phase 1/2, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation trial
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of invasive disease in young infants. Infants born to women with sufficient pre-existing anti-GBS capsular IgG antibodies are at reduced risk of GBS disease, making maternal immunisation a potential strategy for prevention. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a novel hexavalent (serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V) GBS conjugate vaccine (GBS6).Methods This phase 1/2, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation trial, was done at four clinical research centres in the USA (Kentucky, Georgia, and two sites in Utah). Healthy, non-pregnant adults aged 18-49 years were randomly assigned using an interactive, web-based response technology system. Within each dose group (low, medium, or high), participants in sentinel cohorts were randomly assigned 2:2:1 and expanded cohort participants were randomly assigned 4:4:1 to receive GBS6 with aluminium phosphate (AlPO4), GBS6 without AlPO4, or placebo (saline control). One 0.5 mL dose of either saline placebo or 5 mu g capsular polysaccharide per serotype in the low-dose group, 10 mu g capsular polysaccharide per serotype in the medium-dose group, or 20 mu g capsular polysaccharide per serotype in the high-dose group was administered by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle on day 1. The primary outcome was safety up to 6 months after vaccination, including the proportion of sentinel cohort participants with clinical laboratory abnormalities at 1 week, the proportion of all participants reporting solicited local reactions, systemic events, or use of antipyretic or pain medication within 14 days, adverse events up to 1 month, and medically attended or serious adverse events up to 6 months. The secondary outcome was GBS immunogenicity (serotypespecific IgG geometric mean concentrations at 1 month). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03170609.Findings Between June 5, 2017, and June 25, 2018, 365 participants were randomly assigned and 364 (52 in each dose group) were vaccinated and included in the safety analysis. Unsolicited adverse events were reported by 15 (29%) participants in the 5 mu g with AlPO 4 group, 13 (25%) in the 5 mu g without AlPO4 group, 22 (42%) in the 10 mu g with AlPO 4 group, 12 (23%) in the 10 mu g without AlPO 4 group, 25 (48%) in the 20 mu g with AlPO4 group, 21 (40%) in the 20 mu g without AlPO 4 group, and 20 (38%) in the placebo group. The most common unsolicited adverse events were in the system organ class of infections and infestations in any dose or formulation of GBS6 (ranging from six [12%] in the 10 mu g without AlPO 4 group to 15 [29%] in the 20 mu g with AlPO4 group and placebo group). Three participants reported at least one serious adverse event during the study, one each in the 5 mu g GBS6 with AlPO4 group (diabetic ketoacidosis, two events; resolved), 10 mu g GBS6 with AlPO4 group (died by suicide), and 20 mu g GBS6 with AlPO4 group (metrorrhagia; resolved). None of these serious adverse events were considered related to the vaccine. 11 of the 365 participants were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population, including one participant who did not receive the vaccine, and ten who at 1 month after vaccination were withdrawn for various reasons. GBS serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations increased by 1 week after vaccination for all GBS6 groups, peaked at 2 weeks, stabilised by 1 month, and declined gradually but remained higher than placebo at 6 months.Interpretation GBS6 was well tolerated in healthy adults and elicited robust immune responses for all dose levels and formulations that persisted 6 months after vaccination. This study supports further evaluation of GBS6 in pregnant women. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Classification of Estuarine Wetlands in Yemen Using Local and Catchment Descriptors
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A high number of wetlands were irreversibly lost in arid regions, mainly because their conservation raises the great conflict between maintaining wetland hydrology and satisfying water needs of the human population. In Yemen, as an arid developing country, the poor knowledge on wetlands is another challenge that faces their conservation. The present paper contributes to this knowledge by providing a preliminary classification of estuarine ecosystems in Yemen, using satellite data, which provide us with 15 physiographical descriptors of both estuaries, their catchment areas and sea waters. These data were extracted with GIS tools and treated with modern classification algorithms. Their treatment revealed six different types of estuaries, which are distinguished by three categories of descriptors (size and rock nature of both estuary and watershed and sea exposition). These categories confirm the significant influence of the watershed characteristics in shaping estuaries, whose influence has mainly been established during the pluvial Quaternary episodes. The sea characteristics (hydrodynamics and orography) are crucial in estuary classification; yet, despite the great effort deployed to get pertinent data, it was still difficult to find satellite descriptors of these two features. Therefore, the remote sensing has actually some limits in providing sea data for estuarine classification, which will be no longer exceeded with the increasing number of significant satellite data. Finally, we remind that the raw and compiled data gathered in this study constitute a preliminary inventory of the 451 Yemen estuaries, which is very useful for their knowledge and management.

TI  - Path analysis model to identify and analyse the causes of aeolian desertification in Mu Us Sandy Land, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As is a land degradation process caused by an uncoordinated Human-Earth relationship, aeolian desertification has threatened the safety of eco-environmental and the development of social economy in northern China. Although most studies focus on the causes or driving forces of aeolian desertification with climatic and anthropogenic factors, lack of the impact analysis of the relationship between climate change and human activities, the driving mechanism still remain unclear. In the present study, first the spatial patterns of aeolian desertification land from 1975 to 2015 were obtained by visual interpretation in Mu Us Sandy Land with satellite data. Then, climatic (i.e., temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind speed), and socio-economic data (i.e., population density, livestock, woodland area, and farmland area) were combined with the aeolian desertification pattern to investigate the direct and indirect effects of climate change and human activities on the aeolian desertification via the path analysis model. The results are as follows: (1) During the past 4 decades, the aeolian desertification in Mu Us Sandy Land showed a trend of "violent development-slow reversal" with extremely severe aeolian desertified land as the main representative. The aeolian desertified land area reached 57,778.32 km(2) by 2015. (2) Overall, human activities accounted for 50.96% of the relative influence on aeolian desertification land net growth rate, followed by climate 49.04%, with the temperature, livestock, and population as dominate factors. (3) Path analysis identified a network of inter-correlations of human activities and climate in determining aeolian desertification land net growth rate. (4) The direct correlation of aeolian desertification land net growth rate with human activities was significantly weakened if removing the effects of climate. These results reveal the relative importance of human activities and climate and their complex interconnections in regulating aeolian desertification process.

TI  - Percutaneous Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography combined with in vitro verification for detection and characterization of sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To assess the efficacy of percutaneous Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasound and in vitro verification for identification sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and diagnosis of metastatic SLNs in patients with early breast cancer (BC). Methods Sixty-eight patients with early BC were enrolled finally. After the induction of general anesthesia, 0.4 ml of Sonazoid (SNZ), a new second-generation tissue-specific ultrasound contrast agent (UCA), mixed with 0.6 ml of methylene blue, was injected intradermally. The lymphatic vessels and connected SLNs were immediately observed and marked. After being resected, these SLNs were soaked in saline water and examined still in the mode of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in vitro. This procedure could ensure that all the enhanced nodes had been removed as much as possible. The numbers of SLNs detected by UCA and blue dye were recorded. The enhancement patterns of SLNs were compared with the final pathological results. Results SLNs detection rate by SNZ-CEUS was 100%, which was higher than that by blue dye (95.59%). CEUS identified a median of 1.5 nodes, while blue dye identified a median of 1.9 nodes per case (p = 0.0012). When homogeneous high perfusion and complete annular high perfusion were regarded as negative nodes, the sensitivity and negative predictive value were 92.31% and 96.79% respectively, while the specificity was 84.21%. Conclusions Percutaneous SNZ-enhanced ultrasonography combined with in vitro verification is a feasible and reliable method for SLNs identification intraoperatively. Enhancement patterns can be helpful in determining the status of SLNs.

TI  - Disturbance and predation risk influence vigilance synchrony of black-necked cranes <i>Grus nigricollis</i>, but not as strongly as expected
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Animals monitor surrounding dangers independently or cooperatively (synchronized and coordinated vigilance), with independent and synchronized scanning being prevalent. Coordinated vigilance, including unique sentinel behavior, is rare in nature, since it is time-consuming and limited in terms of benefits. No evidence showed animals adopt alternative vigilance strategies during antipredation scanning yet. Considering the nonindependent nature of both synchronization and coordination, we assessed whether group members could keep alert synchronously or in a coordinated fashion under different circumstance. We studied how human behavior and species-specific variables impacted individual and collective vigilance of globally threatened black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) and explored behavior-based wildlife management. We tested both predation risk (number of juveniles in group) and human disturbance (level and distance) effects on individual and collective antipredation vigilance of black-necked crane families. Adults spent significantly more time (proportion and duration) on scanning than juveniles, and parents with juveniles behaved more vigilant. Both adults and juveniles increased time allocation and duration on vigilance with observer proximity. Deviation between observed and expected collective vigilance varied with disturbance and predation risk from zero, but not significantly so, indicating that an independent vigilance strategy was adopted by black-necked crane couples. The birds showed synchronized vigilance in low disturbance areas, with fewer juveniles and far from observers; otherwise, they scanned in coordinated fashion. The collective vigilance, from synchronized to coordinated pattern, varied as a function of observer distance that helped us determine a safe distance of 403.75 m for the most vulnerable family groups with two juveniles. We argue that vigilance could constitute a prime indicator in behavior-based species conservation, and we suggesting a safe distance of at least 400 m should be considered in future tourist management.

TI  - Spatial patterns of vegetation coverage change in giant panda habitat based on MODIS time-series observations and local indicators of spatial association
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measures to characterize the spatial patterns of vegetation change can provide important information for understanding and assessing habitat fragmentation and its causes. This study developed a new framework to assess fragmentation by integrating the spatial patterns of vegetation coverage and its change across the giant panda habitat ecosystem of China. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data, we detected the historical vegetation disturbances and used "abrupt," "gradual," and "total" to characterize the vegetation change processes from 2000 to 2017. The spatial patterns of vegetation coverage and its change were described by spatial clusters and outliers, and the framework was established to find the potential area for reduction of habitat fragmentation. The results indicated that 1.9% of the study area experienced disturbances during 2000-2017. Most of the disturbed area (78.9%) experienced negative abrupt vegetation change, and the undisturbed area mainly showed an increase in vegetation (85.8%). The spatial clusters of high and low total changes accounted for 22.7% and 18.2% of the study area, respectively. The high change clusters were primarily along the northern and southeastern borders of the giant panda habitat, while the low change clusters spread over the central and southern areas. Considering the spatial patterns of both vegetation coverage and its change, 12.7% of the study area, located mainly in southern Minshan and eastern Qionglaishan, needs careful management to reduce habitat fragmentation. This study provides new insight to understand habitat fragmentation in terms of spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetation status and change, and will benefit future habitat management efforts.

TI  - Numerical simulation and analysis of a geological disaster chain in the Peilong valley, SE Tibetan Plateau
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yarlung Tsangpo river basin in the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau contains many maritime glaciers, where the massive debris flow formation caused by the glacial degradation leads to the issue of regional warming. It often forms a continuous geological disaster chain. In this study, the topographical features and debris flow deposits in the Peilong valley were investigated in November 2018. It was found that the geological conditions in the valley are complex and numerous unstable sources are existed. Field investigations, laboratory tests, and a geomorphological analysis were conducted to obtain relevant data for the valley. And comparison of Landsat images indicates that the rate of change of the glacial area is 51.62% from winter to summer. Discrete element software (PFC3D) is used to simulate glacial landslides on the left bank. The simulation results show that a dam with a height of 141 m was formed, creating a lake. The debris flow after the dam break is simulated for different peak discharge values and durations based on a free surface shallow flow (SFLOW) model, with a final accumulation depth of 21.6 m. The comprehensive results of numerical simulation show that the chain of geological disasters induced by glacial landslide poses a huge threat to residents and roads near Peilong valley. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the glacier activities in real time to enable forecasting of debris flows and reduce the property losses and prevent loss of life.

TI  - Optimal segmentation scale selection and evaluation of cultivated land objects based on high-resolution remote sensing images with spectral and texture features
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the remote sensing technology develops, there are increasingly more kinds of remote sensing images available from different sensors. High-resolution remote sensing images are widely used in the detection of land cover/land change due to their plenty of characteristics of a specific feature in terms of spectrum, shape, and texture. Current studies regarding cultivated land resources that are the material basis for the human beings to survive and develop focus on the method to accurately obtain the quantity of cultivated land in a region and understand the conditions and the trend of change of the cultivated land. Pixel-based method and object-oriented method are the main methods to extract cultivated land in remote sensing field. Pixel-based method ignores high-level image information, while object-oriented method takes the image spot after image segmentation as the basic unit of information extraction, which can make full use of spectral features, spatial features, semantic features, and contextual features. Image segmentation is a key step of object-oriented method; the core problem is how to obtain the optimal segmentation scale. Traditional methods for determining the optimal segmentation scale of features (such as the homogeneity-heterogeneity method, the maximum area method, and the mean variance method), in which only the spectral and geometrical characteristics are considered, while the textural characteristics are neglected. Based on this, the Quickbird and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained in Xiyu Village, Pengzhou City, Sichuan Province, China, were selected as experimental objects, and the texture mean and spectral grayscale mean method (MANC method based on GLCM), which comprehensively considered the spectrum, shape, and texture features, was proposed to calculate the optimal segmentation scale of cultivated land in the study area. The error segment index (ESI) and centroids distance index (CDI) were adopted to evaluate image segmentation quality based on the method of area and position differences. The experimental results show that the MANC method based on GLCM can obtain higher segmentation precision than the traditional methods, and the segmentation results are in good agreement with the cultivated land boundary obtained by visual interpretation.

T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though the occurrence rate of tropical cyclones (TCs) is almost steady as reported in earlier studies, however, the intensity of TCs has shown a significant increase due to global warming. Gonu (2007) and Phet (2010) are examples of TCs, which affected the southern coasts of Iran. The first step in evaluating the effects of TC is the accuracy as well as the correctness of the wind field. For this purpose, the WRF and parametric models have been implemented for the wind field simulation, in the Makran coasts during the Gonu TC. QuikSCAT satellite data and coastal synoptic stations data have been used to evaluate the wind field results. The results indicated that the WRF model can successfully forecast the cyclone's path and its outputs can be employed to forecast such weather hazards. Comparing the wind field results with satellite data, highlights the accuracy of the WRF model in the coastal areas. Modeling the wind field asymmetry due to the cyclone confinement and more realistic wind distribution, distinguishes the results of WRF model from other studied counterparts. In addition, a comparison of the wind field results with the synoptic data indicates that the WRF model results meet very good accuracy. Furthermore, the study of cyclone damage potential (CDP) index in the Gulf of Oman northern coasts shows that the WRF outcomes have a very high accuracy. This study highlights the capability of the ARW model in simulating the wind field, especially on the southern and southeastern coasts of Iran, which are affected by TCs.

TI  - Prediction of algal bloom occurrence based on the naive Bayesian model considering satellite image pixel differences
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bloom occurrence probability prediction is a critical issue for freshwater resource management and protection. As the mechanism of algal blooms is not understood, the construction of prediction model mainly depends on statistical data. Therefore, knowledge on prior bloom occurrence derived from statistical data plays a significant role in establishing a prediction model. In this study, a naive Bayesian model incorporating prior information was constructed to predict algal bloom occurrence probabilities 1-7 days in advance under different weather conditions in Dianchi Lake. The proposed model utilised the following data from the MODIS images, the floating algae index (FAI) for the previous 7 days and five meteorological variables (mean wind speed, air pressure, relative humidity on the prediction day, accumulated sunshine hours in the previous 3 days, and accumulated air temperature in the previous 7 days). The prior probabilities of each pixel were calculated on a monthly timescale to highlight the bloom's temporal-spatial differences, and the 1-7 day posterior probabilities were calculated by combining the prior and conditional probabilities. The predictive effect was tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the results showed the number of pixels with estimation predictions classified as 'Good+' and 'Excellent' were 91.3%, 91.4%, 82.7%, 83.3%, 89.0%, 86.6%, and 90.0% for the predictions on days 1-7, respectively. Additionally, the independent validation datasets showed that the percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI%) of approximately 90% of the pixels were greater than 50%. The proposed algal bloom prediction model based on the naive Bayesian method has pixel-level prediction abilities, is applicable to other inland water systems, and can provide a reference for water environment risk forecasting and management.

TI  - IRS-1C Applications in Land Use/Land Cover Studies: Indian Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Indian experience, in use of remotely sensed data for land use/land cover analysis, gained over past many years through the implementation of various projects. The satellite IRS-1C which was launched on December 28th, 1995 provided a new dimension to the mapping capability of land use/land cover analysis on various scales. Based on different studies, it is concluded that WiFS data can be used for level-I classification for national and regional level applications, whereas LISS-III alone can be use up to level-III for subregional scale and a combination of LISS-III and PAN data can be used for village-level information. IRS-lC data have been extremely useful in the generation of district-wise land used and cover maps, depicting the information up to level-II on 1:250,000 scale for land use planning and National Wasteland Inventory Project. A systematic study was carried out to identify and map 13 different types of wastelands on 1:50,000 scale up to village and micro-watershed level for some districts using IRS 1C data. A digital data with standard codification system in four different spatial layers were generated for the entire country, and about 63.85 million ha have been estimated as wastelands through this study. Various watershed programs are being implemented in the country consulting this database. A successor to this project "Monitoring of Wastelands," which aim at reporting the changes in wastelands statistics in India, considering various developmental programs launched by Govt. of India since early 1990 has been implemented using IRS 1C data.

TI  - Temporal and sex-based variation in organochlorine pesticide levels in the blue-footed booby in two coastal colonies of Sinaloa, Mexico
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal, inter-site, and sex-based variation of 19 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in blood plasma samples collected from blue-footed boobies of two islands in Sinaloa, Mexico, was evaluated. The effect of OCPs was evaluated with the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, micronucleated erythrocyte frequency, and scaled mass index. The OCP-group levels decreased as the breeding season progressed, and interannual (but not inter-colony) differences were detected. Intra-annual variation in OCP levels seemed to reflect run-off inputs, although other environmental processes may better explain the variation between years. Sex-based differences in OCP levels were likely related to ecological and physiological processes linked to breeding (e.g., egg-laying and use of lipid reserves). No correlations between OCP-group levels and biomarkers were detected. Small pelagic fishes are the main prey sources of blue-footed boobies and the targets of regional industrial fisheries, and thus blue-footed booby OCP levels could reflect ecosystem health and indicate potential risks for human consumers.

TI  - Retrieval and validation of forest background reflectivity from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data across European forests
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about forest background reflectance is needed for accurate biophysical parameter retrieval from forest canopies (overstory) with remote sensing. Separating under- and overstory signals would enable more accurate modeling of forest carbon and energy fluxes. We retrieved values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the forest understory with the multi-angular Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo data (gridded 500 m daily Collection 6 product), using a method originally developed for boreal forests. The forest floor background reflectance estimates from the MODIS data were compared with in situ understory reflectance measurements carried out at an extensive set of forest ecosystem experimental sites across Europe. The reflectance estimates from MODIS data were, hence, tested across diverse forest conditions and phenological phases during the growing season to examine their applicability for ecosystems other than boreal forests. Here we report that the method can deliver good retrievals, especially over different forest types with open canopies (low foliage cover). The performance of the method was found to be limited over forests with closed canopies (high foliage cover), where the signal from understory becomes too attenuated. The spatial heterogeneity of individual field sites and the limitations and documented quality of the MODIS BRDF product are shown to be important for the correct assessment and validation of the retrievals obtained with remote sensing.

TI  - Wildlife as Sentinels of Antimicrobial Resistance in Germany?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of bacteria carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in wildlife is an indicator that resistant bacteria of human or livestock origin are widespread in the environment. In addition, it could represent an additional challenge for human health, since wild animals could act as efficient AMR reservoirs and epidemiological links between human, livestock and natural environments. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and the antibiotic resistance patterns of several bacterial species in certain wild animals in Germany, including wild boars (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wild ducks (family Anatidae, subfamily Anatinae) and geese (family Anatidae, subfamily Anserinae). In the framework of the German National Zoonoses Monitoring Program, samples from hunted wild boars, roe deer and wild ducks and geese were collected nationwide in 2016, 2017, and 2019, respectively. Fecal samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella spp. (in wild boars and wild ducks and geese), Campylobacter spp. (in roe deer and wild ducks and geese), Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia (E.) coli (STEC), commensal E. coli and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL) or ampicillinase class C (AmpC) beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (in wild boars, roe deer and wild ducks and geese). In addition, the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was investigated in nasal swabs from wild boars. Isolates obtained in the accredited regional state laboratories were submitted to the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for confirmation, characterization and phenotypic resistance testing using broth microdilution according to CLSI. AMR was assessed according to epidemiological cut-offs provided by EUCAST. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 13 of 552 (2.4%) tested wild boar fecal samples, but absent in all 101 samples from wild ducks and geese. Nine of the 11 isolates that were submitted to the NRL Salmonella were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial substances. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from four out of 504 (0.8%) roe deer fecal samples, but not from any of the samples from wild ducks and geese. Of the two isolates received in the NRL Campylobacter, neither showed resistance to any of the substances tested. From roe deer, 40.2% of the fecal samples (144 of 358) yielded STEC compared to 6.9% (37 of 536) from wild boars. In wild ducks and geese, no STEC isolates were found. Of 150 STEC isolates received in the NRL (24 from wild boars and 126 from roe deer), only one from each animal species showed resistance. Of the 219 isolates of commensal E. coli from wild boars tested for AMR, 210 were susceptible to all 14 tested substances (95.9%). In roe deer this proportion was even higher (263 of 269, 97.8%), whereas in wild ducks and geese this proportion was lower (41 of 49, 83.7%). Nevertheless, selective isolation of ESBL-/AmpC-producing E. coli yielded 6.5% (36 of 551) positive samples from wild boars, 2.3% (13 of 573) from roe deer and 9.8% (10 of 102) from wild ducks and geese. Among the 25 confirmed ESBL-/AmpC-producing isolates from wild boars, 14 (56.0%) showed resistance up to five classes of substances. This proportion was lower in roe deer (3 of 12, 25%) and higher in wild ducks and geese (7 of 10, 70%). None of the 577 nasal swabs from wild boars yielded MRSA.Results indicate that overall, the prevalence of resistant bacteria from certain wild animals in Germany is low, which may reflect not only the low level of exposure to antimicrobials but also the low level of resistant bacteria in the areas where these animals live and feed.However, despite this low prevalence, the patterns observed in bacteria from the wild animals included in this study are an indicator for specific resistance traits in the environment, including those to highest priority substances such as 3rd generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and colistin. Therefore, also continuous monitoring of the occurrence of such bacteria in wildlife by selective isolation is advisable. Furthermore, the possible role of wildlife as reservoir and disperser of resistant bacteria would need to be assessed, as wild animals, and in particular wild ducks and geese could become spreaders of resistant bacteria given their capacity for long-range movements.

TI  - Yield gap and resource utilization efficiency of three major food crops in the world - A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Yield gap analysis could provide management suggestions to increase crop yields, while the understandings of resource utilization efficiency could help judge the rationality of the management. Based on more than 110 published papers and data from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, www.fao.org/faostat) and the Global Yield Gap and Water Productivity Atlas (www.yieldgap.org), this study summarized the concept, quantitative method of yield gap, yield-limiting factors, and resource utilization efficiency of the three major food crops (wheat, maize and rice). Currently, global potential yields of wheat, maize and rice were 7.7, 10.4 and 8.5 t ha(-1), respectively. However, actual yields of wheat, maize and rice were just 4.1, 5.5 and 4.0 t ha(-1), respectively. Climate, nutrients, moisture, crop varieties, planting dates, and socioeconomic conditions are the most mentioned yield-limiting factors. In terms of resource utilization, nitrogen utilization, water utilization, and radiation utilization efficiencies are still not optimal, and this review has summarized the main improvement measures. The current research focuses on quantitative potential yield and yield gap, with a rough explanation of yield-limiting factors. Subsequent research should use remote sensing data to improve the accuracy of the regional scale and use machine learning to quantify the role of yield-limiting factors in yield gaps and the impact of change crop management on resource utilization efficiency, so as to propose reasonable and effective measures to close yield gaps.

TI  - Assessment of groundwater recharge along the Guarani aquifer system outcrop zone in SAo Paulo State (Brazil): an important tool towards integrated management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of the groundwater recharges represents useful and important information for water resource management. The volumes of infiltrated water are essential to maintain water storage in aquifers, as well as to the discharge of groundwater towards the rivers, especially in tropical areas. The outcrop zones of the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) in SAo Paulo state (Brazil) are considered as their most important recharge areas; therefore, knowledge about recharge rates and processes is essential. They are also highly vulnerable to groundwater contamination, another important reason to protect them. This study aimed to estimate spatial and temporal variations of groundwater recharge in the mentioned GAS outcrop zones. Recharge rates were estimated using the Spatial Recharge (SR) method and then compared to other two traditional methods (base flow separation and water table fluctuation method). The SR method uses the spatial distribution of the evapotranspiration and rainfall from GLDAS and TRMM databases and the runoff after the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) empirical method. All three methods revealed similar estimates for groundwater recharge, ranging from 150 to 370 mm year(-1) (about 17% of the total rainfall). Despite its intrinsic limitations, the SR method allowed robust recharge estimation with ability to cope with spatial and temporal variations, as well, especially in areas lacking hydrological monitoring programs. The SR method provides valuable information for water management policymakers and stakeholders to minimize impacts related to climatic variations and inappropriate land use on recharge processes.

TI  - Condition assessment of pearl millet/ bajra crop in different vigour zones using Radar Vegetation Index
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was focused on assessing the condition of pearl millet crop in critical growth stages using both polarimetric Radarsat-2 and dual-polarized Sentinel-1 datasets. The results revealed that bajra having a close structured phenology like maize and Jowar, exhibited significant changes in RVI due to differences in the crop calendar dates. For bajra, polarimetric RVI generated from information rich Radarsat-2 was observed to have a higher level of saturation till 6 kgm(-2) biomass with a R-2 of 0.7. In all instances, RVI exhibited a significant relationship with VWC and plant volume with a R-2 above 0.7 due to its higher sensitivity towards crop dielectric constant. Unlike NDVI, RVI increased with an increase in Leaf Area Index till 5.8 even during panicle initiation stage. Backscatter and truncated RVI almost follow a similar trend of RVI response for various crop growth parameters. Hence, in case of regional analysis and high cost of Radarsat-2 dataset, one can use freely available sentinel data for RVI analysis due to its wider swath coverage. The observed high correlation of crop age with RVI (R-2 = 0.6) proved to be the best tool for predicting sowing dates in staggered sowing zones.

TI  - Fine-grained, spatiotemporal datasets measuring 200 years of land development in the United States
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The collection, processing, and analysis of remote sensing data since the early 1970s has rapidly improved our understanding of change on the Earth's surface. While satellite-based Earth observation has proven to be of vast scientific value, these data are typically confined to recent decades of observation and often lack important thematic detail. Here, we advance in this arena by constructing new spatially explicit settlement data for the United States that extend back to the early 19th century and are consistently enumerated at fine spatial and temporal granularity (i.e. 250m spatial and 5-year temporal resolution). We create these time series using a large, novel building-stock database to extract and map retrospective, fine-grained spatial distributions of built-up properties in the conterminous United States from 1810 to 2015. From our data extraction, we analyse and publish a series of gridded geospatial datasets that enable novel retrospective historical analysis of the built environment at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The datasets are part of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the United States (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/hisdacus, last access: 25 January 2021) and are available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YSWMDR (Uhl and Leyk, 2020a), https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SJ213V (Uhl and Leyk, 2020b), and https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/J6CYUJ (Uhl and Leyk, 2020c).

TI  - How do physical and social factors affect urban landscape patterns in intermountain basins in Southwest China?
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Urbanization in mountainous areas concentrates in intermountain basins (locally named as "bazi") formed by various geomorphological processes, resulted in a unique urban landscape patterns (ULP) and hierarchically structured determinants. Objectives Detecting ULP in basins across the mountainous Yunnan Province in Southwest China; disentangling the impacts of physical and social drivers on ULP in basins of variable sizes and administrative levels. Methods Five indices of ULP were extracted from Landsat 8 OLA, and linked to causal variables of basin geomorphology, land cover types, administrative structure, road network, within-basin topography and climate; and generalized linear regression and random forest models were applied to estimate factor importance for variation of ULP within basins. Results (1) The capital cities of Yunnan Province and its 100% prefectures, 70% counties and 30% townships were located inside a total of 1198 basins with the area ranging from 1.0 to 1385.1 km(2). (2) ULP patterns in basins of county and higher administrative levels were prominently constrained by physical and social features of basins, and were less interpretable in basins of lower administrative level. (3) Basin area but not shape showed dominant impact on ULP, with direct limit effect revealed only in basins of small size and high administrative level. The administrative structure dominated the spatial configuration of ULP (i.e. patch density, connectance and agglomeration) in basins, and regulated the role of road system, topography and climate with hierarchical differences. Conclusions The ULP in mountain areas was co-dominated by physical and social features of basins. Mountain urbanization impacts should be reduced by rational urban development planning harmonizing physical constraints and administrative optimization.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative determination of microplastics in oyster, seawater and sediment from the coastal areas in Zhuhai, China
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics as a new class of environmental contaminants have become the hot issue of global concern. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments to investigate microplastics in oyster, seawater and sediment along the Zhuhai coastline. The soft tissues of oysters were digested with potassium hydroxide (10%) and hydrogen peroxide (30%), seawaters and sediments with hydrogen peroxide (30%) to degrade organic matter, and analyzed using a digital camera, optical microscopy and micro-ATR-FTIR. The abundance of microplastics were in the range of 0.14?7.90 n/g in oysters (wet weight), 10.00?27.50 n/L in seawaters and 0.053?0.26 n/g in sediments. The fiber and fragment shape, black color, 101?500 ?m of size and polyethylene composition were all classified as the major constituents of microplastics. The level of contaminants in oysters was correlated to those in their surrounding environments. Therefore, oysters may serve as a promising sentinel species for the indication of microplastic pollution in the coastal zone of Zhuhai.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture in Northern China based on climate change initiative data
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the sparse, uneven distribution and poor data continuity of measured soil moisture sites in China and the lack of large-scale research, the soil moisture data set of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) was applied to carry out spatial-temporal variation analysis of soil moisture in five agricultural ecological zones in Northern China. The Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple-component metric Kling-Gupta efficiency were used to verify the validity of remote sensing data and to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture with the concept of temporal and spatial persistence. The ESA CCI remote sensing soil moisture data had good spatial and temporal adaptability for the whole year in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, in summer in Northeast China, in spring in Northwest China, in summer and autumn in the Loess Plateau, and in summer and autumn in the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The annual mean soil volume water content in Northern China from 1991 to 2016 was 0.06-0.39 m(3) m(-3). Spatially, soil moisture in Northern China has been gradually increasing from west to east. In this area, seasonally, soil moisture was the highest in summer, followed by autumn and then winter and spring. Northeast China, the Loess Plateau, and the Huang-Huai-Hai region are important grain-producing areas in China. The soil moisture in these areas fluctuates widely with seasonal changes and shows an obvious drying trend.

TI  - Developing a new disturbance index for tracking gradual change of forest ecosystems in the hilly red soil region of southern China using dense Landsat time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gradual change is prevalent across the forest landscape and generates long-lasting effects for the landscape surface; thus, tracking long-term gradual change can effectively characterize forest change processes. The objective of this study was to establish a vegetation index for change monitoring so as to determine long-term gradual change processes of forest ecosystems in typical red soil areas. The study area was located in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, China. Landsat images, field survey, and auxiliary data were collected to devise a disturbance sensitive vegetation index (DSVI) as an indicator of forest change. Long-term (1985-2019) forest changes were detected using the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), while three evaluation aspects of velocity, frequency, and variance were used to analyze the processes of forest gradual change in red soil regions. Results indicate that the DSVI is a suitable index for forest change detection due to its stronger sensitivity compared to other indexes. Further, it shows excellent change detection ability for different types of gradual changes, such as those caused by drought and significant soil erosion. Furthermore, 97.26% of the forests showed gradual change, and approximately 2/3 of monitored forests showed an increasing growth trend while 1/3 showed a decreasing trend. The dominant (28.33%) forest disturbance frequency indicated instability in red soil regions. Dispersion degree of forest variance was mainly low (48.46%) or medium (28.84%). This research establishes the DSVI as a promising method to track forest gradual change and contributes to a better understanding of gradual change processes of forest landscape over time.

TI  - A demonstration of improved constraints on primordial gravitational waves with delensing
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, derived from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization B-modes with "delensing," whereby the uncertainty on r contributed by the sample variance of the gravitational lensing B-modes is reduced by cross-correlating against a lensing B-mode template. This template is constructed by combining an estimate of the polarized CMB with a tracer of the projected large-scale structure. The large-scale-structure tracer used is a map of the cosmic infrared background derived from Planck satellite data, while the polarized CMB map comes from a combination of South Pole Telescope, BicEP/Keck, and Planck data. We expand the BicEP/Keck likelihood analysis framework to accept a lensing template and apply it to the BicEP/Keck dataset collected through 2014 using the same parametric foreground modeling as in the previous analysis. From simulations, we find that the uncertainty on r is reduced by similar to 10%, from sigma(r) = 0.024 to 0.022, which can be compared with a similar to 26% reduction obtained when using a perfect lensing template or if there were zero lensing B-modes. Applying the technique to the real data, the constraint on r is improved from r(0.)(05) < 0.090 to r(0.)(05) < 0.082 (95% C.L.). This is the first demonstration of improvement in an r constraint through delensing.

TI  - Air pollution trends measured from Terra: CO and AOD over industrial, fire-prone, and background regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Following past studies to quantify decadal trends in global carbon monoxide (CO) using satellite observations, we update estimates and find a CO trend in column amounts of about-0.50 % per year between 2002 to 2018, which is a deceleration compared to analyses performed on shorter records that found-1 % per year. Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations of Winter Phytoplankton Blooms Northwest of the Luzon Island in the South China Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton is a key component of marine ecosystems. Winter phytoplankton blooms are frequently observed northwest of Luzon Island in the South China Sea. In this study, with the multi-satellite merged ocean color remote sensing data from November 1999 to February 2015, we examine the spatial and temporal changes of chlorophylla (Chl-a) concentration and further investigate its response to physical environment parameters including wind speed, Ekman transport, Ekman pumping velocity, sea surface temperature, and sea level anomalies in the region northwest of Luzon Island. The main factors affecting the distribution of Chl-a are discussed by using the partial correlation analysis and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis. The results show that centers of winter Chl-a blooms northwest of Luzon Island often occur near 119.5 degrees E, 19.5 degrees N. The significant multiple correlation (r = 0.76, p < 0.01) between Chl-a and oceanic conditions indicates that both the wind component parallel to the coastline and the wind stress curls enhance the winter upwelling in the study area, consistent with previous studies. A novel finding in the present study is that the winter bloom center is located north of the upwelling center, attributed to the advection effect of the northward background coastal flow.

TI  - Enhancing ecosystem services in apple orchards: Nest boxes increase pest control by insectivorous birds
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Ecological intensification in croplands aims to enhance biodiversity-based ecosystem services, helping to increase yield while reducing agricultural environmental impacts. Identifying ecological intensification tools of wide applicability and easily implemented by farmers is, therefore, an imperative. Here, we verify the efficiency of provisioning artificial nest boxes for insectivorous birds to reinforce pest biological control in apple orchards.2. The study was conducted in 24 cider-apple orchards in Asturias (NW Spain) over 3 years. We compared the effect of insectivorous birds between orchards with and without nest boxes occupied by different bird species, through insectivory estimates based on attack on a sentinel pest and measurements of arthropod abundance in apple trees. We also identified preys that birds of different species captured to feed nestlings.3. Bird occupancy of nest boxes was widespread, ranging 25.0%-33.3% each year. Great tit was the dominant species, followed by blue tit and, occasionally, common redstart.4. Predation pressure on apple pests increased in orchards with nest boxes, as judged by the increased proportion of sentinel models attacked by birds (34.9% increase in 2018 and 41.1% in 2019), decreased biomass of tree-dwelling arthropods (-51.7%) and reduced probability of apple pest occurrence (from 57% to 40%), compared to orchards without nest boxes.5.Nesting species showed different predatory roles in apple orchards. Fewer attacks on sentinel pests but lower arthropod biomass was associated with blue tit rather than great tit. Besides, blue tit fed nestlings at a faster rate and included in their diet a higher proportion of apple pests than great tit, which preyed mostly on other herbivorous insects.6. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated the usefulness of nest boxes for insectivorous birds in enhancing biological control of apple pests at a regional scale, identifying tit species as complementary predators of apple pests and herbivores. From the farmers' perspective, providing nest boxes in orchards may represent an efficient, easy to implement, cheap and attractive measure of ecological intensification, compatible with other actions fostering biodiversity in croplands.

TI  - Fetal heart rate nadir during bradycardia and umbilical artery acidemia at birth
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Fetal bradycardia due to sentinel events such as placental abruption, cord prolapse or uterine rupture is associated with an increased risk of acidemia at birth. In the absence of a sentinel event, data regarding neonatal prognosis are scarce, and it seems plausible that the depth of bradycardia might be associated with an increased risk of acidosis at birth. The objective was to determine whether the depth of bradycardia is associated with a higher risk of umbilical artery acidemia at birth in term singleton pregnancies requiring cesarean delivery during labor.Material and methods A retrospective comparative study of all cesarean deliveries for bradycardia in an academic tertiary center in the 6-year period of 2013-2018, among term singleton pregnancies. Bradycardia associated with a sentinel event such as placental abruption, cord prolapse or uterine rupture, were excluded. The nadir of the bradycardia was defined as the lowest fetal heart rate baseline lasting at least 3 minutes during bradycardia. Women who delivered an infant with an umbilical pH at birth <7.00 (acidosis group) were compared with women who delivered an infant with an umbilical pH at birth >= 7.00 (non-acidosis group).Results Among 111 eligible cases, 32 women in the acidosis group were compared with 79 in the non-acidosis group. The median nadir of the bradycardia was lower in the acidosis than in the non-acidosis group (60 bpm, interquartile range [56-65] vs 70 [60-76], P < .01). A bradycardia nadir <60 bpm emerged as the optimal threshold for predicting acidemia and was more frequently observed in the acidosis than in the non-acidosis group (10 [31%] vs 10 [13%], P = .02). In the multivariable analysis, a nadir <60 bpm was independently associated with an umbilical artery pH <7.00 (adjusted OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.10-9.04).Conclusions A bradycardia nadir <60 bpm was associated with a tripled risk of umbilical artery acidemia at birth.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of sea surface temperature increases resulting from the thermal discharge of coastal power plants in China
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The operation of coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants (CNATPPs) can cause regional sea surface temperature (SST) increases. To assess their effects on coastal ecosystems, the scope and extent of their impacts must be understood. We aimed to quantitatively assess the SST increases caused by thermal discharge under climate warming by comparing SSTs between control and test groups and among different offshore buffer zones based on daily MODIS SST data from 2002 to 2017. The results showed that (1) a good correlation occurred between the CNATPP installed capacity and SST increase in the 0-2 km offshore waters; (2) the SST increase caused by thermal discharge was the largest in summer and the smallest in winter; and (3) the effect of thermal discharge occurred within 2 km offshore when the installed capacity exceeded 2000 MW and extended to 5 km when it reaches more than 4000 MW.

TI  - A new vector-based global river network dataset accounting for variable drainage density
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Spatial variability of river network drainage density (D-d) is a key feature of river systems, yet few existing global hydrography datasets have properly accounted for it. Here, we present a new vector-based global hydrography that reasonably estimates the spatial variability of D-d worldwide. It is built by delineating channels from the latest 90-m Multi-Error-Removed Improved Terrain (MERIT) digital elevation model and flow direction/accumulation. A machine learning approach is developed to estimate D-d based on the global watershed-level climatic, topographic, hydrologic, and geologic conditions, where relationships between hydroclimate factors and D-d are trained using the high-quality National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlusV2) data. By benchmarking our dataset against HydroSHEDS and several regional hydrography datasets, we show the new river flowlines are in much better agreement with Landsat-derived centerlines, and improved D-d patterns of river networks (totaling similar to 75 million kilometers in length) are obtained. Basins and estimates of intermittent stream fraction are also delineated to support water resources management. This new dataset (MERIT Hydro-Vector) should enable full global modeling of river system processes at fine spatial resolutions.

TI  - Enhanced drought detection and monitoring using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence over Hulun Buir Grassland, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most damaging events in the grassland ecosystem. The detection and monitoring of drought are very important to maintain the balance of the grassland ecosystem. The potential of Sun-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) for drought detection and monitoring were explored in this study. Based on significant negative anomalies of self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), precipitation (PPT), soil moisture (SM),surface water storage (SWS), and a significant positive anomaly of land surface temperature (LST), a severe drought event was accurately detected from June to August in 2016 over Hulun Buir Grassland. The far-red SIF was decomposed into its mechanical parts such as SIF, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), normalized by APAR (SIFyield), physiological SIF emission yield (SIFpey), and total emitted SIF (SIFte), which were more sensitive to drought than the vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV). SIF and NIRV represented the SIF indicators and the VIs, respectively, which were most affected by drought, with a decrease of -2.67% and 4.19% in June, 50.93% and 31.76% in July, and 55.58% and 39.44% in August. The correlations between anomalies of SIF indicators, VIs, and anomalies of LST, wind speed (WS) were a strong negative correlation, indicating that their reduction was caused by the anomalies of LST and WS. Moreover, the SIF indicators had a shorter lag time in response to meteorological drought than VIs. Besides, the correlations between SIF-based drought indices such as drought fluorescence monitoring index (DFMI), SIF health index (SHI), and SM were - 0.709 and - 0.783 (P < 0.01), respectively, higher than the conventional drought indices. Moreover, DFMI and SHI could reflect the changes of SM in advance, while the conventional drought indices mostly lagged behind the changes of SM. This study shows that SIF can enhance drought detection, and the SIF-based drought index can be well suitable for drought monitoring. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landfall season is critical to the impact of a cyclone on a monsoon-regulated tropical coastal lagoon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclones can produce a wide variety of short-term and long-term ecological impacts on coastal lagoons depending on cyclone's physical-meteorological characteristics and the lagoon's geographic, geomorphic, and bathymetric characteristics. Here, we theorized that in monsoon regulated tropical coastal lagoons, another important factor that could determine the impact of a cyclone is the landfall season or time of the year with reference to the monsoon season. We analyzed the impact of two cyclones which made landfall near Chilika, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon in different seasons, Cyclone Fani and Titli before and after the monsoon season. We compared field measured and satellite-derived water quality parameters including nutrient, salinity, water temperature, transparency, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) before and after the cyclones. We found that although both the cyclones were of similar intensities, after their land interaction, their impact on the lagoon's water quality was contrasting. The post-monsoon cyclone produced a substantial increase in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP), a large drop in salinity, CDOM, and Chl-a. In contrast, after the pre-monsoon cyclone, TN and TP did not show any such hike, no substantial change in salinity and CDOM either, and only a slight increase in Chl-a was observed. We found that the controlling factor in determining the impact of a cyclone is the rate and duration of freshwater discharge to the lagoon, which is normally a strong pulse for pre-monsoon and a continued high flow for post-monsoon cyclones. We conclude that the antecedent conditions of the lagoon and the watershed at the time of a cyclone's landfall is a key criterion in determining the impact. The combined use of satellite data and field data was proved critical to capture the overall impact of cyclones on the hydrological characteristics of the monsoon-regulated coastal lagoon.

TI  - A reconstruction of the recent fire regimes of Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, using remote sensing
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fire is an important process that shapes the structure and functioning of African savanna ecosystems, and managers of savanna protected areas use fire to achieve ecosystem goals. Developing appropriate fire management policies should be based on an understanding of the determinants, features, and effects of prevailing fire regimes, but this information is rarely available. In this study, we report on the use of remote sensing to develop a spatially explicit dataset on past fire regimes in Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, between 2001 and 2019. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images were used to evaluate the recent fire regime for two distinct vegetation types in Majete Wildlife Reserve, namely savanna and miombo. Additionally, a comparison was made between MODIS and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) images by separately evaluating selected aspects of the fire regime between 2012 and 2019. Results Mean fire return intervals were four and six years for miombo and savanna vegetation, respectively, but the distribution of fire return intervals was skewed, with a large proportion of the area burning annually or biennially, and a smaller proportion experiencing much longer fire return intervals. Variation in inter-annual rainfall also resulted in longer fire return intervals during cycles of below-average rainfall. Fires were concentrated in the hot-dry season despite a management intent to restrict burning to the cool-dry season. Mean fire intensities were generally low, but many individual fires had intensities of 14 to 18 times higher than the mean, especially in the hot-dry season. The VIIRS sensors detected many fires that were overlooked by the MODIS sensors, as images were collected at a finer scale. Conclusions Remote sensing has provided a useful basis for reconstructing the recent fire regime of Majete Wildlife Reserve, and has highlighted a current mismatch between intended fire management goals and actual trends. Managers should re-evaluate fire policies based on our findings, setting clearly defined targets for the different vegetation types and introducing flexibility to accommodate natural variation in rainfall cycles. Local evidence of the links between fires and ecological outcomes will require further research to improve fire planning.

TI  - Vegetation Monitoring Optimization With Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Evapotranspiration Using Remote Sensing Measurements and Land Surface Models Over East Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of people in East Africa rely on the agro-pastoral system for their livelihood, which is highly vulnerable to droughts and flooding. Agro-pastoral droughts are endemic to the region and are considered the main natural hazard that contributes to food insecurity. Drought begins with rainfall deficit, gradually leading to soil moisture deficit, higher land surface temperature, and finally impacts to vegetation growth. Therefore, monitoring vegetation conditions is essential in understanding the progression of drought, potential effects on food security, and providing early warning information needed for drought mitigation decisions. Because vegetation processes couple the land and atmosphere, monitoring of vegetation conditions requires consideration of both water provision and demand. While there is consensus in using either the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or evapotranspiration (ET) for vegetation monitoring, a comprehensive assessment optimizing the use of both has not yet been done. Moreover, the evaluation methods for understanding the relationships between NDVI and ET for vegetation monitoring are also limited. Taking these gaps into account we have developed a framework to optimize vegetation monitoring using both NDVI and ET by identifying where they perform the best by using triple collocation and cross-correlation methods. We estimated the random error structure in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI; ET from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model; and ET from land surface models (LSMs). LSM ET and SSEBop ET have been found to be better indicators for vegetation monitoring during extreme drought events, while NDVI could provide better information on vegetation condition during wetter than normal conditions. The random error structures of these variables suggest that LSM ET is most likely to provide important information for vegetation monitoring over low and high ends of the vegetation fraction areas. Over moderate vegetative areas, any of these variables could provide important vegetation information for drought characterization and food security assessments. While this study provides a framework for optimizing vegetation monitoring for drought and food security assessments over East Africa, the framework can be adopted to optimize vegetation monitoring over any other drought and food insecure region of the world.

TI  - Clinical implications of intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer for sentinel node status
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node status is an important prognostic factor for breast cancer patients and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a less invasive surgical proxy. We examined if consecutively derived molecular subtypes from primary breast cancers provide additional predictive value for SLNB status. 1556 patients with a breast cancer>10 mm underwent primary surgical procedure including SLNB and tumor specimens were assigned with a transcriptomics-based molecular subtype. 1020 patients had a negative sentinel node (SN) and 536 a positive. A significant association between tumor size and SN status (p<0.0001) was found across all samples, but no association between size and SN status (p=0.14) was found for BasL tumors. A BasL subtype was a predictor of an SN-negative status (p=0.001, OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38;0.90) and among the BasL, postmenopausal status was a predictor for SN-negative status (p=0.01). Overall survival was significantly lower (p=0.02) in patients with BasL tumors and a positive SN. Interestingly, we identified a significant correlation between hormone receptor activity and SN status within the BasL subtype. Taken together, molecular subtypes and hormone receptor activity of breast cancers add predictive value for SLNB status.

TI  - Automatically selecting hot and cold pixels for satellite actual evapotranspiration estimation under different topographic and climatic conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) over the regions suffering from water scarcity is critical for sustainable agricultural water management. Remote sensing provides time- and cost-effective capability to investigate daily ET rates at large scales. Satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) algorithms typically rely on specifying the upper and lower boundaries of ETa rate over agricultural and pasture fields, commonly known as hot (dry) and cold (wet) pixels selection. These boundaries are to be recognized by an expert through a subjective and labor-intensive task. In this study, a method has been introduced to automatically select appropriate anchor pixels (i.e., hot and cold pixels) independent from land use/cover maps with the simplest possible way, quickly applied even by an inexperienced operator. Subsequently, ETa was calculated using Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), and Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithms and evaluated against measured data. In this method, the mountains and foothills were removed using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and the subsequent product was a slope mask. Then, filters were applied based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Albedo, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) images to identify potential candidate pixels for hot and cold pixels. In the end, the best-conditioned pixel being closest to the meteorological station was selected. The method was assessed in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions. The selected pixels were first visually validated in Landsat images, and then the fluctuations and values were discussed in time series of anchor pixels and LST histograms. The visual interpretation was indicative of selecting the anchor pixels in fallow (hot pixel) and densely vegetated (cold pixel) surfaces. Also, the hot and cold pixels were suitably situated in the upper and lower quartiles of the LST histogram, respectively. The range of cold pixels variations throughout the study periods was lower compared with the hot pixels (44.2, 55.3, 35.5, 66.5, and 25.2 K for hot pixels against 34.2, 45.7, 25.6, 52.2, and 17 K for cold pixels) as expected, which emanated from the lower fluctuations of temperature over vegetation against the soil. The results were indicative of the better performance of METRIC compared with SEBAL and SEBS with greater values of R-2 in all the regions. Therefore, using the introduced method, the expert subjective interference was eliminated and processing time reduced significantly from about 1 h per image to a few minutes.

TI  - A new look at the Butic Canal, Egypt
T2  - E&G QUATERNARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Butic Canal - a Roman period transversal route across the northern Nile Delta - was the longest artificial watercourse in the Nile Delta, yet it remains very poorly understood. To date, the canal has not yet been verified by archeological excavations. The route of the eastern section of the canal has been indirectly identified based on a linear elevated feature most likely representing earth from the excavation of the canal. This study combines the analysis of historical sources and remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery and the TanDEM-X digital elevation model, in order to discuss its date of construction, route, and functions. Based on the data of the digital elevation model, new constructional features are visible in the eastern delta providing the first detailed route of a Roman-era artificial watercourse in Egypt. It is suggested that the canal's construction is placed in the context of imperial investments in the infrastructure of the eastern part of the Roman empire.

TI  - Validation and inter-comparison of MODIS and VIIRS aerosol optical depth products against data from multiple observation networks over East China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on ground-based aerosol optical property observations from the Central China Comprehensive Experimental Site and Aerosol Robotic Network, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products between January 2016 and February 2020 over East China were evaluated and compared on both regional and site scales. In addition, the relationship between the retrieval error and season, the ?ngstro?m exponent, and real AOD values was investigated. The results revealed that on the regional scale, the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm outperformed Dark Target (DT) for all three platforms of Terra/Aqua MODIS and NPP VIIRS (with 57%, 57%, and 70%, respectively, of collocations falling within the expected error range), yet the MODIS DB AOD failed to reach a satisfactory result of at least 67% matchups falling within the expected error range. On the site scale, the VIIRS DB aerosol products were the best over most cropland sites. The AOD retrieval errors at some cropland sites exhibited seasonal patterns, which might be related to field burning events and long-distance transport. The results indicate that the DT algorithm of both MODIS 10-km AOD and VIIRS products over croplands in East China needs further improvement.

TI  - Detection of multi-drug resistance and AmpC β-lactamase/extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes in bacterial isolates of loggerhead sea turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) from the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea turtles are useful sentinels to monitor the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the marine coastal ecosystems. Forty Gram negative bacteria were isolated from wounds of 52 injured Caretta caretta, living in the Mediterranean Sea. Bacteria were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and tested for susceptibility to 15 antibiotics. In addition, NGS amplicon sequencing was performed to detect the presence of AmpC beta-lac-tamase genes (bla(AmpC)) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes (bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(TEM)). Seventy-five percent of the isolates (30/40 isolates) exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes and 32.5% (13/40 isolates) were confirmed to be positive for at least one gene. The variants of ESBLs genes were bla(CTX-M-3), bla(TEM-236) and bla(SHV-12). Variants of the blaAmpC beta-lactamase gene i.e., bla(ACT-24), bla(ACT-2), blaACT-17, bla(DHA-4) and bla(CMY)-(37), were also detected. In addition, 4 isolates were found simultaneously harboring CTX and AmpC genes while 2 strains harbored 3 genes (bla(ACT-2+TEM-236+SHV-12), and bla(CTX-M-3+ACT-24+TEM-236)).

TI  - An eco-parametric method to derive sedimentation rates for coastal saltmarshes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The saltmarsh plant Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Jiangsu coasts, China and serves as an ecological engineer to reduce near-bed shear stress, trap fine-grained sediments and protect the coast from wave-induced erosion. The saltmarshes thus could record the Spartina colonization-driven changes within the sedimentary layers. Based on these ecological and sedimentological changes in sediments, we present a new eco-parametric method to estimate the sedimentation rate for the newly-formed wetlands in the Yancheng Wetland Nature Reserve for Rare Birds, Jiangsu. Sediment cores and satellite imagery were used to identify the thickness of accumulated sediment layers and the time since the Spartina colonization. We defined the original ground on which Spartina alterniflora initially colonized using pigment concentrations, grain size and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic matter (delta C-13) in sediments. We also determined the time mark of the Spartina colonization by examining the Landsat images over 1982-2018 to discriminate the Spartina alterniflora from other native plants and geomorphological features. These two datasets yielded a sedimentation rate of 3.3 cm/yr for Core A and of 9.6 cm/yr for Core B, the latter evidenced by an increase of similar to 0.51 m in the bed level from 2008 to 2014. Combining the Pb-210 dating method, we further estimated the sedimentation rate for the layers beneath the original ground, which was comparable to that of the bare flats in the Jiangsu coast. Even though this new method is only applicable to newly-formed saltmarshes, it helps identify the recent sedimentation events as well as reveal the environmental changes and the evolution of saltmarsh-bare flat systems due to the interplay between vegetation, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. It thus could be an efficient and cost-effective tool for an improved understanding of the response of coastal wetlands to a changing climate/environment. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Tree species richness and diversity predicts the magnitude of urban heat island mitigation effects of greenspaces
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) is awidely recognised phenomenon that profoundly affects the quality of life for urban citizens. Urban greenspace can help mitigate the UHIE, but the characteristics that determine the extent to which any given greenspace can cool an urban area are not well understood. A key characteristic is likely to be the properties of trees that are found in a greenspace. Here, we explore the sensitivity of the strength of the cooling effect to tree community structure for greenspaces in Changzhou, China. Land surface temperatures were retrieved from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS and were used to evaluate the temperature drop amplitude (TDA) and cooling range (CR) of 15 greenspaces across each of the four seasons. Tree community structure of the greenspaces was investigated using 156 sample plots across the 15 greenspaces. We found that a number of plant community structure indicators of greenspaces have a significant impact on the strength of the cooling effect. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, tree species richness and tree canopy coverage of greenspaces are all positively correlated with the magnitude of the temperature drop amplitude, with the strength of their influence varying seasonally. We also find that mean crown width is positively correlated with cooling range in summer and autumn, while greenspace tree density is negatively correlated with cooling range in winter. Our findings improve understanding of the relationship between plant community structure and the cooling effect of greenspaces. In particular, wehighlight the important role that tree species diversity provides for mitigating the UHIE, and suggest that if planners wish to improve the role of urban greenspaces in cooling cities, they should include a higher diversity of trees species.

TI  - Quality of recovery scores in deep serratus anterior plane block vs. sham block in ambulatory breast cancer surgery: a randomised controlled trial
T2  - ANAESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep serratus anterior plane block has been widely adopted as an analgesic adjunct for patients undergoing breast surgery, but robust supporting evidence of efficacy is lacking. We randomly allocated 40 patients undergoing simple or partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy to receive either a pre-operative deep serratus anterior plane block (serratus group) or a placebo injection (sham group), in addition to systemic analgesia. The primary outcome measure was the quality of recovery score at discharge, as assessed by the quality of recovery-15 questionnaire at various time-points. Secondary analgesic outcomes included: pain severity; postoperative opioid consumption; opioid-related side-effects; patient satisfaction up to 7 days postoperatively; and persistent postoperative pain up to 3 months after surgery. All patients who were recruited completed the study. There were no differences in the quality of recovery-15 scores between patients in the serratus and control groups, with mean (SD) scores of 96 (14) and 102 (20) for the control and serratus groups, respectively. We were also unable to detect differences in any of the secondary analgesic outcomes examined. The addition of a deep serratus anterior plane block to systemic analgesia does not enhance quality of recovery in patients undergoing ambulatory breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Within-farm wheat yield forecasting incorporating off-farm information
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As farming practices become increasingly automated, the quantity of high resolution on-farm production information grows exponentially and so does the need for high-throughput computing solutions to aid management. High resolution (5 m) wheat yield forecasting is presented here using two machine learning approaches: (a) Bootstrapped Regression Trees (BRR) where predictions are pixel-wise and (b) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) where predictions use neighbouring pixels. This study focused on three aims. First, to compare the two approaches in a yield forecasting task that included publicly available data and on-farm gathered yield data. Second, to study any benefit of adding more layers of information in the modelling process, e.g. proximal soil sensing surveys. Third, to evaluate the value of including information from contiguous neighbouring fields in order to forecast within-field wheat yield at harvest. Results showed that BRR modelling using publicly available Sentinel data with the addition of local electromagnetic induction surveys or gamma radiometric surveys produced the best forecasts as determined by the classical performance metrics. The results from the CNN models improved with the addition of publicly available data from neighbouring fields and produced a spatial distribution pattern that most closely resembled the actual yield data. Within-field yield forecasting using machine learning techniques and publicly available data shows good potential, and this work suggests that the choice of yield forecasting methodology may depend on the type and extent of spatial data that is available for use in forecasting.

TI  - Winter Habitat Indices (WHIs) for the contiguous US and their relationship with winter bird diversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal dynamics of snow cover strongly affect ecosystem processes and winter habitat, making them an important driver of terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites can capture these dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales, allowing for the development of indices with specific application in ecological research and predicting biodiversity. Here, our primary objective was to derive winter habitat indices (WHIs) from MODIS that quantify snow season length, snow cover variability, and the prevalence of frozen ground without snow as a proxy for subnivium conditions. We calculated the WHIs for the full snow year (Aug-Jul) and winter months (Dec-Feb) across the contiguous US from 2003/04 to 2017/18 and validated them with ground-based data from 797 meteorological stations. To demonstrate the potential of the WHIs for biodiversity assessments, we modeled their relationships with winter bird species richness derived from eBird observations. The WHIs had clear spatial patterns reflecting both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in snow cover. Snow season length was generally longer at higher latitudes and elevations, while snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow were highest across low elevations of the mid latitudes. Variability in the WHIs was largely driven by elevation in the West and by latitude in the East. Snow season length and frozen ground without snow were most accurately mapped, and had correlations with station data across all years of 0.91 and 0.85, respectively. Snow cover variability was accurately mapped for winter (r = 0.79), but not for the full snow year (r = -0.21). The model containing all three WHIs used to predict winter bird species richness patterns across the contiguous US was by far the best, demonstrating the individual value of each index. Regions with longer snow seasons generally supported fewer species. Species richness increased steadily up to moderate levels of snow cover variability and frozen ground without snow, after which it steeply declined. Our results show that the MODIS WHIs accurately characterized unique gradients of snow cover dynamics and provided important information on winter habitat conditions for birds, highlighting their potential for ecological research and conservation planning.

TI  - Estimation of hourly PM<sub>1</sub> concentration in China and its application in population exposure analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate pollution is closely related to public health. PM1 (particles with an aerodynamic size not larger than 1 mu m) is much more harmful than particles with larger sizes because it goes deeper into the body and hence arouses social concern. However, the sparse and unevenly distributed ground-based observations limit the understanding of spatio-temporal distributions of PM1 in China. In this study, hourly PM1 concentrations in central and eastern China were retrieved based on a random forest model using hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Himawari-8, meteorological and geographic information as inputs. Here the spatiotemporal autocorrelation of PM1 was also considered in the model. Experimental results indicate that although the performance of the proposed model shows diurnal, seasonal and spatial variations, it is relatively better than others, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.83 calculated based on the 10-fold cross validation method. Geographical map implies that PM1 pollution level in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is much higher than in other regions, with the mean value of similar to 55 mu g/m(3). Based on the exposure analysis, we found about 75% of the population lives in an environment with PM1 higher than 35 mu g/m(3) in the whole study area. The retrieval dataset in this study is of great significance for further exploring the impact of PM1 on public health. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A novel approach for quantifying high-frequency urban land cover changes at the block level with scarce clear-sky Landsat observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency and complex transitions are two important characteristics of urban land cover changes (ULCCs). However, the change magnitude and duration of ULCCs have rarely been discussed in the context of high-frequency ULCCs. Moreover, previous models for quantifying high-frequency changes commonly required numerous clear-sky observations. Such requirement is difficult to be satisfied in widespread cloud-prone cities. Considering these characteristics of ULCCs and data availability, we developed a novel approach that can comprehensively quantify ULCCs with relatively limited data. The approach successfully integrated two commonly used approaches in change detection, namely temporal segmentation and trajectory classification. In addition, sparse clear-sky observations were used in the time series of fractional land cover (TSFLC). Specifically, we first conducted classifications for each year, and then extracted the TSFLC from each block. Second, we used temporal segmentation to segment the TSFLC based on the local change trend. Third, we classified the segments of time series by trajectory classification, and recorded the change information. The proposed approach can provide comprehensive details for ULCCs including the frequency of changes during the observation time, the transition, the change time, and the change magnitude for each change. The approach quantifies multiple changes with a slightly higher accuracy (93.33%) than that of previous approaches for only one change (91.00%). The categories/ transitions of ULCC were also quantified, with an accuracy of 81.67%. Moreover, the approach effectively monitored ULCCs in a cloud-prone city and successfully captured and analyzed two common transitions, block construction and urban renewal. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing complete and accurate ULCC information with scarce clear-sky observations.

TI  - Preliminary study of AI-assisted diagnosis using FDG-PET/CT for axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To improve the diagnostic accuracy of axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis in breast cancer patients using 2-[F-18]FDG-PET/CT, we constructed an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis system that uses deep-learning technologies. Materials and methods Two clinicians and the new AI system retrospectively analyzed and diagnosed 414 axillae of 407 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who had undergone 2-[F-18]FDG-PET/CT before a mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with a sentinel lymph node (LN) biopsy and/or axillary LN dissection. We designed and trained a deep 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) as the AI model. The diagnoses from the clinicians were blended with the diagnoses from the AI model to improve the diagnostic accuracy. Results Although the AI model did not outperform the clinicians, the diagnostic accuracies of the clinicians were considerably improved by collaborating with the AI model: the two clinicians' sensitivities of 59.8% and 57.4% increased to 68.6% and 64.2%, respectively, whereas the clinicians' specificities of 99.0% and 99.5% remained unchanged. Conclusions It is expected that AI using deep-learning technologies will be useful in diagnosing axillary LN metastasis using 2-[F-18]FDG-PET/CT. Even if the diagnostic performance of AI is not better than that of clinicians, taking AI diagnoses into consideration may positively impact the overall diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - A Robust Stereo Positioning Solution for Multiview Spaceborne SAR Images Based on the Range-Doppler Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the stereo positioning technology based on multiview spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been widely applied in digital surface model extraction. In this letter, problems of the existing methods based on the range-Doppler (RD) model in a multiview stereo solution are pointed out. A robust stereo positioning solution for multiview spaceborne SAR images based on the RD model is proposed. In the proposed method, the traditional RD model is normalized to reduce the model errors caused by the different scales of the range equation and Doppler equation. A weighting strategy is also proposed to improve the positioning accuracy. This strategy is useful for multiview stereo positioning when using images of different satellites with orbital data of different accuracies. The experiments based on GaoFen-3 and TerraSAR-X satellite data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Space-based observation of a high-altitude red-coloured glacial lake in Ladakh, Northwest Himalaya, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports the existence of a unique and unusual feature of the Zanskar valley, Ladakh, India - a proglacial 'red/brown-coloured lake' observed from space-based remote sensing data. The lake has not changed in colour and size over the years. Here we report observations from 2004 onwards till recently. The local geology plays an important role, and iron-dominated lithology of the region interacts with snow and glacial meltwaters and subsequently deposits red/brown-coloured suspended silt in this proglacial lake. Spectral analysis of reflectance data from Sentinel-2 images in visible-infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum suggests that the colour of the lake is due to high concentration of suspended solids, having dominant reflectance at 660-700 nm and thus causing the red/brown colour of the water.

TI  - Using farmer observations for animal health syndromic surveillance: Participation and performance of an online enhanced passive surveillance system
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenge of animal health surveillance is to provide the information necessary to appropriately inform disease prevention and control activities within the constraints of available resources. Syndromic surveillance of farmers? disease observations can improve animal health data capture from extensive livestock farming systems, especially where data are not otherwise being systematically collected or when data on confirmed aetiological diagnoses are unavailable at the disease level. As it is rarely feasible to recruit a truly random sample of farmers to provide observational reports, directing farmer sampling to align with the surveillance objectives is a reasonable and practical approach. As long as potential bias is recognised and managed, farmers who will report reliably can be desirable participants in a surveillance system. Thus, one early objective of a surveillance program should be to identify characteristics associated with reporting behaviour. Knowledge of the demographic and managerial characteristics of good reporters can inform efforts to recruit additional farms into the system or aid understanding of potential bias of system reports. We describe the operation of a farmer syndromic surveillance system in Victoria, Australia, over its first two years from 2014 to 2016. Survival analysis and classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify farm level factors associated with ?reliable? participation (low non-response rates in longitudinal reporting). Response rate and timeliness were not associated with whether farmers had disease to report, or with different months of the year. Farmers keeping only sheep were the most reliable and timely respondents. Farmers < 43 years of age had lower response rates than older farmers. Farmers with veterinary qualifications and those working full-time on-farm provided less timely reports than other educational backgrounds and farmers who worked part-time on-farm. These analyses provide a starting point to guide recruitment of participants for surveillance of farmers? observations using syndromic surveillance, and provide examples of strengths and weaknesses of syndromic surveillance systems for extensively-managed livestock. Once farm characteristics associated with reliable participation are known, they can be incorporated into surveillance system design in accordance with the objectives of the system.

TI  - Low incidence of pulmonary metastases in vulvar cancer patients: limited value of routine chest imaging based on a cohort study
T2  - BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the incidence of pulmonary metastases in the preoperative work-up of patients with primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Design Retrospective cohort study.Setting Tertiary referral centre.Population Patients treated for primary vulvar SCC from 2000 to 2018.Methods The pre-operative chest imaging of 452 consecutively treated patients was documented with a minimal follow-up period of 2 years.Mean outcome measures Incidence of pulmonary metastases, frequency of chest imaging and subsequent coincidental findings.Results In total, 80.8% of patients underwent pre-operative chest imaging. Seven patients (1.9%), with a median tumour size of 80 mm, presented with pulmonary metastases. None of the patients with early stage disease and tumour size <40 mm who underwent radical local excision (RLE) with sentinel node (SN)-procedure, was diagnosed with pulmonary metastasis. Chest imaging was performed by radiography (58.9%) and computerised tomography (CT) (41.1%). Coincidental findings were reported in 40.7% of patients who underwent CT, compared with 15.8% of patients undergoing radiography, resulting in additional diagnostics in 14.7 and 19.7% and being of limited consequence for outcome in 2.9 and 3.3%, respectively.Conclusions The incidence of pulmonary metastases in patients with primary vulvar SCC is extremely low, and none in patients with early stage disease undergoing the SN procedure. Chest imaging was performed in the majority of patients and was associated with frequent coincidental findings leading to clinically irrelevant diagnostic procedures. Therefore, we recommend omitting chest imaging in patients with early stage disease and tumours <40 mm, considering chest CT only in patients with large tumours and/or advanced stage disease.

TI  - Dominance of natural aerosols over India in pre-monsoon: inferences from the lockdown effects
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in absorbing and composite aerosols over India during the first phase of lockdown are examined, using multi-satellite observations. While MODIS shows -16.17 +/- 1.35% reduction in AOD over the Indian landmass, OMI shows a decrease of -22.4 +/- 1.36% (-26.2 +/- 1.17%) in AOD (AAOD). Considerable fraction of this AOD difference is contributed by the changes in aerosols at higher altitudes. While reduction in AOD of -38.05 +/- 1.06% (-39.4 +/- 1.12), -23.02 +/- 2.63% (-17.08 +/- 2.12) and -18.98 +/- 2.86% (-28.38 +/- 2.39%) is observed over IGP, Northwest and Southern Peninsula respectively from MODIS (OMI), enhancement in AOD of 5.16 +/- 2.44% (6.82 +/- 2.86%) is seen over Centralwest India. Reduction in absorbing aerosols over IGP is -39.18 +/- 1.25%, whereas that over Southern Peninsula is -33.1 +/- 2.03%. These changes are significantly contributed by the changes in dust aerosols, in addition to the decrease in anthropogenic aerosols. Though there is a reduction in aerosol loading, compared to previous years, gradual increase in AOD and AAOD is seen even during the lockdown period due to strengthening of dust transport. Moreover, the reduction in total (absorbing) aerosol loading over India during the lockdown phase is only 20% (26%), with significant contribution from higher altitudes, even in the absence of major anthropogenic sources. These results show the dominance of natural aerosols over India during pre-monsoon.

TI  - Cost containment by peer prior authorization program for second line treatment in patients with retinal disease
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background High and increasing drug prices have prompted the establishment of a broad range of cost-containment treatment policies in health systems globally. In 2012, the supplemental insurance program of a large Israeli health maintenance organization (Clalit Health Services) introduced a prior authorization process for second-line use of ranibizumab in patients with retinal disease for whom treatment with bevacizumab proved to be ineffective. A Clalit steering committee established authorization criteria based on cost and periodically updated clinical considerations, while a team of ophthalmic specialists evaluated their colleagues' individual patient subsidization requests, based on the funding criteria. The objectives of this study were to detail this unique authorization process and study its effectiveness in limiting unwarranted spending, while allowing for a smooth transition to a second-line more expensive drug when needed. Methods A retrospective cohort study including all applications for a first or ongoing treatment with ranibizumab, for one or both eyes, received during March 1, 2012 - December 31, 2015. The key parameters examined were percentages of requests from patients treated by first line treatment bevacizumab, requests approved, reapplications, and results. Requests studied include reapplications and requests for treatment continuation. Results During the study period, Clalit affiliated ophthalmologists' submitted 16,778 funding applications for intravitreal ranibizumab treatment on behalf of 5642 patients who applied for approximately three applications. An efficient sentinel effect was achieved, resulting in only 31% of patients treated with bevacizumab applying for treatment, while maintaining extremely high accessibility to second line treatment with almost 95% of requests being approved. Conclusions The data presented shows a low request rate for funding with a high approval rate, proving this peer reviewed report-based authorization process successfully achieved a sentinel effect while controlling cost. We suggest this innovative model be considered in similar decisions processes.

TI  - The complex multi-sectoral impacts of drought: Evidence from a mountainous basin in the Central Spanish Pyrenees
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the impacts of drought severity on a variety of sectors in a topographically complex basin (the upper Aragon basin 2181 km(2)) in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Using diverse data sources including meteorological and hydrological observations, remote sensing and tree rings, we analyze the possible hydrological implications of drought occurrence and severity on water availability in various sectors, including downstream impacts on irrigation water supply for crop production. Results suggest varying responses in forest activity, secondary growth, plant phenology, and crop yield to drought impacts. Specifically, meteorological droughts have distinct impacts downstream, mainly due to water partitioning between streamflow and irrigation channels that transport water to crop producing areas. This implies that drought severity can extend beyond the physical boundaries of the basin, with impacts on crop productivity. This complex response to drought impacts makes it difficult to develop objective basin-scale operational definitions for monitoring drought severity. Moreover, given the high spatial variability in responses to drought across sectors, it is difficult to establish reliable drought thresholds from indices that are relevant across all socio-economic sectors. The anthropogenic impacts (e.g. water regulation projects, ecosystem services, land cover and land use changes) pose further challenges to assessing the response of different systems to drought severity. This study stresses the need to consider the seasonality of drought impacts and appropriate drought time scales to adequately assess and understand their complexity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A dataset of remote-sensed Forel-Ule Index for global inland waters during 2000-2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Water colour is the result of its constituents and their interactions with solar irradiance; this forms the basis for water quality monitoring using optical remote sensing data. The Forel-Ule Index (FUI) is a useful comprehensive indicator to show the water colour variability and water quality change in both inland waters and oceans. In recent decades, lakes around the world have experienced dramatic changes in water quality under pressure from both climate change and anthropogenic activities. However, acquiring consistent water colour products for global lakes has been a challenge. In this paper we present the first time series FUI dataset for large global lakes from 2000-2018 based on MODIS observations. This dataset provides significant information on spatial and temporal changes of water colour for global large lakes during the past 19 years. It will be valuable to studies in search of the drivers of global and regional lake colour change, and the interaction mechanisms between water colour, hydrological factors, climate change, and anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Aircraft-based inversions quantify the importance of wetlands and livestock for Upper Midwest methane emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply airborne measurements across three seasons (summer, winter and spring 2017-2018) in a multi-inversion framework to quantify methane emissions from the US Corn Belt and Upper Midwest, a key agricultural and wetland source region. Combing our seasonal results with prior fall values we find that wetlands are the largest regional methane source (32 %, 20 [16-23] Gg/d), while livestock (enteric/manure; 25 %, 15 [14-17] Gg/d) are the largest anthropogenic source. Natural gas/petroleum, waste/landfills, and coal mines collectively make up the remainder. Optimized fluxes improve model agreement with independent datasets within and beyond the study timeframe. Inversions reveal coherent and seasonally dependent spatial errors in the WetCHARTs ensemble mean wetland emissions, with an underestimate for the Prairie Pothole region but an overestimate for Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Wetland extent and emission temperature dependence have the largest influence on prediction accuracy; better representation of cou- pled soil temperature-hydrology effects is therefore needed. Our optimized regional livestock emissions agree well with the Gridded EPA estimates during spring (to within 7 %) but are similar to 25 % higher during summer and winter. Spatial analysis further shows good top-down and bottom-up agreement for beef facilities (with mainly enteric emissions) but larger (similar to 30 %) seasonal discrepancies for dairies and hog farms (with > 40 % manure emissions). Findings thus support bottom-up enteric emission estimates but suggest errors for manure; we propose that the latter reflects inadequate treatment of management factors including field application. Overall, our results confirm the importance of intensive animal agriculture for regional methane emissions, implying substantial mitigation opportunities through improved management.

TI  - Polarized observations for advanced atmosphere-ocean algorithms using airborne multi-spectral hyper-angular polarimetric imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne measurements of the linear polarization state of light were carried out over coastal and open ocean conditions to study aerosol and water column properties and investigate the possibility of using a multi-spectral, hyper-angular imaging polarimeter for retrieving aerosol and hydrosol optical properties. The instrument, the Versatile Imager for the Coastal Ocean (VICO), is used to support the analysis of ocean color polarized observations and their implication for future space-borne polarimetry such as the polarimeters planned to be deployed with the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. Several sets of images at different viewing angles from the visible to the near-infrared spectrum were collected and compared with simulations using a vector radiative transfer (VRT) code. The simulations were obtained based on measured seawater inherent optical properties from shipborne instruments and measured atmospheric parameters from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and a shipborne sunphotometer at different locations. An uncertainty method has been derived by propagating uncertainties from the measured polarized radiances. The method demonstrates practicable uncertainty formulations that can be used to construct a measurement uncertainty budget for the polarized data products. Results from VICO and the VRT simulation are consistent for both radiance and polarization spectrum at all the measured viewing angles. The total and polarized water-leaving reflectances are retrieved at four bands and varied geometries. It is also shown that the polarized remote sensing reflectance measured at various angles could be used to distinguish between the aerosols' and hydrosols' optical signatures by exploiting the fact that the polarized reflectance is fairly insensitive to hydrosols for given acquisition geometries. This study thus provides an opportunity to investigate various relationships between the microphysical properties of the oceanic and atmospheric particulates such as refractive index and particle size properties. It also contributes to the development of polarization-based inverse ocean color algorithms. Finally, the provided analysis gives insights for the validation of the ocean color parameters that will be retrieved from the forthcoming polarimetric satellite missions. (C) 2021TheAuthors.

T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Austrian node of the Natural Resources Satellite Remote Sensing Cloud Service Platform was established in 2016 through a cooperation agreement between the Land Satellite Remote Sensing Application Center (LASAC), Ministry of Natural Resources of the Peoples Republic of China and the University of Vienna, Austria. Under this agreement panchromatic and multispectral data of the Chinese ZY-3 satellite are pushed to the server at the University of Vienna for use in education and research. So far, nearly 500 GB of data have been uploaded to the server. This technical note briefly introduces the ZY-3 system and illustrates the implementation of the agreement by the first China-Sat Workshop and several case studies. Some of them are already completed, others are still ongoing. They include a geometric accuracy validation of ZY-3 data, an animated visualization of image quick views on a spherical display to demonstrate the time series of the image coverage for Austria and Laos, and the use of ZY-3 data to study the spread of bark beetle in the province of Lower Austria. An accuracy study of DTMs from ZY-3 stereo data, as well as a land cover analysis and comparison of Austria with ZY-3 and other sensors are still ongoing.

TI  - The use of satellite data to support the structural health monitoring in areas affected by slow-moving landslides: a potential application to reinforced concrete buildings
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The building stock around the world is exposed to different types of natural actions such as earthquakes or landslides. In particular, Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides. Mitigation of landslide risk is a topic of great interest for the evaluation and management of its consequences. Periodical monitoring of the landslide-induced damage on structures require high costs due to the large number of exposed elements. With respect to the reinforced concrete structures, slow-moving landslides can affect primary structural elements, but more frequently damage occurs on the most vulnerable elements of the structure such as infills. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the potential utility of satellite data derived from a remote sensing technique, known as differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, to support the structural health monitoring of reinforced concrete buildings affected by landslides. This article shows the structural health monitoring process for a reinforced concrete infilled building within a landslide-affected area, using the differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry data as input for the structural analysis in order to investigate the evolution of damage over the years. Three-dimensional structure, including the explicit infills consideration, has been modeled based on the information available from a visual survey, obtaining the missing parameters from a simulated design process and from the literature. In the field of the civil protection programs for the landslide risk reduction, this methodology can be quickly repeated for large sets of reinforced concrete buildings. Evidence of the visual survey showed a significant damage pattern in some infills. A good agreement has been found between analytical previsions and existing damage. Moreover, a global infills damage assessment of the case study building is proposed. Finally, assuming a constant increase in displacements in future years, a prediction of the future expected damage is shown.

M3  - Article
AB  - Most crises, though difficult and challenging to address, offer opportunities for change and for development of new perspectives or approaches to deal with traditional strategies. The reaction to and the managing of the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a platform for evaluating how we quantify disease prevalence, incidence, time courses and sequellae as well as how well we plan, design, analyze and interpret health care associated data, including clinical trials and electronic medical records and health claims data. Whether the Covid-19 crisis provides opportunities to advance the fields of biostatistics and epidemiology in select ways remains to be seen. This article describes three areas of crises experienced by the author during a career in the regulation of pharmaceutical products and how they were responded to. Some suggestions for potential future opportunities in reaction to the Covid-19 crises are provided.

TI  - Use of IRS-1C and Its Follow-On Missions for Geological Applications: A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing is being used by geologists for the last five decades for conducting geological surveys and applications. The launch of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS)-1C in December 1995 opened new opportunities to study and characterise Earth's surface materials, landforms and surface as well as subsurface processes. The availability of panchromatic (PAN) camera and Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) in addition to multispectral Linear Imaging Self-Scanning sensor-III (LISS-III) made the IRS-1C unique among its contemporary satellites. While wide coverage provided by the WiFS images could be used for studying regional features like geological and geomorphic provinces and mega lineaments/fractures, the PAN-sharpened LISS-III images facilitated improved interpretability and made large-scale (up to 1:10,000) mapping possible. In this article, we review the geological applications of the IRS-1C and its follow-on missions carrying similar sensors, with an aim to present the status of the achievements made with this unique mission. From the basic geological and geomorphological mapping to different applied geological investigations in the fields of hydrogeology, mineral and hydrocarbon exploration, geoengineering surveys, geoenvironmental appraisal of engineering, mining and infrastructural projects, and geological hazards are covered in this review. While reviewing different applications, we highlight major projects executed, new initiatives undertaken, and scientific findings through the use of IRS-1C data and its successor missions. We also provide some recommendations on the future requirements of remote sensing systems and processes from the geological perspective.

TI  - Concentrations of trace elements in tissues of loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>) from the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian coastlines (Calabria, Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxic trace elements from both, natural and anthropogenic origin, pose a threat to aquatic environments and marine wildlife due to their long-range transport, bioaccumulative nature, and biomagnification through the food chain. Being long-lived and migratory animals, sea turtles can be exposed to elevated levels of toxic elements, and are therefore considered sentinel species for chemical pollution. In this study, concentrations of trace elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury) were determined in tissues of 46 loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts of Calabria, in Southern Italy, between 2014 and 2020. Curved carapace length (CCL), curved carapace width (CCW), body mass (BM), and sex were determined and the correlations of these parameters with toxic elements concentrations were investigated. During necropsy, kidney, liver, and muscle tissues were collected and the concentration and distribution of metals determined. Muscle tissues showed the lowest toxic element burdens, except for As that showed the highest mean concentrations in this tissue. The kidney was the main accumulation organ for Cd, while similar levels of Hg and Pb were measured in kidney, liver, and muscle tissues. The risk assessment performed for Cd, Hg, and Pb in sea turtles' liver highlighted possible negative effects on sea turtles' health and the need for marine turtle toxicology researches. This is the first study reporting levels and distribution of toxic elements in tissues of Caretta caretta turtles from the Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts of Calabria.

TI  - Axillary Primary and Breast Cancer Management
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Axillary primary breast cancer, also known as occult primary breast cancer, is a rare entity representing less than 1% of all breast cancers. The surgical management of the axilla in breast cancer has changed significantly, with implications for the management of axillary primary breast cancer. Much of the data is limited by era, small cohorts, or large retrospective database studies. The purpose of this review is to reinforce the diagnostic work up of occult breast cancer, review updated management strategies of the axilla and breast, and summarize changes and updates in practice management and outcomes. Recent Findings Pathologic confirmation of breast primary disease and MRI are critical for the diagnostic work up of axillary primary breast cancer. A recent axillary primary specific meta-analyses and several National Cancer Database studies (NCDB) have reinforced that mastectomy versus breast conservation with whole breast radiation has equivalent outcomes. Surgical axillary management is under evolution, with multiple large trials reporting the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downstage the node-positive axilla and decrease the morbidity of axillary lymph node dissection by allowing accurate sentinel node biopsy. Use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy is increasingly used, although no prospective data exists specifically in occult primary breast cancer. Appropriate diagnostic work up includes MRI to identify possible primary breast lesions in all patients with metastatic axillary disease and negative exam, mammography, and ultrasound. Axillary primary breast cancer should be treated with contemporary management strategies as other anatomic stage II breast cancers. Appropriate management strategies based on recent trial data suggest the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to downstage the axilla and allow for less morbid axillary surgery. Outcomes are equivalent with mastectomy or whole breast radiation.

TI  - Abiotic disturbances affect forest short-term vegetation cover and phenology in Southwest China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances significantly affect the global carbon cycle by, for example, vegetation loss or changing forest phenology. However, the lack of historical disturbance events constitutes a challenge for in-depth temporal and spatial analysis. Available remote sensing time series and combined climate data may have great potential to quickly and consistently detect and identify forest disturbances events. We employed time-series data (2001-2014) of a vegetation index (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and a change detection algorithm (the breaks for additive seasonal and trend, BFAST) to detect forest disturbances in a sub-tropical area located in Southwest China. Remote sensing and meteorological data were combined to distinguish among the typical forest disturbances: fires, extreme cold events in winter (ECE), and droughts. With the reconstructed historical disturbance events, post-disturbance vegetation loss, short-term vegetation cover, and phenology changes were analyzed. Our results show that fires and droughts caused severe damage to forest cover (NDVI anomalies can reach up to-1.84 and-1.11, respectively). Fire changed the regular phenological periods which last 3-4 years, and it also took 1-2 years for vegetation greenness to recover after ECE and droughts, which triggered carbon emissions and reduced forest stocks. Warmer areas were vulnerable to ECE effects as well and should be paid more attention. Post-disturbance effects show complex patterns: characteristics of disturbances, climatic conditions, and multiple events overlaying contribute to modifying forest vegetation. Hence, forest disturbances cannot be neglected but should be emphasized in future forest ecosystem modeling or analyzing. The approach used in the study can be a crucial step in detecting and assessing the effects of various disturbances on forest vegetation and phenology and, thereby, contributes to improved risk analysis and management in forestry.

TI  - Carbon tattooing for targeted lymph node biopsy after primary systemic therapy in breast cancer: prospective multicentre TATTOO trial
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several techniques for targeted lymph node biopsy in patients with node-positive breast cancer receiving primary systemic therapy are in use, each with their inherent advantages and disadvantages. The aim of the TATTOO trial was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of carbon tattooing of positive lymph nodes as a method for targeted lymph node biopsy avoiding radiation exposure, high costs, and preoperative localization procedures.Methods: Patients with initially cT1-4c cN1-3 cM0 invasive breast cancer were included in this prospective multicentre trial. Before initiation of primary systemic therapy, a carbon suspension was injected into the most suspicious axillary lymph node. Targeted lymph node biopsy was performed in all patients after completion of primary systemic therapy. Additional sentinel lymph node biopsy was done in those with axillary downstaging, and completion axillary lymph node dissection in patients still presenting with suspicious lymph nodes.Results: A total of 118 patients were included and 110 were eligible for data analysis. The detection rate for the targeted lymph node was 93.6 per cent (103 of 110), and the sentinel lymph node was identical to the targeted lymph node in 60 per cent. The false-negative rate for the combination of targeted and sentinel node lymph node biopsy (targeted axillary dissection) was 9 per cent.Conclusion: Targeted axillary dissection after carbon tattooing is associated with a high detection rate, an acceptable false-negative rate, and appears feasible for clinical use even in healthcare settings with limited resources.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR captures 2019 catastrophic White Island eruption
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The andesitic volcanic island Whakaari (White Island) explosively erupted on 9 December 2019. White Island is a popular tourist destination, and 47 people were on the island at the time. Twenty-one died, and a further twentysix people suffered injuries. Persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful satellite-based remote sensing tool to monitor land deformation associated with volcanic unrest. This study examined deformation on White Island over the eruption period and identified a dome on the crater floor that inflated for 15 months preceding the eruption, consistent with a previous analysis of TerraSAR-X satellite data. Results here show the dome began to collapse after 25 November, about two weeks prior to the eruption. This finding has immediate relevance for ongoing hazard monitoring at White Island and other volcanoes worldwide where sudden dome contraction may presage an eruption.(c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - TS-InSAR analysis for monitoring ground deformation in Lanzhou New District, the loess Plateau of China, from 2017 to 2019
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale land creation projects involving the cutting of mountains to infill gullies for construction have been carried out in Lanzhou New District (LZND). However, there is an urgent need for comprehensive and detailed research on the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation in LZND. Based on Sentinel-1A SAR data, combined with the urban geological background, the ground deformation in LZND from 2017 to 2019 was analysed. Two independent, multi-temporal techniques, persistent scatterers interferometry (PS-InSAR) and the small baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR), were used to calculate the deformation time series, and the results were cross-verified. The time series-monitoring results of the SBAS and PS calculations exhibited strong consistency in LZND and verified the high reliability of the experimental results. The results showed the whole surface of the LZND from March 2017 to October 2019 maintained stability, and the deformation rate was primarily in the range of -10 to 10 mm/year. However, ground deformation in the Xicha area was evident. The maximum annual deformation rates monitored by SBAS-InSAR and PS-InSAR were -52.48 mm/year and -56.35 mm/year, respectively. The most typical deformation areas include the built-up area and the land creation area. The surface subsidence area was concentrated in the filling area. The ground deformation range of LZND kept expanding and accelerating from 2017 to 2019. Land creation, urban construction, geology and precipitation were the primary factors contributing to local severe ground deformation. The results of this study provide reference for the regional urban planning in LZND. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of a Gene Expression Profiling Assay in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. A significant proportion of deaths from cutaneous melanoma occur among patients with an initial diagnosis of stage 1 or 2 disease. The Decision-Dx Melanoma (DDM) 31-gene assay attempts to stratify these patients by risk of recurrence. This study aimed to evaluate this assay in a large single-institution series.Methods. A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent surgery for melanoma at a large academic cancer center with DDM results was performed. Patient demographics, tumor pathologic characteristics, sentinel node status, gene expression profile (GEP) class, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were reviewed. The primary outcomes were recurrence of melanoma and distant metastatic recurrence.Results. Data from 361 patients were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 15 months. Sentinel node biopsy was performed for 75.9% (n = 274) of the patients, 53 (19.4%) of whom tested positive. Overall, 13.6% (n = 49) of the patients had recurrence, and 8% (n = 29) had distant metastatic recurrence. The 3- and 5-year RFS rates were respectively 85% and 75% for the class 1A group, 74% and 47% for the class 1B/class 2A group, and 54% and 45% for the class 2B group. Increased Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitoses, sentinel node biopsy positivity, and GEP class 2B status were significantly associated with RFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in the univariate analysis (all p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, only Breslow thickness and ulceration were associated with RFS (p < 0 .003) , and only Breslow thickness was associated with DMFS (p < 0.001).Conclusion. Genetic profiling of cutaneous melanoma can assist in predicting recurrence and help determine the need for close surveillance. However, traditional pathologic factors remain the strongest independent predictors of recurrence risk.

TI  - Completing the machine learning saga in fractional snow cover estimation from MODIS Terra reflectance data: Random forests versus support vector regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study; i) investigates the suitability of two frequently employed machine learning algorithms in remote sensing, namely, random forests (RFs) and support vector regression (SVR) for fractional snow cover (FSC) estimation from MODIS Terra data, and ii) compares them with the previously proposed artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) methods over an heterogeneous and complex alpine terrain. The dataset comprises 20 Landsat 8 - MODIS image pairs that belong to European Alps acquired from Apr 2013 to Dec 2016. The fifteen image pairs are used to generate the training dataset necessary to build the models, whereas the remaining five are employed as a separate test dataset. The reference FSC maps are derived from the binary classified Landsat 8 snow/no snow maps at 30 m resolution. In order to assess the effect of sampling type and sample size, nine different training datasets are generated. The RF and SVR models are trained accordingly by using various settings of model tuning parameters. During the training of the models, MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance values of bands 1-7, NDSI, NDVI and land cover class are input as independent variables (i.e., predictors) to estimate the dependent variable (i.e., response), i.e., FSC value. The resolution of the generated FSC maps is 500 m. The results indicate that the ANN, MARS, RF and SVR models exhibit high consistency with reference FSC values as indicated by low RMSE (similar to 0.14) and high R (similar to 0.93) values. In order to analyze the effect of using three auxiliary variables, i.e., NDSI, NDVI and land cover class, to the predictive ability of the models; ANN, MARS, RF and SVR models are also trained without these predictor variables, i.e., by only using MODIS bands 1-7. The models trained without three auxiliary variables slightly differ from the ones trained with the full set of predictors by only resulting in a mean decrease in R <0.012 and a mean increase in RMSE <0.009, showing that they perform well in solving the complex functional dependencies by only using MODIS reflectance data. In terms of computational efficiencies of the proposed algorithms measured by the CPU times spent during model training, MARS and RF algorithms outperform ANN and SVR methods.

TI  - Spatial characteristics of wind and wave parameters over the Sea of Marmara
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to determine long-term spatial variability of wind and wave characteristics over the Sea of Marmara. For this purpose, we produced four different wind and wave datasets for a period of 40 years (1979-2018) using the calibrated and default-setting SWAN models forced with both CFSR and ERA-Interim winds and inter-compared. The performance of these datasets is examined against the wave height measurements of 2015 at the Silivri buoy station and 27-year (1991-2018) satellites data (ENVISAT, ERS-1, ERS-2, JASON-1, JASON-2, JASON-3, SENTINEL-3A, SENTINEL-3B, TOPEX). Then, for wind and wave climate analysis, the spatial distributions of the wind and wave characteristics over the study area are determined in terms of seasonal and annual averages. 40-year averages of 95th and 99th percentile significant wave heights, probabilities of being larger than significant wave heights exceeding a critical value, and 40-year maximum significant wave heights are spatially analyzed. Finally, the calibrated SWAN model using CFSR winds presents the most accurate results. Therefore, the effects of different model inputs and settings on the model results are examined by creating spatial distributions of the biases of the other three model results and comparing them to those of the calibrated model results using CFSR winds. The CFSR forced and calibrated model predicts the largest average wind speed and average wave height in the central regions of the Sea of Marmara in comparison with the other three models. The shores of Kapidag Peninsula and Marmara Island are exposed to be with the highest wave conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides an insight into the interrelation between the worldview and personal meaningful orientations in the context of the modern digital era. The purpose of the article is to investigate the process of generating personal ontology with due regard to personal meaning-making, which involves considering three groups of issues. Firstly, attention is focused on understanding the complexity of the modern epoch against the background of the technological revolution and the effects of virtual imitation of reality, which may determine the worldview. Secondly, an effective insight into life-meaning orientations involves reviewing methodological approaches. Thirdly, the article considers the basic paradigms of life choices including the pragmatic option for self-determination, retrospective reflection based on historical-philosophical inquiry, the paradigm of genetic determination of human behavior and decision-making, and an opposing existential paradigm, which identifies proper life orientations. The study refers to enactivism as a methodological tool, according to which, changes in external circumstances generated by the subject may effect the structure of semantic regulations. The authors come up with an innovative approach to investigating the ways in which the meanings of personal ontology are shaped in the context of complexity and virtualization of the modern world. The idea of the ambivalence of life-purpose relfection is justified. The authors come to a conclusion that structuring personal ontology depends on processing the main tendencies of the epoch in the domain of personal reflection, which is based on one's inner world and connected with goal-setting and shaping one's life-project.

TI  - Understanding global land degradation processes interacted with complex biophysics and socioeconomics from the perspective of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (1982-2015)
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the world has been suffering from a severe crisis of land degradation. To combat this, a scientific understanding of global land degradation processes based on empirical evidence is needed. However, a complete study of how the global land degradation processes operate within complex biophysics and socioeconomics is lacking. Depending on the latest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1982-2015) as a surrogate measure of land degradation, this study uses linear regression and correlation analyses to provide valuable insight into the degradation processes as well as their underlying drivers. We found that a dynamic trend is more capable of objectively and accurately describing the underlying status of land degradation compared to a static pattern. Globally, the area interchanges between the degradation and improvement trends over short terms indicate that the long-term crisis of land degradation is not completely reversed. Meanwhile, either inter-annual rain variability or atmospheric fertilization affects the degradation processes to varying degrees at the regional rather than the global scale. Thus, we concluded that the irregular processes of global land degradation are collectively driven by related biophysical attributes interacting with local socioeconomics in different areas and years. Finally, a number of hotspot areas with degradation risks or improvement opportunities can be targeted accordingly.

TI  - [Predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy in prognosis of acral melanoma].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and its prognostic value in the treatment of acral melanoma. Methods: We retrospective analyzed 118 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy from Mar 2012 to Jun 2019 with effective follow-up data available in our institute. We ruled out palpable regional lymph node metastasis with preoperative imaging of MRI and ultrasonography, used the (99)Tc(m)-Dextran (Dx) as a tracer, with intraoperative gamma-ray probe positioning for SLN capture. Wide resection and reconstruction in primary lesion followed by complete lymph node dissection were underwent SLN positive patients. Cox regression model were used to analyze the prognostic factors. Results: The patients had an average disease history of 53.6 months (2-360 months), the primary lesion located at hands and feet in 84 cases, while 27 cases were subungual and 7 cases were cutaneous. The mean Breslow depth was 3.6 mm, and 72 cases (61.0%) combined with ulceration. The average number of SLN was 2.8, the SLN positive rate was 24.6% (29/118), and the false-negative rate was 2.5% (3/118). There were 24 cases (20.3%) developed clinically positive metastasis, including 7 cases displayed distant metastasis combined with lymph node metastasis (5.9%), 8 cases with clinically positive lymph node metastasis alone (6.8%), and 9 cases with distant metastasis (7.6%). There were 33 patients in stage Ⅰ, 56 patients in stage Ⅱ and 29 patients in stage Ⅲ, with a 5-years overall survival rate of 69.5%. The Breslow depth is an independent risk factor of SLN positive. While Breslow depth, SLN status, SLN positive number and clinically detectable metastasis are independent prognostic factors of the overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusions: Patients without clinically positive regional lymph node metastasis under imaging and physical examinations, SLNB can provide accurate pathologic staging and play an accurate prediction role in the prognostic evaluation. SLNB should be carried out routinely in clinical practice.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass from PolSAR and PolInSAR using regression-based modelling techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of forestry studies, microwave remote sensing has broad applications due to the penetration into the semi-transparent media. This feature is used for the estimation of biophysical parameters and monitoring of deforestation. Therefore, the estimation of biophysical parameters is essential for assessing carbon stock management. Hence, the aboveground biomass (AGB) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is recognized as typical approaches in forest application. However, the integrated use of polarimetric (PolSAR) and interferometric (PolInSAR) data might be more efficient tools for AGB mapping. Accordingly, in this study with the integrated data, the efficiency of machine learning techniques including random forest regression (RFR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) model were assessed and compared for the prediction of AGB. The analyses were performed using an image pair of fully polarimetric Radarsat-2 C-band data set and the related field data of Malhan Forest Range, Dehradun Forest Division, which were collected using the systematic sampling technique. Particularly, the training and testing of the models were done using the field sample plots. The experimental results showed that the RFR algorithm provided a better prediction result of AGB than the MLR model. The correlation coefficient (R (2)) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the RFR algorithm was estimated to be around 0.65 and 24.33 Mg/ha, respectively, while for the MLR model, R2 and RMSE are estimated as 0.54 and 33.05 Mg/ha, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the prediction of AGB through the machine learning technique using PolSAR and PolInSAR data has a significant advantage for accurate estimation of the AGB.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 atmospheric correction and signal normalization based on ground-truth spectroradiometric measurements
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite Earth Observing Systems (EOS) provide a variety of products for monitoring Earth surface processes at varying spatial and spectral resolutions. Combining information from high and medium spatial resolution images is valuable for monitoring ground cover and vegetation status in cropland, grassland, forests, and other natural settings. However, coupling information from different EOS requires compensating for atmospheric and view angle effects before integrating comparable surface reflectance (SR) values. The objectives of this study were i) to assess how different atmospheric constituents affect the atmospheric correction results in Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 imagery, ii) to establish a relationship with field spectra measurements, and iii) to develop an empirical approach to ensure that SR values extracted from different EOS can be normalized for use in monitoring vegetation and land cover status. We compared surface reflectance values derived from Sentinel-2 images corrected with Sen2Cor, MODTRAN or FLAASH atmospheric correction approaches for the visible-tonear infrared regions. Additionally, this information was compared to SR values extracted from WorldView-3 imagery acquired from the same dates and location (Central Spain) and corrected with MODTRAN and FLAASH approaches. Assessment of the atmospheric correction was conducted by comparing satellite image SR with ground-truth spectra acquired with a FieldSpec hand-held spectroradiometer. The results emphasized the importance of using common atmospheric parameters collected from ancillary data sources (i.e. MODIS Atmosphere & Land products) to ensure a reliable SR comparison. When compared to field-collected spectral data, SR from corrected Sentinel-2 push-broom imagery showed a reliable match (<4% difference in the visible bands and <0.52% difference in the near infrared bands). However, SR imagery from the pointable WorldView-3 instrument showed significant deviation, likely resulting from the effects of steep off-nadir acquisition angles (24.6. to 39.1.) combined with surface anisotropy. The magnitude and sign of the deviation in SR differed depending on the vegetation type, wavelength and sun-surface-sensor geometry. Therefore, it was necessary to account for angular effects to ensure reliable comparisons of imagery from the different EOS. In this study, an empirical angular correction approach was developed based on calibrating each WorldView-3 band against the ground-truth spectra. This correction allowed for the accurate signal normalization of WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 imagery SR in the visible-to-near infrared regions.

TI  - Effect of surgical approach on risk of recurrence after vaginal brachytherapy in early-stage high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective was to determine if surgical approach affects time to recurrence in early-stage high intermediate risk endometrial cancer (HIR-EC) treated with adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy (VBT).Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, HIR-EC patients treated with VBT between 2005 and 2017 were identified and those who received open or minimally invasive hysterectomies (MIS) were included. Clinical and surgical variables were analyzed and time to recurrence was compared between surgical groups.Results. We identified 494 patients, of which 363 had MIS hysterectomies, 92.5% had endometrioid histology, 45.7% were stage IA and 48.0% stage IB. Open hysterectomy patients had higher BMIs (p = 0.007), lower rates of lymph node sampling (p < 0.001) and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (p = 0.036), however in patients who recurred, no differences were noted between groups. Overall, 65 patients (13.2%) recurred, 14 in the open group (10.7%) and 51 in the MIS group (14.0%) (p = 0.58), while vaginal recurrences were noted in 4.6% and 6.1% respectively. When compared to the open group, the MIS group had a significantly shorter time to any recurrence (p = 0.022), to pelvic (p = 0.05) and locoregional recurrence (p = 0.021) and to death from any cause (p = 0.039). After adjusting for age, BMI, grade, LVSI and surgery date, the MIS group had a higher risk of any recurrence (HR 2.29 (1.07-4.92), p = 0.034) and locoregional recurrence (HR 4.18 (1.44-12.1), p = 0.008).Conclusions. Patients with HIR-EC treated with VBT after MIS hysterectomy have a shorter time to recurrence and higher risk of recurrence when compared to open hysterectomy patients. Further studies into the safety of MIS in high-intermediate risk patients are required. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Political Religion and Pragmatics in Soviet Atheisation Practice: The Case of Post-Stalinist Soviet Lithuania
T2  - POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the outcomes of Soviet attempts to create an atheist society. It uses the concepts of political pragmatics and political religion to explain the kind of secular society Soviet atheisation politics created. It claims that the politics of secularization was led primarily by political pragmatics in order to build a society of loyal Soviet citizens rather than by the dogmatically declared claim of creating a society of atheists with strong materialist views. The article focuses on political measures to develop a non-religious worldview (or ethics) in Soviet Lithuania in the 1960-1980s: the authority's motivation to promote secular ethics, the efforts to institutionalize the ethical search, and the acknowledged failures in satisfying the needs of the society. It shows that by the end of the 1980s, atheisation policies had resulted in a plurality of secular worldviews: ideological as well as religious indifference, secular humanism, New-Age like spiritualism, and even neo-paganism.

TI  - Development of a method for flood detection based on Sentinel-1 images and classifier algorithms
T2  - WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters in the world, displacing millions of people each year and causing severe damage to people's lives and infrastructure. It is the most widespread hydrological hazard worldwide that affects water management, nature protection, economic activities, hydromorphological alterations on ecosystem services and human health. Real-time monitoring systems play a key role in flood risk reduction and disaster response decisions. Studies have shown that using earth observation data for flood monitoring and timely actions based on good quality information reduces damages. In this paper, after thresholding, a machine learning algorithm and an object-based classification method were used to classify the SAR data. Thresholding helps detect regions in the flooded areas. A comparison of the results showed that the machine learning algorithm obtained significant results. Because of the results obtained, the usefulness of Sentinel-1 images as a baseline data for the improvement of the methodological guide is appreciated and should be used as a new source to monitor the flood risks.

TI  - Application of satellite observations to study the changes of hypoxic conditions in near-bottom water in the western part of Peter the Great Bay (the Sea of Japan)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we explore the possibilities of applying satellite ocean colour (OC) observations and SST to study the changes in the conditions of hypoxia in the near-bottom water in the western part of Peter the Great Bay. Near-bottom water hypoxia occurs in water bodies with increased organic matter influx when the dissolved oxygen (DO) consumed at its oxidation is not restored. Consumption of most DO is usually attributed to the oxidation of organic matter formed as a result of increased algae growth during water eutrophication. Satellite data on indicators of phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) and fluorescence (FLH)) allow to analyze the spatial-temporal changes of this substation. Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), non-algal particles (NAP) influence on satellite Chl estimates and also on near-bottom water hypoxia formation. This study analyzes daily, seasonal, and inter-annual changes in the distributions of indicators (Chl, FLH, the coefficients of light absorption by coloured detrital matter (a(CDM)) and light backscattering by suspended particles (b(bp))), based on the instant satellite OC data from MODIS-Aqua. Data on the Chl, the sea surface temperature (SST) from the MODIS-Aqua, the precipitation from the TRMM satellite and the hydrometeorological stations (HMSs), the wind speed and direction from HMS "Vladivostok" are used to study the influence of hydrometeorological conditions on the Chl values. These distributions were compared with the literary information based on field observations of the hypoxia cases in the same area and with the changes in the vertical DO, Chl, temperature, salinity distribution obtained by coastal expeditions in October-November 2010 and February-March 2011. Significant interrelations within 95% confidence level between the satellite Chl, FLH values calculated at the MUMM atmospheric correction and in situ Chl values obtained in the autumn of 2010 were reached separately for the cases with winds of northern and southern directions with the correlation coefficients of 0.71, 0.48 and 0.49, 0.71, respectively. Significant dependences of Chl on SST and Chl on wind speed explained by the influence of continental runoff and water ventilation were obtained. Therefore, the changes of Chl reflect the changes of hypoxic conditions in the near-bottom water. In Amursky Bay the onset of hypoxia was at the Chl and SST values equal to 4 mg m(-3) and 13 degrees C (up arrow) - at increasing SST); near Furugelm Island it was at 1.6 mg m(-3) and 25 degrees C (up arrow), 1 mg m(-3) and 21 degrees C (down arrow). The difference in the Chl values was reflected in the hypoxia onset timings that were the beginning of June (2011), August (2013), and September (2014), respectively. The water flow from the eastern coast of Amursky Bay in early August of 2013 recorded from the OC and SST satellite imagers appeared in an additional hypoxic zone. Decreased OC characteristics in the runoff of the Razdolnaya River in August-September of 2014 were a sign of hypoxia at its mouth. Near Furugelm Island the hypoxia destruction (increase in the DO level from 1 to 4.5 ml L-1 was observed at the Chl of 0.9 mg m(-3) and SST = 18 degrees C (down arrow). At the autumn maximum of Chl equal to 1.7 mg m(-3) and SST = 4 degrees C (down arrow) in mid-November the DO level here increased to 8 ml L-1. In Amursky Bay, short-term destructions/weakening of hypoxia manifested themselves in sharp increases of Chl.At that, the ratio between the Chl value and the approximation level was equal to 2 and higher for SST equal to 22-25 degrees C (up arrow), to 0.9 and higher for SST equal to 5-13 degrees C (down arrow). With the water stratification destruction in temperature and the noticeable weakening of the stratification in salinity (mid-November), the hypoxia destructed (the DO level increased from 2 to 6 ml L-1). In this case, Chl and SST were about 3 mg m(-3) and 5 degrees C (down arrow). (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Accuracy of preoperative cross-sectional imaging in cervical cancer patients undergoing primary radical surgery
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We aim to describe the false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) rates of preoperative crosssectional imaging (PCI) prior to radical surgery for cervical cancer.Methods. A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer from January 2010 until December 2017 at a single tertiary care center was performed. Patients were included if they underwent preoperative PCI and radical surgery. Patient demographics and clinicopathologic information were recorded from medical record review. Descriptive statistics were used.Results. Overall, 106 patients met inclusion criteria. Eighty-four percent (89/106) of patients had no suspicion for metastatic disease on PCI, while 16% (17/106) had suspicion for metastatic disease. Of the 89 without suspicion for metastatic disease on PCI, 16% (14/89) had a false negative study with metastatic disease identified on final surgical pathology. False negative rates by modality were 16% (11/70) for PET/CT and 6% (2/33) for diagnostic CT. Of the 17 cases with suspicion for metastatic disease on imaging, 53% (9/17) were false positive studies with no metastatic disease identified histologically. False positive rates by modality were 7% (5/70) for PET/CT and 12% (4/33) for diagnostic CT.Conclusion. PCI is a tool to help identify patients who are optimal candidates for radical surgery. In this sample, the false negative rate was 16%, and false positive rate was 53% for PCI among women who underwent primary radical surgery. Further study is needed to explore preoperative testing that may more accurately identify optimal surgical candidates.(c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modelling above ground biomass of Indian mangrove forest using dual-pol SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Usage of remote sensing technology has increased for estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) due to accessibility issues within the forests. Current study is piloted for mangroves of Mundra taluka in Kachchh district, western India. The study aims to validate and compare various allometric models for mangrove Above Ground Biomass (AGB) estimation to find out best suitable model. Models are validated by extensive ground truth. The most suitable allometric model is then used to develop a novel methodology to estimate AGB using dual-pol Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This study is first of its kind, implemented for Indian mangroves, using Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (PRVI) for modelling AGB. The study also incorporates time series change detection in AGB within the study area. Our results suggest that amalgamation of field measurements, allometric equations and remote sensing technology can be the vital solution for modelling Above Ground Biomass of mangrove forest.

TI  - Effects of a dual-filter-based cerebral embolic protection device in transcatheter aortic valve replacement on cerebral oxygen saturation: A prospective pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel-CPS) is increasingly used in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the impact of inserting the Sentinel-CPS inside the brain-supplying arteries on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation is unknown.Methods: Twenty patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) cerebral embolic protection using the Sentinel-CPS were prospectively observed. All patients received conscious sedation and cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was continuously measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The cumulative perioperative cerebral desaturation was calculated for each patient by multiplying rSO(2) below an individualized desaturation threshold by time. In addition, rSO(2) values at the time of Sentinel-CPS insertion, filter positioning, and device retraction were analyzed.Results: There was no significant difference in cumulative cerebral desaturation in patients with Sentinel-CPS (median [IQR]) (0 [0/81] s%) and without (median [IQR]) (0 [0/23] s%), p = .762. A total of 6 patients (33.3%) experienced a perioperative decrease in rSO(2) below the individualized desaturation threshold (n = 3 with Sentinel-CPS, n = 3 without Sentinel-CPS; p = 1.000). Cerebral desaturation was detected during valve deployment (n = 5) and after postdilatation (n = 1). No desaturation events occurred during Sentinel-CPS insertion, filter positioning, or retraction.Conclusion: Our pilot study revealed no difference in cumulative perioperative cerebral desaturation between TAVR with and without Sentinel-CPS. Catheter- and filter-based manipulations in the brain-supplying arteries for Sentinel-CPS application were not associated with a decrease of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.

TI  - A Method to Derive Tidal Flat Topography in Nantong, China Using MODIS Data and Tidal Levels
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing data have proven to be useful in deriving tidal flat topography. However, limited satellite observations over a certain period have large uncertainties. In this study, we used MODIS time-series data with a high observational frequency to generate accurate tidal flat topography in Nantong, China based on the relationship between the T_Tide-derived tidal levels and the MODIS-derived inundation frequency map. First, 8-day MOD09Q1 data from 2007 to 2008 were used to perform the land-water classification. Second, 92 land-water maps were stacked to generate the inundation frequency map of the tidal flat. Then, the T_Tide package was applied to calculate the tidal levels at Lvsi Tide Gauge Station. Finally, the inundation frequency map and the tidal levels were integrated to derive the tidal flat topography, which agreed well with the in-situ elevation data (RMSE = 0.40 m, r = 0.89) and the Landsat-based elevation data (RMSE = 0.18 m, r = 0.98). In addition, the derived slopes agreed well with the slopes from the in-situ elevation data (RMSE = 1.00 parts per thousand, r = 0.85). We highlighted the necessity of using all MODIS data for deriving an accurate tidal flat topography. Our proposed method has a potential to derive tidal flat topography and temporal changes over the past 20 years from MODIS data.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of water clarity for various lakes in China
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (expressed as Secchi disk depth (SDD)) reflects light transmission capacity of a water body and influences growth of aquatic plants, aquatic organisms, and primary productivity. Here, we calibrated and validated a general model based on Landsat series data for deriving SDD of various inland waters across China. The quality of remotely sensed reflectance products from different Landsat series images was assessed using in situ reflectance measurements. The results indicated that the products in the visible bands are the most robust and stable to estimate SDD for inland waters. Subsequently, a simple power function model based on red band was built using 887 pairs of in situ SDD measurements and concurrent Landsat images. The model was validated with an independent dataset of 246 SDD measurements, and the results showed that the mean relative error and normalized root mean square error were 34.2% and 55.4%, respectively. Finally, the model was applied to Landsat images acquired between 2016 and 2018 to investigate the SDD spatial distribution of all lakes with water area >= 10 km(2) (total 641 lakes) in China. The estimation results demonstrated that the Eastern Plain Lake Zone and Northeast Plain Lake zone have relatively low SDD, with multiyear average SDD of 0.56 +/- 0.17 m and 0.47 +/- 0.29 m, respectively. The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Lake Zone and Tibetan Plateau Lake Zone have relatively high SDD, with multiyear average SDD of 1.48 +/- 0.86 m and 1.30 +/- 0.83 m, respectively. The results indicated that the proposed model exhibits strong ability to accurately construct SDD coverage for various lakes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Generating surface soil moisture at 30 m spatial resolution using both data fusion and machine learning toward better water resources management at the field scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture has a considerable impact on the hydrological cycle, runoff generation, drought development, and water resources management. Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6-12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m x 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m x 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m x 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m x 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m x 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e. g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70-0.84, -0.034-0.012 cm (3)/cm(3), 0.025-0.044 cm(3)/cm(3), 0.031-0.050 cm(3)/cm(3), and 0.022-0.042 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m x 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale.

TI  - Can Insectary Plants Enhance the Presence of Natural Enemies of the Green Peach Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Mediterranean Peach Orchards?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation biological control could be an alternative to insecticides for the management of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer). To develop sustainable strategies for M. persicae control in peach orchards in the Mediterranean, a 2-yr field experiment was conducted to identify the key predators of the aphid; to determine whether the proximity of insectary plants boost natural enemies of M. persicae in comparison to the resident vegetation; and whether selected insectary plants enhance natural enemy populations in the margins of peach orchards. Aphidoletes aphidimyza Rondani (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) and Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae) were the most abundant predators found among sentinel aphid colonies, accounting for 57% and 26%, respectively. Samplings during 2015 yielded twice as many hoverflies in M. persicae sentinel plants close to the insectary plants as those close to the resident vegetation. The abundance of other natural enemies in sentinel plants, depending on their proximity to the insectary plants, was not significantly different in either of the 2 yr. Hoverflies hovered more often over the insectary plants than over the resident vegetation and landed significantly more often on Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv., Moricandia arvensis (L.) DC., and Sinapis alba L. (Brassicales: Brassicaceae) than on Achillea millefollium L. (Asterales: Compositae). Parasitoids were significantly more abundant in L. maritima and A. millefollium. The vicinity of selected insectary plants to peach orchards could improve the presence of hoverflies, which might benefit the biological control of M. persicae.

TI  - Automated digital elevation model (DEM) generation from very-high-resolution Planet SkySat triplet stereo and video imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Planet SkySat-C SmallSat constellation can acquire very high resolution (0.7 m to 0.9 m) triplet stereo and video imagery with short revisit times, providing an exciting opportunity for global, on-demand 3D mapping of dynamic surface features. However, a lack of suitable processing software, limited geolocation accuracy, and scene-to-scene offsets currently limit the potential for accurate SkySat digital elevation model (DEM) production. We developed an open-source workflow to refine the SkySat-C camera models and improve absolute image geolocation using external reference DEMs, without manual ground control point (GCP) selection. The refined camera models are used to generate accurate and self-consistent DEMs with 2-m posting and orthoimages at native resolution. We present sample DEM products for a triplet stereo collection over Mt. Rainier, USA and two video collections over Mt. St. Helen's, USA. The output DEMs display <1 to 2 m relative and <2 to 3 m absolute vertical accuracy when compared to DEMs generated with stereo image pairs acquired by the DigitalGlobe/YMaxar WorldView satellites and airborne LiDAR. Differencing the two SkySat-C video DEMs over Mt. St. Helen's shows elevation change of similar to 5 to 15 m due to melting of seasonal snow and glacier flow. Our workflow can be scaled for batch processing of SkySat stereo imagery, and extended to other frame camera systems with limited initial geolocation accuracy.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We assembled water-temperature data (1.0-15 m depth horizon) from several field studies (spanning 2003-2020) within Pelorus Sound to generate composite time-series of temperature at four locations. We also examined satellite-sensed sea-surface temperature records for the region (2002-2019). Time-series were deseasoned and Sen-slopes were calculated as measures of long-term trend. All of the in-situ slopes and most of the satellite slopes fell inside the range 0.2-0.4 degrees C decade(-1). Within the in-situ data, warming appears to have been less rapid during the spring (September-November) quarter than in others. In the satellite data, warming was slower during both the winter and spring quarters. The satellite data indicate that warming has been less rapid inside the Sound than the nearby oceanic waters. Air temperatures inside the Sound have warmed at a rate similar to the nearby water (and a lesser rate than the oceanic ones) and riverine heat inputs have not changed appreciably. We infer that warming has been driven mainly by import of warming oceanic waters. We discuss the implications of future warming for the two marine crops grown in Pelorus Sound (Chinook salmon and Greenshell (TM) mussel) drawing upon literature concerning their responses to temperature.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer: Tips and tricks to improve bilateral detection rate. The sentitricks study, a monocentric experience *
T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objective of the study is to show some small tricks for bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) uptake in endometrial cancer. Materials and methods: Each step of the sentinel lymph node technique was analyzed. The cervix was exposed through the use of vaginal valves and by Martin pliers stapling of the anterior cervical lip. Fifty mg Indocyanine Green (ICG) powder was diluted with 10 ml of physiological solution. The spinal needle was marked at 15 mm with a steri-strip. After 20 min from the administration, in case of no LNS identification, an additional 1 ml in the non-detected side was administered in the superficial cervical area. All cervical injections were made by a single (BR) surgeon experienced in oncological gynecology. Results: Fifty patients undergoing sentinel lymph node research for endometrial cancer. The uptake of at least one side of the sentinel node was 98% (49 cases). Forty-six (92%) patients had bilateral lymph node uptake and 3 patients (6%) had unilateral uptake. Only one patient with pelvic and metastatic aortic lymph nodes had no sentinel nodal uptake. Conclusions: Little tricks can increase the bilateral uptake of the SLN up to 92%. The reinjection could be a key element for the success of the SLN technique. Experienced surgeons could certainly play a fundamental role in raising bilateral SLN detection. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to achieve the best SLN infiltration strategy. ? 2021 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Improving Quality of Care Through a Mandatory Provincial Audit Program: Ontario's Emergency Department Return Visit Quality Program
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Emergency Department Return Visit Quality Program was launched in Ontario, Canada, to promote a culture of quality. It mandates the province's largest-volume emergency departments (EDs) to audit charts of patients who had a return visit leading to hospital admission, including some of their 72-hour all-cause return visits with admission and all of their 7-day ones with sentinel diagnoses (ie, acute myocardial infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pediatric sepsis), and submit their findings to a governmental agency. This provides an opportunity to identify possible adverse events and quality issues, which hospitals can then address through quality improvement initiatives. A group of emergency physicians with quality improvement expertise analyzed the submitted audits and accompanying narrative templates, using a general inductive approach to develop a novel classification of recurrent quality themes. Since the Return Visit Quality Program launched in 2016, 125,698 return visits with admission have been identified, representing 0.93% of the 86 participating EDs' 13,559,664 visits. Overall, participating hospitals have conducted 12,852 detailed chart audits, uncovering 3,010 (23.4%) adverse events/quality issues and undertaking hundreds of quality improvement provincewide projects as a result. The inductive analysis revealed 11 recurrent themes, classified into 3 groupings: patient characteristics (ie, patient risk profile and elder care), ED team actions or processes (ie, physician cognitive lapses, documentation, handover/communication between providers, radiology, vital signs, and high-risk medications or medication interactions), and health care system issues (ie, discharge planning/community follow-up, left against medical advice/left without being seen, and imaging/testing availability). The Return Visit Quality Program is the largest mandatory audit program for EDs and provides a novel approach to identify local adverse events/quality issues to target for improved patient safety and quality of care. It provides a blueprint for health system leaders to enable clinicians to develop an approach to organizational quality, as well as for teams to construct an audit system that yields defined issues amenable to improvement.

TI  - High-resolution estimation of ambient sulfate concentration over Taiwan Island using a novel ensemble machine-learning model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy loadings of sulfate aerosol trigger haze formation and pose great damage to human health in Taiwan Island. Nevertheless, high-resolution spatiotemporal variation of ambient sulfate across Taiwan Island still remained unknown because of the scarce monitoring sites. Thus, we developed a novel ensemble model named extreme gradient boosting coupled with geographically and temporally weighted regression (XGBoost-GTWR) to predict the high-resolution sulfate concentration (0.05 degrees) based on satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and the output of chemical transport models (CTMs). The result suggested that XGBoost-GTWR model outperformed other five models in predicting the sulfate concentration with the highest R-2 value (R-2 = 0.58) and the lowest relative mean square error (RMSE = 1.96 mu g/m(3)). Besides, the transferability of the XGBoost-GTWR model was also validated based on the ground-level sulfate data in 2019. The result suggested that the R-2 value of the extrapolation equation (0.53) did not show notable decrease compared with the 10-fold cross-validation result (0.58), indicating that the model was robust to predict the sulfate concentration. The ambient sulfate concentration in Taiwan Island displayed featured spatial variation with the highest one in Southwest Taiwan and the lowest one in Northeast Taiwan, respectively. It was assumed that the higher anthropogenic emission combined with the adverse meteorological condition led to the higher sulfate level in the southwestern coastal region. The ambient sulfate concentration exhibited significantly seasonal variation with the highest value in spring (5.65 +/- 0.84 mu g/m(3)), followed by those in winter (5.45 +/- 1.25 mu g/m(3)) and autumn (4.60 +/- 0.80 mu g/m(3)), and the lowest one in summer (3.80 +/- 0.65 mu g/m(3)). The higher sulfate concentration in spring was mainly contributed by the dense biomass burning and scarce rainfall amount. The present study develops a novel model to capture the high-resolution sulfate map and provides basic data for effective regulations of air pollution and epidemiological studies.

TI  - Hybrid inversion of radiative transfer models based on high spatial resolution satellite reflectance data improves fractional vegetation cover retrieval in heterogeneous ecological systems after fire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In forest landscapes affected by fire, the estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from remote sensing data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) enables to evaluate the ecological impact of such disturbance across plant communities at different spatio-temporal scales. Even though, when landscapes are highly heterogeneous, the fine-scale ground spatial variation might not be properly captured if FVC products are provided at moderate or coarse spatial scales, as typical of most of operational Earth observing satellite missions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of a RTM inversion approach for estimating FVC from satellite reflectance data at high spatial resolution as compared to the standard use of coarser imagery. The study was conducted both at landscape and plant community levels within the perimeter of a megafire that occurred in western Mediter-ranean Basin. We developed a hybrid retrieval scheme based on PROSAIL-D RTM simulations to create a training dataset of top-of-canopy spectral reflectance and the corresponding FVC for the dominant plant communities. The machine learning algorithm Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) was learned on the training dataset to model the relationship between canopy reflectance and FVC. The GPR model was then applied to retrieve FVC from WorldView-3 (spatial resolution of 2 m) and Sentinel-2 (spatial resolution of 20 m) surface reflectance bands. A set of 75 plots of 2x2m and 45 plots of 20x20m was distributed under a stratified schema across the focal plant communities within the fire perimeter to validate FVC satellite derived retrieval. At landscape scale, the accuracy of the FVC retrieval was substantially higher from WorldView-3 (R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 7.92%) than from Sentinel-2 (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 11.89%). At community level, FVC retrieval was more accurate for oak forests than for heathlands and broomlands. The retrieval from WorldView-3 minimized the over- and under-estimation effects at low and high field sampled vegetation cover, respectively. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of high spatial resolution satellite reflectance data to capture FVC ground spatial variability in heterogeneous burned areas using a hybrid RTM retrieval method.

TI  - When a dollar makes a BWT
T2  - THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Burrows-Wheeler-Transform (BWT) is a reversible string transformation which plays a central role in text compression and is fundamental in many modern bioinformatics applications. The BWT is a permutation of the characters, which is in general better compressible and allows to answer several different query types more efficiently than the original string.It is easy to see that not every string is a BWT image, and exact characterizations of BWT images are known. We investigate a related combinatorial question. In many applications, a sentinel character $ is added to mark the end of the string, and thus the BWT of a string ending with $ contains exactly one $-character. Given a string w, we ask in which positions, if any, the $-character can be inserted to turn w into the BWT image of a word ending with $. We show that this depends only on the standard permutation of w and present a O(n log n)-time algorithm for identifying all such positions, improving on the naive quadratic time algorithm. We also give a combinatorial characterization of such positions and develop bounds on their number and value. This is an extended version of [Giuliani et al. ICTCS 2019]. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Divergent processes and trends of desertification in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification and the expansion of deserts are regarded as a major threat to human livelihoods and ecosystem services, as well as achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Humans have been recognized as significant agents in the expansion of desert-like conditions, through the agency of desertification/land degradation, and through contributions to global climate change. Yet, how desertification changes and whether human or climate change drives these processes and trends over the whole Mongolia Plateau is still not clear. Here we first use MODIS data for 2000-2019 to assess the long-term vegetation changes across the Mongolian Plateau, both in Inner Mongolia of PR China and the Mongolian People's Republic. We then appied a General Linear Model to analyze the additional climate and human attribute data sets to explore relationships between the observed desert extent reduction and their potential drivers. Results show that from 2000-2019, desert extent declined by over 7%, comprised of an almost 11% reduction in Inner Mongolia and 5% reduction in Mongolia, and a reduction in the degree of desert conditions, as measured by vegetation cover grades, across the whole region (37.5% decline - one grade in PR China, 28.75% in Mongolia). The majority of desert area reduction occurs in the northern and eastern areas of the Mongolia Plateau. We found that the main drivers of changing desert extent is not because of a reduction in human pressures on the land, but an increasing trend of both precipitation and temperature, which explains over 75% of all the observed changes. Besides, urbanization, and a reduction of population pressures on the land, contribute to most of the remaining changes. Our results suggest that although the climate has been the primary driver of changing desert area and severity, human interventions have played an important role, although the way it intervenes and the intensity varies in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. Human's active response to land degradation in the desert contributes to more land restoration in Inner Mongolia than in Mongolia.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 68th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene (ASTMH)
CL  - National Harbor, MD
AB  - Background: Helminth infections caused by parasitic worms, including nematodes (roundworms), cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes), can cause chronic symptoms and serious clinical outcomes if left untreated. The US military frequently conducts activities in helminth-endemic regions, particularly Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. However, the military does not currently screen for these infections, and to date, no comprehensive surveillance studies have been completed to assess the frequency of helminth diagnoses in the military personnel and their families.Methods: To determine the burden of helminth infections in the US Military Health System (MHS), we conducted a retrospective analysis of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 diagnosis codes from all medical encounters in the MHS Data Repository (MDR) from fiscal years (FY) 2012 to 2018. Chart reviews were conducted to assign ICD diagnoses as incorrect, suspected, probable or confirmed based on the laboratory results and symptoms.Results: Abstraction of MHS data revealed over 50 000 helminth diagnoses between FY 2012 and FY 2018. Of these, 38 445 of diagnoses were amongst unique subjects. After chart review, we found there were 34 425 validated helminth infections diagnosed amongst the unique subjects of US military personnel, retirees and dependents. Nearly 4000 of these cases represented infections other than enterobiasis. There were 351 validated strongyloidiasis diagnoses, 317 schistosomiasis diagnoses and 191 diagnoses of cysticercosis during the study period. Incidence of intestinal nematode infection diagnoses showed an upward trend, whilst the incidence of cestode infection diagnoses decreased.Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that helminth infections capable of causing severe morbidity are often diagnosed in the US military. As helminth infections are often asymptomatic or go undiagnosed, the true burden of helminth infections in US military personnel and dependents may be higher than observed here. Prospective studies of US military personnel deployed to helminth-endemic areas may be indicated to determine if post-deployment screening and/or empirical treatment are warranted.

TI  - The potential and uncertainty of triple collocation in assessing satellite precipitation products in Central Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although satellite-based precipitation estimation has extensive application potential, validation of its reliability is challenging for areas lacking ground-based data which is particularly true for many arid and semiarid regions. The triple collocation (TC) method can be used to evaluate three independent inputs with unknown true values, and thus provides an appealing alternative for assessment of satellite precipitation products in lack of observation regions. This study is the first to utilize TC to comprehensively assess the uncertainties of various satellite precipitation products in Central Asia (CA) with a distinctive continental arid and semi-arid climate. TC requires the errors of inputs to be independent with each other, while many multi-satellite precipitation products use overlapped data sources. To address this problem, this study uses a soil moisture-based product (SM2RAIN) and a reanalysis model-based product (ERA5) as two inputs of a triplet with the last input coming from each one of the six satellite precipitation products (3B42, CHIRPS, CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG, PERSIANN). Six independent triplets are obtained in this way. The temporal/spatial resolution is daily/0.1. and the period is 2007-2019. The results show the overall performance of GSMaP is best among eight gridded precipitation products over CA, followed by IMERG, CMORPH and PERSIANN. All precipitation products show degraded performance with increasing altitude. Moreover, the accuracy estimates are subjected to uncertainties caused by the TC method and data inputs. Overall, the study concludes the TC method can provide a new perspective for the assessment of precipitation products over data-absent arid and semiarid regions, while careful check and explanation of evaluation results are always necessary to defend the rationality of TC in specific cases.

TI  - Weeds Impose Unique Outcomes for Pests, Natural Enemies, and Yield in Two Vegetable Crops
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Weed management requires enormous labor investments from vegetable farmers, yet crops vary in how much weed pressure they can tolerate without yield loss. Moreover, until weeds reach a point where they threaten yield or approach seed production, they can increase biodiversity and provision food and habitat to attract predatory insects. In two related field experiments, we quantified impacts of weed presence and diversity on pests, predators, and biocontrol of both weed seeds and insect prey. We also measured yields of two vegetables that vary in competitiveness (eggplants and turnips) across two weed management treatments (weedy and weed-free), to determine productivity costs of tolerating weeds. Allowing weeds to grow adjacent to rows of eggplants increased abundances of predators and reduced pests. Surprisingly, relaxing weed management came at no cost to eggplant yield. In contrast, tolerating weeds in turnips had strong yield costs, and did not benefit predators or decrease pest pressure. On both crops, pests declined as weed diversity increased. Yet, weed treatments had no impact on consumption of weed seeds or sentinel prey by soil-surface insects, which were dominated by red imported fire ants. Our results suggest that highly competitive crops might benefit from stronger natural pest control when weeds are less-aggressively managed. However, herbivores and predators had unique responses to weeds that were crop-specific. To help farmers allocate limited weed management labor resources, future work should examine the relative competitiveness of a wider variety of vegetables over a gradient of weed pressure while measuring corresponding impacts on pest control.

TI  - Field reconnaissance data from GEER investigation of the 2018 M<sub>W</sub> 7.5 Palu-Donggala earthquake
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The M(w)7.5 Palu-Donggala earthquake occurred on 28 September 2018 and caused significant damage in Palu City and the surrounding Central Sulawesi region of Indonesia. The earthquake initiated a series of catastrophic landslides (classified as flowslides) [1,2], collapsed buildings, and generated tsunami waves that impacted Palu Bay's coast. The earthquake claimed over 40 00 lives, making it the deadliest natural disaster of 2018. We performed a post-earthquake field reconnaissance and collected perishable data at the sites of five significant flowslides (named for the communities where they occurred: Balaroa, Petobo, Lolu Village, Jono Oge, and Sibalaya), as well as at other damage locations in the mesoseismal region. Our field team consisted of five U.S.-based members, who were sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation-supported Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) organization [3], in collaboration with geologists, geotechnical engineers, and other researchers from Indonesia's Center for Earthquake Studies (PusGen) and the Indonesian Society of Geotechnical Engineers (HATTI) [this international team is collectively referred to as the Palu Earthquake ";GEER" team]. The GEER team arrived at Palu City on 13 November 2018 and conducted five days of extensive fieldwork using instrumentation from the Natural Hazards Reconnaissance Facility (known as the "RAPID") [4,5], including mobile data collection software, digital imaging systems, high-resolution Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antennas, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or ";drones"). The resulting dataset includes over 20 00 geotagged photographs, UAV images, ground coordinates, and other field measurements and observations, as well as associated post-processed geospatial data products (point clouds, digital surface models, orthomosaic images). Additionally, we used remote sensing data (i.e., preand post-event satellite imagery) to generate displacement vectors for over 1200 structures affected by the flowslides. The complete reconnaissance dataset is openly available on DesignSafe [6]. The data collected by the field team and subsequent mapping efforts, which document the morphology and patterns of movements of the flowslides, may be used by researchers studying liquefaction-induced flowslides. In addition, the displacement mapping provides a unique dataset for researchers who are calibrating and verifying simulation models of landslide displacements, or who are seeking a validation dataset for image correlation analysis (including machine learning routines). This dataset is associated with original research presented in ";East Palu Valley Flowslides Induced by the 2018 M-W 7.5 Palu-Donggala Earthquake"[1] and also is the basis of research presented by Gallant et al.

TI  - Peatland-fire interactions: A review of wildland fire feedbacks and interactions in Canadian boreal peatlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Boreal peatlands store a disproportionately large quantity of soil carbon (C) and play a critical role within the global Climate system; however, with climatic warming, these C stores are at risk. Increased wildfire frequency and severity are expected to increase C loss from boreal peatlands, contributing to a shift from C sink to source. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of pre- and post-fire hydrological and ecological interactions that affect the likelihood of peatland burning, address the connections between peatland fires and the C-climate cycle, and provide a conceptual model of peatland processes as they relate to wildland fire, hydro-climate, and ecosystem change. Despite negative ecohydrological feedback mechanisms that may compensate for increased C loss initially, the cumulative effects of climatic warming, anthropogenic peatland fragmentation, and subsequent peatland drying will increase C loss to the atmosphere, driving a positive C feedback cycle. However, the extent to which negative and positive feedbacks will compensate for one another and the timelines for each remains unclear. We suggest that a multi-disciplinary approach of combining process knowledge with remotely sensed data and ecohydrological and wildland fire models is essential for better understanding the role of boreal peatlands and wildland fire in the global climate system.

TI  - Using satellite data to identify the methane emission controls of South Sudan's wetlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides observations of atmospheric methane (CH4) at an unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution and daily global coverage. Hu et al. (2018) reported unexpectedly large methane enhancements over South Sudan in these observations. Here we assess methane emissions from the wetlands of South Sudan using 2 years (December 2017-November 2019) of TROPOMI total column methane observations. We estimate annual wetland emissions of 7.4 +/- 3.2 Tg yr(-1), which agrees with the multiyear GOSAT inversions of Lunt et al. (2019) but is an order of magnitude larger than estimates from wetland process models. This disagreement may be explained by the underestimation (by up to 4 times) of inundation extent by the hydrological schemes used in those models. We investigate the seasonal cycle of the emissions and find the lowest emissions during the June-August season when the process models show the largest emissions. Using satellite-altimetry-based river water height measurements, we infer that this seasonal mismatch is likely due to a seasonal mismatch in inundation extent. In models, inundation extent is controlled by regional precipitation scaled to static wetland extent maps, whereas the actual inundation extent is driven by water inflow from rivers like the White Nile and the Sobat. We find the lowest emissions in the highest precipitation and lowest temperature season (June-August, JJA) when models estimate large emissions. In general, our emission estimates show better agreement in terms of both seasonal cycle and annual mean with model estimates that use a stronger temperature dependence. This suggests that temperature might be a stronger control for the South Sudan wetlands emissions than currently assumed by models. Our findings demonstrate the use of satellite instruments for quantifying emissions from inaccessible and uncertain tropical wetlands, providing clues for the improvement of process models and thereby improving our understanding of the currently uncertain contribution of wetlands to the global methane budget.

TI  - Plasmasphere and topside ionosphere reconstruction using METOP satellite data during geomagnetic storms
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPACE WEATHER AND SPACE CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the space weather monitoring, the response of the ionosphere and plasmasphere to geomagnetic storms is typically under continuous supervision by operational services. Fortunately, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers on board low Earth orbit satellites provides a unique opportunity for developing image representations that can capture the global distribution of the electron density in the plasmasphere and topside ionosphere. Among the difficulties of plasmaspheric imaging based on GNSS measurements, the development of procedures to invert the total electron content (TEC) into electron density distributions remains as a challenging task. In this study, a new tomographic reconstruction technique is presented to estimate the electron density from TEC data along the METOP (METeorological OPerational) satellites. The proposed method is evaluated during four geomagnetic storms to check the capabilities of the tomography for space weather monitoring. The investigation shows that the developed method can successfully capture and reconstruct well-known enhancement and decrease of electron density variabilities during storms. The comparison with in-situ electron densities has shown an improvement around 11% and a better description of plasma variabilities due to the storms compared to the background. Our study also reveals that the plasmasphere TEC contribution to ground-based TEC may vary 10-60% during geomagnetic storms, and the contribution tends to reduce during the storm-recovery phase.

TI  - Characterizing Khetri copper mine environment using geospatial tools
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mines result in land use and land cover (LULC) change due to degradation of natural resources and establishment of new infrastructure for ore extraction and beneficiation. The present study was carried out to, with objectives, (1) characterize LULC change (from 1975 to 2017) in Khetri copper mine region, (2) spatial distribution of pollution indices and (3) spectral response of elemental concentration of soil and groundwater using Landstat and ASTER satellite data. The study was designed to fulfil the objectives and for the same NDVI values were calculated for LULC classification and generated maps were analyzed for landscape pattern. Spatial distribution of pollution indices calculated using geochemical data of soil and groundwater was plotted to understand the impact of contamination on landscape pattern. The correlation of spectral response of Landstat bands with heavy metals concentration was plotted to assess their possible use in quantification of heavy metals. Results show constant increase in settlements, mines and open area while vegetation cover has decreased. Landscape and class level metrics (number of patch, patch density, aggregation index and landscape shape index) indicate increase in the fragmentation of landscape in recent years. Shannon's Evenness Index indicates increase in uniformity in landscape and it is attributed to loss of vegetation and agriculture patches. Pollution indices, Pollution Load Index for soil is high near the overburden materials and Index of Environmental Risk (I-ER) and Contamination Index for ground water is high near abandoned mines. Spectral bands 5 and 6 (SWIR 1) show significant negative correlation, and 9 (Cirrus) shows significant positive correlation with metal concentration in soil and water suggesting the possible use of remote sensing in assessment of metal concentration at ground level. Thus, it can be concluded that mines significantly influence the landscape pattern and remote sensing could be used for the assessment and predication of heavy metal contamination at broader scale in a cost-effective way.

TI  - Assessment of GPM IMERG satellite precipitation estimation and its dependence on microphysical rain regimes over the mountains of south-central Chile
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide crucial information for those places lacking precipitation observations from ground-based sensors, especially over oceans, mountain regions, or developing countries. This is the case over much of South America, including Chile, a country with complex topography that has limited long-term precipitation records and high-elevation data, and no operational weather radars. This study focuses on investigating the skill of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval for GPM (IMERG: version 6) quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). IMERG is assessed against ground-based observations from two field campaigns that took place near 36 degrees S: The Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment (CCOPE; winter 2015), which collected data over the coastal mountain range, and The Chilean Orographic and Mesoscale Precipitation Study (ChOMPS; winter 2016), which collected observations in a transect from the coast to the Andes. To characterize how IMERG performance depends on microphysical regime, we used data from profiling radars and rain gauge measurements to classify rainfall into regimes including "ice-initiated rain" and "warm rain", characterized by the presence or absence of a well-defined melting layer respectively. Rain gauge data was used to evaluate performance of IMERG QPE overall and for these two regimes. IMERG depicts the general spatial pattern of observed orographic enhancement but highly underestimates the magnitude of this enhancement. At higher elevations during CCOPE, IMERG underestimated the total amount of rainfall by 50%, while during ChOMPS the underestimation was by 16%. For CCOPE, at higher elevation sites, IMERG underestimated ice initiated rain by 30% and underestimated warm rain by 70%. For ChOMPS, the underestimation at the Andes site was 33% for ice-initiated rain and 50% for warm rain. IMERG QPE for both field campaigns showed larger underestimations for warm rain periods and at higher elevations than for ice-initiated rain periods. Documenting how IMERG performance varies with terrain and microphysical regime may help guide improvements to satellite-based QPE.

TI  - Disaggregating satellite soil moisture products based on soil thermal inertia: A comparison of a downscaling model built at two spatial scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of high spatial resolution soil moisture data is a major limitation in many regional scale hydrologic, climatic and agricultural applications. The available satellite soil moisture data products are too coarse and unable to cater for this resolution requirement. Downscaling coarse spatial resolution satellite soil moisture retrievals is a feasible option to meet the required level of spatial resolution for those applications. The main focus of this study is to compare two soil thermal inertia-based downscaling models, built by using long-term time records of (i) point scale in-situ data and, (ii) 25 km resolution Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land surface model outputs. The developed models were tested over Goulburn River catchment in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, Australia to downscale Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 36 km radiometric product into 1 km resolution. The downscaled SMAP product from both models produced encouraging results with unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSEs) of 0.07-0.10 cm(3)/cm(3), against in-situ field data, and an average ubRMSEs of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) when compared to the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE'05) soil moisture retrievals. Both models showed promising results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution, but with their own strengths and weaknesses. The findings here provide useful insights on the robustness of the soil thermal inertia relationship across scales and the effects of the model resolution to the downscaled soil moisture estimates. The approach demonstrated encouraging results over semi-arid regions in estimating soil moisture at a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Improving waterbird monitoring and conservation in the Sahel using remote sensing: a case study with the International Waterbird Census in Sudan
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In several regions of the world, the remoteness of potential bird hotspots and lack of trained observers have often prevented countries from effectively designing proper monitoring schemes at a national scale. For many countries, it is not known whether certain bird strongholds have been missed that should be included for more complete censuses. Such gaps at national scales, sometimes large, may be detrimental for global monitoring schemes. To address this, we used the irregular participation of Sudan to the International Waterbird Census (IWC) as a case study. We designed and tested a method based on remote-sensing data of the country's lowlands to detect open water bodies in order to develop predictive models of the potential distribution of waterbird abundance and diversity. To identify open water bodies and their flooding duration, we used a Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) derived from Landsat 8 data. Field ornithological surveys were then used as ground-truth data to estimate the method's accuracy. The statistical results (overall accuracy = 0.972; Kappa index = 0.93) confirmed its effectiveness. Remotely sensed water bodies and additional environmental covariates were then used to build simple habitat models of the distribution of waterbird abundance and diversity based on IWC field survey data. Of the 3119 remotely sensed clusters of open water bodies, three were predicted to host more than 10 000 waterbirds, 89 more than 1000 waterbirds and five more than 30 waterbird species. Located mainly in the southern agricultural floodplains along the main rivers, these predicted waterbird strongholds are therefore recommended for inclusion in the next IWC survey in Sudan. Our findings indicate that using remote sensing to identify open water bodies combined with simple statistical modelling is likely to be a cost-effective solution to improve IWC sampling and to enhance both waterbird and wetland monitoring in vast under-surveyed regions.

TI  - Linking phytoplankton absorption to community composition in Chinese marginal seas
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Phytoplankton pigments significantly affect photosynthesis and play a crucial role in regulating marine ecological and biogeochemical processes. Assessment of phytoplankton pigments through optical means is desirable as it may be extended to satellite remote sensing. Here, using an extensive data set of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) phytoplankton pigment concentrations and phytoplankton absorption spectra (a(ph)(lambda)) collected through five cruise surveys of the Chinese marginal seas during 2016 and 2017, we explore the potentials of using (a(ph)(lambda) to estimate twenty pigments. Specifically, the first and second derivatives of (a(ph)(lambda) are used to construct an (a(ph)(lambda) - pigment model. The validation of the (a(ph)(lambda)-derived pigment classes, specific to individual phytoplankton community and size groups, shows a generally satisfactory model performance. Additionally, hierarchical cluster analysis also exhibits high similarity within the classification results based on the measured and modeled pigments, where only two pigments were decided into different clusters. Although still preliminary in nature, this proof-of-concept study for the Chinese marginal seas shows the potentials of using satellite remote sensing to assess phytoplankton pigment composition once hyperspectral satellite data are available and (a(ph)(lambda) inversion algorithms are developed and validated.

TI  - Targeted axillary dissection-standard or still experimental?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) has been proposed as a possible alternative to axillary staging in initially node-positive breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) and achieving a clinical complete response in the axilla. However, the available evidence is incomplete and many questions still remain unanswered. Objective The aim of the present work was to provide a review of the currently published data regarding TAD, including marking techniques, localization techniques, rates of successfully removing the target lymph node (TLN), and the false-negative rate (FNR). Moreover, the authors wished to elucidate the study landscape. Materials and methods This work reviews published articles and abstracts on TAD. Results The published articles report on an FNR of less than 10%. The optimal marking technique remains unclear. Different tools are used, such as clips or coils that are wire marked preoperatively, radioactive seeds that have to be detected via a gamma probe, magnetic seeds that require detection with a magnetic probe, and the use of a charcoal suspension for visual identification of the TLN. To date, only one magnetic seed is approved for lymph node marking prior to NST and is being evaluated in ongoing trials. There is evidence that an initially lower tumor burden in the axilla is associated with a lower FNR. Conclusion As TAD has already been introduced into clinical routine, it is important to use this technique wisely and to include these patients in clinical trials.

TI  - Impact of Urbanization on Groundwater Levels in Rawalpindi City, Pakistan
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the rate of urbanization directly impact groundwater levels and quality. Therefore, the present study examines the relationship between changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC) and groundwater drawdown in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Landsat images, i.e., Operational Land Imager (OLI), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), were downloaded for the years 1991, 1997, 2007, 2010, and 2017. The study area was classified using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) to create three classes, i.e., urban area, vegetation, and barren land. The groundwater level in the study area for the year 2017 was obtained using an electrical resistivity survey (ERS) with a Schlumberger configuration. The data obtained were interpreted using IX1D iteration software. The results of NDBI and NDVI showed that the urban area increased by 37.89% during the period 1991-2017, at the expense of vegetation. Similarly, the groundwater level was found to decrease at a rate of 1.38 m per annum. If the same trend prevails, the groundwater level will decrease to approximately 160 m from the natural ground surface by the end of this century. The results of the present study may be used for the formulation of policy and proper planning prior to any major developmental project to control the impact of LULC changes on water resources in the future.

TI  - Ground-based validation of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> measurements with the NDACC ZSL-DOAS, MAX-DOAS and Pandonia global networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports on consolidated ground-based validation results of the atmospheric NO2 data produced operationally since April 2018 by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the ESA/EU Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite. Tropospheric, stratospheric, and total NO2 column data from S5P are compared to correlative measurements collected from, respectively, 19 Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS), 26 Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) Zenith-Scattered-Light DOAS (ZSL-DOAS), and 25 Pandonia Global Network (PGN)/Pandora instruments distributed globally. The validation methodology gives special care to minimizing mismatch errors due to imperfect spatiotemporal co-location of the satellite and correlative data, e.g. by using tailored observation operators to account for differences in smoothing and in sampling of atmospheric structures and variability and photochemical modelling to reduce diurnal cycle effects. Compared to the ground-based measurements, S5P data show, on average, (i) a negative bias for the tropospheric column data, of typically -23 % to -37 % in clean to slightly polluted conditions but reaching values as high as -51 % over highly polluted areas; (ii) a slight negative median difference for the stratospheric column data, of about -0.2 Pmolec cm(-2), i.e. approx. -2 % in summer to -15 % in winter; and (iii) a bias ranging from zero to -50 % for the total column data, found to depend on the amplitude of the total NO2 column, with small to slightly positive bias values for columns below 6 Pmolec cm(-2) and negative values above. The dispersion between S5P and correlative measurements contains mostly random components, which remain within mission requirements for the stratospheric column data (0.5 Pmolec cm(-2)) but exceed those for the tropospheric column data (0.7 Pmolec cm(-2)). While a part of the biases and dispersion may be due to representativeness differences such as different area averaging and measurement times, it is known that errors in the S5P tropospheric columns exist due to shortcomings in the (horizontally coarse) a priori profile representation in the TM5-MP chemical transport model used in the S5P retrieval and, to a lesser extent, to the treatment of cloud effects and aerosols. Although considerable differences (up to 2 Pmolec cm(-2) and more) are observed at single ground-pixel level, the near-real-time (NRTI) and offline (OFFL) versions of the S5P NO2 operational data processor provide similar NO2 column values and validation results when globally averaged, with the NRTI values being on average 0.79 % larger than the OFFL values.

TI  - The NeST (Neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer) study: National Practice Questionnaire of United Kingdom multi-disciplinary decision making
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is increasingly used in the treatment of breast cancer, yet it is clear that there is significant geographical variation in its use in the UK. This study aimed to examine stated practice across UK breast units, in terms of indications for use, radiological monitoring, pathological reporting of treatment response, and post-treatment surgical management.MethodsMultidisciplinary teams (MDTs) from all UK breast units were invited to participate in the NeST study. A detailed questionnaire assessing current stated practice was distributed to all participating units in December 2017 and data collated securely usingREDCap. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each questionnaire item.ResultsThirty-nine MDTs from a diverse range of hospitals responded. All MDTs routinely offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to a median of 10% (range 5-60%) of patients. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) was offered to a median of 4% (range 0-25%) of patients by 66% of MDTs. The principal indication given for use of neoadjuvant therapy was for surgical downstaging. There was no consensus on methods of radiological monitoring of response, and a wide variety of pathological reporting systems were used to assess tumour response. Twenty-five percent of centres reported resecting the original tumour footprint, irrespective of clinical/radiological response. Radiologically negative axillae at diagnosis routinely had post-NACT or post-NET sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in 73.0 and 84% of centres respectively, whereas 16% performed SLNB pre-NACT. Positive axillae at diagnosis would receive axillary node clearance at 60% of centres, regardless of response to NACT.DiscussionThere is wide variation in the stated use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy across the UK, with general low usage of NET. Surgical downstaging remains the most common indication of the use of NAC, although not all centres leverage the benefits of NAC for de-escalating surgery to the breast and/or axilla. There is a need for agreed multidisciplinary guidance for optimising selection and management of patients for NST. These findings will be corroborated in phase II of the NeST study which is a national collaborative prospective audit of NST utilisation and clinical outcomes.

TI  - Estimating cover crop biomass nitrogen credits with Sentinel-2 imagery and sites covariates
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops can positively impact productivity and the environment. While improved estimates of cover crop N benefits could help promote their adoption, little information is currently available at the broad scale. We conducted a multi-site study to determine whether use of satellite images and site factors could fill this gap. Six spectral indices were extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and used with modeling covariates to estimate cover crop properties and biomass N credits (biomass x N contents). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were calibrated and validated with samples from 42 cover crop fields located in the midwestern and northeastern United States collected in 2017-2018. Remote sensing (RS)-derived spectral indices strongly correlated (r > .7) with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) but not with rye (Secale cereale L.) biomass. Growing degree days (GDDs), cover height, ground cover percentage, and temperature often had high importance (variable importance in projection >1) in PLSR models. Model predictive power was limited for estimates of biomass N credits when data from all validation sites and cover types were used (adjusted [adj] R-2 = .52). However, models for both biomass (adj R-2 = .81) and biomass N credits (adj R-2 = .89) were successful for red clover fields. This suggests N benefits could be more effectively modeled for specific cover crop types. We also found RS-based estimation of C/N ratios performed moderately well when applied to the complete dataset (adj R-2 = .54), suggesting a way to differentiate grass and legume cover crops that can potentially inform biogeochemical models.

TI  - Evaluation of fine resolution gridded rainfall datasets over a dense network of rain gauges in Niger
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the reliability of gridded rainfall products with fine spatial resolution using 29 gauges of a dense observation network in Niger. Four gridded datasets were considered, viz. the African Rainfall Climatology version 2.0 (ARC2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). The datasets were quantitatively compared to the gauge rainfall at different timescales and their rainfall detection skills were assessed using four validation metrics and three contingency indices, respectively. Furthermore, their potentials for trend analysis was assessed using a modified Mann-Kendall test; and finally, their capability of capturing damaging rainfalls was evaluated using data of five historical damaging rainfall amounts on a daily basis. The CMORPH product showed a good performance in detecting rainfall events and exhibited the best linear relationship with the gauge rainfall; however, it displayed high errors and relative bias (RB > 100%)-showing its inaccuracy in rainfall quantification. At daily, dekadal and monthly timescale, CHIRPS showed the lowest errors, followed by the ARC2 and TAMSAT, whereas ARC2 exhibited the lowest RB-between-12% and 22%. All of the four datasets were unable to unveil the significant trends found in ground observations and were inaccurate in sensing the depths of damaging rainfall amounts. The overall results revealed that the 3-hourly CMORPH dataset is a good sub-daily rainfall product-whereas daily, dekadal and monthly CHIRPS and ARC2 rainfalls have good potentials for hydro-climatological applications in Niger.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To compare doctors' and nurses' perceptions of factors influencing medical error reporting.Background In Nigeria, there is limited information on determinants of error reporting and systems.Methods From the total workforce (N = 600), 140 nurses and 90 doctors were selected by random sampling and completed the questionnaire February to March 2017.Results All 140 nurses and 90 doctors approached responded. Inter-professional differences in response to sentinel events showed that 55/140, 39.3% nurses and 48/90, 53.3% doctors would never report wrong medicines administered and 49/138, 35.5% nurses and 35/90, 38.9% doctors would never report a haemolytic transfusion error. Some respondents (72/140, 51.4% nurses vs. 29/90, 32.2% doctors) were unaware of reporting systems. Most (77/140, 55% nurses vs. 48/90, 53.3% doctors) considered these to be ineffective and confounded by a 'blame culture'. Perceived barriers included lack of confidentiality; facilitators included clear guidelines about protection from litigation.Conclusions Error reporting is suboptimal. Nurses and doctors have a minimal common understanding of barriers to error reporting and demonstrate inconsistent practice.Implications for Nursing Management Suboptimal reporting of serious adverse events has implications for patient safety. Managers need to prioritize education in adverse events, clarify reporting procedures and divest the organisation of a 'blame culture'.

TI  - Effects of iron oxide particles on MRI and mammography in breast cancer patients after a sentinel lymph node biopsy with paramagnetic tracers
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of iron oxide particle deposition on follow-up mammograms and MRI examinations of patients who underwent sentinel lymph node detection with iron oxide particles.Materials and methods: Two hundred and eighteen patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with iron oxide particles were evaluated. Follow-up MRI and mammography were available in 36 and 69 cases respectively. MRI examinations were evaluated for ferromagnetic artifacts that were graded as follows: 0 = No artifact, 1 = Focal area, 2 = Segmental and 3 = Regional signal void artifact. Mammography artifacts were evaluated for the presence of dense particles. Pearson's chi-square test was used for statistical analyses and P < 0.05 was accepted as significant.Results: MRI artifact grading was as follows: Grade 0: 11 (30.6%), Grade 1: 14 (38.9%), Grade 2: 3 (8.3%), and Grade 3: 8 (22.2%). The grade of artifacts differed across surgery types (P = 0.019). Grade 3 artifacts were higher in breast conserving cases whereas Grade 0 was more frequent in subcutaneous mastectomy cases. Three out of 69 (4.4%) cases who had follow-up mammography had artifacts due to iron oxide particle accumulation which presented as Grade 3 MRI artifact in all.Conclusion: Accumulation of iron oxide particles after SLNB with paramagnetic tracers causes artifacts on followup MRI examinations in half of the cases but it is significantly low in mammograms. These artifacts may be confusing in the evaluation of the images. Radiologists must be aware of these tracers and their artifacts whereas patients should be questioned for the type of SLNB before a follow-up examination.

TI  - The Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuyou Formula Alleviates Precocious Puberty by Inhibiting GPR54/GnRH in the Hypothalamus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the traditional Chinese medicine Fuyou formula on precocious puberty (PP). The Fy formula may exert an effect in female rats with PP and GT-7 cells through the GPR54/GnRH signaling pathway. To confirm the effect of the Fy formula on PP through the GPR54/GnRH signaling pathway, we first treated GT1-7 cells with the Fy formula and observed changes in the expression of related genes and proteins and in GnRH secretion. Then, we randomly divided young female Sprague-Dawley rats into the control group, model group, leuprorelin group and the Fy formula group. A PP model was established by injection of danazol on postnatal day 5, and the Fy formula was administered on PND15. The time of vaginal opening, the wet weights of the ovary and uterus, serum hormone levels and the expression of hypothalamic-related genes were observed. We found that the Fy formula delayed vaginal opening, decreased the wet weights and coefficients of the ovary and uterus, decreased the levels of serum hormones (E2, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) and the cellular GnRH level, and downregulated the gene expression of Kiss1, GPR54 and GnRH in the hypothalamus and the gene and protein expression of GPR54 and GnRH in GT1-7 cells. In conclusion, the Fy formula may alleviate PP via the GPR54/GnRH signaling pathway.

TI  - Influence of forest fires on the formation processes of low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids, ω-oxocarboxylic acids, pyruvic acid and α-dicarbonyls in springtime fine (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) aerosols over Southeast Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports on homologous series of dicarboxylic acids (C-2-C-12), omega-oxocarboxylic acids (omega C2-omega C9), pyruvic acid, and alpha-dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) in near source biomass burning influenced (PM2.5) aerosols collected at Doi Ang Khang (DAK), Thailand, during an intense forest fire (March 1 to April 13, 2015) occurred in the vicinity of the sampling site over Southeast Asia (SEA). The molecular distributions of diacids were characterized by a predominance of oxalic (C-2) acid followed by succinic (C-4) and malonic (C-3) acids. The abundance of maleic acid (M) was almost three times higher than that of fumaric acid (F). The observed lower values of C-3/C-4 (mean: 0.54), C-2/C-4 (4.45) and F/M ratios (0.33), indicating the limited photochemistry of organic aerosols at DAK and these ratios were comparable to those reported for biomass burning influenced aerosols (C-3/C-4: 0.51-0.66, C-2/C-4: similar to 4.0, and F/M: 0.2-0.35). Further, strong positive correlations (R-2 > 0.80) were observed for diacids and related organic compounds with levoglucosan (LG, a unique tracer for biomass burning emission), suggesting that enhanced biomass burning associated with forest fires are major sources of diacids at DAK. This inference was further supported by the air mass back trajectories and MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) derived fire spots over the study region. The formation pathway of C-2 was largely linked to biomass burning derived precursor compounds as inferred from the correlation coefficient matrix analysis. We also found that C-3/C-4 and C-2/C-4 ratios were negatively correlated with LG, although they have strongly correlated each other. This inference suggests that biomass burning affect not only the concentration levels of organic aerosols but also their formation processes in the atmosphere. The present study demonstrates that intensive biomass burning during forest fires in SEA largely control the levels of carbonaceous aerosols and seriously affect the climate in the outflow regions.

TI  - Optical and chemical properties of long-range transported aerosols using satellite and ground-based observations over seoul, South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols that are transported long distances to the Korean Peninsula due to seasonal weather conditions can affect the local air quality of South Korea. In general, the long-range transported aerosols are widely distributed and variable with respect to time and space. In this aspect, geostationary satellites can be used as a powerful tool for providing temporal and spatial variation of aerosols by sequentially observing a target area. In this study, select events of high-concentration aerosols transported to Seoul, the capital of South Korea, were identified and analyzed using aerosol optical properties retrieved from geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) for the cold season (October-March) from 2015 to 2018. In addition to the satellite data, ground-based observations of particulate matter (PM) and backward trajectory models were used. Based on the trajectories of air masses simulated with the backward trajectory models, events of the long-range transported high-concentration aerosols (hereafter referred to as "LRT events") were selected and classified into three types: yellow dust, PM traversing over the Yellow Sea (PM-YS), and PM passing through North Korea (PM-NK). Optical and chemical properties of the three LRT events were analyzed, and significantly different features were found. Yellow dust showed a relatively high mean depolarization ratio at 1020 nm (0.26), a low angstrom ngstrom exponent between 440 nm and 870 nm (0.27), fine mode fraction at 500 nm (0.26), single scattering albedo at 440 nm (0.93), and lidar ratio at 675 nm (37 sr) compared with those during the other PM events. Moreover, the proportions of Ca+ concentrations to the water-soluble ions in PM2.5 and concentrations of Ca and Fe among inorganic elements in PM2.5 significantly increased during the yellow dust event. On the contrary, the PM events (PM-YS and PM-NK) had relatively high mean angstrom ngstrom exponent (1.28 and 1.38), fine mode fraction (0.94 and 0.81), single scattering albedo (0.96 and 0.94), lidar ratio (66 sr and 44 sr), and low depolarization ratios (0.035 and 0.066). The ratios of NO3- and SO42- to water-soluble ions in PM2.5 were significantly increased during the high PM events. By comparing the two PM events, the volume median radius of fine mode particles and fine mode fraction of PM-YS were found to be considerably higher compared with those of PM-NK. Such different characteristics found in this study for the three LRT events indicate that optical and chemical analyses of aerosols using satellite and ground-based observations can give us the possibility of roughly identifying aerosol types (yellow dust or PM) and trajectories (passing through the Yellow Sea or North Korea).

TI  - Indexing soil properties through constructing minimum datasets for soil quality assessment of surface and profile soils of intermontane valley (Barak, North East India)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil quality (SQ) assessment considering surface and profile soils holds great significance in sustainable soil health management. We assessed the effect of land-use systems (agriculture, forest and plantation) on SQ using three SQ indices (SQI) models namely additive (SQIa), weighted additive (SQIw) and nemoro (SQIn) from total (TDS) and minimum (MDS) datasets in the intermontane valley soils of North East India (Barak Valley). Surface samples were taken from 13 to 24 cm depth and profile samples were taken up to 102-167 cm depth from 67 profiles selected by multi-layer thematic overlay analysis of agro-physical parameters with Survey of India (SOI) topo-sheets at 1:50 K scale as base map. The estimated SQIs averaged over models and land-uses were nearly two-fold higher for surface (0.751 +/- 0.03) and profile (0.722 +/- 0.02) soils from TDS than the MDS (surface: 0.398 +/- 0.09; profile: 0.333 +/- 0.06) approach. The SQIn model underestimated the SQI values by 28-35% less than SQIa and SQIw for both datasets. The effect of land-uses on SQIs values was mostly non-significant (p > 0.05) for both surface and profile soils. We mapped (at 1: 50 K scale) spatial variability in SQ grades as poor, medium, good and very good in quality and validated by error matrix and Kappa analysis against independent variable (NDVI map derived from Landsat 8). The SQ maps developed from TDS were superior to MDS in Kappa agreement. Among the models, SQIw followed by SQIa from TDS had better Kappa agreement in representing spatial distribution of SQ across soil depth and land-use. We propose the SQIw model as a better option to evaluate soil quality of surface and profile soils with a satisfactory level of accuracy and reliability since it is independent of qualitative assumptions and superior in Kappa agreement for spatial variability mapping. The information generated can be harnessed for managing soil health in intermontane valleys and other such similar agro-ecological regions.

TI  - IRS-1C Satellite Data Utilization for Groundwater Prospects Mapping for the Entire Country Under National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP): A State of the Art Initiative
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional methods of groundwater targeting often result in failures due to improper selection of sites as a result of the lack of scientific database. Satellite-based mapping using geographic information system (GIS) has brought a paradigm shift in the mapping of the natural resources including groundwater. Remote sensing is a cost effective technique to carry out the groundwater prospects mapping which otherwise is difficult to achieve at national scale. A comprehensive database could be created on groundwater resource mapping and assessment using IRS LISS III satellite data from IRS-1C and its follow-on missions like IRS-1D and Resourcesat-1 for the entire India which was first of its kind. A national mission called National Rural Drinking Water Program was launched in the year 1999 to carry out groundwater prospects mapping at 1:50,000 scale for the entire country using 23.5 m resolution IRS LISS III satellite data. The objective of the project was to generate groundwater prospects maps on 1:50,000 scale in GIS format showing (a) different prospective zones in terms of yield and depth of aquifer and (b) tentative sites of different recharge structures suitable in the area. It is imperative that the mammoth task of preparing 4898 groundwater prospects maps on 1:50,000 scale for the entire country has become a reality due to the timely and continuous availability of LISS III satellite images from IRS-1C sensor and its follow-on missions.

TI  - Existential uncertainty in health care: A concept analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives: According to an influential taxonomy of varieties of uncertainty in health care, existential uncertainty is a key aspect of uncertainty for patients. Although the term "existential uncertainty" appears across a number of disciplines in the research literature, its use is diffuse and inconsistent. To date there has not been a systematic attempt to define it. The aim of this study is to generate a theoretically-informed conceptualisation of existential uncertainty within the context of an established taxonomy.Method: Existential uncertainty was subjected to a concept analysis, which drew on existing uses of the term across multiple disciplines as well as insights from uncertainty theory more broadly and from the existential therapy literature to generate a tentative definition of the concept. Antecedents, consequences, and empirical referents of existential uncertainty were also identified. A model case was described as well as a borderline case and a related case in order to illustrate and delineate the concept.Results: Existential uncertainty is conceptualised as an awareness of the undetermined but finite nature of one's own being-in-the-world, concerned primarily with identity, meaning, and choice. This awareness is fundamental and ineradicable, and manifests at different levels of consciousness.Conclusion: Humans rely on identity, worldview, and a sense of meaning in life as ways of managing the ineradicable uncertainty of our being-in-the-world, and these can be challenged by a serious diagnosis. It is important that medical professionals acknowledge issues around existential uncertainty as well as issues around scientific uncertainty, and recognise when patients might be struggling with these. Further research is required to identify ways of measuring existential uncertainty and to develop appropriate interventions, but it is hoped that this conceptualisation provides a useful first step towards that goal.

TI  - Multi-angular reflectance spectra of small single trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the reflectance anisotropy of forests and the underlying scattering mechanisms is needed to improve the accuracy of retrievals of fundamental forest characteristics from optical remote sensing data. In this paper, we developed a laboratory measurement set-up for a large goniometer (LAGOS) and measured multiangular spectra (350-2500 nm) of 18 small trees, composed of three common European tree species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). For all trees, we measured tree spectra in 47 view angles in the upper hemisphere. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting multi-angular reflectance spectra of single trees. We also measured the reflectance and transmittance spectra of needles and leaves, as well as reflectance spectra of bark of the sample trees. We analyzed the spectro-directional characteristics of the trees, and the inter- and intraspecific variations of these characteristics. The anisotropy of trees was shown to be strongly asymmetrical and characteristic to species: while pine and spruce exhibited strong hotspot effects, oak showed a strong specular component. Our results indicate that simultaneous measurements of both spectral and directional characteristics of trees may enhance the discrimination of species and thus, support the retrieval of information of their biophysical properties.

TI  - Forest fire fuel through the lens of remote sensing: Review of approaches, challenges and future directions in the remote sensing of biotic determinants of fire behaviour
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Forested environments are subject to large and high intensity unplanned fire events, owing to, among other factors, the high quantity and complex structure of fuel in these environments. Compiling accurate and spatially comprehensive fuel information is necessary to inform various aspects of land management in forested environments. Remote sensing may offer distinct advantages for this in comparison to traditional site-based approaches. We conducted a literature review of the past 10 years of research in the remote sensing of fire fuel in forested environments, with a focus on emerging methods of fuel estimation, and the fuel attributes estimated. We position our review of remote sensing research in relation to the fuel attributes that influence fire behaviour, as suggested by contemporary physics-based fire behaviour knowledge, and a summary of fuel inputs to widely applied forest fire behaviour models. We find a disconnect between recent remote sensing research and fuel characterisations relevant to contemporary fire behaviour knowledge. Specifically, we find a tendency in remote sensing research towards estimation of forest overstorey fuel attributes, and a relative lack of research that estimates more obscured, though highly relevant, fuel components such as understorey, surface, and bark fuel. We also find a tendency for recent remote sensing research to conceptualise fire fuel by existing fire behaviour models, with particular emphasis on matching pre-existing fuel model classifications. A case is made for remotely sensed forest fuel estimation grounded in current knowledge of fire behaviour processes and the fuel attributes known to influence these processes. Shortcomings in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes are partly due to inherent limitations of current technologies, and we discuss recent and expected advancements in remote sensing research and technology that may drive significant future advancement in forest fuel estimation. Further, we suggest that recognition of interactions between fuel attributes and measurable biophysical forest properties can assist in addressing present limitations in remote sensing of key forest fuel attributes. Such process-based methods would be more spatially and temporally applicable, encourage new techniques for estimating fuel attributes using remote sensing data, and may encourage the development of fire behaviour and risk prediction systems that are more suited to remote sensing.

T2  - NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Energetic Pair Telescope gamma-ray polarimeter uses a time projection chamber for measuring pair production events and is expected to generate a raw instrument data rate four orders of magnitude greater than is transmittable with typical satellite data communications. GammaNet, a convolutional neural network, proposes to solve this problem by performing event classification on-board for pair production and background events, reducing the data rate to a level that can be accommodated by typical satellite communication systems. In order to train GammaNet, a set of 1.1 x 10(6) pair production events and 10(6) background events were simulated for the Advanced Energetic Pair Telescope using the Geant4 Monte Carlo code. An additional set of 10(3) pair production and 10(5) background events were simulated to test GammaNet's capability for background discrimination. With optimization, GammaNet has achieved the proposed background rejection requirements for Galactic Cosmic Ray proton events. Given the best case assumption for downlink speeds, signal sensitivity for pair production ranged between 1.1 +/- 0.5% to 69 +/- 2% for 5 and 250 MeV incident gamma rays. This range became 0.1 +/- 0.1% to 17 +/- 2% for the worst case scenario of downlink speeds. The application of a feature visualization algorithm to GammaNet demonstrated decreased response to electronic noise and events exiting or entering the frame and increased response to parallel tracks that are close in proximity. GammaNet has been successfully implemented and shows promising results.

TI  - Analysis of long- and short-term shoreline change dynamics: A study case of Joao Pessoa city in Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal area of Joao Pessoa city, Paraiba, Brazil, is densely populated and has a large flow of trade and services. More recently, this region has been suffering from the advance of the sea, which has caused changes in the shoreline and caused a decrease in the beach area and damage to various urban facilities. Thus, the spatiotemporal changes of the short- and long-term characteristics of the shoreline of Joao Pessoa city over the past 34 years (1985-2019) were calculated and the forcing mechanisms responsible for the shoreline changes were analyzed. Remote sensing data (Landsat 5-TM and 8-OLI) and statistical techniques, such as endpoint rate (EPR), linear regression rate (LRR) and weighted linear regression (WLR), using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), were used. In this study, 351 transects ranging from similar to 1.1 km to similar to 6 km were analyzed within four zones (Zones Ito IV), and the main controlling factors that influence the shoreline changes in these zones, such as sea level, tidal range, wave height, beach morphology and ocean currents, were discussed. The long-term change from 1985 to 2019 showed primarily accretion on the shoreline of Joao Pessoa city, with the rate of 0.55 m/year (WLR method): 282 transects showed accretion. The results showed that Zone-I, which was located in the south of the study area, was the only zone that primarily recorded erosion from 1985 to 2019, with a mean rate of -023 m/year according to the WLR method. According to the short-term shoreline change analysis, a cyclical pattern of erosion was observed in the 1985-1990, 1993-1999, 2005-2011 and 2014-2019 periods, and accretion was observed in the 1990-1993,1999-2005 and 2011-2014 periods. It was inferred that the patterns of all analyzed zones were similar, i.e., when majority accretion was detected within a zone, the other zones also recorded accretion, except for during the period from 2014 to 2019, when Zone-I showed different behavior. Finally, the long- and short-term analyses showed that the coastal area of Joao Pessoa city is influenced by various forcing mechanism responsible for the shoreline changes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Changes in the Ice-Front Position and Surface Elevation of Glaciar Pio XI, an Advancing Calving Glacier in the Southern Patagonia Icefield, From 2000-2018
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciar Pio XI has advanced and thickened over the past several decades in contrast to the generally retreating and thinning trends seen in other glaciers in the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI). To quantify recent changes in ice-front positions and glacier surface elevation over the ablation area of Glaciar Pio XI, we analyzed satellite data acquired from 2000 to 2018. Two major glacier termini, and most of the small outlet glaciers, showed advancing trends, including the largest advance (1,400 m), observed at the southern terminus during the study period. Surface elevation increased by 37.3 +/- 0.4 m as a mean over the study area, and the rate of the increase accelerated by 135 +/- 10% from Period 1 (2000-2007) to Period 2 (2007-2017/18). Elevation change during Period 1 was only slightly positive except for extraordinary thickening (similar to 20 m a(-1)) observed near the southern terminus and one of the outlet glacier fronts, whereas significant thickening (similar to 2.7 m a(-1)) occurred over the entire ablation area during Period 2. Satellite imagery showed an emergence of sedimentary mounds in front of the southern terminus, suggesting that reduction in frontal ablation and increasingly compressive flow regime are the main drivers of the recent rapid thickening and advance. Most likely, the influence of the sediment deposition on the southern terminus subsequently propagated to the northern terminus and upper reaches of the glacier. The rate of ice mass increase during the study period was 0.48 +/- 0.03 Gt a(-1), which corresponds to 4% of the total mass loss from the SPI from 2000 to 2015/16.

TI  - Global protected-area coverage and human pressure on tidal flats
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are a globally distributed coastal ecosystem important for supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services. Local to continental-scale studies have documented rapid loss of tidal habitat driven by human impacts, but assessments of progress in their conservation are lacking. With an internally consistent estimate of distribution and change, based on Landsat satellite imagery, now available for the world's tidal flats, we examined tidal flat representation in protected areas (PAs) and human pressure on tidal flats. We determined tidal flat representation and its net change in PAs by spatially overlaying tidal flat maps with the World Database of Protected Areas. Similarly, we overlaid the most recent distribution map of tidal flats (2014-2016) with the human modification map (HMc) (range from 0, no human pressure, to 1, very high human pressure) to estimate the human pressure exerted on this ecosystem. Sixty-eight percent of the current extent of tidal flats is subject to moderate to very high human pressure (HMc > 0.1), but 31% of tidal flat extent occurred in PAs, far exceeding PA coverage of the marine (6%) and terrestrial (13%) realms. Net change of tidal flat extent inside PAs was similar to tidal flat net change outside PAs from 1999 to 2016. Substantial shortfalls in protection of tidal flats occurred across Asia, where large intertidal extents coincided with high to very high human pressure (HMc > 0.4-1.0) and net tidal flat losses up to 86.4 km(2) (95% CI 83.9-89.0) occurred inside individual PAs in the study period. Taken together, our results show substantial progress in PA designation for tidal flats globally, but that PA status alone does not prevent all habitat loss. Safeguarding the world's tidal flats will thus require deeper understanding of the factors that govern their dynamics and effective policy that promotes holistic coastal and catchment management strategies.

TI  - Linking forest transition, plant invasion and forest succession theories: socioeconomic drivers and composition of new subtropical andean forests
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context The patterns and causes of forest transition have been extensively studied, identifying socio-economic drivers of land use deintensification and the associated forest expansion. However, most studies do not take into account the origin of the dominant species of new forests (i.e. native or exotic), which affects biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.Objectives We develop a framework integrating forest transition, forest succession and biological invasion theories to identify the socio-environmental conditions that facilitate different pathways of spontaneous forest transitions in a subtropical mountain basin.Methods We used Landsat images and Random forest classifier to detect land cover changes over 30 years (1988-2017). We used generalized additive models to identify socioeconomic and biophysical variables associated with expansion of native and exotic-dominated forests.Results Expanding native forests are scattered throughout the whole basin under a broad spectrum of socioeconomic and environmental conditions. In contrast, the new forests dominated by exotic species were aggregated around their focal introduction areas and their expansion was associated with accessibility and specific land uses (livestock or residential use).Conclusions Understanding the pathways of alternative forest transition involves the integration of land science, forest succession theory and invasion ecology. Land science explains the availability of sites to be reforested. The species composition of new forests depends on the availability of propagules, dispersal agents and competitive relationships between species (forest succession theory). Invasion ecology explains the role of introduction areas (which are often associated with residential use) of exotic species in the successional process.

TI  - River body extraction from sentinel-2A/B MSI images based on an adaptive multi-scale region growth method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River networks are important water carriers that provide a multitude of ecosystem services, including freshwater for agriculture, drinking water for cities, and recreational activities. Accurate mapping of river networks from remote-sensing images is important for the study of these systems. Unfortunately, the delineation of river networks is challenging due to the meandering nature of river channels, the often complex and variable features of the surrounding landscape, and the spatial heterogeneity of the river networks. Here, we present an adaptive, multi-scale region growth method (AMRGM) to delineate river networks from sentinel-2A/B MSI images. The method can handle variable river heterogeneous surroundings, multiple spatial scales, and variable curvatures of the river channels. The method includes four steps: (1) a water index (NDWI) is used to provide initial detection of river water pixels in the image; (2) a bias-corrected fuzzy C-means (BCFCM) method alleviates the effects of the variable surrounding landscape; (3) a scale-enhancement algorithm based on the hessian matrix makes full use of scale and direction information to enhance river morphology characteristics (multiple dimensions and variable curvatures), and (4) a regional growth criterion facilitates handling of various river dimensions. Fast-growing and fine-screening strategies are also included in the AMRGM. The method is applied to eight river networks to evaluate its accuracy and reliability with various river morphologies and hydrological conditions. The AMRGM is more widely applicable than four commonly used river-detection methods (i.e., K-means method, maximum likelihood method, iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm, and support vector machine) and outperform these methods when detecting multi-scale river branches. The mean overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficients (KC) of the AMRGM exceed 97% and 0.92 across the eight river networks. The most accurate river extractions are obtained for large rivers such as the Amazon River, Mackenzie River, and Ganges River Delta, which have more discernable scale and direction characteristics. Relatively high omission and commission errors are observed in river networks with complex and heterogeneous zonations, such as the river Welland, UK, and the Zagya Zangbo River in the Tibet plateau. The complex geomorphic features of the river Welland reduce OA and KC to 93.8% and 0.86, respectively

M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3 is the first satellite altimetry mission to operate both in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode and in open-loop tracking mode nearly globally. Both features are expected to improve the ability of the altimeters to observe inland water bodies. Additionally, the two-satellite constellation offers a unique compromise between spatial and temporal resolution with over 65 000 potential water targets sensed globally. In this study, we evaluate the possibility of extracting river water surface elevation (WSE) at catchment level from Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B radar altimetry using Level- lb and Level-2 data from two public platforms: the Copernicus Open Access Hub (SciHub) and Grid Processing on Demand (GPOD). The objectives of the study are to demonstrate that by using publicly available processing platforms, such databases can be created to suit specific study areas for any catchment and with a wide range of applications in hydrology. We select the Zambezi River as a study area. In the Zambezi basin, 156 virtual stations (VSs) contain useful WSE information in both datasets. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is between 2.9 and 31.3 cm at six VSs, where in situ data are available, and all VSs reflect the observed WSE climatology throughout the basin. Some VSs are exclusive to either the SciHub or GPOD datasets, highlighting the value of considering multiple processing options beyond global altimetry-based WSE databases. In particular, we show that the processing options available on GPOD affect the number of useful VSs; specifically, extending the size of the receiving window considerably improved data at 13 Sentinel-3 VSs. This was largely related to the implementation of GPOD parameters. While correct on-board elevation information is crucial, the postprocessing options must be adapted to handle the steep changes in the receiving window position. Finally, we extract Sentinel-3 observations over key wetlands in the Zambezi basin. We show that clear seasonal patterns are captured in the Sentinel-3 WSE, reflecting flooding events in the floodplains. These results highlight the benefit of the high spatiotemporal resolution of the dualsatellite constellation.

TI  - Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Aura nitrogen dioxide standard product version 4.0 with improved surface and cloud treatments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - 5 We present a new and improved version (V4.0) of the NASA standard nitrogen dioxide (NO2) product from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite. This version incorporates the most salient improvements for OMI NO2 products suggested by expert users and enhances the NO2 data quality in several ways through improvements to the air mass factors (AMFs) used in the retrieval algorithm. The algorithm is based on the geometry-dependent surface Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GLER) operational product that is available on an OMI pixel basis. GLER is calculated using the vector linearized discrete ordinate radiative transfer (VLIDORT) model, which uses as input high-resolution bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) information from NASA's Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments over land and the wind-dependent Cox-Munk wave-facet slope distribution over water, the latter with a contribution from the water-leaving radiance. The GLER combined with consistently retrieved oxygen dimer (O-2-O-2) absorption-based effective cloud fraction (ECF) and optical centroid pressure (OCP) provide improved information to the new NO2 AMF calculations. The new AMFs increase the retrieved tropospheric NO2 by up to 50% in highly polluted areas; these differences arise from both cloud and surface BRDF effects as well as biases between the new MODIS-based and previously used OMI-based climatological surface reflectance data sets. We quantitatively evaluate the new NO2 product using independent observations from ground-based and airborne instruments. The new V4.0 data and relevant explanatory documentation are publicly available from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMNO2_V003/summary/, last access: 8 November 2020), and we encourage their use over previous versions of OMI NO2 products.

TI  - Poisoning during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: retrospective analysis of exposures reported to French poison control centres
T2  - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on French Poison Control Centre (PCC) call characteristics.MethodsReported cases of xenobiotic exposures from 1 March to 30 April in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were extracted from the French National Database of Poisonings. The collected data included call, patient, and exposure characteristics for both general calls and for calls involving sentinel xenobiotic categories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 exposures were compared to 2018-2019 exposures by using simple logistic models in order to provide effect size with odds ratios.ResultsFrom March to April 2020, 32,182 exposures were reported to French PCCs with an overall increase of 5.6% compared to exposures in the same time frame in 2018-2019. A similar increase in calls was observed in non-epidemic and epidemic COVID-19 areas with an increase in calls from the public (+13.6%) while calls from health-professionals decreased (-7.5%). Despite the increase in exposures, the incidence of symptomatic exposures remained stable (-0.4%) with a decrease in severity (moderate/severe -17.2%). A significant increase in exposures to home cleaning products containing biocides, essential oils, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers (odds ratio >1.3, p < .0001) was observed.Discussion and conclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic altered calls to French PCCs with a small increase in calls during the study period and changes in the pattern of exposure. These changes possibly reflected the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic i.e., limited access to primary care, fear of contracting COVID-19 and anxiety related to home isolation.

TI  - Drivers for the poor air quality conditions in North China Plain during the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China's lockdown to control COVID-19 brought significant declines in air pollutant emissions, but haze was still a serious problem in North China Plain (NCP) during late-January to mid-February of 2020. We seek the potential causes for the poor air quality in NCP combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. Efforts to constrain COVID-19 result in a drop-off of primary gaseous pollutants, e.g., -42.4% for surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and -38.9% for tropospheric NO2 column, but fine particulate matter (PM25) still remains high and ozone (O-3) even increases sharply (+84.1%). Stagnant weather during COVID-19 outbreak, e.g., persistent low wind speed, frequent temperature inversion and wind convergence, is one of the major drivers for the poor air quality in NCP. The surface PM2.5 levels vary between -12.9 similar to+15.1% in NCP driven by the varying climate conditions between the years 2000 and 2020. Besides, the persistent PM2.5 pollution might be maintained by the still intensive industrial and residential emissions (primary PM2.5), and increased atmospheric oxidants (+26.1% for ozone and +29.4% for hydroxyl radical) in response to the NO2 decline (secondary PM2.5). Further understanding the nonlinear response between atmospheric secondary aerosols and NOx emissions is meaningful to cope with the emerging air pollution problems in China.

TI  - The variability of warm cloud droplet radius induced by aerosols and water vapor in Shanghai from MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of aerosol optical depth (AOD) on cloud droplet effective radius (CER) is closely related to the liquid water path (LWP) and the total water vapor (WV) in the atmosphere. From a spatial distribution, the interaction between AOD and CER coincided with the anti-Twomey effect in Shanghai. The high-value locations of both the AOD and CER were consistent, both found in central Shanghai. Based on a linear regression analysis of the AOD-CER relationship on a log-log scale, the results showed that the effect of AOD on CER in Shanghai followed not only the Twomey effect but also the anti-Twomey effect. This was mainly due to differing LWPs. When the LWP was less than 50 g/m2, CER decreased with increasing AOD at moderate aerosol loading (AOD < 0.6), and then followed by an increase in CER with increasing AOD. Note that, the role of AOD on CER may be overestimated under this situation. Conversely, when LWP ranged from 50 g/m(2) to 150 g/m(2), CER decreased with the increase in AOD, agreeing with the Twomey effect. The effect of WV on the interaction between AOD and CER was also investigated and the results indicated that the influence of AOD on CER became larger as WV decreased.

TI  - Large-Scale High-Resolution Coastal Mangrove Forests Mapping Across West Africa With Machine Learning Ensemble and Satellite Big Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal mangrove forests provide important ecosystem goods and services, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and hazard mitigation. However, they are being destroyed at an alarming rate by human activities. To characterize mangrove forest changes, evaluate their impacts, and support relevant protection and restoration decision making, accurate and up-to-date mangrove extent mapping at large spatial scales is essential. Available large-scale mangrove extent data products use a single machine learning method commonly with 30 m Landsat imagery, and significant inconsistencies remain among these data products. With huge amounts of satellite data involved and the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics across large geographic areas, finding the most suitable method for large-scale high-resolution mangrove mapping is a challenge. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning ensemble for mangrove forest mapping at 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa using Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) imagery. The machine learning ensemble integrates three commonly used machine learning methods in land cover and land use mapping, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Neural Network (NN). The cloud-based big geospatial data processing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for pre-processing Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data. Extensive validation has demonstrated that the machine learning ensemble can generate mangrove extent maps at high accuracies for all study regions in West Africa (92%-99% Producer's Accuracy, 98%-100% User's Accuracy, 95%-99% Overall Accuracy). This is the first-time that mangrove extent has been mapped at a 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa. The machine learning ensemble has the potential to be applied to other regions of the world and is therefore capable of producing high-resolution mangrove extent maps at global scales periodically.

TI  - A study of thermal controls in rapidly developing city using remotely sensed satellite data: spatiotemporal perspective
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The unsusual rise in the land surface temperature is playing a vital role toward the rapid and intense changes in global climate. Occurrence of certain land use land cover and alternative changes in them is the prime cause of bringing extreme changes in temperature. In this research, using 30-year long time series (1988-2018) data from Landsat satellites for understanding relation of mean temperature with the two largest and main controlling land use classes (vegetation and built-up) in a rapidly urbanizing district, Lahore. For this purpose, multivariate statistical approaches of scatter plot and correlation coefficient were employed. Temperatures, vegetative and built-up areas were derived using a combination of different spatiotemporal tools in a specifically designed model. Critical analysis suggests breaking up of investigation timeline in two portions based on changing trend. A 23-year period from 1989 to 2011 (Temporal Window-1) and a 6-year period from 2013 to 2018 (Temporal Window-2) were tested separately for the same arguments. Vegetative area showed an increase throughout the temporal window-1 and then a rapid decrease from 2013 to 2018, while built-up area and mean temperature presented an ever-increasing trend during both temporal windows but with much higher rates in second window. Correlation of temperature with the both the investigated thermal controls has found getting strong in Temporal Window-2 showing that relation of these landcover areas with temeperature is not linear and severity is increasing with time. Moreover, temperature is found to be strongly dependent upon changes in built-up areas than that of vegetative areas. So, an increase in built-up area has much more devastating effects over the temperature rather than decrease in vegetative area. It was concluded that Lahore district is contributing in global warming more rapidly than it had ever done before.

TI  - Evaluating the temporal accuracy of grassland to cropland change detection using multitemporal image analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are valuable carbon sinks in the effort to mitigate climate change. However, they are not well protected and are consequently being replaced by agricultural systems worldwide. Current monitoring efforts using remote sensing and ground-based methods are insufficient, and accordingly the mapping of grassland to cropland conversions must be improved to better document these changes in the Canadian Prairies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate different structural break methods and remote sensing datasets for their temporal accuracy in detecting grassland conversions in two Alberta study areas from 2010 to 2018. Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), BFAST Seasonal and Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality and Trend (BEAST) methods were applied to evaluate their sensitivity to rangeland and pasture conversions. The best model was BFAST Seasonal, correctly predicting the year of change for 76% of rangelands and 66% of pastures. This demonstrates that seasonal models are effective in detecting interannual changes in vegetation composition amidst background noise from climate and management induced phenological changes. MODIS data outperformed Landsat, outlining the importance of high temporal resolution remote sensing data to successful change detection, even at the expense of higher spatial resolution. Overall, this study demonstrates that structural break methods are effective in identifying grassland to agriculture transitions and may be useful for the operational monitoring of grassland inventories in the future.

TI  - On the generation of internal waves by river plumes in subcritical initial conditions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal waves (IWs) in the ocean span across a wide range of time and spatial scales and are now acknowledged as important sources of turbulence and mixing, with the largest observations having 200 m in amplitude and vertical velocities close to 0.5 m s(-1). Their origin is mostly tidal, but an increasing number of non-tidal generation mechanisms have also been observed. For instance, river plumes provide horizontally propagating density fronts, which were observed to generate IWs when transitioning from supercritical to subcritical flow. In this study, satellite imagery and autonomous underwater measurements are combined with numerical modeling to investigate IW generation from an initial subcritical density front originating at the Douro River plume (western Iberian coast). These unprecedented results may have important implications in near-shore dynamics since that suggest that rivers of moderate flow may play an important role in IW generation between fresh riverine and coastal waters.

TI  - The influence of source maps on SILAM performance in modeling ragweed pollen concentrations in the area of a major European source
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pannonian Plain is one of the centers of ragweed distribution in Europe. The province of Vojvodina (Serbia) is located on the southern part of the Pannonian Plain, representing a highly infested region. In this study, we have used the SILAM atmospheric dispersion model to simulate ragweed pollen concentrations during the season 2016 in the Vojvodina region. SILAM was tested with three different source maps of ragweed distribution in Vojvodina only: (1) map used in operational SILAM, which was calibrated with the SILAM model and observations, (2) map derived using "top-down" approach with land cover data inventory, and (3) map obtained with "top-down" approach using crop classification from the satellite data. Additionally, the sensitivity studies were done using two modified maps to study the effect of the source strength and long-range transport. Results of simulations were validated with the bi-hourly, daily, and seasonal pollen concentrations measured at five stations in Vojvodina. Overall Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.51 (Map 1), 0.50 (Map 2), and 0.42 (Map 3), while debiased scores were 232.95 pollen m(-3) (Map 1), 245.59 pollen m(-3) (Map 2), and 258.24 pollen m(-3) (Map 3). Even though Vojvodina is in the area of a major European source, regional transport of ragweed pollen from a few hundred kilometers of the surrounding area was important in explaining the presence of pollen in the afternoon hours, although it could not completely explain total pollen quantity. The results confirmed that it is vital to calibrate source maps using atmospheric dispersion model with the observed pollen data.

TI  - A Semi-automated Fuzzy-Object-Based Image Analysis Approach Applied for Gully Erosion Detection and Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion and its complex and variable characteristics have led to challenging and many problems for creation of erosion maps with the most commonly used methods of satellite imagery analysis. The fuzzy algorithm-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) method is one of the most effective methods for classifying satellite imagery, which aims to integrate the spectral satellite imagery and provides the necessary facilities for the use of environmental and spatial information as well as a geometric feature of land surface phenomena. The purpose of this study was to apply and evaluate the implementation of different classification algorithms and fuzzy functions membership detecting and mapping of gully erosion. For this purpose, satellite images of Sentinel-2 were employed and accordingly the soil erosion map of Lighvan watershed was developed within the semi-automated approach by applying fuzzy-OBIA features and techniques. The obtained results from the accuracy assessment of the methods indicated that the accuracy of gully maps obtained by fuzzy-OBIA features including: length/width, asymmetry, density, and shape index algorithms with the respective kappa coefficient of 0.78, 0.91, 0.85, and 0.89 is higher than other algorithms. Also, the results obtained from the study of the degree of membership of fuzzy functions indicate the high role of this factor in the accuracy of the results, so that the highest classification accuracy (kappa coefficient greater than 0.91) was related to the length/width algorithm, in which the fuzzy functions B, D, H and L with the highest degree of membership (0.685, 1, 0.972 and 1, respectively) were employed. Results of current research are great of important for decision makers and authorities by means of providing detailed information regarding the soil erosion in the study area as well as GIS sciences society for applying and introducing the most efficient methods and techniques.

TI  - Biting midge dynamics and bluetongue transmission: a multiscale model linking catch data with climate and disease outbreaks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8 has been circulating in Europe since a major outbreak occurred in 2006, causing economic losses to livestock farms. The unpredictability of the biting activity of midges that transmit BTV implies difficulty in computing accurate transmission models. This study uniquely integrates field collections of midges at a range of European latitudes (in Sweden, The Netherlands, and Italy), with a multi-scale modelling approach. We inferred the environmental factors that influence the dynamics of midge catching, and then directly linked predicted midge catches to BTV transmission dynamics. Catch predictions were linked to the observed prevalence amongst sentinel cattle during the 2007 BTV outbreak in The Netherlands using a dynamic transmission model. We were able to directly infer a scaling parameter between daily midge catch predictions and the true biting rate per cow per day. Compared to biting rate per cow per day the scaling parameter was around 50% of 24 h midge catches with traps. Extending the estimated biting rate across Europe, for different seasons and years, indicated that whilst intensity of transmission is expected to vary widely from herd to herd, around 95% of naive herds in western Europe have been at risk of sustained transmission over the last 15 years.

TI  - Envisioning indigenized geography: a two-eyed seeing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing educational curricula and programs in post-secondary education for Reconciliation brings new opportunities and challenges for geography educators, including decolonizing and indigenizing their own teaching practices and perspectives. A team of geography educators, from vastly different geographies and contexts, explored their understandings and approaches to indigenization and found commonalities aligned with Two-Eyed Seeing, a framework that calls for a weaving of perspectives to hold views of both Indigenous and Western knowledge simultaneously. While originally applied in a teaching context, Two-Eyed Seeing is now recognized as a valuable approach in Indigenous research but remains promising as a means to connect indigenous knowledge and epistemology to geography teaching practice. A review of challenges in indigenization efforts in education indicates that Two-Eyed Seeing can address a number of pedagogical challenges, including reducing binary perspectives, providing a more holistic worldview, and creating a safe space for students. Realizing goals of reconciliation, decolonization, and indigenization requires contributions and efforts from across the geography education community, including from non-Indigenous actors who may not be active in the Indigenous Geographies space. Providing strategies and examples of approaches such as Two-Eyed Seeing is critical to support these educators and ensure the best learning opportunities for their students.

TI  - Global distribution of maritime low clouds with an emphasis on different aerosol types and meteorological parameters inferred from multi-satellite and reanalysis data during 2007-2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the comparison of spatiotemporal distributions of maritime cloud top height (CTH) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on level 3 products of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Besides, the latest cloud and aerosol products from CALIPSO and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research (MERRA-2) reanalysis meteorology variables, the response of marine low cloud amount (LCA) as the function of occurrence frequencies of different aerosols (AOF), including clean marine (CM), Desert Dust (DD), and Dusty Marine (DM, the mixed type of CM and DD) are explored for the period 2007-2016. The study suggests, on an annual mean, the total agreement between CALIPSO and MODIS is 72.2%/69.5% during the daytime/nighttime for MLC (marine low cloud) and NMLC (not marine low cloud). It is revealed that the CALIPSO captures 11.4%/15.3% of MLC and 88.6%/84.7% of NMLC. While the MODIS captures 20.4% MLC and 79.6% NMLC during both day and nighttimes, partly due to the misidentification of MLC as aerosols by MODIS. Meanwhile, the discrepancy of AOD between MODIS and CALIPSO is approximately 0.053 on the annual scale, which is likely caused by detection sensitivity and surface reflectance models. Further, we have noticed that the aerosol effects on MLC are dependent on their types. It is evident that the CM tends to invigorate MLC and promote more LCA, and DD inclines to inhibit MLC and contribute to less LCA. However, DM shows the net significant aerosol effect on MLC possibly due to the contrasting aerosol effect of CM and DD. We also found that these aerosol invigoration or suppression effects on MLC present the non-monotonic mode under the condition of heavy aerosol loading.

TI  - How we treat Merkel cell carcinoma: within and beyond current guidelines
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin cancer associated with a high risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis. Optimal care of this potentially life-threatening cancer is critical but challenging because: physicians are often unfamiliar with its management due to rarity, and MCC management remains controversial, in part because it is rapidly evolving across multiple specialties. While guidelines offer a broad overview of management, they are often not sufficient when making decisions for individual patients. Herein, we present a literature review as well as practical approaches adopted at our institutions for staging, surveillance and therapy of MCC. Each of these areas are discussed in light of how they can be appropriately customized for prevalent but challenging situations. We also provide representative examples of MCC patient scenarios and how they were managed by a multidisciplinary team to identify suitable evidence-based, individualized treatment plans.Lay abstractMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a skin cancer with a high risk of recurrence and distant spread.

TI  - Remote sensing of a high-Arctic, local dust event over Lake Hazen (Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A dust plume rising to a maximum altitude of about 1 km above the springtime high-Arctic terrain of Lake Hazen, Nunavut, Canada was detected using a diverse array of passive and active, satellite-based remote sensing techniques. We were able to broadly characterize the 532 nm optical depth and particle size of the upper plume (0.5 +/- 0.2 and 15-25 mu m radius limits respectively). To our knowledge this is the first satellite-based remotely sensed, overland capture of what is an ubiquitous aeolian process across the Arctic: drainage winds inducing dust plumes that are funneled along basin pathways to spread over the water and land surfaces at the outlets of those pathways. The identification and characterization of the Lake Hazen plume was challenging given that there is little development of passive and active remote sensing techniques over Arctic terrains. Our findings suggest that Arctic-adapted remote sensing techniques that incorporate a priori information on dust optical properties can be exploited to identify and characterize locally generated plumes.

TI  - Disentangling the effects of hydro-climatic factors and land use intensification on wetland vegetation dynamics in the Lower Delta of the Parana River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The non-insular portion of the Lower Delta of the Parana River is part of the largest mosaic of wetlands in Argentina. However, it is being altered by intensification of cattle grazing and the increasingly rapid implementation of water management infrastructure. In this context, studying the relationship between hydro-climatic variables and vegetation growth is urgent to ensure sound management and conservation. To overcome the limitation of high cloud cover in the area which has hampered the construction of regularly spaced high-resolution time series, we implemented the recently developed spatio-temporal vegetation index image fusion model (STVIFM). In order to understand the relationship between vegetation growth and hydro-climatic factors, we performed pixel-wise correlation analyses between the newly synthesized monthly (30m) NDVI time series and hydro-climatic variables. Then, we tested whether water control infrastructure alters these relationships. Based on the accurate performance of STVIFM, we provide quantitative and spatially accurate evidence on the positive, complementary and heterogeneous relationships between vegetation growth, temperature, rainfall and the flood pulse. Our results show that water management infrastructure decouples certain areas from its natural hydrological regime, decreasing water availability and altering vegetation growth dynamics. In this context, urgent action is needed aimed towards implementing land planning measures that consider the natural variability and hydrologic regime of the system while balancing production and conservation.

TI  - QGIS-Landsat Indices plugin (Q-LIP): Tool for environmental indices computing using Landsat data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental monitoring has become of paramount importance for researchers and decision makers in order to better protect the environment and achieve sustainable development goals, especially with continuous population growth and rapid urbanization and industrialization processes that alter natural components of the environment and degrade the ecosystems. Hence, the use of Landsat data is of great significance, particularly in environmental monitoring and land management, due to their high spatial resolution and their free of cost availability since 1972. However, calculation of remotely sensed indices for environmental purpose occurs in several steps and requires minimum knowledge in imagery processing. This paper describes the development and design of Q-LIP "QGIS-Landsat Indices plugin"a simple and easy-to-use tool to download, process and automatically calculate environmental indices from Landsat imagery. Q-LIP has been built under Python and designed as a QGIS software plugin; it is available to download from QGIS Plugin Repository.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and fluxes in the Amazon River plume using in situ and remote sensing data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimations of the global carbon budget include a quantitative understanding of the evolving processes that occur along river-to-ocean gradients. However, high spatiotemporal resolution observations of these processes are limited. Here we present in situ measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) made through the Amazon River plume (ARP) during different discharge seasons, from 2010 to 2012. We evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution of pCO(2) using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite observations for each hydrologic period in the ARP. Regression models were used to estimate pCO(2) at the ARP for the period of 2010-2014. From these distributions we calculated sea-air gas exchange of CO2 between the plume waters and the atmosphere (F-co2(sea)). Intra-annual variability of Fseaco(2) was related to discharge at the river mouth and ocean currents as well as trade winds in the plume. Climatic events during the study period had a significant impact on the Fsea co(2). Including the plume area closer to the river mouth makes the ARP a net source of CO2 with an annual net sea-air flux of 8.6 +/- 7.1 Tg C y(-1) from 2011 to 2014.

TI  - Reduced exposure to malaria vectors following indoor residual spraying of pirimiphos-methyl in a high-burden district of rural Mozambique with high ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets: entomological surveillance results from a cluster-randomized trial
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe need to develop new products and novel approaches for malaria vector control is recognized as a global health priority. One approach to meeting this need has been the development of new products for indoor residual spraying (IRS) with novel active ingredients for public health. While initial results showing the impact of several of these next-generation IRS products have been encouraging, questions remain about how to best deploy them for maximum impact. To help address these questions, a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial to measure the impact of IRS with a microencapsulated formulation of pirimiphos-methyl (PM) in an area with high ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was conducted in a high-transmission district of central Mozambique with pyrethroid resistant vectors. Presented here are the results of the vector surveillance component of the trial.MethodsThe 2 year, two-armed trial was conducted in Mopeia District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique. In ten sentinel villages, five that received IRS with PM in October-November 2016 and again in October-November 2017 and five that received no IRS, indoor light trap collections and paired indoor-outdoor human landing collections catches (HLCs) were conducted monthly from September 2016 through October 2018. A universal coverage campaign in June 2017, just prior to the second spray round, distributed 131,540 standard alpha-cypermethrin LLINs across all study villages and increased overall net usage rates in children under 5 years old to over 90%.ResultsThe primary malaria vector during the trial was Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.), and standard World Health Organization (WHO) tube tests with this population indicated variable but increasing resistance to pyrethroids (including alpha-cypermethrin, from>85% mortality in 2017 to 7% mortality in 2018) and uniform susceptibility to PM (100% mortality in both years). Over the entire duration of the study, IRS reduced An. funestus s.l. densities by 48% (CI95 33-59%; p<0.001) in indoor light traps and by 74% (CI95 38-90%; p=0.010) during indoor and outdoor HLC, though in each study year reductions in vector density were consistently greatest in those months immediately following the IRS campaigns and waned over time. Overall there was no strong preference for An. funestus to feed indoors or outdoors, and these biting behaviours did not differ significantly across study arms: observed indoor-outdoor biting ratios were 1.10 (CI95 1.00-1.21) in no-IRS villages and 0.88 (CI95 0.67-1.15) in IRS villages. The impact of IRS was consistent in reducing HLC exposures both indoors (75% reduction: CI95 47-88%; p=0.<0.001) and outdoors (68% reduction: CI95 22-87%; p=0.012). While substantially fewer Anopheles gambiae s.l. were collected during the study, trends show a similar impact of IRS on this key vector group as well, with a 33% (CI95 7-53%; p=0.019) reduction in mosquitoes collected in light traps and a non-statistically significant 39% reduction (p=0.249) in HLC landing rates.ConclusionIRS with PM used in addition to pyrethroid-only LLINs substantially reduced human exposures to malaria vectors during both years of the cluster-randomized controlled trial in Mopeia-a high-burden district where the primary vector, An. funestus s.l., was equally likely to feed indoors or outdoors and demonstrated increasing resistance to pyrethroids.Findings suggest that IRS with PM can provide effective vector control, including in some settings where pyrethroid-only ITNs are widely used.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov, NCT02910934.

TI  - Basin-scale high-resolution extraction of drainage networks using 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of drainage networks is an important element of river flow routing in hydrology and large-scale estimates of river behaviors in Earth sciences. Emerging studies with a focus on greenhouse gases reveal that small rivers can contribute to more than half of the global carbon emissions from inland waters (including lakes and wetlands). However, large-scale extraction of drainage networks is constrained by the coarse resolution of observational data and models, which hinders assessments of terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Recognizing that Sentinel-2 satellite can detect surface water up to a 10-m resolution over large scales, we propose a new method named Remote Sensing Stream Burning (RSSB) to integrate high-resolution observational flow location with coarse topography to improve the extraction of drainage network. In RSSB, satellite-derived input is integrated in a spatially continuous manner, producing a quasi-bathymetry map where relative relief is enforced, enabling a fine-grained, accurate, and multitemporal extraction of drainage network. RSSB was applied to the Lancang-Mekong River basin to derive a 10-m resolution drainage network, with a significant reduction in location errors as validated by the river centerline measurements. The high-resolution extraction resulted in a realistic representation of meanders and detailed network connections. Further, RSSB enabled a multitemporal extraction of river networks during wet/dry seasons and before/after the formation of new channels. The proposed method is fully automated, meaning that the network extraction preserves basin-wide connectivity without requiring any postprocessing, hence facilitating the construction of drainage networks data with openly accessible imagery. The RSSB method provides a basis for the accurate representation of drainage networks that maintains channel connectivity, allows a more realistic inclusion of small rivers and streams, and enables a greater understanding of complex but active exchange between inland water and other related Earth system components.

TI  - Upscaling proximal sensor N-uptake predictions in winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) with Sentinel-2 satellite data for use in a decision support system
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Total nitrogen (N) content in aboveground biomass (N-uptake) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as measured in a national monitoring programme was scaled up to full spatial coverage using Sentinel-2 satellite data and implemented in a decision support system (DSS) for precision agriculture. Weekly field measurements of N-uptake had been carried out using a proximal canopy reflectance sensor (handheld Yara N-Sensor) during 2017 and 2018. Sentinel-2 satellite data from two processing levels (top-of-atmosphere reflectance, L1C, and bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance, L2A) were extracted and related to the proximal sensor data (n = 251). The utility of five vegetation indices for estimation of N-uptake was compared. A linear model based on the red-edge chlorophyll index (CI) provided the best N-uptake prediction (L1C data: r(2) = 0.74, mean absolute error; MAE = 14 kg ha(-1)) when models were applied on independent sites and dates. Use of L2A data, rather than L1C, did not improve the prediction models. The CI-based prediction model was applied on all fields in an area with intensive winter wheat production. Statistics on N-uptake at the end of the stem elongation growth stage were calculated for 4169 winter wheat fields > 5 ha. Within-field variation in predicted N-uptake was > 30 kg N ha(-1) in 62% of these fields. Predicted N-uptake was compared against N-uptake maps derived from tractor-borne Yara N-Sensor measurements in 13 fields (1.7-30 ha in size). The model based on satellite data generated similar information as the tractor-borne sensing data (r(2) = 0.81; MAE = 7 kg ha(-1)), and can therefore be valuable in a DSS for variable-rate N application.

And we propose an error compensation extreme learning machine model. Using the error compensation extreme learning machine and the spectral information of the copper ore can quickly and accurately identify the copper content in the copper ore. Finally, the satellite remote sensing data were simulated, and the copper content distribution in the mining area was obtained.

TI  - Detecting Biophysical Characteristics and Nitrogen Status of Finger Millet at Hyperspectral and Multispectral Resolutions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Finger millet (Eleusine coracana Gaertn L.) is an important grain crop for small farmers in many countries. Reliable estimates of crop parameters, such as crop growth and nitrogen (N) content, through remote sensing techniques can improve in-season management of finger millet. This study investigated the relationships of hyperspectral reflectance with canopy height, green canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), and N concentrations of finger millet using an optimal waveband selection procedure with partial least square regression (PLSR). Predictive performance of 13 vegetation indices (VIs) computed from the original hyperspectral data as well as synthesized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data were evaluated and compared for estimating various crop parameters with simple linear regression (SLR) and multilinear regression (MLR) models. The optimal wavebands determined by PLSR were mostly concentrated within 1,000-1,100 nm for both LAI and dry biomass but were scattered for other canopy parameters. The SLR statistics resulted in the simple ratio pigment index (SRPI) and red/green index (RGI) performing best when predicting LAI (R-v(2) = 0.53-0.59) and canopy cover (R-v(2) = 0.72-0.76). The blue/green index (BGI(1)) was strongly related to canopy height (R-v(2) = 0.65-0.78), dry biomass (R-v(2) = 0.42-0.49), and N concentration (R-v(2) = 0.70-0.83) of finger millet, regardless of spectral resolutions. The MLR approach, using four maximum VIs as input variables, improved the prediction accuracy of N concentration by 14% compared to both SLR and waveband selection methods. VIs computed from synthesized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data resulted in similar or greater prediction accuracy than hyperspectral data for various canopy parameters of finger millet, indicating publicly accessible multispectral data could serve as alternative to hyperspectral data for improved crop management decisions via precision agriculture.

TI  - Integration of remote-sensing based metrics and econometric models to assess the socio-economic contributions of carbon sequestration in unmanaged tropical dry forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon sequestration by forests is one of the vital ecosystem services regulating the global climate. Equally important are the socio-economic co-benefits of carbon sequestration, given their implications for designing policies focused on conservation or restoration of tropical forests. Much debate has been around how to account for, and maximize, the co-benefits of carbon sequestration. Prior research suggests that a better understanding of the spatial relationship between carbon sequestration potential and forest types and dynamics - as a function of geographical context and time - is needed to better estimate their socio-economic benefits. Hence, this paper uses the Tropical Dry Forests of Central and South America to propose a new approach to quantify carbon sequestration of this biome, and its efficiency, using time series of the Terra-MODIS satellite. Our estimations of carbon sequestration are then coupled with a benefit transfer approach to infer carbon sequestration's monetary cost. Results reveal that these tropical forests sequester an annual average of 22.3 +/- 3.3 tCO(2) ha(-1) yr(-1) or in total, 1.16 GtCO(2). The associated social cost of carbon, calculated using three econometric models, ranges from USD 489 ha(-1) yr(-1) to USD 2828 ha(-1) yr(-1). These results can open new perspectives regarding the benefits of carbon sequestration against the costs of the negative impacts of climate change for national welfare accounts, their relevance for environmental policy-making, and the implementation or monitoring of carbon-based incentive programs (e.g., WAVES).

TI  - A statistical-based reach scale classification for the lower Tapajos river channel, eastern Amazonia
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tapajos river is among the largest rivers in the world and has been credited as the main affluent of the lower Amazon River. Geomorphological studies in the Tapajos commonly deal with evolutionary, hydrological, and sedimentological issues. Recently, important advances have been made in understanding the morphology and dynamics in the Tapajos, especially in the confluence zone near Santarem, eastern Amazonian Brazil. However, the lack of an independent channel classification system makes it difficult to integrate data obtained from different sources. This work presents a classification system for the lower Tapajos based on morphometric variables extracted from transversal profiles coupled with radar and optical remote sensing data. We used discriminant analysis of principal components for the first time in fluvial geomorphology to provide a clustering-based geomorphological classification, which is statistically supported. We propose a segmentation of the channel into three distinct sections referred to as narrower channel reach, higher ria reach, and lower ria reach. The results showed that the channel has a distinct morphological pattern in each of these reaches, which can also be observed by the variation along the longitudinal profile. Our findings showed that the most variable hydrological and sedimentological patterns are found in the lower ria reach, while the higher ria reach comprises a canyon-shaped, more stable part of the channel. We discuss the implications of this pattern on the ria's evolution. The method developed here could be applied to other areas of the Amazon basin, where the lack of data and logistical difficulties carrying out fieldwork are common obstacles to large-scale investigations. The identified reaches are indended to be considered in the sample design of future works and in the formulation of water resources management strategies.

TI  - Land Surface Ecological Status Composition Index (LSESCI): A novel remote sensing-based technique for modeling land surface ecological status
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate modeling of Land Surface Ecological Status (LSES) is crucial in environmental applications. Despite valuable benefits, common indices are unable to distinguish LSES of bare soils from lands affected by Anthropogenic Destructive Activities (ADAs). The objective of this study was to present an index to distinguish LSES of different Land Use/Covers (LULCs) particularly bare soils from lands affected by ADAs using remote sensing images. Landsat multi-temporal imagery, National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Imperviousness and High Resolution Layer Imperviousness (HRLI) datasets for Arasbaran protected area in Iran and 13 cities from the United States and Europe were used in this study. First, the surface biophysical characteristics and LULC were derived from Landsat images using the single channel algorithm, spectral indices, and support vector machine. Secondly, a new index was developed based on improved Ridd's conceptual Vegetation-Impervious-Soil triangle model and specified as Land Surface Ecological Status Composition Index (LSESCI). LSESCI was developed by combining Biophysical Composition Index (BCI) information and Land Surface Temperature (LST). In the third step, the LSES was modeled based on Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI). Variance-based global sensitivity analysis was used to calculate the impact of input parameters on the modeled LSES. Afterwards, the variations in these indices were modeled using Subtraction, Variance and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) strategies. Finally, the efficiency of these indices was assessed and compared to model from the relationships between LSESCI and RSEI with spectral indices, and LULC classes. There was an overall improvement in modelling LSES accuracy using the LSESCI over RSEI. For instance, the difference between the mean RSEI and LSESCI for the lands affected by ADAs and Bare soil lands in Arasbaran protected area in Iran were 0.04 and 0.27, respectively. LST and Wetness have the most and least impact on LSES modeling, respectively, compared to other input parameters. The mean absolute value of the correlation coefficient (r) between greenness, moisture, dryness, and heat indices and LSESCI (RSEI) were 0.90 (0.84), 0.76 (0.69) and 0.93 (0.88), respectively. The mean absolute values of r between variations of different spectral indices and variations of LSESCI (RSEI) obtained from PCA, Variance and Subtraction strategies were 0.89 (0.87), 0.73 (0.64) and 0.79 (0.73), respectively. Similarly, for selected cities in the United States and Europe, the mean of r values between RSEI and LSESCI and NLCD Imperviousness (HRLI) were 0.58 (0.77) and 0.77 (0.85), respectively. Overall, the LSESCI had high ability to distinguish the LSES of different LULC classes especially bare soils from lands affected by ADAs. Thus, the proposed LSESCI was superior in modeling LSES of the urban and non-urban regions with heterogeneous surface over RSEI.

TI  - Early detection of forest stress from European spruce bark beetle attack, and a new vegetation index: Normalized distance red & SWIR (NDRS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus [L.]) is one of the most damaging pest insects of European spruce forests. A crucial measure in pest control is the removal of infested trees before the beetles leave the bark, which generally happens before the end of June. However, stressed tree crowns do not show any significant color changes in the visible spectrum at this early-stage of infestation, making early detection difficult. In order to detect the related forest stress at an early stage, we investigated the differences in radar and spectral signals of healthy and stressed trees. How the characteristics of stressed trees changed over time was analyzed for the whole vegetation season, which covered the period before attacks (April), early-stage infestation ('green-attacks', May to July), and middle to late-stage infestation (August to October). The results show that spectral differences already existed at the beginning of the vegetation season, before the attacks. The spectral separability between the healthy and infested samples did not change significantly during the 'green-attack' stage. The results indicate that the trees were stressed before the attacks and had spectral signatures that differed from healthy ones. These stress-induced spectral changes could be more efficient indicators of early infestations than the 'green-attack' symptoms.In this study we used Sentinel-1 and 2 images of a test site in southern Sweden from April to October in 2018 and 2019. The red and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 showed the highest separability of healthy and stressed samples. The backscatter from Sentinel-1 and additional bands from Sentinel-2 contributed only slightly in the Random Forest classification models. We therefore propose the Normalized Distance Red & SWIR (NDRS) index as a new index based on our observations and the linear relationship between the red and SWIR bands. This index identified stressed forest with accuracies from 0.80 to 0.88 before the attacks, from 0.80 to 0.82 in the early-stage infestation, and from 0.81 to 0.91 in middle- and late-stage infestations. These accuracies are higher than those attained by established vegetation indices aimed at 'green-attack' detection, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index, Ratio Drought Index, and Disease Stress Water Index. By using the proposed method, we highlight the potential of using NDRS with Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest vulnerability to European spruce bark beetle attacks early in the vegetation season.

TI  - Classification of tree species in a heterogeneous urban environment using object-based ensemble analysis and World View-2 satellite imagery
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees are valuable in, inter alia, ameliorating air pollution and mitigating the effects associated with urban heat islands. The dearth of tree cover maps is a major challenge for urban planners in the management of urban trees. This work adopts remote sensing approaches to provide urban tree cover maps which can strengthen urban landscape management. Whereas traditional pixel-based classification approaches have been commonly used in image classification, they are not well-suited for urban tree mapping due to their failure to fully explore the image's spatial and spectral characteristics. Object-based classification techniques produce improved accuracies using additional variables. This study depicts the capability of object-based image analysis (OBIA) in mapping common urban trees using very high-resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery. The study tests the utility of WV-2 bands and other feature variables in the object-based mapping of common urban trees and other land cover classes. Furthermore, the study compares the utility of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) in the object-based mapping of common urban trees and other land cover classes. The results show that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NIR 1 and NIR 2 bands were important in the classification of common urban trees and other land cover classes. The RF classifier performed better than SVM, with an overall accuracy of 91.9% as compared to 87.3% for SVM. The results of this study offer insight to urban authorities with knowledge on the segmentation parameters, classification methods and feature variables for mapping urban trees, valuable in urban tree management.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variations in Community Size Structure of Arctic Protist Plankton in the Fram Strait
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Ocean is subject to severe environmental changes, including the massive decline in sea ice due to continuous warming in many regions. Along with these changes, the Arctic Ocean's ecosystem is affected on various scales. The pelagic microbial food web of the Arctic is of particular interest, because it determines mass transfer to higher trophic levels. In this regard, variations in the size structure of the microbial community reflect changes in size-dependent bottom-up and top-down processes. Here we present analyses of microscopic data that resolve details on composition and cell size of unicellular plankton, based on samples collected between 2016 and 2018 in the Fram Strait. Using the Kernel Density Estimation method, we derived continuous size spectra (from 1 mu m to approximate to 200 mu m Equivalent Spherical Diameter, ESD) of cell abundance and biovolume. Specific size intervals (3-4, 8-10, 25-40, and 70-100 mu m ESD) indicate size-selective predation as well as omnivory. In-between size ranges include loopholes with elevated cell abundance. By considering remote sensing data we could discriminate between polar Arcticand Atlantic water within the Fram Strait and could relate our size spectra to the seasonal change in chlorophyll -a concentration. Our size spectra disclose the decline in total biovolume from summer to autumn. In October the phytoplankton biovolume size-spectra reveal a clear relative shift toward larger cell sizes (> 30 mu m). Our analysis highlights details in size spectra that may help refining allometric relationships and predator-prey dependencies for size-based plankton ecosystem model applications.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of satellite-derived phytoplankton size classes using a three-component model bridged with temperature in Marginal Seas of the Western Pacific Ocean
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) are among the most important metrics of phytoplankton community structure and determinants of aquatic food web functionality. Advanced satellite algorithms can be used to estimate PSCs and to integrate the results of biogeochemical research and theoretical studies. Analysis of an extensive dataset of pigment concentrations measured via high-performance liquid chromatography in the southern Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea revealed that nanophytoplankton made important contributions to phytoplankton biomass and that sea surface temperature (SST) was the key environmental factor associated with variations of PSCs. A regional SST-dependent, abundance-based model was then tuned to estimate the PSCs and was found to be more effective than the SST-independent model in capturing the temporal trends in PSCs. The implication is that dynamic PSCs variations may be underestimated by using SST-independent, abundance-based model parameters in marginal seas. Moreover, the logistic "S-shape" dependence of PSCs model parameters on SST suggested that global warming may affect PSCs differently on continental shelves in marginal seas or other middle-latitude regions. Application of this PSCs model to satellite data from 2002 to 2017 revealed the temporal and spatial distributions of the PSCs in these marginal seas. We investigated seasonal climatological variations of PSCs in thirteen representative regional areas, including estuaries, upwelling areas, shelves, slopes, and basins. The results were consistent with in situ investigations but provided more high-resolution information. Wind, irradiance, and temperature were found to be important determinants of PSCs variations.

TI  - Status of glaciers and climate change of East Karakoram in early twenty-first century
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the glaciers change status in Shyok basin, East Karakoram in terms of area and mass balance, and to ascertain if glaciers in this part of Karakoram also display similar anomaly like central or western counterparts. The spatio-temporal monitoring of glaciers during the time frame of 24 years (1990/2000/2014) suggests major percentage of stable glaciers and insignificant retreat in the total glaciated area. The percentage of retreating glaciers has increased after year 2000. Area change analysis of glaciers having size >1 km(2) (569 glaciers) suggests the number of fluctuated glaciers have substantially increased i.e. overall 56% glaciers remained stable, 35% retreated and 9% advanced during 1990-2014. The geodetic based findings using SRTM-C (2000) and Cartosat-1 (2010/2011/2014) stereo-imageries for 201 glaciers suggest the mass loss at the rate of -0.10 +/- 0.07 m w. e. a(-1). To better apprehend the status of glaciers changes in the region, climatic studies using in-situ observations as well as reanalysis dataset (ERA-I) were also undertaken of past 30 years. Therefore, this study is also a maiden attempt to ascertain if alongwith Karakoramanomaly, a climatic anomaly exists in the Eastern parts of Karakoramor not. A long termfield collected snow-meteorological data of East Karakoram region suggests overall warming trend in annual temperature and no trend for snowfall during 1985-2015. The statistically significant increased rates of warming and decreased snowfall after year 2000 support the spatial variations in glaciers of East Karakoram and marginal mass loss. The observations of the marginal mass loss along withwarming temperatures indicate that no Karakoramor climatic anomaly is existent over the East Karakoram region. Our study further refutes the prevalence of the elevation-dependent warming (EDW) over East Karakoram region vis-a-vis North-West Himalayan ranges. The impact of hiatus in global warming was also not observed over studied region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - FDPPGAN: remote sensing image fusion based on deep perceptual patchGAN
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellites can simultaneously capture high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images. Pan-sharpening in the fusion of remote sensing images aims to generate high-resolution MS images by integrating the spatial information of PAN images and the spectral characteristics of MS images. In this study, a novel deep perceptual patch generative adversarial network (FDPPGAN) was proposed to solve the pan-sharpening problem. First, a perception generator was constructed, it included, a matching module, which can process as input images of different resolutions, a fusion module, a reconstruction module based on the residual structure, and a module for the extracting perceptual features. Second, patch discriminator was utilized to convert the dichotomy of the sample into that multiple partial images of the same size to ensure that the generated results can retain more detailed features. Finally, the loss function of FDPPGAN comprised perceptual feature loss, content loss, generator loss, and discriminator loss. Experiments on the QuickBird and WorldView datasets demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms in subjective and objective indexes.

TI  - An attempt for development of pavements temperature prediction models based on remote sensing data and artificial neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) test are dependent upon pavement temperature and its changes daily or seasonally. It is crucial to have the temperature of pavement when FWD data are collected, and also to compare the FWD data for different temperatures. Conventional models for pavement temperature rely on parameters such as air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity. However, the accuracy of these data might not be high when the pavement is far from meteorological stations. Thus, this study is investigating the applicability of using remote sensing technology for the estimation of pavement temperature. Satellite input data are used to develop three models as linear, non-linear and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for depths of 20 and 25 cm and in different layers of asphalt pavement. The predicted temperatures are very close to the measured temperature(correlation coefficients 0.79-0.99). Moreover, the results of this model are compared with the BELLS3 model for Chosen sites in Raton Pass, Aguilar, and Schurz-Nevada, based on the data in IOWA State University in the United States. Nonetheless, the results of this model can be extended for similar conditions with hot weather, subtropical area and low vegetation.

TI  - A local- to national-scale inverse modeling system to assess the potential of spaceborne CO<sub>2</sub> measurements for the monitoring of anthropogenic emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a flux inversion system which assesses the potential of new satellite imagery measurements of atmospheric CO2 for monitoring anthropogenic emissions at scales ranging from local intense point sources to regional and national scales. Such imagery measurements will be provided by the future Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission (CO2M). While the modeling framework retains the complexity of previous studies focused on individual and large cities, this system encompasses a wide range of sources to extend the scope of the analysis. This atmospheric inversion system uses a zoomed configuration of the CHIMERE regional transport model which covers most of western Europe with a 2 km resolution grid over northern France, western Germany and Benelux. For each day of March and May 2016, over the 6 h before a given satellite overpass, the inversion separately controls the hourly budgets of anthropogenic emissions in this area from similar to 300 cities, power plants and regions. The inversion also controls hourly regional budgets of the natural fluxes. This enables the analysis of results at the local to regional scales for a wide range of sources in terms of emission budget and spatial extent while accounting for the uncertainties associated with natural fluxes and the overlapping of plumes from different sources. The potential of satellite data for monitoring CO2 fluxes is quantified with posterior uncertainties or uncertainty reductions (URs) from prior inventory-based statistical knowledge.A first analysis focuses on the hourly to 6 h budgets of the emissions of the Paris urban area and on the sensitivity of the results to different characteristics of the images of vertically integrated CO2 (XCO2) corresponding to the space-borne instrument: the pixel spatial resolution, the precision of the XCO2 retrievals per pixel and the swath width. This sensitivity analysis provides a correspondence between these parameters and thresholds on the targeted precisions of emission estimates. However, the results indicate a large sensitivity to the wind speed and to the prior flux uncertainties. The analysis is then extended to the large ensemble of point sources, cities and regions in the study domain, with a focus on the inversion system's ability to separately monitor neighboring sources whose atmospheric signatures overlap and are also mixed with those produced by natural fluxes. Results highlight the strong dependence of uncertainty reductions on the emission budgets, on the wind speed and on whether the focus is on point or area sources. With the system hypothesis that the atmospheric transport is perfectly known, the results indicate that the atmospheric signal overlap is not a critical issue. All of the tests are conducted considering clear-sky conditions, and the limitations from cloud cover are ignored. Furthermore, in these tests, the inversion system is perfectly informed about the statistical properties of the various sources of errors that are accounted for, and systematic errors in the XCO2 retrievals are ignored; thus, the scores of URs are assumed to be optimistic. For the emissions within the 6 h before a satellite overpass, URs of more than 50% can only be achieved for power plants and cities whose annual emissions are more than similar to 2 MtC yr(-1). For regional budgets encompassing more diffuse emissions, this threshold increases up to similar to 10 MtC yr(-1). The results therefore suggest an imbalance in the monitoring capabilities of the satellite XCO2 spectro-imagery towards high and dense sources.

TI  - Role of remotely sensed leaf area index assimilation in eco-hydrologic processes in different ecosystems over East Asia with Community Land Model version 4.5-Biogeochemistry
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for representing vegetation state, and it is closely related to simulating carbon and water exchanges between land and the overlying atmosphere in land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models. Model simulations are still limited in their representation of vegetation phenological processes and capturing the resulting LAI seasonality. Therefore, this study demonstrated how LAI assimilation into the model improved carbon and water fluxes in different ecosystems over East Asia. We assimilated LAI derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data for seven years (2004-2010) over East Asia into the Community Land Model version 4.5 with a biogeochemistry module (CLM4.5-BGC) by employing the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter method. Results showed that LAI assimilation remarkably improved estimated gross primary production (GPP). In particular, the root mean square error decreased from 97.12 to 48.63 gC/m(2)/ month across the region for June-August. Additionally, while evapotranspiration (ET) was less sensitive to LAI than GPP, the ET components of ground evaporation, canopy evaporation, and canopy transpiration significantly changed after assimilation. The analysis of plant-available soil water showed that LAI assimilation has unique effects on soil moisture depending on the soil layer, climate, and ecosystems. In general, the improvement in ecological prediction skill by LAI assimilation was particularly evident in temperate needleleaf forests where LAI was overestimated most distinctly. This study improves our understanding of the role of LAI assimilation in ecohydrological processes in different ecosystems with CLM4.5-BGC, which allows for the improvement of model forecasting and more accurate simulation of the effects of LAI state evolution.

T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 491 Landsat satellite images from 1973 to 2017 were used to study the evolution of two newborn subdeltas of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya system, the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) and the Atchafalaya Delta (AD). The exposed delta areas derived from the satellite images using an unsupervised classification method were applied to evaluate the long-term land growth and seasonal area variations in the WLD and AD, as well as their main influencing factors. The results show that the land growth rate of the WLD decreased relative to the mean sea level from 1.67 km(2)/year to 0.35 km(2)/year from 1983-1999 to 1999-2017, and the growth rate of the AD decreased from 1.51 km(2)/year to 0.80 km(2)/year from 1973-1999 to 1999-2017. The land building of the two subdeltas during the 1980s to 1999 was more efficient than that from 1999 to 2017. The significant decreases in the land growth rate and land building efficiency are attributed both to the increased impact from relative sea level rise and to the decrease in river sediment discharge, and the extension of the distributary channels, as well. The satellite-derived exposed areas of the WLD and AD show unique seasonal loops affected by the growth of vegetation during the warmer weather from April to June and the decay of vegetation mainly due to the cold fronts in December, which is different from the monotonic changes in the areas of other deltas, mainly driven by the rise and fall of water levels. A new method based on the correction between the exposed areas and water levels from December to April was used to estimate the vertical growth rates of the WLD and AD. After deducting the relative sea level rise rate, the net sediment deposition rates of the WLD and AD were estimated to be 20.8 and 24.2 mm/year, respectively. Approximately 72% and 62% of the sediments deposited in the WLD and AD were used to offset the effects of relative sea level rise when building deltaic lands from 1999 to 2017. This study not only improves our understanding of the growth of newborn subdeltas but also aids in assessing whether river course shifts and sediment diversions can restore deltas or deltaic wetlands that are at risk of drowning.

TI  - Impact of dust events on the optimization of photovoltaic-wind hybrid system in desert
T2  - WIND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable optimization of renewable energy systems has to be adapted to the installation site and its environmental factors. In dust event sources, the impact of dust on solar irradiance or on system's production is not usually taken into consideration during optimization of photovoltaic (PV) or PV-wind hybrid systems. The first objective of this paper was to make observatory studies on wind velocity and lifting of Saharan dust that characterize Algerian desert which allowed us to extract a wind threshold for each event in our desert site. The second objective was to quantify this dust suspension and its negative impact, up to 47.46% on global solar irradiance (GSI) and 48.95% on photovoltaic yield effects were observed. The third and main objective of this paper was evaluating changes in optimized system when the dust impact was taken into account. To achieve that we adjusted GSI satellite data on HOMER software to dust presence, and then we run an optimization on HOMER with its GSI database and the new data, this data adjustment leads to a significant expansion of 13.70% on the size of PV generator, also 7.66% and 7.68% increase on the investment expenses and cost of energy respectively. Results obtained on this paper can be used to make PV-hybrid system's technical and financial optimization in the main Algerian dust source trustworthy.

TI  - Mapping CAMP formations of the northern flank of Tindouf Basin by integrating remotely sensed data, geochemistry and field observations
T2  - LITHOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is a major Large Igneous Province. Its formation coincides with the breakup of Pangea and the first opening stages of the central Atlantic Ocean. The CAMP consists of mafic rocks, often in the form of sills, dikes, and lava flows, which are spread across four continents (Africa, North America, South America, and Europe). The Algerian CAMP appears in the southwestern Paleozoic Bechar, Tindouf, Hank, and Taoudeni basins, where the magma is intruded within the Paleozoic sedimentary series in the form of giant sills and km-long dikes. The CAMP formations in western Africa are classically subdivided into four strati graphic units (lower, intermediate, upper, and recurrent); however, only the upper and recurrent units were recognized by previous work in the Tindouf Basin. These two units are geochemically and petrographically well studied, but their spatial distribution and emplacement mode are still unknown.This study maps CAMP units within the northern flank of the Tindouf Basin by integrating geochemical and remote sensing data. As a first step, basic remote sensing techniques such as color composites and ratioing were applied to Landsat 8 images to locate the different CAMP outcrops in the study area. Then, a field expedition was performed to validate preliminary results and collect samples for geochemical and petrographic analysis. The field and laboratory observations show the existence of three different doleritic units: upper, recurrent, and plug-like intrusion units. This last unit contains a high concentration of sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) that could be of economic interest. The analysis of the combined geochemical results and reflectance values shows a strong concordance between the mineralogical composition and the spectral response of samples. The reflectance variation of CAMP units is widely controlled by iron, magnesium, and calcium oxides. Thus, advanced image processing techniques were applied on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A images. Furthermore, the analysis of the spatial distribution of these units, linked to the formation type (sill, dike, or intrusion) and the stratigraphic level (Devonian or Carboniferous), may provide insight to understand the emplacement mechanism and ore potential.

TI  - The contribution of remotely sensed data to the stress state evaluation in underground marble quarries
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An in-depth knowledge of the geostructural characteristics of the territory is fundamental for optimizing the design of artificial structures. Feasibility, costs, duration, and issues of the works are strictly correlated with the geological, geomechanical, and in situ stress features of the area. Remotely sensed data represent a source of information for detecting tectonic structures that can be complementary to traditional surveys, with the advantage of being cheaper, of covering large areas and of reducing time for surveying. The study of the regional tectonic setting together with local structural features is fundamental to define the far-field tectonic stress and for correctly modeling the induced stress during excavation activities and monitoring stress variations. A multiscale and multidisciplinary approach was set up and applied to an area in the Alpi Apuane marble district (Tuscany, Italy). Visually and semi-automatically detected geological structures were analyzed and correlated to data from in-situ measurements in four underground marble quarries, to define the far-field stress state. This study is also an attempt to bridge the gap between structural geology analysis and remotely sensed data for far-field stress definition, correlating on-field kinematic observations and in situ stress measurements.(c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Wilding of a post-industrial site provides a habitat refuge for an endangered woodland songbird, the British Willow Tit <i>Poecile montanus kleinschmidti</i>
T2  - BIRD STUDY
M3  - Article
AB  - Capsule: Post-industrial sites that have become wilded by colonizing vegetation can represent important habitat refuges for Willow Tits Poecile montanus, which occupy large territories in early-successional wet woodland and scrub.Aims: To quantify Willow Tit population density and territory characteristics on a habitat mosaic of wetland, grassland and woodland/scrub, which has developed on a 596 ha area of former coal mining activities in northwest England.Methods: Field surveys located all 35-37 nests per year during 2017-2019. Territories were estimated using Thiessen polygons around nest sites. Remote sensing data (land cover mapping and lidar) characterized woody vegetation height and coverage across the site and within territories. Changes in coverage between 1990 and 2015 were assessed to estimate the age of woody vegetation. The relationship between territory size and woodland was tested to see if birds secure a similar area and volume of woody vegetation in each territory.Results: Mean breeding density was 7.3 pairs/km(2) (excluding 103 ha of ponds/lakes). Estimated territories averaged 13.7 ha, or 6.9 ha in wooded habitat only. The woodland and scrub were a maximum of 25-30 years old and had a mean height of 3.7 m. Larger territories contained a greater coverage and volume of wooded habitat. The site held 1.3% of the national and global population of the British subspecies of Willow Tit.Conclusion: Willow Tits occur at low density and require large areas of habitat. Wilded post-industrial sites appear to be important for Willow Tit conservation in Britain, but may require ongoing management to maintain the early-successional woodland and scrub associated with new wetlands in former mining areas. Such sites may have a broader conservation value for a range of species.

TI  - Scaling Phenocam GCC, NDVI, and EVI2 with Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel using Gaussian Processes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of near-surface remote sensing for monitoring vegetation phenology has advanced greatly over the past decade. The Phenocam Network has deployed more than 500 web-enabled cameras across the globe that use digital repeat photography to capture color information and measure changes in vegetation phenology across diverse ecosystems. Vegetation indices (VIs) such as the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) have been derived from phenocam imagery. However, it is often necessary to scale these metrics to align them with satellite imagery since phenocam data are not standardised to surface reflectance. We developed a method to convert phenocam digital numbers (DNs) to align with Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 surface (HLS) reflectance products using a Gaussian process. We applied our method across six grassland phenocam sites. The Gaussian Process regression was on average able to account for 77.4 percent of the variation in the HLS surface reflectance, and our resulting phenocam VIs had a high level of agreement with the modeled HLS VIs with an R-2 of 0.811. This technique provides a novel method for standardising phenocam imagery, easing comparison between multiple phenocam locations and satellite or other sensors that have a standardised surface reflectance product.

TI  - Deuteron-deuteron elastic and three- and four-body breakup scattering using the Faddeev-Yakubovskii equations
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW C
M3  - Article
AB  - The deuteron-deuteron elastic and three- and four-body breakup scattering cross section have been calculated using the Faddeev-Yakubovskii (FY) chain-of-partition momentum-space equations. In this calculation the initial two-cluster potential is split into separable and nonseparable components, and the effective potential is reduced to elastic two-body and three- and four-body breakup open channels and a closed-channel many-body contribution. The closed-channel contribution is determined by minimizing a variational bound. The Coulomb interaction was included by expanding the initial and final Coulomb states in a Coulomb-Sturmian basis. The three sets of chain-of-partition integral equations were solved for the elastic and three- and four-body breakup scattering amplitudes. The calculations were performed for the S = 2 spin/L = 0 angular-momentum state. The elastic and double-breakup calculations were performed for energies up to E = 5.48 MeV, while the single-breakup calculations were performed for energies up to E = 4.17 MeV. In the case of elastic scattering, the calculated scattering length of a (5)a(dd) = 7.8 +/- 0.3 fm is in good agreement with a FY cluster reduction calculation. The calculated phase shift is smaller than that predicted by the resonating group model and this difference is believed to be due to the differences in the potential and calculation methods. The breakup cross sections were calculated as a function of initial deuteron momentum and fragmented-deuteron momentum. The d + d -> d + n + p cross sections were compared with neutron yield measurements and, while the measurements also included the L > 0 components, the general features were consistent. Estimates of the calculational uncertainties/bias are provided.

TI  - Transformation for sustainability: a deep leverage points approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Change and transformation of human systems are increasingly seen as the fundamental solution space for treating the root causes of unsustainability. What does transformation of human systems for sustainability exactly mean and entail, and how to effectively transform human systems? This paper addresses these essential questions in a holistic, systems thinking approach following and extending the leverage points tool for systemic change proposed by Meadows (Thinking in Systems: a primer. Chelsea Green Publishing, White River Junction, 2008). The paper focuses on the often unquestioned, largely unconscious, systemic realm of mental models and human intent. It targets Meadows' deepest leverage points of purpose and paradigm; beyond, it deals with worldview, core metaphor, and human thinking. The fundamental outcome of this conceptual study is that unsustainability roots in a cognitive illusion coupled to a lack of teleological thinking. Transformation needs us to see and reconceive the human-world bond through the systemic lens of dynamic inclusion, aliveness, purpose and value. Learning to think in terms of living systems, physical and mental, and substituting the iceberg metaphor-in-use in conventional systems thinking with a holistic metaphor of nested leverage points are the first transformation steps toward a new sustainability paradigm. Practical evidence and ecological content come from the transformative design discipline of biomimicry, which consciously turns to nature as the source of its conceptual system. The paper concludes that transformative practice for sustainability will gain momentum by braiding together systems thinking in practice and biomimicry thinking. In sum, this transdisciplinary approach opens up exciting research horizons in ontological, epistemological, methodological and teleological directions.

TI  - Monitoring urban expansion using SVM classification approach in Khenifra city (Morocco)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is a major process in developing countries such as Morocco. Since their appearance in the 1970s, digital remote-sensing space sensors have been used to provide images with spatial and spectral resolutions that are adequate to comprehend the phenomenon of urban expansion. Become real tools for cities management and planning, through the many applications. Using Landsat images, we studied Khenifra's (Moroccan city) urban area evolution and extension to quantify its impact on current landscape. A supervised classification using support vector machines (SVM) was employed to extract the urban state in three periods 1991, 2000 and 2017. The results reveal a clear progression of total occupied urban space from 12% in 2000 until 36% in 2017. This expansion is unevenly distributed in space, and at slightly different rates depending on the period considered. This phenomenon of significant urban expansion is largely related to population growth and the rural exodus.

TI  - Small Mammals as Reservoir for Zoonotic Agents in Afghanistan
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Rodents and other small mammals can serve as reservoirs for a large number of zoonotic pathogens. A higher risk of infection with rodent-borne pathogens exists for humans with direct contact to rodents and/or their excretions, e.g., soldiers in operation areas. To date, little is known about endemic human pathogenic disease agents that are naturally associated with small mammals in Afghanistan. The aim of this study was to screen abundant rodents and insectivores collected from 2009 to 2012 in four field camps of the German Federal Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) in Northern Afghanistan for the presence of different pathogens.Materials and Methods:Isolated nucleic acids from ear pinna were screened by real-time PCR for spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae and from liver samples for Francisella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Yersinia pestis, and poxvirus. Chest cavity lavage (CCL) samples were tested for antibodies against SFG and typhus group (TG) rickettsiae, as well as against flaviviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay.Results:Rickettsial DNA was detected in 7/750 (1%) ear pinna samples with one being identified as Rickettsia conorii. Antibodies against SFG rickettsiae were detected in 15.3% (n = 67/439) of the small mammals; positive samples were only from house mice (Mus musculus). Antibodies against TG rickettsiae were found in 8.2% (n = 36/439) of the samples, with 35 from house mice and one from gray dwarf hamster (Cricetulus migratorius). Flavivirus-reactive antibodies were detected in 2.3% (n = 10/439) of the investigated CCL samples; again positive samples were exclusively identified in house mice. All 199 investigated liver-derived DNA preparations were negative in the Francisella spp., C. burnetii, Brucella spp., Y. pestis, and poxvirus-specific PCRs.Conclusions:Further investigations will have to prove the potential value of rodents in army camps as sentinel animals.

TI  - Spatio-temporal and synoptic changes in dust at the three islands in the Persian Gulf region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of severe and inclusive dust storms has caused a lot of damage every year in the Persian Gulf region and it has destructive environmental effects in this area. The aim of this study is to investigate the monthly changes in the frequency of dust storms over Khark, Kish and Qeshm islands located in the Persian Gulf region during the 10-year period (2007-2017) using satellite and model observations. The results show that the highest dust frequency was observed over Qeshm Island followed by Kish and Khark Islands. The highest number of dusty days was reported in all three stations in 2008 and most of the dust events occurred in May and July as compared to other months. The average wind speed in these two months (May and July) shows that the wind directions are mostly from northern and northwestern areas. The dust AOD evaluation of eight dust prediction models shows that the models simulated AOD patterns vary differently from each other for a severe dust storm on July 14, 2014 in the study area. Among the eight models, DREAM8-MACC model has a better performance and has good agreement with satellite observations. The analysis showed a high correlation (R = 0.74) between AERONET and DREAM8-MACC model AOD at the observation sites.

TI  - An Improved DDV Algorithm for the Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth From NOAA/AVHRR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is one of the important parameters to characterize the physical properties of the atmospheric aerosol, which is used to describe the extinction characteristics of the aerosol, and also to calculate the aerosol content, to assess the degree of air pollution and to study aerosol climate effect. To study the historical change of aerosol in long-time series, the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data earliest used for aerosol research was used in this study. Due to the lack of shortwave infrared (SWIR) (center at 2.13 mu m) of the sensor, the relationship between the blue and red bands with SWIR cannot be provided, and the visible band used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) contains the wavelength range of red and green, it is very difficult to calculate the accurate land surface reflectance (LSR). Therefore, based on the Dense Dark Vegetation algorithm (DDV), we propose to introduce mature MODIS vegetation index products (MYD13) to correct AVHRR NDVI, to support the estimation of AVHRR LSR, determine the relationship between corrected AVHRR NDVI and visible band LSR, and to carry out aerosol retrieval. The results show that about 63% of the data are within the error line, and there is a consistent distribution trend in the inter-comparison validation with MODIS aerosol products (MYD04).

TI  - Motion Consistency-Based Correspondence Growing for Remote Sensing Image Matching
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a remote sensing image matching method that is simple yet efficient to deal with different deformations. Inspired by the region growing strategy used in image segmentation, we integrate the motion consistency into the general region growing pipeline from a novel perspective. Specifically, we first obtain a subset with a high ratio inlier as the seed correspondence set. Then, to find more reliable correspondences, we formulate the motion consistency into the correspondence growing criterion, which is general to be suitable to many remote sensing applications. Extensive experimental results on the public available remote sensing data set show that our method achieves the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Regulation of Th17 cell development by gut commensals is known to contribute to their dichotomous role in promoting gut homeostasis and host defense, or development of autoimmune diseases. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. One candidate factor contributing to Th17 differentiation, and the expression of which could be influenced by commensals is the atypical nuclear I kappa B protein I kappa B zeta. I kappa B zeta acts as a transcriptional regulator of the expression of Th17-related secondary response genes in many cell types including dendritic cells (DCs). Insights into the regulation of I kappa B zeta in DCs could shed light on how these immune sentinel cells at the interface between commensals, innate and adaptive immune system drive an immune-tolerogenic or inflammatory Th17 cell response. In this study, the influence of two gut commensals of low (Bacteroides vulgatus) or high (Escherichia coli) immunogenicity on I kappa B zeta expression in DCs and its downstream effects was analyzed. We observed that the amount of I kappa B zeta expression and secretion of Th17-inducing cytokines correlated with the immunogenicity of these commensals. However, under immune-balanced conditions, E. coli also strongly induced an I kappa B zeta-dependent secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10, facilitating a counter-regulative Treg response as assessed in in vitro CD4(+) T cell polarization assays. Yet, in an in vivo mouse model of T cell-induced colitis, prone to inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, administration of E. coli promoted an expansion of rather pro-inflammatory T helper cell subsets whereas administration of B. vulgatus resulted in the induction of protective T helper cell subsets. These findings might contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases using commensals or commensal-derived components.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration mineral deposits from Landsat 8 satellite data in Pala, Mayo Kebbi Region, Southwestern Chad
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The different image attribute extracting techniques, spectral enhancement ability, pixel classification methods have been applied on the Landsat 8 OLI satellite image data to map geological features and spatial distribution of hydrothermal alteration zones, which have been recorded to be associated with gold mineralization in the Pala, Mayo Kebbi region of southwestern Chad. Radiometric calibrated, noise filtered and image enhanced Landsat 8 OLI data were subjected to colour composite, band rationing and crosta analyses in order to enhance spectral reflectance and compositional information, create colourful multispectral images which enable the mapping of desired spectral bands into principal component images for the purpose of accentuating salient information needful to delineate hydrothermal alteration zones within the study area.Composite ratios 4/2-6/7-6/5 indicate relative spatial distribution of iron-oxide in the southeast while clays and hydroxyl minerals occur in the west and northwestern part of the study area. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues for hydroxyl minerals from the crosta analysis indicate highest loadings of opposite signs (-0.721498 & 0.649465; bands 6 & 7) in PC3, representing "H" image. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues for iron-oxides on the other hand present highest loading of opposite signs (0.895721 & -0.443283; bands 2 & 4) in PC4, representing the "F" image. The white coloured pixels within the bright reflections generated from Crosta composite image of H, H+F & F in RGB delineate hydrothermal alteration zones. The plot of delineated zones of hydrothermal alteration on the Landsat 8 true colour indicate spatial distribution of the alteration areas within the host greenstone belt belonging to the Precambrian Goueygoudoum series and they plot mainly along major structural features, suggesting structural control. Field control revealed that some areas delineated by band rationing as hydrothermal alteration zones appear to be the result of intense weathering. Accordingly, we recommend that remote sensing delineation of hydrothermal alteration zones should be checked by a relevant ground-observation based control procedure. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Analysis of urban heat island effect in Visakhapatnam, India, using multi-temporal satellite imagery: causes and possible remedies
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal data sets of Landsat for the years 2014 and 2019 are used to assess the transients of land surface temperature (LST) in Visakhapatnam, India. The variation in estimated temperature fields is compared with the land use pattern to validate temperature with reference to land use land cover (LULC). During the considered period, the built-up area in the study region increased by 63%. The aerial extent of water bodies has come down by 12.5%, and there is a significant drop in vegetation cover. The LST of the regions with the densely built-up area is high compared to the other types of land use. A mean rise of 4.8 degrees C in the LST has been noticed over the study area during this period. Few monitoring points representing rural areas within the proximity of the study region have been established, and the LST is monitored explicitly. As a result, it has been observed that the temperature in rural areas is relatively lower than the city region, which confirms the urban heat island effect. A micro-level study has been conducted by dividing the study area into four zones as per administrative boundaries. Statistical analysis using the zonal attributes affirms a positive correlation of 0.55 between LST and the built-up area. In contrast, a negative correlation of 0.52 between LST and vegetation cover is observed. The LULC results are validated using Google Earth Images captured at a finer resolution. Being selected as one of the cities under the smart city mission by the Urban Development Ministry of Govt. of India, it is expected that the land use pattern in Visakhapatnam will change drastically in the coming years. The findings of this study foster the relationship between LST and LULC, and the conclusions thus drawn would help planners for the sustainable development of Visakhapatnam.

TI  - Development and characterization of an all-in-one gamma probe with auto-peak detection for sentinel lymph node biopsy based on NEMA NU3-2004 standard
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A gamma probe is a handheld device used for intraoperative interventions following interstitial injection of a radiotracer to locate regional lymph nodes through the external detection of radiation. This work reports on the design and performance evaluation of a novel fully integrated gamma probe (GammaPen), recently developed by our group. Materials and methods GammaPen is an all-in-one pocket gamma probe with low weight and adequate dimensions, consisting of a detector, a control unit and output all together. The detector module consists of a cylindrical Thallium-activated Cesium Iodide [CsI (Tl)] crystal optically coupled to a Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), shielded using Tungsten housing on side and back faces. The electronics of the probe consists of two small boards to handle signal processing and analog peak detection tasks. A number of parameters, including probe sensitivity in air/water, spatial resolution in air/water, angular resolution in air/water, and side and back shielding effectiveness, were measured to evaluate the performance of the probe based on NEMA NU3-2004 standards. Results The sensitivity of the probe in air at distances of 10, 30, and 50 mm is 18784, 3500, and 1575 cps/MBq. The sensitivity in scattering medium was also measured at distances of 10, 30, and 50 mm as 17,680, 3050, and 1104 cps/MBq. The spatial and angular resolutions in scattering medium were 47 mm and 87 degree at 30 mm distance from the probe, while they were 40 mm and 77 degree in air. The detector shielding effectiveness and leakage sensitivity are 99.91% and 0.09%, respectively. Conclusion The performance characterization showed that GammaPen can be used effectively for sentinel lymph node localization. The probe was successfully used in several surgical interventions by an experienced surgeon confirming its suitability in a clinical setting.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The capability of IRS-1C mission of ISRO to acquire imagery of Earth's surface from multiple orbits to form a stereo pair creates a possibility to recreate the terrain topography and to indulge in digital topographic mapping from space borne line scanner imagery. The scientific exercises leading to use of IRS-1C stereo imagery, specifically development of algorithms and software for assimilating orbit and attitude data sets in photogrammetric relations are summarized in this review paper. Further developments in this direction attributed to conceptualization, design and operational exploitation of Cartosat-1 as a dedicated cartography mission are summarized. A number of technologies like stereo strip triangulation for working with long strips, parametric modeling of image to ground relations through rational polynomial coefficients and for obtaining relative undulations without the use of ground control points developed for Cartosat-1 and other missions of Cartosat series are summarized. Brief description of some large scale operational solutions for extracting three-dimensional elevation model from Cartosat-1 data like CartoDEM, SAPHIRE, Karnataka GIS framework is provided. Some future possibilities are explored.

TI  - A fast, edge-preserving, distance-regularized model with bilateral filtering for oil spill segmentation of SAR images
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spills are among the most significant sources of marine pollution. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used to improve oil spill observations because of its advantages in oil spill detection and identification. However, speckle noise, weak boundaries, and intensity inhomogeneity often exist in the oil spill regions of SAR imagery, which will seriously affect the accurate identification of oil spills. To enhance marine oil spill segmentation of SAR images, a fast, edge-preserving framework based on the distance-regularized level set evolution (DRLSE) model was proposed. Specifically, a bilateral filter penalty term is designed and incorporated into the DRLSE energy function (BF-DRLSE) to preserve the edges of oil spills, and an adaptive initial box boundary was selected for the DRLSE model to reduce the operation time complexity. Two sets of RadarSat-2 SAR data were used to test the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the bilateral filtering scheme incorporated into the energy function during level set evolution improved the stability of level set evolution. Compared with other methods, the proposed improved BF-DRLSE algorithm displayed a higher overall segmentation accuracy (97.83%). In addition, using an appropriate initial box boundary for the DRLSE method accelerated the global search process, improved the accuracy of oil spill segmentation, and reduced computational time. Therefore, the results suggest that the proposed framework is effective and applicable for marine oil spill segmentation.

TI  - Man-Made Target Detection of PolSAR Image Based on Local Convolution Sparse Representation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Man-made target detection of PolSAR image is an important part of the application of remote sensing data, and generally, the target occupies very few pixels of the image. Convolutional sparse representation (CSR) is proved able to effectively combine polarimetric and spatial information of a PolSAR image to achieve target detection. However, the acquisition of prior knowledge and the modeling of background are difficult. Moreover, the solution process is highly dependent on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm, which introduces new parameters and has high computational complexity. To solve these problems, this letter proposes a man-made target detection method for PolSAR images based on local CSR (Local-CSR). In this method, a novel target detection framework to combine the polarimetric and spatial information based on CSR is proposed, the target dictionary is constructed by the Local-CSR to avoid the aforementioned problems of ADMM solution procedure and finally realize the man-made target detection of the PolSAR image. Two sets of fully polarimetric SAR data sets are used to demonstrate the performance and the experimental results prove the capacity and validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Steady increase in water clarity in Jiaozhou Bay in the Yellow Sea from 2000 to 2018: Observations from MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data were used to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of water clarity (Z(sd)) in the Jiaozhou Bay, Qingdao, China, in the Yellow Sea from 2000 to 2018. Z(sd) retrieval models were regionally optimized using in-situ data with coincident MODIS images, and then were used to retrieve the Z(sd) products in Jiaozhou Bay from 2000-2018. The analysis of the Z(sd) results suggests that the spatial distribution of relative Z(sd) spatial characteristics in Jiaozhou Bay was stable, being higher Z(sd) in the southeast and a lower Z(sd) in the northwest. The annual mean Z(sd) in Jiaozhou Bay showed a significant upward trend, with an annual increase of approximately 0.02 m. Water depth and wind speed were important factors affecting the spatial distribution and annual variation of Z(sd) in Jiaozhou Bay, respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The commercial Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta (R. kanagurta) is widely distributed on the east coast of the Peninsular of Malaysia. Monsoon variations influence its occurrences and abundance. Understanding the variability of oceanographic physical processes and formation of habitats is vital in exploring fish resources. Temperature differences can have an important impact on ocean circulation and mechanisms that can affect the distribution and availability of fish. This study used fishing locations data of 2008 and 2009 and derived chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite data (MODIS-Aqua). The objectives of this study were to determine potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta using a presence-absence data model, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and presence-only data model, maximum entropy (Maxent) and to assess the impact of temperature rise on its seasonal distribution based on the IPCC-AR5-RCP temperature forecast. Results showed that the GAM model had higher prediction accuracy. The constructed model predicted larger distribution areas of R. kanagurta. Maxent model, however, predicted limited distribution range concentrated only areas surrounding the point of presence. Increase of SST projected across all RCPs resulted in a decreased extent of suitable fishing habitats. Potential habitats were observed to shift out of the EEZ. Applicability of the GAM model to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of fish habitat positively contributes to optimal fishing and sustainability in the management of marine resources.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study validated the use of an updated MCD12Q1 MODIS Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data into Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and investigated the effects of LULC change on the spatiotemporal pattern of dew point temperature (DPT), temperature, precipitation and some associated parameters over West Africa (WA). Series of WRF model simulations were carried out with 6 LULC scenarios, which include Built-up (Bu), Partial Deforest I and II (PDI/PDII), Partial Afforest (PA), Total Afforest (TA) and Total Deforest (TD). MCD12Q1 LULC data was integrated into WRF model to carry out eight simulations from May-September, 2012 at 12 km horizontal resolution over WA. The integration of updated MODIS LU data into WRF model showed improvement with lesser RMSE. The BU and TD scenario generally decreases dew point temperature while the areas with remarkable decrease (increase) in dew point temperature also have a decrease (increase) in evapotranspiration and an increase (decrease) in Sensible Heat (SH). Increased SH could be a factor for the increased precipitation over the urbanized area. All afforestation options decreased the temperature due to weakening of the SH. Afforestation of the Sahel led to an increase in rainfall, which is attributed to increase in ET. Deforestation of the Guinea zone (PDI/PDII) reduced the precipitation in Sahel and Sahel-Sahara interface and the entire area. Only the TA scenario increased precipitation over the Sahel-Sahara interface due to increased ET. The effects of LULC change on precipitation are complex as more in-depth analysis of the effects on major features of the general circulation of WA is recommended for future research.

T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of the study was to investigate the effects of drought on vegetation cover and ground water resources. In the present study, an available climatic data series (2001-2017) for 9 synoptic stations in Lorestan province were analyzed to detect wet and dry years using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Furthermore, a long data series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was analyzed by remote sensing data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps have been produced for the study period (2001-2017). For all data, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Pearson Correlation Coefficient test between SPI and NDVI were used based on the data resource and normality test. In addition, the relationship between rainfall and groundwater levels was investigated using artificial neural network (ANN). During the study period, 2008 and 2015 were selected as dry and wet years based on SPI values, respectively. The values of the NDVI in the wet year (2015) are significantly higher than the values in the dry year (2008) at a 99% confidence level. Spatial variation of SPI shows that for intensive drought conditions (2008) and wet year (2015) the northern part of Lorestan province had the highest variation in comparison with other parts of the study area. Generally, the results of the present study show that MODIS data in a mountainous area could be a key tool in detecting the effects of intensive drought on natural vegetation cover. Furthermore, ground water level showed a significant correlation with the 3-month delay of monthly precipitation.

TI  - Complex networks of marine heatwaves reveal abrupt transitions in the global ocean
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how marine heatwaves (MHWs) unfold in space and time under anthropogenic climate change is key to anticipate future impacts on ecosystems and society. Yet, our knowledge of the spatiotemporal dynamics of MHWs is very limited. Here, I combine network theory with topological data analysis and event synchronization to high-resolution satellite data and to a set of Earth System Model simulations to reveal the dynamical organization of complex MHW networks. The analysis reveals that MHWs have already crossed a tipping point separating highly synchronized preindustrial MHWs from the more extreme, but less coherent warming events we experience today. This loose spatiotemporal organization persists under a reduced RCP 2.6 emission scenario, whereas a second abrupt transition towards a permanent state of highly synchronized MHWs is foreseen by 2075 under a business-as-usual RCP 8.5 scenario. These results highlight the risks of abrupt ocean transitions, which may dramatically affect marine life and humanity by eroding valuable time for adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Prevalence and patterns of hospital use for people with frequent alcohol-related hospital admissions, compared to non-alcohol and non-frequent admissions: a cohort study using routine administrative hospital data
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims This study compared prevalence and hospital use among individuals frequently admitted to hospital in England with wholly attributable alcohol-related diagnoses (WAAD), known as alcohol-related frequent attenders (ARFAs), with those of non-alcohol frequent attenders (NAFAs), non-frequent alcohol attenders (ARNFAs) and non-alcohol non-frequent attenders (NANFAs). Design Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of 5 years of England's Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Setting Hospital inpatients in England, UK, 2011-16. Participants Two cohorts (2011/12 = 489 580/7 654 944 patients and 2015/16 = 490 384/7 660 108 patients) were selected from all adult patients aged >= 18 years, treated in English hospitals between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2016. Patients were categorized as having alcohol-related admissions if diagnoses included a WAAD (ICD-10 classification, WHO, 2016) and frequent admissions if they had more than three hospital admissions during a single HES year. Measurements Prevalence of ARFA, number of admissions (spells), occupied bed-days (OBDs), average length of stay (ALOS) and total admission costs over 5 years were compared among ARFAs, ARNFAs, NAFAs and NANFAs. Findings On average, 0.7% of people admitted to hospital per annum in England 2011-15 were ARFAs and more than a quarter of all frequent attenders (for all causes) to hospitals had a wholly attributable alcohol diagnosis on admission. ARFAs had longer ALOS than the other patient groups [5.55 days versus ARNFA 4.7, NAFA 3.39 and NANFA 2.57 days, F = 1088.37 (3, 488 570, P < 0.001)] in the 2015/16 index year; but fewer spells than NAFAs [5.38 ARFAs versus 5.98 NAFAs, F = 20 536.25 (3, 490 380) P < 0.001]. The ARFA cohort reduced in size (from 51 934 ARFAs to 20 548) in the course of 5 years. ARFAs had the highest average total cost of admissions per person over 5 years at 38 pound 189. Conclusions People with repeated admissions for alcohol-related problems in England appear to be a high-cost, high-need, complex group of patients that makes up more than a quarter of the country's alcohol admissions.

TI  - Radiative forcing of black carbon in seasonal snow of wintertime based on remote sensing over Xinjiang, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC), which consists of the strongest light-absorbing particles (LAPs) in snow, has been regarded as a potential factor accelerating regional climate change and the melting of snow cover globally. In this study, we used remote sensing (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) observations combined with a snow albedo model (Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation, SNICAR) and a radiative transfer model (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer, SBDART) to retrieve the radiative forcing (RF) by BC in snow (R-MODIS(BC)) across Xinjiang, China, for the first time. The observations in January-February show that the concentrations of BC (equivalent BC) in snow ranged from 44.08 to 1949.9 ng g(-1), with an average of 536.71 ng g(-1). The lowest concentrations of BC were on the border of the Altay region (AR), with a median concentration in snow of 98.5 ng g(-1). South of this area in the industrial region (Tianshan Mountain North Slope Economic Development Belt, TMNSEDB), the median concentration of BC in snow was 913.2 ng g(-1) R-MODIS(BC) presents distinct spatial variability, with the minimum (3.01W m(-2)) in the AR and the maximum (40.2W m(-2)) near industrial areas in TMNSEDB. The regional mean R-MODIS(BC) was 20.43 +/- 7.3 W m(-2) in Xinjiang, and the average values of the impurity index (I-LAPs) and SGS in the region were 0.273 and 241.38 mu m, respectively. Moreover, based on the multiple linear regressions, the BC emission intensity values were significantly correlated with I-LAPs and RF, and the correlation reached 0.681 and 0.661, respectively; thus, the BC emission could explain above 75% of the spatial variance of BC contents in TMNSEDB, confirming the reasonability of the spatial patterns of retrieved RFMODISBC in Xinjiang. Additionally, we found that the distribution of R-MODIS(BC) in northern Xinjiang is dominated by I-LAPs and BC emissions. We validated R-MODIS(BC) using in situ RF estimates (R-site(estimate)), and the error was 24.05 W m(-2); furthermore, the biases in R-MODIS(BC) were negatively correlated with the BC concentrations and ranged from 24.3% to 326% in Xinjiang.

TI  - Assessing the impact of bridge construction on the land use/cover and socio-economic indicator time series: A case study of Hangzhou Bay Bridge
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of transportation infrastructure is a vital step in boosting economic and societal opportunities and often results in land use changes. In this study, we focus on the land use dynamics of the urban agglomeration around Hangzhou Bay, where the Qiantang River flows into the East China Sea. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge crosses the bay since 2008. We used Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) to analyze the influence of the bridge on the land use and land cover (LULC) time series of the surrounding areas and on socio-economic indicators. We applied the Random Forest method to classify Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2017, thus enabling us to quantify LULC changes before and after the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for data acquisition, pre-processing, and classification. The results showed that during the period from 2000 to 2017, impervious surface areas expanded rapidly at the expense of agricultural land, and this transformation continued even more rapidly after 2008. ITSA showed that the driver behind the impervious surface area expansion switched from residential and industrial area growth in 2000-2008, to exclusively infrastructure area growth in 2008-2017. The construction of the bridge accelerated the expansion of impervious surface in the joint area of the bridge-connected cities of Ningbo and Jiaxing. With the Hangzhou Bay Bridge connection, various socio-economic factors, including tourism, GDP, tertiary industry, real estate investment, and highway freight, increased rapidly. The outcomes of this research could contribute to policymaking and impact assessments for sustainable urban development and land management. The methods used in this study are universal and therefore can also be used to assess the effect of any notable event that may impact LULC change.

TI  - Record low ozone values over the Arctic in boreal spring 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone data derived from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) sensor on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite show exceptionally low total ozone columns in the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere (Arctic) in spring 2020 Minimum total ozone column values around or below 220 Dobson units (DU) were seen over the Arctic for 5 weeks in March and early April 2020. Usually the persistence of such low total ozone column values in spring is only observed in the polar Southern Hemisphere (Antarctic) and not over the Arctic. These record low total ozone columns were caused by a particularly strong polar vortex in the stratosphere with a persistent cold stratosphere at higher latitudes, a prerequisite for ozone depletion through heterogeneous chemistry. Based on the ERAS, which is the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis, the Northern Hemisphere winter 2019/2020 (from December to March) showed minimum polar cap temperatures consistently below 195 K around 20 km altitude, which enabled enhanced formation of polar stratospheric clouds. The special situation in spring 2020 is compared and discussed in context with two other Northern Hemisphere spring seasons, namely those in 1997 and 2011, which also displayed relatively low total ozone column values. However, during these years, total ozone columns below 220 DU over several consecutive days were not observed in spring. The similarities and differences of the atmospheric conditions of these three events and possible explanations for the observed features are presented and discussed. It becomes apparent that the monthly mean of the minimum total ozone column value for March 2020 (221 DU) was clearly below the respective values found in March 1997 (267 DU) and 2011 (252 DU), which highlights the special evolution of the polar stratospheric ozone layer in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2020. A comparison with a typical ozone hole over the Antarctic (e.g., in 2016) indicates that although the Arctic spring 2020 situation is remarkable, with total ozone column values around or below 220 DU observed over a considerable area (up to 0.9 million km(2)), the Antarctic ozone hole shows total ozone columns typically below 150 DU over a much larger area (of the order of 20 million km(2)). Furthermore, total ozone columns below 220 DU are typically observed over the Antarctic for about 4 months.

TI  - Exploring the use of spectral indices to assess alterations in soil properties in pine stands affected by crown fire in Spain
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Forest fires have increased in extent and intensity in the Mediterranean area in recent years, threatening forest ecosystems through loss of vegetation, changes in soil properties, and increased soil erosion rates, particularly in severely burned areas. However, establishing the relationships between burn severity and soil properties that determine infiltration remain challenging. Determining where soil burn severity evaluation should be carried out is critical for planning urgent measures to mitigate post-fire soil erosion. Although previous research has indicated that spectral indices are suitable for assessing fire severity, most of the classifications used consider combined effects in vegetation and soil. Moreover, the relationship between spectral indices and soil burn severity has scarcely been explored until now.Results: We selected three pine stands in Spain for study immediately after being burned by wildfires. We analyzed various soil properties (soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, and soil organic carbon) in relation to six levels of soil burn severity in all three stands. In addition, we established 25 field plots in the burned areas. We computed ten spectral indices for each plot by using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The soil burn severity categories indicated the degree of degradation of important soil properties related to soil erosion susceptibility. Of the spectral indices considered, the relativized burn ratio (RBR) was the best predictor of cumulative infiltration and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates. The differenced mid-infrared bispectral index (dMIRBI) was most closely correlated with soil organic carbon content.Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the potential applicability of remote sensing to determining changes in soil properties after fire.

TI  - Estimating daily high-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over Texas: Machine Learning approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 is an important atmospheric constituent associated to human health. Therefore, the capability of estimating PM2.5 concentrations at high spatiotemporal resolutions, particularly in places with no ground stations, would be invaluable. Although several studies have involved the estimation of PM2.5, few have estimated PM2.5 concentrations at high spatial resolutions. In this study, we leverage the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate daily 1-km PM2.5 concentrations over Texas from 2014 to 2018. For this purpose, we use collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To address the different sources and speciation of PM2.5 over Texas, we use several important control parameters. As a result, the accuracy of RF remains consistent throughout the study area. After estimating ground-level PM2.5 levels, we apply a ten-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.83-0.90 and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.47-1.77 mu g/m(3). Our results show that RF is highly capable of estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. In addition to the RF model, we also compare the capability of commonly used models, including multiple linear regression (MLR) and mixed effects model (MEM), for estimating the PM2.5 concentrations of global regions. Results indicate that RF, compared to the other models, has the highest accuracy, MEM the second-highest, and MLR the third. We also leverage the USEPA Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) to estimate the impact of changes in PM2.5 levels on the number of respiratory-related premature mortalities in Texas in 2014-2018. Considering 2014 as the baseline year, the BenMAP analyses reveal that PM2.5 reductions could have prevented a large number of premature mortalities, particularly among adults aged 25-99, from 2014 to 2018 in Texas.

TI  - Machine learning estimates of eddy covariance carbon flux in a scrub in the Mexican highland
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid and semiarid ecosystems contain relatively high species diversity and are subject to intense use, in particular extensive cattle grazing, which has favored the expansion and encroachment of perennial thorny shrubs into the grasslands, thus decreasing the value of the rangeland. However, these environments have been shown to positively impact global carbon dynamics Machine learning and remote sensing have enhanced our knowledge about carbon dynamics, but they need to be further developed and adapted to particular analysis. We measured the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of C with the eddy covariance (EC) method and estimated gross primary production (GPP) in a thorny scrub at Bernal in Mexico. We tested the agreement between EC estimates and remotely sensed GPP estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and also with two alternative modeling methods: ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression and ensembles of machine learning algorithms (EMLs). The variables used as predictors were MODIS spectral bands, vegetation indices and products, and gridded environmental variables. The Bernal site was a carbon sink even though it was overgrazed, the average NEE during 15 months of 2017 and 2018 was -0.78 g Cm(-2)d(-1), and the flux was negative or neutral during the measured months. The probability of agreement (theta s) represented the agreement between observed and estimated values of GPP across the range of measurement. According to the mean value of theta s, agreement was higher for the EML (0.6) followed by OLS (0.5) and then MODIS (0.24). This graphic metric was more informative than r(2) (0.98, 0.67, 0.58, respectively) to evaluate the model performance. This was particularly true for MODIS because the maximum theta s of 4.3 was for measurements of 0.8 g Cm(-2)d(-1) and then decreased steadily below 1 theta s for measurements above 6.5 g Cm(-2)d(-1) for this scrub vegetation. In the case of EML and OLS, the theta s was stable across the range of measurement. We used an EML for the Ameriflux site US-SRM, which is similar in vegetation and climate, to predict GPP at Bernal, but theta s was low (0.16), indicating the local specificity of this model. Although cacti were an important component of the vegetation, the nighttime flux was characterized by positive NEE, suggesting that the photosynthetic dark-cycle flux of cacti was lower than ecosystem respiration. The discrepancy between MODIS and EC GPP estimates stresses the need to understand the limitations of both methods.

TI  - Quantifying individual variability in exposure risk to mosquito bites in the Cascades region, Burkina Faso
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Cascades region, Burkina Faso, has a high malaria burden despite reported high insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) use. Human and vector activities outside the hours when indoor interventions offer direct protection from infectious bites potentially increase exposure risk to bites from malaria-transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes. This work investigated the degree of variation in human behaviour both between individuals and through time (season) to quantify how it impacts exposure to malaria vectors.Methods: Patterns in human overnight activity (18:00-06:00) to quantify time spent using an ITN across 7 successive nights in two rural communities, Niakore (N = 24 participants) and Toma (71 participants), were observed in the dry and rainy seasons, between 2017 and 2018. Hourly human landing Anopheles mosquito catches were conducted in Niakore specifically, and Cascades region generally, between 2016 and 2017. Data were statistically combined to estimate seasonal variation in time spent outdoors and Anopheles bites received per person per night (bpppn). Results Substantial variability in exposure to outdoor Anopheles bites was detected within and between communities across seasons. In October, when Anopheles densities are highest, an individual's risk of Anopheles bites ranged from 2.2 to 52.2 bites per person per night (bpppn) within the same week with variable risk dependent on hours spent indoors. Comparably higher outdoor human activity was observed in April and July but, due to lower Anopheles densities estimated, bpppn were 0.2-4.7 and 0.5-32.0, respectively. Males and people aged over 21 years were predicted to receive more bites in both sentinel villages.Conclusion: This work presents one of the first clear descriptions of the degree of heterogeneity in time spent outdoors between people and across the year. Appreciation of sociodemographic, cultural and entomological activities will help refine approaches to vector control.

T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative imaging has been studied using conventional devices such as near infrared (NIR) optical probes and gamma probes. However, these devices have limited depth penetration and spatial resolution. In a previous study, we realized a multi-modal endoscopic system. However, charge-coupled device (CCD)-based gamma imaging required long acquisition times and lacked gamma energy information. A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based gamma detector is implemented in a multi-modal laparoscope herein. A gradient index (GRIN) lens and CCD are used to transfer and readout visible and MR photons. The feasibility of in-vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was successfully performed with the proposed system.

TI  - Mapping coastal salt marshes in China using time series of Sentinel-1 SAR
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes provide crucial ecological functions and services and are experiencing rapid losses and degradation under global climate changes and high-intensity human activities in coastal zone. However, mapping salt marsh distributions and compositions with high accuracy on the national or global scale remains challenging. Here, we used Sentinel-1 time-series data and knowledge-based automatic decision tree classifiers to produce a 10-m map of the salt marshes in China coastal zones. We established annual synthetic aperture radar (SAR) composite features to address seasonal variations and tidal dynamics in salt marshes and created five partitioned-region classifiers according to the climatic and environmental characteristics. In total, 1729 Sentinel-1 images in 2019 and 3418 in situ sites were included for the classification. The results showed that (1) the annual mean SAR composite is more stable and practical than the seasonal composite for salt marsh classification along the China coastal zones in terms of these features addressing variations in tidal fluctuation, climate zones, and salt marsh compositions; (2) SAR surface roughness can effectively separate salt marshes into sparse density and red phenotype salt marshes; (3) the total area of Chinese coastal salt marshes was 127,477.37 ha with an overall accuracy of 87.30%, it included 48.30% Spartina alterniflora, 29.19% Phragmites australis, 13.76% Suaeda spp. and 8.75% Scirpus spp., and more than 85% of salt marshes were distributed from Shandong Province to Zhejiang Province. This study showed the potential application of time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data, annual composite data and knowledge-based classifiers for large-scale coastal zones, and these data will be valuable for coastal ecological restoration and sustainability management.

TI  - A community-GIS supported dryland use and cover change assessment: The case of the Njemps flats in Kenya
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) are a major cause of environmental degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) drylands and hence a serious problem to sustainable utilization and development of those lands. Involving communities in their detection and identification can empower and convince them of the importance of adopting practices that minimize their undesirable impacts. In this study, we applied a GIS assisted community participatory approach to detect LULCC, their drivers and effects in the drylands of mid rift valley Kenya. Focus group discussions, key informant and household head interviews were corroborated with three Landsat images for three periods of 1980, 1995 and 2019. Results from community interviews and focus group discussion reported increasing trends in cropland and shrubland, Declining trend were reported in livestock mobility, livestock herd size, forest land and natural grasses. The GIS analysis reported increase of cropland from 370 Ha to 2889 Ha, increase in shrubland by 4.2%, expansion of Lake Baringo by 1.4%, decrease in forest cover by 1.2% and decrease in natural grass pastures by 1.1%. Major driving forces for LULCC were identified as population growth, insecurity caused by cattle rustling, government policies and interventions, poor agricultural practices, drought and climate change. From the outcomes of this study, we recommended government policy strategies and interventions that support adoption of practices that mitigate adverse effects of LULCC including sustainable grazing schemes, rehabilitation of already degraded land, community participation in watershed management and adoption of soil and water conservation measures.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current times, anthropogenic activities and natural change in the processes cause much change in the world, causing multiple hazards and disturbing the natural flow. One such hazard is soil erosion, which is increasing day by day due to changes in climate and anthropogenic activities. Thus, identifying the soil erosion vulnerable zones and map such regions is extremely useful for the town and land planning. Such soil vulnerability mapping gives a quantifiable and reliable method to evaluate soil erosion in a wide variety of circumstances. In the current research, the soil erosion method, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with geographic information system (GIS), has been applied for soil erosion approximation in the Rawalpindi Tehsil situated in the province of Punjab in the northeast part of Pakistan. The Rawalpindi metropolis is a semi-arid area with a drainage area of 259 km(2) up to the gauging station. The datasets of the RUSLE model were valued from the remote sensing data, and the probable soil loss regions were estimated with the help of GIS. All the datasets, i.e., slope, soil, precipitation, crop management factor, was then used for soil erosion potential mapping. The potential map is generated from the weighted overlay method that gives an output showing that most of the study area is in medium (67.2%) to high (20.2%) erosion zone with erosion intensities of < 20 tons ha(-1) year(-1) and < 40 tons ha(-1) year(-1) respectively. Concurrently, few patches lie in high potential zones that need to be looked after and need to be pondered in terms of mitigation measures. Accuracy assessment for land-use and land-cover classes for the Rawalpindi watershed was also accomplished by comparing ground-truth with satellite data, and the Kappa coefficient of the agreement was also obtained. The overall accuracy was 85%, and the Kappa coefficient was found to be 84%, inferring the acceptability of results. Few mitigation solutions have also been described in this study, which might be helpful to minimize erosion. This research provides a positive impact on the execution of soil management and preservation practices to lessen the erosion of the soil in the Tehsil Rawalpindi.

TI  - Quantifying of surface urban cool island in arid environments case study: Isfahan metropolis
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cities that are built on the arid biomes with the hot and dry climates can adjust the temperature (oasis effect) and create the urban cool island (UCI) during the day. As the background climate of the Isfahan metropolis is warm and dry, we can expect an UCI during the day. The MODIS land cover product data were used to distinguish between the urban and nonurban areas. The MODIS/Terra/LST data from 2000 to 2016 were then used for day-time view to examine the UCI. In the next step, the UCI intensity index was calculated by the spatial correlation representative pixel method for the city and the background. This study showed that due to the passage of the Zayandehrood river from the middle of the city and the expansion of vegetation in the urban environment, the metropolitan area of Isfahan is 3.5 degrees cooler than the suburban barren lands during the day. The UCI intensity index has been intensified over the last few years and has fallen below - 4.5 degrees. The studies have shown that the UCI intensity index is weakened during the cold months and intensified in the warm months of the year. The seasonal changes in UCI intensity in the metropolitan area of Isfahan can be related to the high variability of vegetation throughout the year.

TI  - Evaluation of SAR C-band interferometric coherence time-series for coastal wetland hydropattern mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - South America is the continent of wetlands, which represents more than 20% of its surface. Since the ecological integrity of wetlands strongly depends on their water sources and dynamics, it is fundamental to understand their hydrology. Large wetlands are usually located in inaccessible areas where remote sensing results are a fundamental tool for wetland monitoring, providing information over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Radar spaceborne sensors provide an excellent all-weather tool for monitoring and recent investigations have also shown that Interferometric SAR (InSAR) can be very valuable for wetland monitoring in addition to its regular uses in DEM generation and surface deformation analyses. The availability of new SAR satellites such as the Sentinel 1 and SAOCOM missions, with short revisit times and open data policies, repeat-pass interferometry can now provide long time-series of coherence for wetland monitoring. In this article, we used a SOM neural network to cluster a yearly series of Sentinel 1 B coherence images from the coastal plain of Samboromb'on Bay, Argentina, into temporal coherence patterns. The timing and coherence values of these patterns were interpreted in terms of landcover, vegetation phenology, water sources, and waterlogged condition. Although the SOM patterns did not show a one to one relationship with landcover types nor with the main water sources, their spatial distribution and temporal signature of coherence gave information on wetlands with different water dynamics. A key outcome of our study was that temporal patterns of coherence could be used to assess the impacts of land-use practices on wetland functioning, which deserves further exploration. The spatial distribution of the temporal coherence patterns can be used as a hypothesis for wetland hydropatterns, a key to hydrological functional type wetland classification. This approach can help us gain a better understanding of complex wetlands and foster their sustainable management, particularly combined with in situ fieldwork and other remote sensing sources, particularly repeat pass L-band coherence, which can give a better indication of soil wetness.

TI  - Comparison of Three Different Satellite-Based Approaches for Aboveground Biomass Estimation
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective estimation of crop yield on a regional scale in a short time with low cost would only be possible utilizing remote sensing. Several approaches have been proposed based on remotely sensed data for estimating Aboveground Biomass (AGB). In this study, three satellite-based approaches, including Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE). The soil water atmosphere plant (SWAP) model, and FAO33, were evaluated in the irrigated wheat and barley fields in the Qazvin irrigation network, Iran. To this end, the leaf area index (LAI) and relative evapotranspiration (ETrel) were extracted from the Landsat data and incorporated into the methods. A comparative analysis was undertaken to evaluate the performance of the satellite-based approaches using percent absolute error (PAE). By updating SWAP with satellite-derived LAI and surface incoming solar radiation, the PAE decreased significantly. Results of different Spectral Indices (SIs) in the RUE method showed that NDVI performed best with PAE of 1.52 percent and RMSE of 664.6 kg ha(-1). Also, the RUE method with RMSE of 664.6 kg ha(-1) had 4.7 and 23.8 lower PAE compared to the SWAP (RMSE = 2221.4 kg ha(-1)) and FAO33 (RMSE = 4394.2 kg ha(-1)), respectively. However, this was not the only criteria for a well-performed method, because earlier AGB forecast was only feasible by making use of SWAP since the satellite-derived parameters were only incorporated into the model about one month before the harvest.

TI  - A D-vine copula quantile regression approach for soil moisture retrieval from dual polarimetric SAR Sentinel-1 over vegetated terrains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture retrieval from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) over vegetated terrains requires an isolation of soil and canopy signals from observed backscatter (sigma degrees). This study develops a probabilistic soil moisture retrieval method from dual polarimetric C-band SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) with uncertainty quantification at distinct vegetation covers (VCs). Both sigma(VV)degrees and sigma(VH)degrees were used to represent ground and volume scattering due to the high respective sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. A novel D-vine copula quantile regression (DVQR) was adopted to provide the soil moisture estimates based on modelling trivariate dependence of sigma(VV)degrees-sigma(VH)degrees -soil moisture anomalies (VV-VH-Mv), with a support from the innovative cosmic-ray soil moisture as ground-truth data. The feasibility of DVQR was underlined for: (1) multivariate nonlinear dependence structure modelling and (2) soil moisture retrieval with associated uncertainty. An inter-dependence analysis, which assesses the correlations among three major variables, indicated that the dependence between each pair of variables decreased as canopy density increases from herbs to forests, mainly due to the ci degrees attenuated by vegetation effect. The dependence structures simulated from the D-vine copula revealed highly nonlinear and asymmetric shapes with tail dependences occurred in most VCs, which can be well captured by different associated Archimedean copulas. Soil moisture anomaly (Mv) estimated using the DVQR and Multiple linear quantile regression (MLQR) were compared against ground-truth data for both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions. Superior performances of the DVQR in most VCs, with 10% and 16% improved in RMSE at grasslands and broadleaf forests, respectively, demonstrated the robustness of this method for S-1 soil moisture retrieval due to the highly nonlinear dependence structures captured by the D-vine models. Over VCs, better performances were obtained at low-canopy herbaceous regions (grasslands and croplands); whereas extremely dry conditions and complex structures in shrublands and dense forests resulted in inferior performances. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to evaluate the change in My estimation accuracy given distinct VV and VH quantile levels. Result underlines that VV is the primary factor controlling the retrieval accuracy, but the increase in VH level also contributes to higher errors in soil moisture estimation, especially under wet conditions.

TI  - Updates on the treatment of invasive breast cancer: <i>Quo Vadimus</i>?
T2  - MATURITAS
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women. Despite an increase in incidence, breast cancer mortality has drastically dropped over the last 20 years. This change has been attributed to advances in screening, diagnosis, and treatment. This review summarises recent updates in the clinical approach to breast cancer. Advances in genetics have facilitated the stratification of the risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer. Advances in biology have led to the development of novel therapies (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, cyclindependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, HER2 targeted agents). Their combination with endocrine (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, GnRH-analogues, fulvestrant) and systematic therapy (anthracyclines, taxanes) in early and advanced disease have improved clinical outcomes. In the near future, neoadjuvant strategies in specific breast cancer subgroups (triple-negative breast cancers) and novel strategies (immune-modulatory agents) could further improve histopathological responses and survival. Radical mastectomies have been widely replaced by breast conserving operations, while the traditional axillary dissection is being replaced with sentinel node techniques. Breast cancer therapeutics represents a great challenge due to patients' heterogeneous molecular and clinical characteristics, while the identification of reliable and easily reproducible predictive factors could further improve individualized treatment.

TI  - Presolar stardust in highly pristine CM chondrites Asuka 12169 and Asuka 12236
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a NanoSIMS search for presolar grains in the CM chondrites Asuka (A) 12169 and A12236. We found 90 presolar O-rich grains and 25 SiC grains in A12169, giving matrix-normalized abundances of 275 (+55/-50, 1 sigma) ppm or, excluding an unusually large grain, 236 (+37/-34) ppm for O-rich grains and 62 (+15/-12) ppm for SiC grains. For A12236, 18 presolar silicates and 6 SiCs indicate abundances of 58 (+18/-12) and 20 (+12/-8) ppm, respectively. The SiC abundances are in the typical range of primitive chondrites. The abundance of presolar O-rich grains in A12169 is essentially identical to that in CO3.0 Dominion Range 08006, higher than in any other chondrites, while in A12236, it is higher than found in other CMs. These abundances provide further strong support that A12169 and A12236 are the least-altered CMs as indicated by petrographic investigations. The similar abundances, isotopic distributions, silicate/oxide ratios, and grain sizes of the presolar O-rich grains found here to those of presolar grains in highly primitive CO, CR, and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) indicate that the CM parent body(ies) accreted a similar population of presolar oxides and silicates in their matrices to those accreted by the parent bodies of the other CC groups. The lower abundances and larger grain sizes seen in some other CMs are thus most likely a result of parent-body alteration and not heterogeneity in nebular precursors. Presolar silicates are unlikely to be present in high abundances in returned samples from asteroids Ryugu and Bennu since remote-sensing data indicate that they have experienced substantial aqueous alteration.

TI  - Evaluating the dynamics and eco-climatic predictors of forest conversion and restoration in Old Oyo National Park, Nigeria using geospatial and machine learning techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation and restoration in protected areas over a period provide insights into the success of any ecological intervention. This study aimed to determine the landscape pattern, dynamics, intensity, and eco-climatic drivers of forest fragmentation and restoration within the last 4 decades in Old Oyo National Park (OONP), Nigeria. The data collection and analysis used field observations, and geospatial and machine learning techniques. Three-time series (1986, 2003, and 2019) of Landsat satellite imageries downloaded and subjected to supervised image classification and landscape analysis (LA). The results revealed that the mixed open savanna areas covered the highest landmass of OONP. The dense woodland and forest outlier areas (DWFOA) reduced from 579.34 km(2) (23.07%) in 1986 to 489.84 km(2) (19.50%) in 2003 and increased to 653.46 km(2) (26.02%) in 2019. LA revealed an increase in the forest fragmentation based on the number of patches and mean patch area. Twenty-six and twenty-eight out of forty-three eco-climatic variables are the most significant drivers to the changed and restored DWFOA between the year 1986 and 2019. Partial dependence plots showed a strong relationship of bush burn severity on the probability of the conversion and restoration of DWFOA. Other significant variables include distance to host communities, distance to roads, distance to rivers, elevation, average monthly rainfall (March-April, June-October), and slope. Despite the forest restoration, the evidence of forest fragmentation calls for measures to mitigate the climate change, indiscriminate bush burning and other anthropogenic pressure indicators.

TI  - SAR image despeckling using deep CNN
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are contaminated with noise called speckle that is multiplicative in nature. The presence of speckles in SAR images makes it impossible to understand and interpret for extensive range of applications. However, certain characteristics of SAR and the ability to function irrespective of weather conditions, are making such images worth processing in order to be able to extract relevant information. A despeckling model is proposed that uses deeper convolutional neural networks, which was never used before, as far as authors are concerned, for diminishing speckle in noisy SAR images. Multiple skip connections from the ResNet model are also employed in authors' proposed architecture. In order to maintain uniformity, a formula to be followed while applying skip connections is also derived. A hybrid loss function is developed to train the network more consistently to achieve the desired output. Experiments on simulated SAR images using the NWPU-RESISC benchmark are conducted and tested on real TerraSAR-X images and compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that the proposed method achieved considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods with PSNRs 27.02, 24.60, and 22.01 for looks 10, 4, and 1, respectively.

TI  - First assessment of the interferometric capabilities of SAOCOM-1A: New results over the Domuyo Volcano, Neuquen Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has been used for measuring ground deformations with high both spatial and temporal resolutions. The effectiveness of this technique has been extensively proved using mainly C and X band because of the availability of SAR platforms operating in these frequencies. In vegetated areas, L-band SAR is more adequate because of their less sensitivity to temporal decorrelation. This work presents a review of the characteristics of the L-band Argentinian satellite SAOCOM-1A and its potential in deformation monitoring. In order to show it, we processed a dataset acquired over the Domuyo Volcano (Neuquen, Argentina). Time series and mean deformation maps are validated against those computed using a Sentinel-1 dataset spanning the same time period. Results show an inflation pattern of 6 cm between August 2019 and May 2020. As expected and despising the scarce availability of SAOCOM scenes, its mean velocity map is admittedly more coherent in comparison with the Sentinel-1. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, the computation of deformation time series using SAOCOM data.

TI  - Tick-borne zoonoses and commonly used diagnostic methods in human and veterinary medicine
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Around the world, human health and animal health are closely linked in terms of the One Health concept by ticks acting as vectors for zoonotic pathogens. Animals do not only maintain tick cycles but can either be clinically affected by the same tick-borne pathogens as humans and/or play a role as reservoirs or sentinel pathogen hosts. However, the relevance of different tick-borne diseases (TBDs) may vary in human vs. veterinary medicine, which is consequently reflected by the availability of human vs. veterinary diagnostic tests. Yet, as TBDs gain importance in both fields and rare zoonotic pathogens, such as Babesia spp., are increasingly identified as causes of human disease, a One Health approach regarding development of new diagnostic tools may lead to synergistic benefits. This review gives an overview on zoonotic protozoan, bacterial and viral tick-borne pathogens worldwide, discusses commonly used diagnostic techniques for TBDs, and compares commercial availability of diagnostic tests for humans vs. domestic animals, using Germany as an example, with the aim of highlighting existing gaps and opportunities for collaboration in a One Health framework.

TI  - Comparison of cooling effect between green space and water body
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cooling effects of green spaces and water bodies are essential in subtropical cities with high temperatures combined with increasing urban heat island effect, while there is insufficient research on the difference between these two categories of cold sources. Therefore, Nanning, China, was selected as the typical case in the subtropical climate zone, and spatial and statistical analysis based on Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images was conducted to compare the cooling effect and factors of blue and green spaces. Results showed that (1) the area-related green-space and water-body metrics are significantly positively correlated with the cooling effect. An additional 10 % of green space cover leads to a decline in the mean LST of 0.39 degrees C compared with a decline of 0.42 degrees C for water cover; (2) green and blue spaces with simple shapes and high fragmentation may have strong cooling effect, whereas green and blue spaces with more complex shapes may cool larger areas, benefiting more residents; (3) the threshold values of efficiency (TVoE) of tree-based green spaces and water patches were both approximately 0.30 ha, increasing with spatial sprawl of impervious surfaces; and (4) water bodies have slightly higher cooling intensity and much larger cooling ranges than tree-based green spaces.

TI  - Ground deformation at the Cerro Blanco caldera: A case of subsidence at the Central Andes BackArc
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex (CBVC) is one of the youngest caldera complexes in the Southern Central Andes. Subsidence registered at CBVC has shown a slowdown in deformation velocity since 1992 (2.6 cm/yr) to 2010 (0.87 cm/yr). We update the deformation state of this caldera system by processing DInSAR data between 2003 and 2020 and GPS as a complementary tool. Results showed a circular deformation pattern of about 12 km diameter related to subsidence centered at CBVC throughout the entire period under analysis. Deformation rate decreased from 1 cm/yr for 2003-2009 period (Envisat data) to 0.7 cm for the 2012-2020 period (COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 data). Rate values were confirmed with GPS measurements during 2004 and 2013-2015. Analytical inverse modelling was used to infer the main characteristic of the source responsible for the measured displacement. Best-fitting solution corresponded to a spherical source located between 9 and 14 km from the surface with a volume decrease of about 0.013 km(3)/yr for the entire period. We propose that a combination of magmatic and geothermal dynamic as the origin of the continuous and slow subsidence observed in the CBVC as a consequence of the last eruption that occurred ca. 4 ka ago.

TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of zoonotic enteropathogens in gulls from southern Europe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. are the two most frequent zoonotic bacteria involved in human enteric infections in the European Union. Both enteropathogens have been isolated from a diversity of wild birds in Northern Europe, but there is limited information about gulls as potential reservoirs in Southern Europe. A broad sampling of fledglings from nine colonies of yellow-legged gull (Lams michahellis, N = 1222) and Audouin's gull (Carus audouinii, N = 563) has been conducted in Spain and Tunisia during the late chick rearing period. Overall, the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. was 5.2% (93/1785, CI95%: 4.2-6.2%) and 20.8% (371/1785, CI95%: 18.9-22.7%), respectively. The most predominant Campylobacter species was C. jejuni (94.6%). A high diversity of Salmonella serovars was isolated and the most frequent were those also reported in human outbreaks, such as Salmonella Typhimurium. A high proportion of Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent (20.2% and 51.5%, respectively), while 19.2% of Salmonella isolates were multidrug-resistant. These results show the relevance of gulls as reservoirs of Campylobacter and Salmonella by maintaining and spreading these bacteria, including resistant and multidrug resistant strains, in the environment. Our results suggest that gulls can serve as sentinel species for antibiotic pressure in the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work supports previous studies in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon that show the new nitrogen (N) load introduced by Trichodesmium is similar to or greater than that from riverine discharges. However, the current management programs aimed at improving the chronic eutrophic state of the GBR ignore the N load from Trichodesmium. These programs also ignore the evidence that Trichodesmium blooms could promote the bioavailability of heavy metals and be a source of toxins in the ciguatera food chain. Further work is urgently required to better quantify the potential impacts of Trichodesmium and develop management plans to reduce those impacts. A simple algorithm that uses MODIS imagery is developed for not only monitoring the spatial extent of Trichodesmium blooms but also for quantifying the concentration of those blooms. The algorithm is based on the readily available MODIS L2 data. A management plan that includes the harvesting of Trichodesmium is outlined.

TI  - Using SMAP Level-4 soil moisture to constrain MOD16 evapotranspiration over the contiguous USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key hydrologic variable linking the Earth's water, carbon and energy cycles. At large spatial scales, remote sensing-based (RS) models are often used to quantify ET. Despite the large number of RS ET models available, few include soil moisture as a key environmental input, which can degrade model accuracy and utility. Here, we use model assimilation enhanced soil moisture estimates from the NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission as a water supply control in the MOD16 ET algorithm framework. SMAP-derived daily surface (0-5 cm depth) and root zone (0-1 m depth) soil moisture are used with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation observations, and 4 km gridded regional surface meteorology (Gridmet) as primary inputs for estimating daily ET and underlying model soil and stomatal conductance terms. We calibrated the model environmental response parameters using tower eddy covariance ET observations representing major North American biomes. The model ET results were validated using a holdout set of tower observations spanning a large regional climate gradient. The updated ET estimates outperform the baseline MOD16 product across all tower validation sites (RMSE = 0.758 vs 1.108 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.68 vs 0.45, respectively). Smaller relative improvements were obtained using a recalibrated model with 4 km Gridmet meteorology, but no soil moisture control (RMSE = 0.813 mm day(-1); R-2 = 0.66), indicating that these changes are essential for the improved model performance. The soil moisture-constrained model improvements and relative benefits from the SMAP observations are greater in arid climates, consistent with stronger soil moisture control on ET in water-limited regions. The use of SMAP soil moisture as an additional model constraint improves MOD16 regional performance and provides a new framework for investigating both soil and atmosphere controls on ET.

TI  - Sun glint correction with an inherent optical properties data processing system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent and extensive sun glint is a serious obstacle to real-time monitoring of ocean colour anomalies. We semi-analytically adjust an inherent optical properties (IOPs) data processing system for the open ocean to correct for sun glint (called 'IDAS-SGC') and for remote sensing reflectance (R (rs)) and IOPs retrievals. Tests with synthetic data validated the effectiveness of our algorithm in deriving ocean colour data from severely glint-contaminated images to produce high quality images. Evaluating results from single mission images suggested that our approach provides spatially smooth and consistent ocean colour products from both severe glint and glint-free regions for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and for Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II instruments. Specifically, complete coverage of circulation-caused ocean colour anomalies can be recovered from a single severe sun glint image. Comparing multi-mission images found that the inter-mission consistency for IDAS-SGC R (rs) in sun glint regions is comparable with the inter-mission consistency in glint-free regions. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the Cox-Munk algorithm for sun glint estimation, and we find that our IDAS-SGC algorithm is more effective than the Cox-Munk algorithm in deriving R (rs) products from severe sun glint regions due to the absence of accurate real-time wind data. Our results suggest that the IDAS-SGC algorithm obtains meaningful ocean colour products from sun glint-contaminated images of the open oceans.

TI  - Comparison and evaluation of the simulated annual aerosol characteristics over China with two global aerosol models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, simulations of the annual mean aerosol budget, aerosol optical properties, and surface mass concentration in 2006 in China are performed with two aerosol interactive global atmosphere models, namely, the Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) coupled with the Spectral Radiation Transport. Model fur Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) and the Beijing Climate Center Atmospheric General Circulation Model (BCC_AGCM) coupled with the Canadian Aerosol Module (CAM) online. The observed and simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) exhibit similar horizontal distributions with large values over eastern and central China, and sulfate aerosols contribute the main differences between the AODs simulated by NICAM and BCC_AGCM. The simulated sulfate and dust surface concentrations are more consistent with observations compared with the simulated carbonaceous surface concentrations, and both models can reproduce the decreasing tendency of the sulfate surface concentration from urban sites to rural sites. However, the dust emission and deposition levels in China simulated by BCC_AGCM are three times as high as those simulated by NICAM, and the major sink processes of the anthropogenic sulfate, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) aerosols over China are very different between the two models. The emission and deposition results, which are closely related to the model assumed aerosol particle size distribution, indicate that the current aerosol size distribution used in the two models should be further improved. The differences in dust emission parameterizations also lead significant discrepancies in aerosol cycles and the dust emission scheme is an important factor determining the magnitudes of global and regional dust emission fluxes.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance clusters in commensal <i>Escherichia coli</i> from livestock
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), policymakers need an overview of evolution and trends of AMR in relevant animal reservoirs, and livestock is monitored by susceptibility testing of sentinel organisms such as commensal E. coli. Such monitoring data are often vast and complex and generates a need for outcome indicators that summarize AMR for multiple antimicrobial classes. Model-based clustering is a data-driven approach that can help to objectively summarize AMR in animal reservoirs. In this study, a model-based cluster analysis was carried out on a dataset of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), recoded to binary variables, for 10 antimicrobials of commensal E. coli isolates (N = 12,986) derived from four animal species (broilers, pigs, veal calves and dairy cows) in Dutch AMR monitoring, 2007-2018. This analysis revealed four clusters in commensal E. coli in livestock containing 201 unique resistance combinations. The prevalence of these combinations and clusters differs between animal species. Our results indicate that to monitor different animal populations, more than one indicator for multidrug resistance seems necessary. We show how these clusters summarize multidrug resistance and have potential as monitoring outcome indicators to benchmark and prioritize AMR problems in livestock.

TI  - Detecting phenological changes in plant functional types over West African savannah dominated landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is an important component in the climate system, and play a key role in controlling many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate systems. Differences in phenology of plant functional types (PFTs) due to the variation in seasonal cycles (e.g. changes in weather variability), the impact from land-use activities (e.g. fire) and their mechanisms for adaptation (e.g. climate change, regrowth/post-fire regeneration) have major implications in conservation planning and monitoring actions. Detecting phenological variations in PFTs is therefore of great importance to quantitative remote sensing applications, especially in a biome as diverse and complex as savannah. In this study, we implement Savitzky-Golay filtering and the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithms to detect changes in PFTs based on their phenological events using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 2001 to 2018. In this region, PFTs present distinct seasonal, annual and interannual variability. Woody phenology presents early green-up dates with a prolonged senescence period and invariably observed the longest growing season length (GSL). The relationship between the start of season (SOS) or end of season (EOS) was assessed for each PFT to find out the extent to which they determine GSL for different PFTs. GSL is mostly determined by the SOS in woody savannah (coefficient of determination (R-2) =0.41, p <0.01), open shrubs and (R-2 =0.79, p <0.001), grassland (R-2 =0.35, p <0.01) while EOS determined the GSL for both dryland crops (R-2 =0.75, p <0.001) and paddy rice (R-2 =0.69, p <0.001). We compared the interannual variability of woody savannah and other PFTs by measuring the differences of their phenological indicators using Welch's t-test. All PFTs show statistically significant difference with the GSL of woody savannah except open shrubs (p = 0.23). The abrupt vegetation changes estimated with BFAST varied by PFT. Some PFTs are more resilient to harsh environmental conditions than others. While woody species present a few abrupt changes, grass phenology is more vulnerable to disturbance, seasonally as well as in the trend components (large number of abrupt changes) with browning trend following an abrupt negative change. In all PFTs, breakpoint (disturbance) assessed using BFAST negatively correlate with precipitation data which means the magnitude of disturbance decreases with increasing precipitation. Woody species had an r (correlation coefficient) value of -0.5 while grassland had r = -0.7 which is a further indication that grass phenology responds more strongly to annual precipitation than the woody species. These results show that MODIS NDVI time-series data can be used to distinguish the phenological events of different PFTs in West African savannah dominated landscape.

TI  - Effects of diclofenac on sentinel species and aquatic communities in semi-natural conditions
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the potential hazard of diclofenac on aquatic organisms and the lack of higher-tier ecotoxicological studies, a long-term freshwater mesocosm experiment was set up to study the effects of this substance on primary producers and consumers at environmentally realistic nominal concentrations 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g/L (average effective concentrations 0.041, 0.44 and 3.82 mu g/L). During the six-month exposure period, the biovolume of two macrophyte species (Nasturtium officinale and Callitriche platycarpa) significantly decreased at the highest treatment level. Subsequently, a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels was observed. High mortality rates, effects on immunity, and high genotoxicity were found for encaged zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in all treatments. In the highest treatment level, one month after the beginning of the exposure, mortality of adult fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) caused effects on the final population structure. Total abundance of fish and the percentage of juveniles decreased whereas the percentage of adults increased. This led to an overall shift in the length frequency distribution of the F-1 generation compared to the control. Consequently, indirect effects on the community structure of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates were observed in the highest treatment level. The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) value at the individual level was < 0.1 mu g/L and 1 mu g/L at the population and community levels. Our study showed that in more natural conditions, diclofenac could cause more severe effects compared to those observed in laboratory conditions. The use of our results for regulatory matters is also discussed.

TI  - Assessing MODIS carbon and water fluxes in grasslands and shrublands in semiarid regions using eddy covariance tower data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are two important fluxes between the terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Remote sensing data-driven models have been successfully used to estimate carbon and water fluxes in various ecosystems, but the models are still underperforming in dryland. In this study, the agreement between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, MODIS data-driven models, and the eddy covariance (EC) tower observation data were tested for two different ecosystem sites in arid regions in Xinjiang, China. The results convincingly indicated that the MODIS products can successfully capture the temporal GPP and ET variables for grasslands and shrublands, but these results have large biases. The MODIS GPP products certified contributed 88% of the EC observed GPP for the grassland but 16% for the shrubland. The temperature and greenness (TG) model clearly showed favourable correspondence with tower GPP observed in arid regions, with the coefficient of determination (R (2)) of 0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.65 g C m(-2) 16 days(-1). The ET performance was evaluated at two sites, yielding R (2) values of 0.77 and 0.34 for the grassland and shrubland, respectively. Our study showed that the source of uncertainties comes from the remotely sensed data input in GPP and ET algorithms.

TI  - Application of geospatial indices for mapping land cover/use change detection in a mining area
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining contributes significantly to the GDP of South Africa but it also comes with some adverse impacts on the environment. In this study, remote sensing was used to quantify land-use/cover changes in the Welkom - Virginia Goldfields. The aim was to analyse Landsat images with a 5-year interval from 1988 to 2018 using geo-spatial indices: Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to discriminate different land cover types. Supervised classification with the maximum likelihood method was used to classify the images into appropriate classes. Findings revealed different land-use changes with fluctuations in values for each index with an overall accuracy of the classified images ranging from 88% to 96% respectively. Hence these indices are reliable for mapping and monitoring land use/cover changes in mining areas over a large extent.

TI  - Mapping properties of vegetation in a tidal salt marsh from multi-spectral satellite imagery using the SCOPE model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative remote sensing of vegetation biophysical and biochemical parameters through the inversion of physical models is of great significance for monitoring vegetative growth, ecosystem function, and the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, mapping and comparing vegetation parameters in a tidal saltmarsh based on multi-spectral satellite imagery has been rarely documented. In this study, a coupled model (Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photochemistry and Energy fluxes, SCOPE) was used to quantitatively invert the spatial patterns of key parameters such as the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (C (ab)), and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) of salt marsh vegetation from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite 8 (Landsat-8), Sentinel-2A, and RapidEye multispectral satellite imagery. The results show that RapidEye outperformed Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A in the retrieval of LAI and C (ab), with higher coefficients of determination (R (2) = 0.539 and 0.488, respectively) and lower normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE = 0.32 and 0.28, respectively). Without the red-edge band, the R (2) between the modelled and observed LAI and C (ab) for RapidEye decreased by 27.83% and 5.33%, respectively, while the NRMSE increased by 3.13% and 46.43%, respectively, highlighting the important role of the red-edge band in vegetation parameter retrieval. Tidal flooding resulted in poor retrieval results from Sentinel-2A. However, the accuracy of C (ab) inversion was significantly improved by removing the sampling sites near tidal trenches or in low-lying areas, indicating that tidal inundation exerted a notable effect on the retrieval of saltmarsh vegetation parameters when using multi-spectral images. In addition, the spatial pattern of the simulated fPAR from RapidEye is consistent with that of the gross primary productivity. This study provides an alternative method for estimating ecosystem functions in a tidal saltmarsh wetland, as well as for large-scale and high-precision monitoring of wetland restoration that is beneficial for the ecological protection of coastal zones.

TI  - Estimating soybean yield using time series of anomalies in vegetation indices from MODIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of soybean yield while the plants are still in the field is highly necessary for industry applications and decision-making policies related to planning. Remote sensing is a powerful tool, due to its spatio-temporal coverage, for developing empirical models to predict and evaluate crop yields at regional and national scales. In Argentina, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is the most important crop, particularly in Cordoba province the 89% of the sown area and 88% of the production is concentrated in eleven departments. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to explain the anomalies in the soybean yield at department-level in Cordoba, and to develop regressions models for estimate this variable using anomalies of these indices and average crop yield, considering time series of historical records and different sources of data. The results showed that the anomalies of the three vegetation indices fit, with very good precision, the anomalies of soybean yield (Pearson correlation coefficient values from 0.71 to 0.85). The evolution of the NDVI anomalies of mid-season crop development stage, for all periods considered, showed a similar pattern to yield anomalies, particularly differentiating years where droughts or highest soybean yields occurred, independently of data sources used. The regression models estimated soybean yield with NDVI anomalies, obtained prior to harvest, with % RMSE values between 8% and 17%. These simple and versatile models show that using free MODIS data, we can produce reasonable real-time estimates of soybean yield at department-level without previous crop classification.

TI  - Spatial variability of the green water footprint using a medium-resolution remote sensing technique: The case of soybean production in the Southeast Argentine Pampas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture accounts for about 70% of the fresh water use in the world, dominating rainfed production systems. As meeting future food demand will require an increase in crop production, new techniques are necessary to monitor the spatial variability of agricultural water use. However, the use of remote sensing for the water footprint estimation is limited. This study aims at evaluating the spatial variability of the soil-water consumption in soybean crops, also termed as green water footprint (WFgreen), in a sector of the Argentine Pampas using satellite data. WFgreen was evaluated at spatial resolution of 250 m, estimating the soil water availability through the evaporative fraction and crop yield from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Aqua) data. In the analysed soybean plots, the WFgreen, varied from 900 m(3) t t(-1) 1800m(3) t(-1). The preliminary comparison of the method with field measurements showed a RMSE = 494 m(3) t(-1) and Bias =-410 m(3) t(-1), respectively. The high spatial variability reflected the heterogeneity of soil-water use efficieny. The proposed technique can be useful to obtain WFgreen maps at medium spatial resolutions (250 m-1000 m). Also, it can be applied in regions with poor ground data coverage to estimate the WFgreen, after a parameterization of the model. The contribution to our understanding of the relationship between soil-water availability, rainfed-crop productivity and then WFgreen is expected. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Shoreline change monitoring for coastal zone management using multi-temporal Landsat data in Mahi River estuary, Gujarat State
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline changes are caused by sea-level rise, erosion and anthropogenic activities, and have important consequences on coastal ecosystems and communities. In this study, shore line changes during the last 40 years near the Mahi estuarine belt in the Gulf of Khambhat region have been monitored using multi-temporal Landsat data from 1978 to 2018. Multi-date Landsat digital data with 10-year interval from 1978 to 2018 was downloaded from the website . The Landsat data covering the study area with 15-km buffer was extracted and analyzed for monitoring the changes in the shoreline. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images were also generated for delineation of the shoreline. The data was analyzed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System in ArcGIS software, which provides a set of tools permitting transects-based calculation of shoreline displacement. A total number of 10 transects from the centre of the village up to the coast line were marked on the multi-date Landsat digital data. The changes in the shoreline from the centre of the village were calculated using the End Point Rate (EPR) and temporal linear regression model to predict future shoreline position. The decadal shoreline change indicated that shoreline has continuously increased from 113.9 to 831.4 m during the 40-year period from 1978 to 2018, respectively. This indicates that total migration of shoreline towards the land area of the study village during the last 40 years (1978 to 2018) was 1590.5 m with an alarming annual rate of change of 39.76 m year(-1), which is very remarkably high and alarming which may lead to any future disaster for the study village. The coastline was not significantly changing until 1988; however, change in coastline is exponentially faster from 1989 to 2018. The linear regression method was adopted for predicting the shoreline change rates over the entire period of the study from 1978 to 2018 and from 2018 to 2028 and 2038. The results of shoreline change prediction for future 10 years (2028) and 20 years (2038) indicate the average predicted transect length of 1908 m and 1543 m, respectively. With the projected estimates of shoreline change during next 20 years at the rate of almost 120 m/year, it appears that the Chokari village may get submerged in the sea water. The analysis of change in the land surface area of the Chokari village indicated that it has decreased from 12.45 to 9.63 km(2), which indicates that area reduced by 2.8 km(2) may be due to the erosion along the river-bed which is the result of change in the shoreline during the last 40 years. Based on these results of shoreline change analysis, it is recommended that the Government of Gujarat needs to take immediate steps to protect the Chokari village from submergence by adopting Integrated Coastal Zone management strategies.

TI  - Three-dimensional-imaging thermal surfaces of coal fires based on UAV thermal infrared data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quick and precise location of the burning zones of coal fires, which are continuously burning in abandoned coal mines worldwide, has long been a technical problem. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can reduce field work intensity, improve data collection efficiency, and ensure high accuracy at low cost. In order to visualize the distribution of burning points of coal fires, the UAV-based thermal infrared oblique photography is adopted. A 4-step 3D thermal imaging method is proposed in which the processing of thermal images is the most crucial. Furthermore, a software program is developed to improve the contrast and quality of batches of thermal images in one-click as well as to unify the temperature level and scale in each thermal image. This methodology is implemented in the Maoergou coal fires in China to reconstruct the surface thermal field in genuine 3D. The high-temperature zones are illustrated clearly in the 3D thermal model. The results indicate that this methodology can be used as a tool for the delineation of coal fires and other types of thermal anomaly scenario.

TI  - A machine learning-based radiomics model for the prediction of axillary lymph-node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to develop and validate machine learning-based radiomics model for predicting axillary lymph-node (ALN) metastasis in invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC) using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Methods A total of 100 consecutive IDC patients who underwent surgical resection of primary tumor with sentinel lymph-node biopsy and/or ALN dissection without any neoadjuvant treatment were analyzed. Volume of interests (VOIs) were drawn more than 2.5 of standardized uptake value in the primary tumor on the PET scan using 3D slicer. Pyradiomics package was used for the extraction of texture features in python. The radiomics prediction model for ALN metastasis was developed in 75 patients of the training cohort and validated in 25 patients of the test cohort. XGBoost algorithm was utilized to select features and build radiomics model. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the predictive model were calculated. Results ALN metastasis was found in 43 patients (43%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis of ALN metastasis in the entire patients were 55.8%, 93%, and 77%, respectively. The radiomics model for the prediction of ALN metastasis was successfully developed. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the radiomics model for the prediction of ALN metastasis in the test cohorts were 90.9%, 71.4%, and 80%, respectively. Conclusion The machine learning-based radiomics model showed good sensitivity for the prediction of ALN metastasis and could assist the preoperative individualized prediction of ALN status in patients with IDC.

TI  - Utility and optimization of LANDSAT-derived burned area maps for southern California
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of burned area derived from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) system imagery may be more reliable than fire perimeter records based on ground observation or manual cartographic delineation. This study evaluates accuracy of LANDSAT-derived burned area maps associated with 19 fires (65 to 86,776 ha) within shrublands of southern California in the period 1996-2018. High spatial resolution aerial images collected soon after these 19 fires were used to verify burned fractions within LANDSAT ground resolution elements. Validated burned fractions were used to optimize classification thresholds applied to burn severity metrics based on LANDSAT Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The burn severity metrics included post-fire spectral index data (e.g., NBR), pre-fire to post-fire differences (e.g., dNBR), and relative differences (e.g., RdNBR). Optimized classifications of dNBR had the greatest overall accuracy (94%) compared to dNBR(2) (93%) and dNDVI (92%). Classifications based on standard difference metrics yielded burn area maps that were 1% more accurate than those based on relative-difference metrics for each spectral index. Classification products based solely on post-fire imagery were 85% to 90% accurate, depending on the spectral index utilized. In comparison, perimeter data from the California Fire and Resource Assessment Programme (FRAP) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) substantially overestimated burned extent (by about 44%). The MTBS severity maps excluding the 'unburned/low severity' class slightly overestimated burned extent (11%). Commission error in the FRAP data set was attributed to low cartographic detail and inclusion of internal unburned patches. Site-specific differences in unburned soil and vegetation fractions (within partly-burned areas) correlated strongly with overestimation of burned area in the optimized LANDSAT-derived maps; areal overestimates of 10%-15% resulted from data grain size rather than map commission error. The main innovation presented in this study is an empirical method to predict dNBR thresholds based on local (pre-fire) NDVI mean and variance, which produced burned area maps of 90% median accuracy. This LANDSAT-based method could support an efficient reconstruction of fire history in recent decades, which would be more comprehensive and accurate than available fire records for southern California.

TI  - IHS-based pan-sharpening technique for visual quality improvement using KPCA and enhanced SML in the NSCT domain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the different characteristics of satellite imagery, pan-sharpening has become an important field of remote sensing science. It is a reliable method to fuse the high-resolution panchromatic (Pan) image with the low-resolution multispectral (MS) images to generate a composite high-resolution MS (pan-sharpened) image. In this paper, we propose a robust pan-sharpening technique which combines the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). An enhancement method is executed on the source MS image to retain the maximum spatial information present in the MS bands based on the intensity hue saturation (IHS) colour space transform. The proposed pan-sharpening technique is performed as follows: first, the source Pan and MS images are divided into high and low-pass coefficients by NSCT. Second, KPCA is used to propose an effective fusion rule for choosing appropriate low-pass NSCT coefficients for fusion. The high-pass coefficients are fused by proposing an enhanced sum modified Laplacian method (SML). Finally, the final pan-sharpened image is obtained by performing an inverse NSCT and inverse IHS transform on the fused low and high-pass coefficients. Four different groups of satellite image datasets are utilized in the experiments, which show that the proposed technique can both preserve the spatial details of the source images well and avoid spectral distortion. In addition, different image fusion quality metrics are adopted to evaluate the spectral and spatial qualities of the pan-sharpened image. Compared to the state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods, the proposed technique achieved better performance in balancing spectral and spatial information and improved pan-sharpening results in terms of both visual quality and objective measurements.

TI  - Seasonal and landscape effects on the biotic resistance of forest communities to experimental insect introductions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Natural enemies play an important role in the regulation of many forest insect populations. The hypothesis that these organisms also reduce invasion potential is one element of a concept known as biotic resistance. While many studies have shown that the abundances of natural enemies are affected by landscape structure and diversity, seasonality, and host tree species, this study tests the hypothesis that these factors affect the biotic resistance of forest communities to invasion by a non-native tussock moth.2. At 20 sites on Vancouver Island, Canada, spanning a range of natural to urban forests, small populations of the rusty tussock moth, Orgyia antiqua, an exotic polyphagous tussock moth, were introduced. Introductions were repeated at three different periods in the year, on coniferous and deciduous host trees, and included both late-instar larvae and pupae. The survival of these small populations was monitored in relation to four landscape variables measured around each site.3. Spring introductions had significantly lower mortality rates than either early or mid-summer introductions. There was little difference in predation rates between coniferous and deciduous host trees. The amount and type of forest cover in the landscape had important, but seasonally dependent, effects on survival that likely reflect changes in the habitat requirements of a shifting community of generalist predators.4. Based on the results, this study concludes that landscapes with intermediate forest cover are the least resistant to invasion by early feeding species such as the rusty tussock moth.

TI  - Predicting mining-induced dynamic deformations for drilling solution rock salt mine based on probability integral method and weibull temporal function
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term dynamic monitoring and sustainable prediction of rock salt mines is extremely important in preventing potential geological damages. However, the future prediction of the mining-induced surface displacement after the underground mining extraction cannot be achieved with single Multi-Temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique, which can only reveal the deformation history during the period of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisition dates. In this paper, a novel dynamic model, namely Dynamic Probability Integral Method (DPIM), based on the integration of Probability Integral Method (PIM) and Weibull temporal function, is proposed in order to predict the future dynamic subsidence for the period which can not covered by the SAR acquisitions. Firstly, the time series deformation over the test salt mine are generated by Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique with use of 43 Sentinel-1 images, and then the functional relationship between the derived deformation and DPIM is established; Subsequently, the unknown parameters, including the PIM parameters and the Weibull temporal parameters are estimated following the genetic algorithm; Finally, the dynamic surface deformation occurring during the entire period of the underground extraction of the test rock salt mine is predicted. Both simulation and real deformation data over Xinhua (a typical rock salt mine in Hunan province, China) have been investigated. The scenario using the simulated data shows that the overall root-mean-square error of DPIM-predicted subsidence is +/- 3 mm. The real data experimental results show that the maximum predicted vertical subsidence over the rock salt mine was up to 246 mm. The root-mean-square error with comparison to the levelling measurements is estimated as +/- 7 mm.

TI  - CNN-based near-real-time precipitation estimation from Fengyun-2 satellite over Xinjiang, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time precipitation estimation from satellite observations is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate precipitation over Xinjiang, the driest region in China, from Fengyun-2 satellite data. Our network mainly consists of two modules: the precipitation identification module and the precipitation estimation module. The first module aims at identifying the given region as precipitation or non-precipitation, while the second one focuses on estimating the specific precipitation amount of the identified region. In addition, considering that topography generally have effects on the quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) task, we therefore incorporate them into the second module. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model over the national stations, we compare it with not only the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG), but also another two near-real-time products named Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation Near-Real-Time product (GSMaP_NRT) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS). Besides, two precipitation events are selected to validate the generalization ability of our proposed model in Xinjiang, and the verification experiment is conducted upon the precipitation product IMERG Final run. Experimental results show that, in comparison with the rain gauges records, the precipitation identification accuracy and correlation coefficient of our proposed model are 0.93 and 0.21, while the precipitation estimation RMSE and MSE of our proposed model are 0.25 and 0.038 mm/h, respectively. For the two precipitation events, our proposed model demonstrates high consistency with IMERG Final run in precipitation identification, but it shows a tendency to underestimate the heavy rainfall estimated by IMERG Final run. More importantly, the implementation time of our proposed model on the hourly testing dataset is only 5.5 s. Therefore, our proposed model can achieve near-real-time results, which is valuable for precipitation nowcasting applications.

TI  - Climate- and human-driven variations in lake area and number in North Xinjiang, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the surface area of lakes can indicate climate change and human activity, and there are few reports on the characteristics of such changes in North Xinjiang, China. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) was modified by using the middle infrared band (MIR) instead of the near infrared band (NIR). The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can effectively extract the lake boundary. Changes in the number and area of lakes (surface area > 1 km(2)) were examined using topographic maps (1:100,000) and Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) series images (multispectral scanner, thematic mapper, enhanced thematic mapper plus, and operational land imager) for the period from 1960 to 2018. The results showed that more than 85.00% of the lakes were identified in the Erqis River Basin (ErRB), Ulungur River Basin (URB), and Central North Tianshan (CNT) between 1960 and 1980, few lakes were observed in the Ebinur Lake Basin (ELB), Jimunai River Basin (JRB), Emin River Basin (EmRB), Guerbantonggute Desert Area (GDA), and Ili River Basin (IRB), and no lakes were observed in the Eastern North Tianshan (ENT). The surface area and numbers of lakes in North Xinjiang were increased by 795.99 km(2) (35.54%) and 39 (195.00%), respectively, between 1960 and 2018. Multiple factors influenced the changes observed for different types of lakes. The number and surface area of mountain lakes fluctuated and increased mainly in response to precipitation and temperature. The number of oasis lakes remained unchanged until 1990, but then increased in response to precipitation and temperature. The fluctuations in the surface area of oasis lakes, which were affected by climate and groundwater development, were relatively small between 1960 and 1990, but then became larger. However, the number and surface area of plain lakes increased between 1960 and 2018 and were mainly influenced by climate change and human activity, such as water diversion for irrigation, ecological restoration projects, and the implementation of the river chief system.

TI  - Climatology and trends of aerosol optical depth with different particle size and shape in northeast China from 2001 to 2018
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol generated from the economic development and extensive urbanization in northeast China (NEC) could influence aerosol optical properties and affect the regional air quality. The level 3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) of different particle size and shape (spherical or nonspherical) obtained by Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) version 23 were used to estimate their seasonal, annual, and decadal distribution and contribution in NEC from 2001 to 2018. The highest AOD of approximately 0.3 was found in the central Liaoning urban agglomeration, and the lowest AOD occurred in the mountainous area of NEC; the proportion of spherical AOD in NEC region was more than 90%. The contribution of large AOD was higher in spring, ranging from 28.8% to 29.8%. In spring and summer, small and medium AODs were concentrated in central Liaoning (approximately 02-0.3 and 0.06-0.08, respectively). The annual variation in the AOD of different particle size was significantly higher in Liaoning than in Jilin and Heilongjiang. The annual proportions of small and spherical AODs were approximately 60% and 90%, respectively. The annual occurrence of clean conditions with AOD < 0.05 was most common in northern Heilongjiang (approximately 20%). In NEC, the annual occurrence frequencies of 0.05 < AOD < 0.15 and AOD > 0.6 were the highest (approximately 50%) and the lowest (less than 1%), respectively. Interdecadal AOD revealed a positive trend from 2001 to 2008 and a negative trend from 2009 to 2018. The frequency of occurrence trend at different AOD levels also changed from positive to negative between these two periods. The findings in this study are based on the first aerosol retrieval of the newly released MISR in NEC. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the regional and climatological aerosol extinction with different AOD of size and shape as well as various level bins in NEC.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Multispectral Remote Sensing for Commercially Important Aromatic Crops in India for Its Efficient Monitoring and Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aromatic plants cultivation, processing and marketing is an upcoming agro-industry. The yields from these plants are generally governed by its good management practices of timely, suitable and precise actions against damaging factors. Remote sensing in agriculture is not a new phenomenon anymore, but using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, commonly known as drones) for the same is a pertinent topic these days, especially in India. Therefore, the study seeks to perform UAV-based airborne data acquisition, processing and analysis for modernised agricultural practices, finding of which may lead to generate rapid and on-demand real-time remotely sensed data for precision agriculture of commercial crops, which require more care and timely inputs as compared to conventional crops. The UAV high-resolution (1.5 cm/pixel) data were acquired from Mica Sense Altum, a 6 bands multispectral sensor, mounted over an indigenous Quad-copter (< 5 kg). With the help of processed orthoimage, the 22 plots of Rosa damascena (Damask Rose) were precisely (95% accuracy) classified into 03 categories, i.e., rose canopy, weed and open soil areas. We have also estimated digital plant count, plant height derived from canopy height model (CHM), canopy temperature and the topographic conditions of the crop plots. The digital plant counting for R. damascena planted in 4323 m(2) area took 1.2 h as compared to manual 5.94 h counting. Average plant height values derived from CHM ranged from 23-68 cm as compared to 28-71 cm manually measured heights. Results were compared with ground sampling data, with which high correlation was found in digital plant count (R-2 = 0.99) and plant height (96.69% accuracy). The derived average moderate slopes and northeast aspect suggested suitable topographic conditions required for R. damascena cultivation. The image-derived canopy temperature was compared to the relative ground-based measurements, obtaining accuracy percent of 98.54%. The outcomes are encouraging and have potential to be applied for future UAV grounded applications by farmhands.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated several successful meteorological applications of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) by mapping high-resolution precipitable water vapor (PWV) over large areas with satisfactory precision (e.g., 1-2 mm). InSAR, however, can only measure temporal changes in the PWV, that is, the differential PWV (Delta PWV) between two SAR acquisition epochs. The construction of absolute PWV maps using InSAR observations remains an intractable problem. We present here a new method for constructing high-resolution PWV maps by fusing InSAR and global positioning system (GPS) measurements. Our method involves: (1) extracting temporal differences in the zenith wet delays (Delta ZWD) from InSAR observations with the assistance of synchronous GPS measurements, and (2) using a constrained minimum variance estimator (CMVE) to construct the high-resolution maps of the absolute ZWDs by fusing the InSAR-Delta ZWD and the GPS-ZWD samples, and finally (3) transforming the high-resolution ZWDs to PWVs using an elevation-dependent proportionality. Only a single interferogram was needed in our method, so we did not use any temporal (i.e., time-series) hypotheses, for example, we did not assume that the average value of the temporal turbulent ZWDs was equal to zero. We validated the new method over the Southern California region using four Sentinel-1 interferograms related to eight SAR images acquired in different seasons and in different years. We also used synchronous GPS measurements from the Southern California integrated GPS network. Eight high-resolution maps of PWVs related to the eight SAR acquisitions were generated, covering similar to 250 km in area at a similar to 160 m spatial resolution. Comparisons between the CMVE method and the other two methods (GPS-only-based interpolation and time-series InSAR stacking) were conducted. Experimental results showed that the CMVE method performed significantly better than conventional methods for constructing high-resolution PWV maps, which is of great interest to a wide community of geophysicists and meteorologists.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer Using Methylene Blue Dye Alone: a Safe, Simple, and Cost-Effective Procedure in Resource-Constrained Settings
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is done by different techniques in clinically node-negative patients with early breast cancer. In this study, we aim to estimate the identification rates, positivity rates, cost-effectiveness, and outcomes for patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy using methylene blue dye alone. This was a retrospective review of 172 patients with early breast cancer (cT1-3, N0) who underwent SLNB using methylene blue dye alone between January 2014 and December 2018 including their follow-up details until December 2019. The mean age was 51 +/- 10.3 (range: 28 to 76) years. There were 63 (36.6%) patients with cT1 tumor, 108 (62.7%) with cT2, and only 1 patient with cT3 tumor. Breast conservation surgery was performed in 62 (36%) while the remaining 110 (64%) underwent simple mastectomy. Sentinel nodes were successfully identified in 165 (95.9%) with a positivity rate of 23.6%. There was no dye-related adverse reactions intra-operatively. The mean duration of follow-up was 26.68 +/- 15.9 months (range: 1-60). Chronic arm pain was present in 7 (4%) while none of the patients had lymphedema or restriction of shoulder joint motion. There were no documented axillary nodal recurrences in this cohort. Eight (4.65%) patients were detected to have systemic metastasis. One patient died of brain metastasis from bilateral breast cancer. The mean disease-free survival was 57 months (95% CI: 55-59). Sentinel lymph node biopsy using methylene dye alone is a safe, simple, and cost-effective alternative to isosulfan blue or radio isotope technique in surgical centers with resource constraints.

TI  - The Color of Rivers
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are among the most imperiled ecosystems globally, yet we do not have broad-scale understanding of their changing ecology because most are rarely sampled. Water color, as perceived by the human eye, is an integrative measure of water quality directly observed by satellites. We examined patterns in river color between 1984 and 2018 by building a remote sensing database of surface reflectance, RiverSR, extracted from 234,727 Landsat images covering 108,000 kilometers of rivers > 60 m wide in the contiguous USA. We found 1) broad regional patterns in river color, with 56% of observations dominantly yellow and 38% dominantly green; 2) river color has three distinct seasonal patterns that were synchronous with flow regimes; 3) one third of rivers had significant color shifts over the last 35 years. RiverSR provides the first map of river color and new insights into macrosystems ecology of rivers.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS & SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart agriculture is based primarily on three platforms, namely science, innovation and space technologies. These are considered as the three pioneer pillars of nation building. Space technologies play a vital role in improving soil quality, reducing the waste of water during irrigation and sharing agricultural information with farmers. With the help of terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial sensors, satellites and surveillance equipment, a large volume of geo-spatial data from diversifying sources is collected, analyzed, and utilized for smart farming and shielding of crops. The technology foresight will introduce innovations such as the use of drones in agriculture, precision gene processing in plants, epigenetic, big data and internet of things (IoT), utilizing efficiently all types of energy like smart wind and solar energy, artificial intelligence-based application of robotics, desalination technology in mega-scale and so on. Some of these innovations are already being used in developed nations. Agriculture plays an important role in developing economy so the use of digital farming in rural areas will be a boon for agriculture sector. By 2030, 85% of the world's population is expected to live in developing countries. In this context, data-driven technological development is urgently needed for developing countries to increase gross domestic product (GDP) and ensure food security for the population.

TI  - Modelling wheat yield with antecedent information, satellite and climate data using machine learning methods in Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops in the world, and its demand is expected to increase about 60% by 2050. Thus, appropriate and reliable yield forecasts are fundamental to ensure price stability and food security around the globe. In this study, we developed a Machine Learning (ML) approach to combine satellite and climate data with antecedent wheat yield information (YieldBaseLine) from 2004 - 2018, at municipal level, in Mexico. We compared the performance of four linear (generalized linear model -glm-, ridge regression -ridge-, lasso, partial least squares -pls-) and four non-linear algorithms (k-nearest neighbours -kknn-, support vector machine radial -svmR-, extreme gradient boosting -xgbTree- and random forest -rf) before harvest time. Additionally, we evaluated their performance using five different feature selection scenarios (No FS, FS = 0.9, FS = 0.75, FS = 0.9 and YieldBaseLine). The models were independently tested using two different approaches: random sampling and selective sampling. In the random sampling, the non-linear models performed generally better under the FS = 0.5 scenario, whereas the non-linear models were less sensitive to feature reduction. The results also evidenced the capacity of the YieldBaseLine predictor, combined with satellite and climate data, to address the inter-annual and spatial variability in the study area. The highest prediction accuracy was obtained by the rf method (No FS) with R-2 = 0.84. To further prove the model's operability in a simulated real-case scenario, we held out the last year records (2018) to test the models. The best performing model was again the rf (R-2 = 0.81). This study proposes a robust methodology to model crop yield (at large scale) and it may be used with operative purposes. Therefore, it can be of interest to decision and law makers, producers, authorities or the wheat industry. In addition, it can help to establish appropriate food security and trading policies. A similar approach can be applied to other regions or crops.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and exposure in China from 2013 to 2017 using satellite-derived data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based estimation of fine particulate matter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) at a high spatiotemporal resolution is important to understand the detailed dynamics of PM2.5 pollution and exposure. Stricter clean air policies have been enacted in recent years to tackle China's serious problem with PM2.5 pollution, including the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan between 2013 and 2017. However, assessment of the change in national PM2.5 exposure during this period is difficult due to the limitation of high-resolution PM2.5 data. To address this issue, a satellite-based spatiotemporal model was developed to predict daily high-resolution surface PM2.5 concentrations in China during the designated period, and quantitative analysis was then performed regarding the spatiotemporal characteristics of this critical pollutant. The corresponding changes in the population exposure to PM2.5 were also explored at a fine scale. The overall concentrations of PM2.5 declined from 2013 to 2017, with substantial decreases in eastern China but negligible decreases in western China. The national PM2.5 concentration declined remarkably from 2013 to 2014 to 2015-2017. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Pearl River Delta regions and most cities reached the goals set by the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan. However, despite the overall reduction in the PM2.5 concentration, by 2017 the vast majority of the Chinese population still lived in areas with sustained levels of high risk from fine particle pollution. The findings from this study have crucial environmental policy implications for the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution and could benefit PM2.5-related health studies in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Impacts of Hurricane Maria on Land and Convection Modification Over Puerto Rico
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricane Maria drastically altered the landscape across the island of Puerto Rico. This article investigates modifications to surface-atmospheric interactions due to Hurricane Maria induced land damage and the associated impacts on local convective dynamics. Herein, we employed LANDSAT-8 image mosaics to quantify the hurricane induced land modification. Results of the analysis indicate that the island suffered significant forest damage-much of which registered as a 28.35% increase in barren land and a 10.85% increase in pasture. Smaller changes included a decrease in cultivated agricultural land cover by 0.76%, along with wetland and water increases of 0.62% and 0.25%, respectively. Pre and postMaria land classifications were then assimilated into the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System cloud resolving model for the simulation of the June 23 to July 2, 2018 period under two land conditions. Results of the numerical experiments indicate that surface to atmosphere interactions were significantly modified when the land cover was altered, and that the highest deviations between pre and postMaria convection occurred over elevated areas with extreme hurricane induced land changes, such as the Cordillera Central mountain range and the El Yunque rainforest.

TI  - Rapid, robust, and automated mapping of tidal flats in China using time series Sentinel-2 images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are threatened by tidal reclamation and climatic changes around the world. Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2-5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Review on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in vegetation remote sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Identifying and characterizing vascular plants in time and space is required in various disciplines, e.g. in forestry, conservation and agriculture. Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.

TI  - A physical-based two-source evapotranspiration model with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of energy budget components and its partitioning between canopy and soil is essential for improving water resource management. During the last few decades, several two-source evapotranspiration (ET) models have been developed by exploiting satellite datasets in conjunction with meteorological observations to estimate fluxes at different spatio-temporal scales. However, the complex parameterization scheme intrinsic to those models as well as the need for a large number of input datasets hampers their applications in a broader hydro-meteorological studies. In this study, we formulated a Leaf Area Index (LAI)-based methodology to develop a Two-Source Surface Energy Balance System (TS-SEBS) based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and Su (2002) principles, which uses fewer input datasets from satellite and meteorological observations to obtain fluxes on local as well as regional scales. Specifically, 97 medium-resolution Landsat TM/ETM+ images have been used to validate the TS-SEBS model estimations with (a) Eddy Covariance (EC)-based in-situ flux tower observations and (b) one-source SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) model estimations in East Asian ecosystems. The mean bias and RMSE were 10.90 and 58.95 Wm(-2) for instantaneous net radiation, 35.14, and 63.35 Wm(-2) for instantaneous net radiation over the soil, and -25.06 and 45.93 Wm(-2) for instantaneous net radiation over the canopy, whereas the ground heat flux showed a mean bias and RMSE of 45.60 and 59.21 Wm(-2), respectively, over six selected sites. The results of sensible heat flux (H) for SEBS revealed its underestimation pattern (mean bias value of -20.68 Wm(-2)), whereas TS-SEBS tended to slightly overestimate values (mean bias value of 2.32 Wm(-2)) compared with EC observations. The TS-SEBS exhibited relatively better approximations of H (mean RMSE of 57.83 Wm(-2)) compared with SEBS (mean RMSE of 79.47 Wm(-2)) by reducing the error by similar to 27%. In terms of spatially distributed estimation of ET, the TS-SEBS outperformed SEBS with a mean normalized standard deviation value of 1.08 compared with 1.25 for SEBS, a reduction of similar to 14%. A mean Pearson's correlation coefficient value >0.73 was obtained for both selected models based on a Taylor diagram, and these statistics more closely approximate the ground-based EC observations. The better performance of TS-SEBS compared with SEBS is due to the incorporation of improved LAI-based formulations in its structural algorithm to partition fluxes between soil and canopy, incorporation of improved wind speed profile extinction coefficient, and separate calculations of aerodynamic resistance for both soil and canopy components. The proposed methodology in the next-generation TS-SEBS model provides an unprecedented opportunity for quantifying improved energy budgets and partitioning fluxes between soil and canopy in an accurate and computationally efficient approach for better plant-soil-atmosphere interaction studies.

TI  - The 2019-2020 Australian Drought and Bushfires Altered the Partitioning of Hydrological Fluxes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Though coarse in spatial resolution, the nearly all weather measurements from passive microwave sensors can help in improving the spatio-temporal coverage of optical and thermal infrared sensors for monitoring vegetation changes on the land surface. This study demonstrates the use of vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission for capturing the vegetation alterations from the recent 2019 to 2020 Australian bushfires and drought. The impact of vegetation disturbances on terrestrial water budget is examined by assimilating the VOD retrievals into a dynamic phenology model. The results demonstrate that assimilating VOD observations lead to improved simulation of evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture states. The study also demonstrates that the vegetation changes from the 2019 to 2020 Australian drought and fires led to significant modifications in the partitioning of evaporative and runoff fluxes, resulting in increased bare soil evaporation, reduced transpiration, and higher runoff.

TI  - Estimation of marine winds in and around typhoons using multi-platform satellite observations: Application to Typhoon Soulik (2018)
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating horizontal winds in and around typhoons is important for improved monitoring and prediction of typhoons and mitigating their damages. Here, we present a new algorithm for estimating typhoon winds using multiple satellite observations and its application to Typhoon Soulik (2018). Four kinds of satellite remote sensing data, along with their relationship to typhoon intensity, derived statistically from hundreds of historical typhoon cases, were merged into the final product of typhoon wind (MT wind): 1) geostationary-satellite-based infrared images (IR wind), 2) passive microwave sounder (MW wind), 3) feature-tracked atmospheric motion vectors, and 4) scatterometer-based sea surface winds (SSWs). The algorithm was applied to two cases (A and B) of Typhoon Soulik and validated against SSWs independently retrieved from active microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and microwave radiometer (AMSR2) images, and vertical profiles of wind speed derived from reanalyzed data and dropsonde observations. For Case A (open ocean), the algorithm estimated the realistic maximum wind, radius of maximum wind, and radius of 15 m/s, which could not be estimated using the reanalysis data, demonstrating reasonable and practical estimates. However, for Case B (when the typhoon rapidly weakened just before making landfall in the Korean Peninsula), the algorithm significantly overestimated the parameters, primarily due to the overestimation of typhoon intensity. Our study highlights that realistic typhoon winds can be monitored continuously in real-time using multiple satellite observations, particularly when typhoon intensity is reasonably well predicted, providing timely analysis results and products of operational importance.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of Fengyun-3 satellites derived soil moisture with in-situ measurements across the globe
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a pivotal role in terrestrial water circulation, energy transfer, and mass exchange. The X-band radiometer on-board Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites have been used for soil moisture retrieval since 2011. In this study, the spatial and temporal integrity of all available Fengyun-3 series soil moisture products were evaluated, and the data accuracy was validated against four in-situ measurements ascertained globally. The validation results reveal that: (1) The ascending Fengyun-3B soil moisture retrievals express higher spatial coverage percentages than others, and a higher temporal coverage percentage appears at 20-60 degrees N and 20-50 degrees S in summer. (2) The soil moisture products derived from both Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites reveal superior goodness of fit and smaller bias in the northern hemisphere in-situ measurements than in the southern hemisphere. In particular, the satellite retrieved pixel scale soil moisture datasets possesses a better correlation to small scale networks with densely distributed stations. In the southern hemisphere, the bias was positively correlated with the vegetation index and negatively correlated to land surface temperature, and this regularity may act as a reference for Fengyun-3 soil moisture correction. Moreover, the Fengyun-3 soil moisture products reveal positive responses to precipitation, and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days. (3) The X-band signals were gradually impacted by increasing vegetation optical depth, leading to obvious overestimations. Further corrections, including hardware and software, are urgently required to enhance the anti-interference and robustness of the X-band signal.

TI  - Between land and water: Hydraulic engineering in the Tlalixcoyan basin, Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent remote sensing research in the Tlalixcoyan basin, Veracruz, has identified patterns of raised fields and public civic-ceremonial plaza groups that suggest a local and decentralized strategy of cooperation to develop hydraulic and agricultural resources. This perspective provides support for Scarborough and Lucero's (2010) cross-cultural conceptualization of hydraulic strategies in the semi-tropics, but we note some exceptions to their model as well. We conclude based on the remotely sensed data that (1) most of the interconnected field systems are too large or complex for a single family or lineage to have built and maintained alone; (2) the Tlalixcoyan settlement system is divided into clusters that likely represent social groupings akin to administrative districts; (3) each residential cluster possessed its own public civic-ceremonial plaza group; (4) each plaza group could have provided the seat of cooperation in the creation and maintenance of common-pool resources like raised fields; and (5) despite the implication of local hydraulic management within districts, the region as a whole presents a hierarchical settlement distribution with the Tlalixcoyan Monumental Complex at the top. The last two points represent central hypotheses generated from the remote sensing data that will be tested in future field research.

TI  - Determining agreement between preoperative computed tomography lymphography and indocyanine green near infrared fluorescence intraoperative imaging for sentinel lymph node mapping in dogs with oral tumours
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic drainage from the head and neck is variable with significant crossover, therefore sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping can help ensure the appropriate lymph node(s) are sampled. To improve sensitivity, SLN mapping utilizing multiple modalities and a combination of preoperative computed tomography lymphography (CTL) and intraoperative near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF) with indocyanine green (ICG) +/- methylene blue (MB) dye has been suggested. The aim of this study was to describe a method for intraoperative ICG lymphography and determine agreement for SLN detection using preoperative CTL and intraoperative ICG NIRF + MB lymphography (IOL) in dogs with oral tumours. Fourteen client-owned dogs were included. All dogs had preoperative CTL with iodinated contrast and intraoperative IOL with an exoscope. Lymph nodes with CTL contrast-enhancement, blue staining or fluorescence were considered sentinel. The overall SLN identification rate was 100% when CTL and IOL were combined. A total of 57 SLNs were identified. Indocyanine green NIRF identified a greater proportion of SLNs (91%; 52/57) compared with MB (50.8%; 29/57) and CTL (42.1%; 24/57). Eighteen SLNs were identified by all three modalities with a fair level of agreement using Fleiss kappa. These findings suggest a combination of preoperative CTL with intraoperative SLN mapping techniques may greatly improve the ability to accurately detect the SLN in dogs with oral tumours.

TI  - A Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model for improving interpretability and predictive accuracy of satellite-based PM<sub>2.5</sub>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Being able to monitor PM2.5 across a range of scales is incredibly important for our ability to understand and counteract air pollution. Remote monitoring PM2.5 using satellite-based data would be incredibly advantageous to this effort, but current machine learning methods lack necessary interpretability and predictive accuracy. This study details the development of a new Spatial-Temporal Interpretable Deep Learning Model (SIDLM) to improve the interpretability and predictive accuracy of satellite-based PM2.5 measurements. In contrast to traditional deep learning models, the SIDLM is both "wide" and "deep." We comprehensively evaluated the proposed model in China using different input data (top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements-based and aerosol optical depth (AOD)-based, with or without meteorological data) and different spatial resolutions (10 km, 3 km, and 250 m). TOA-based SIDLM PM2.5 achieved the best predictive accuracy in China, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 15.30 and 15.96 mu g/m(3), and R-2 values of 0.70 and 0.66 for PM2.5 predictions at 10 km and 3 km spatial resolutions, respectively. Additionally, we tested the SIDLM in PM2.5 retrievals at a 250 m spatial resolution over Beijing, China (RMSE = 16.01 mu g/m(3), R-2 = 0.62). Furthermore, SIDLM demonstrated higher accuracy than five machine learning inversion methods, and also outperformed them regarding feature extraction and the interpretability of its inversion results. In particular, modeling results indicated the strong influence of the Tongzhou district on the principle PM2.5 in the Beijing urban area. SIDLM-extracted temporal characteristics revealed that summer months (June-August) might have contributed less to PM2.5 concentrations, indicating the limited accumulation of PM2.5 in these months. Our study shows that SIDLM could become an important tool for other earth observation data in deep learning-based predictions and spatiotemporal analysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of the countryside landscapes for sustaining biodiversity in karst areas at a semi centennial scale
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale anthropic conversion of natural ecosystems into human-dominated countryside ecosystems has led to biodiversity loss worldwide. However, how countryside landscapes affect biodiversity is still controversial, especially in karst regions lack of relevant studies. To answer this question, we analyzed the impact of countryside landscapes on biodiversity changes in the South China Karst, featured as a World Natural Heritage site of subtropical karst landscape and rich biodiversity. We presented a new framework to examine the impact of countryside landscapes on biodiversity change at a semi centennial-scale using three indicators: biodiversity cluster characteristics, the barrier of villages to biodiversity, and the barrier of arable land to biodiversity. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, satellite remote sensing data, and field survey data were combined during the process. Results revealed that plant biodiversity was positively correlated to vegetation restoration, and vegetation took approximately 80 years to recover to a stable state. Plant biodiversity spatial points are densely distributed at karst peaks, with an average distance of only 420 m-480 m. Small villages create no apparent barriers to biodiversity, with an average barrier distance of about 450 m-530 m. Arable land intersecting with forest patches connects biodiversity spatial points. Hence, the expansion of countryside landscapes in karst depressions was restricted by karst peaks, and patches of artificial arable land and forest connect the natural reserved forest at karst peaks, which both promote local spatial heterogeneity and sustain local biodiversity. This study enriches the application of countryside biogeography theory in karst regions and provides evidence for integrating biodiversity conservation into sustainable planning in broader areas. We strongly recommend that a heterogeneous landscape pattern similar to karst peak forests, such as the distance between biodiversity spatial points and the barrier distance to villages both around 450-500 m, would be conducive to biodiversity preservation.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Karkheh river's Delta is located in the west of Khuzestan Plain and can be divided into two smaller deltas; northern delta named as Karkheh Delta (including Bostan, Sableh and Neisan Deltas) and southern delta named as Karkheh -e- Noor Delta. Based on Galloway7 classification, Karkheh Delta is river-dominated type (type 1). Considering activity, this delta is divided to two parts; an active part in north and an inactive part in south. Based on Orton and Reading 16 classification, Karkheh Delta is placed in fine-grained (muddy) delta category due to prevailing silt and clay. In terms of sediment transportation and deposition process, this delta is a constructive delta. To recognize changes of Karkheh Delta's area, Landsat images 5, 7 and 8 were studied and compared using 13 satellite images from 1973 to 2016 which shows an increase in the delta's area particularly in northern part. In order to study sedimentology of this delta, 25 samples were taken. Sediment sizing analysis results show that silt is the most abundant sediment on average in this delta whereas clay, sand and gravel are in next abundance. Due to Shepard 17 classification, in Karkheh delta, silty clay, clay silt, silt, sandy silt and clay-silt-sand were identified. Also, channel, flood plain, crevasse, levee and sabkha depositional environments could be recognized in this delta.

TI  - Exploratory analysis of carbonaceous PM<sub>2.5</sub> species in urban environments: Relationship with meteorological variables and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbonaceous chemical composition and mass concentration of particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), were analyzed, as well as their relationship with satellite data and meteorological variables. PM2.5 ground samples were collected at nine sampling sites with different land use in the metropolitan area of C ' ordoba city, during autumn and winter in 2018, and concentrations of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were measured. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) was retrieved from the MODIS sensor, Aqua and Terra satellites. The AOD was validated using ground-based sun photometer data. Furthermore, the PM2.5 mass concentration and composition were simulated using multiple linear regression models, with the measured AOD and meteorological parameters as input variables. The data showed that PM2.5 mass concentrations varied in space throughout the city, indeed at four sampling sites, they exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) daily guidelines. The OC and EC mass concentrations were moderate and low, respectively, in comparison with other cities in the world. PM2.5 concentrations were negatively associated with average planetary boundary layer (PBLav), dew point (DP) and AOD from Aqua satellite (AOD(a)). The columnar average AOD(av) did not correlate significantly with the ground-based PM2.5 measurements, however AOD(a) was retained in a model to explain PM2.5 having a negative effect on particles. An effective carbon ratio (ECR) was calculated to estimate theradiative forcing of PM2.5 in a local scale. The results suggested an overall local radiative heating effect due to PM2.5.

TI  - Remote sensing of temperate and boreal forest phenology: A review of progress, challenges and opportunities in the intercomparison of in-situ and satellite phenological metrics
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation phenology is the study of recurring plant life cycle stages, seasonality which is linked to many ecosystem processes and is an important proxy of climate and environmental change. Remote sensing has been playing an important and increasing role in the monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology. The aim of this review is to critically examine key studies related to remote sensing of vegetation phenology, with a special focus on temperate and boreal forests. Specifically, we focus on how the latest ground, near-surface and aerial data have been used to assess the satellite-derived Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the agreements that has been achieved in the last 15 years. Results demonstrated that the timing of satellite-derived LSP events can be detected, in the best-case scenarios, with a certainty of around half-week for spring metrics (e.g. Day of Year -DOYof start of growing season) and around one week for autumn metrics (e.g. DOY of end of growing season). With expected shifts in plant phenology averaging <1 day per decade, such LSP uncertainties (in terms of absolute phenological dates) could greatly overor under-estimate these species-level shifts; but the spatial variation in phenology can be consistently monitored. An increasing number of studies have investigated autumn phenology in the last decade, but autumn phenological dates continue to be more challenging to retrieve and interpret than spring dates. Emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of forest phenology is presented that includes synergetic use of multiple orbital sensors and its LSP evaluation with data from new sensors at a ground, near-surface and airborne level; yet traditional ground-based observations will continue to be highly useful to accurately record the timing of species-specific phenological events. This review might provide a guide for planning and managing remote sensing of forest phenology.

TI  - Canopy wetness in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy wetness is a common condition that influences photosynthesis, the leaching or uptake of solutes, the water status and energy balance of canopies, and the interpretation of eddy covariance and remote sensing data. While often treated as a binary variable, 'wet' or `dry', forest canopies are often partially wet, requiring the use of a continuous description of wetness. Minor precipitation events such as dew, that wet a fraction of the canopy, have been found to contribute to dry season foliar water uptake in the Eastern Amazon, and are fundamentally important to the canopy energy balance. However, few studies have reported the spatial and temporal distribution of canopy wetness, or the relative contribution of dew to leaf wetness, for forest ecosystems.In this study, we use two canopy profiles of leaf wetness sensors, coupled with meteorological data, to address fundamental questions about spatial and temporal variation of leaf wetness in an Eastern Amazonian rainforest. We also investigate how well meteorological tower data can predict canopy wetness using two models, one empirical and one that is physically-based.The results show that the canopy is 100% dry only for 34% of the time, otherwise being between 5% and 100% wet. Dew accounts for 20% or 43% of total annual leaf wetness, and 36% or 50% of canopy wetness in dry season, excluding or including dew events that co-occur with rain, respectively. Wetness duration was higher at the top than bottom of the canopy, mainly because of rain events, whilst dew formation was strongly dependent on the local canopy structure and varied horizontally through the canopy. The best empirical model accounted for 55% of the variance in canopy wetness, while the physical model accounted for 48% of the variance. We discuss future modelling improvements of the physical model to increase its predictive capacity.

TI  - A surface reflectance correction model to improve the retrieval of MISR aerosol optical depth supported by MODIS data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined use of different satellite sensors are known to improve retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this study, we propose a new method for retrieving Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) AOD data supported by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in Jiangsu Province, China, over the period of 2016-2018 using MODIS L1B, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), MISR 1B2T, and ground-measured AOD data. This method is based on the surface reflectance determined by the MODIS V5.2 algorithm. Through the observation angle and spectral conversion between different sensors, the MISR AOD can be obtained. The correlation coefficient (R) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the retrieved MISR and ground-measured AOD data varied between different seasons. The accuracy of the MISR AOD retrieval was notably improved after correcting the MISR surface reflectance. Therefore, the method proposed in this study is feasible for the retrieval of MISR AOD supported by MODIS data, and will be applicable to atmospheric environmental monitoring over large areas in the future.

TI  - Climate change effects on waterhole persistence in rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The episodic, seasonal hydrology of Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) rivers produce a series of waterholes which provide critical aquatic refugia and essential water supply during predominantly dry periods. This study used direct measures of water loss, regional meteorological data, and waterhole bathymetry to develop calibrated waterhole persistence models in a range of waterhole types throughout the Queensland portion of the LEB. Evaporation was a major driver of waterhole persistence, whereas the influence of other water balance parameters (e.g. groundwater discharge, seepage, vegetation utilisation) varied between waterholes and years. Estimates of waterhole persistence were extrapolated to the regional scale using a modelled time-series of waterhole level data and Landsat satellite imagery (1988-2019). Strong relationships were calculated between waterhole level and waterhole area (r(2) = 0.88) and waterhole level and number of waterholes (r(2) = 0.79) for all regional waterhole zones. Using these relationships and predicted evaporation rates under three possible future greenhouse gas scenarios, modelling showed that, by 2070, the number of persistent waterholes could reduce by up to 67% over 12 month period without flow. Similarly, reductions in waterhole area of up to 72% are possible under drier climate scenarios. These results potentially represent a significant risk to the aquatic ecosystems and other waterhole-dependent users for an already limited resource.

TI  - Freshwater salinization increases survival of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and risk of bacterial impairment
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) are responsible for more designated freshwater stream impairments than any other contaminant in the United States. E. coli are intentionally used as a sentinel of fecal contamination for freshwaters because previous research indicates that salt concentrations in brackish or marine waters reduce E. coli survival, rendering it a less effective indicator of public health risks. Given increasing evidence of freshwater salinization associated with upland anthropogenic land-use, understanding the effects on fecal indicators is critical; however, changes in E. coli survival along the freshwater salinity range (<= 1500 mu S cm(-1)) have not been previously examined. Through a series of controlled mesocosm experiments, we provide direct evidence that salinization causes E. coli survival rates in freshwater to increase at conductivities as low as 350 mu S cm(-1) and peak at 1500 mu S cm(-1), revealing a subsidy stress response across the freshwater-marine continuum. Furthermore, specific base cations affect E. coli survival differently, with Mg2+ increasing E. coli survival rates relative to other chloride salts. Further investigation of the mechanisms by which freshwater salinization increases susceptibility to or exacerbates bacterial water quality impairments is recommended. Addressing salinization with nuanced approaches that consider salt sources and chemistry could assist in prioritizing and addressing bacterial water quality management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The practices of synthetic biology are being integrated into 'multiscale' designs enabling two-way communication across organic and inorganic information substrates in biological, digital and cyber-physical system integrations. Novel applications of 'bio-informational' engineering will arise in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, precision medicine and next-generation biomanufacturing. Potential developments include sentinel plants for environmental monitoring and autonomous bioreactors that respond to biosensor signaling. As bio-informational understanding progresses, both natural and engineered biological systems will need to be reimagined as cyber-physical architectures. We propose that a multiple length scale taxonomy will assist in rationalizing and enabling this transformative development in engineering biology. Synthetic biology engineering principles enable two-way communication between living and inanimate substrates. Here the authors consider the development of this bio-informational exchange and propose cyber-physical architectures and applications.

TI  - Remotely sensed phenological heterogeneity of restored wetlands: linking vegetation structure and function
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal phenological dynamics of vegetation hold important clues on ecosystem performance towards management goals, such as carbon uptake, and thus should be considered in projections of their targeted services. However, in wetlands spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to mixing of open water, soil, green and dead vegetation makes it difficult to generalize ecosystem functioning across different regions. Remote sensing observations can provide spatially-explicit, cost-effective phenology indicators; however, little is known about their capacity to indicate the links between wetland ecosystem structure and function. Here we assessed this potential by comparing one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from satellite products at high (5m; RapidEye) and low (30m; Landsat) spatial resolutions with eddy covariance time series of net carbon exchange, field digital camera (phenocam) greenness and water temperature among three floristically similar restored wetlands in California, USA. Phenological timing differed by wetland site: depending on satellite, the range in site-median start of greening was up to 28 days, end of greening - up to 73 days, start of senescence - up to 79 days, and end of senescence - up to 10 days. Key transition dates from satellite inputs agreed with seasonal changes in net carbon exchange, phenocam greenness and water temperatures, suggesting that phenological contrasts could result in part from site differences in vegetation configuration and litter affecting the exposure of canopy, soil and water to sunlight and thus sub-canopy microclimate and ecosystem functioning. Yet, the agreement between satellite inputs was non-systematic, with the greatest disparities at the more heterogeneous, less vegetated site. Phenological model fitting uncertainty increased with greater spatial resolution, highlighting the tradeoff between the accuracy of representing vegetation and the complexity of local seasonal variation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of satellite-derived phenology to structural and functional heterogeneity of ecosystems and call for more rigorous spatially-explicit analyses to inform assessments of restoration and management outcomes.

TI  - Evaluation and possible uncertainty source analysis of JAXA Himawari-8 aerosol optical depth product over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest version of JAXA aerosol optical depth (AOD) product over China in 2018 from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) was evaluated, including validation with global AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and China Aerosol Research Network (CARSNET) ground-based observations, and comparison against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD product. Considering both the quality and quantity of the AHI AOD product, the Quality Assurance Flags (QA_Flags) with "good" and "very good" are chosen for evaluation and analysis. AHI and MODIS AOD products are well correlated and the spatial distributions are similar, even though underestimation from AHI AOD in the morning and overestimation in the afternoon are found when compared with MODIS AOD. Validation with ground-based observations also indicates a good correlation (R > 0.75) when sparsely vegetated surfaces are excluded. It is found that 52.74% fall below the expected error (EE) at 10:30 BJT when compared with CARSNET which has more vegetation sites and 56.91% fall above the EE at 13:30 BJT when compared with AERONET which has more urban sites. The slope of the fit line is around 1.0 for all matched sites, while the scatter plots have divided into two parts as the performance of AHI AOD depends on the observation times and surface types. The temporal variations of AHI and AERONET AODs show that the overestimation from AHI AOD occurs in the afternoon for barren surface while the underestimation occurs in the morning for well-vegetation surface. For monthly variation, the overestimation of AHI AOD is found over Northern China in winter and those seasons when the plants are growing or disappearing rapidly.The assumption that the surface reflectance remains unchanged and the solar geometries are nearly identical within a month causes the underestimation of surface reflectance and thus contributes to the AHI AOD overestimation for low vegetation and bare surfaces in autumn and winter. While over the vegetated surfaces, neglecting the background aerosols causes overestimation of the surface reflectance, and thus leads to underestimation of AHI AOD. The difference between backward and forward scattering contributes to the larger JAXA AHI AOD error in the afternoon, which aggravates positive deviation for barren land sites and alleviates the underestimation for vegetation surface types in the afternoon. In addition, aerosol model selection and cloud contamination also affect the accuracy of aerosol products, especially when AOD is large.Overall, the JAXA AHI AOD provides a high temporal resolution and relative reliable aerosol product for environmental research. The analysis on characteristics and uncertainty sources in this study are to further enhance the understanding of the geostationary satellite aerosol products for applications, and provide useful information for improving the aerosol retrieval algorithm in future.

TI  - ModIs Dust AeroSol (MIDAS): a global fine-resolution dust optical depth data set
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and describing the spatiotemporal variability in dust aerosols is crucial for understanding their multiple effects, related feedbacks, and impacts within the Earth system. This study describes the development of the ModIs Dust AeroSol (MIDAS) data set. MIDAS provides columnar daily dust optical depth (DOD) at 550 nm at a global scale and fine spatial resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) over a 15-year period (2003-2017). This new data set combines quality filtered satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from MODIS-Aqua at swath level (Collection 6.1; Level 2), along with DOD-to-AOD ratios provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis to derive DOD on the MODIS native grid. The uncertainties of the MODIS AOD and MERRA-2 dust fraction, with respect to the AEronet RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Lldar climatology of vertical Aerosol Structure for space-based lidar simulation (LIVAS), respectively, are taken into account for the estimation of the total DOD uncertainty. MERRA-2 dust fractions are in very good agreement with those of LIVAS across the dust belt in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea; the agreement degrades in North America and the Southern Hemisphere, where dust sources are smaller. MIDAS, MERRA-2, and LIVAS DODs strongly agree when it comes to annual and seasonal spatial patterns, with colocated global DOD averages of 0.033, 0.031, and 0.029, respectively; however, deviations in dust loading are evident and regionally dependent. Overall, MIDAS is well correlated with AERONET-derived DODs (R = 0.89) and only shows a small positive bias (0.004 or 2.7 %). Among the major dust areas of the planet, the highest R values (>0.9) are found at sites of North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. MIDAS expands, complements, and upgrades the existing observational capabilities of dust aerosols, and it is suitable for dust climatological studies, model evaluation, and data assimilation.

TI  - Anxiety buffers and the threat of extreme automation: a terror management theory perspective
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The advent of extreme automation from new technologies such as artificial intelligence portends a massive increase in unemployment. The psychological impact of this threat on the workforce is critically important. This paper aims to examine the functioning of individuals' anxiety buffers in response to this threat. Design/methodology/approach A two-stage mixed-methods design is used. In stage 1, qualitative data are gathered through semi-structured interviews. In stage 2, quantitative data are collected through two experiments to assess the psychological impact of exposure to the threat. Findings Exposure to the threat of extreme automation reduces self-esteem, faith in the worldview and attachment security. When self-esteem and attachment security are under attack, they are ineffective as anxiety buffers, and anxiety levels increase. Additionally, there is a distal effect such that during a period of distraction, the threatened anxiety buffers are reinforced and return to their normal levels. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to a homogenous culture in which work is highly salient. Future research should include other cultures, other methods of exposure and further examine the distal effects. Originality/value The study examines the previously underexplored issue of individuals' psychological response to the impending changes in the workforce because of technological advancements.

AB  - While typically North American and Anglo-European stances have dominated discussion on different paradigms advanced about mixed method research, recently there has been a call for examination of other cultural worldviews. This article contributes to the field of mixed methods research by presenting a worldview based on collective inquiry, whereby different perspectives are woven together to create new knowledge. Fa'afaletui, a Samoan research framework, literally means "'ways of' [fa'a] 'weaving together' [tui] deliberations of different groups or 'houses' [fale]." It is derived from the Pacific philosophy of connectiveness and a collective holistic approach. We give a case example of how this framework is directing our research.

T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mostly motivated by the crop field classification problem and the automated computational methodology for the extraction of agricultural fields with a uniform crop distribution from satellite data, we propose an indirect approach for the image segmentation which is based on the concept of a piecewise constant approximation of the slope-based vegetation indices. We discuss in detail the consistency of the new statement of segmentation problem and its solvability. We mainly focus on the rigor mathematical substantiation of the proposed approach, deriving the corresponding optimality conditions, and we show that the new optimization problem is rather a flexible and powerful model of variational image segmentation problems. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by numerical experiences with images that have been delivered by satellite Sentinel-2. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contrasting changes in cloud optical properties and the influence of aerosols, meteorology and radiation feedback in the Himalaya Karakoram region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal variations in cloud optical properties and the influence of aerosols, radiation feedback and meteorological parameters were investigated at high altitudes of Diamir, Gilgit and Skardu in the Himalaya Karakoram (HK) region of northern Pakistan from 2004 to 2016. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) depicted significant variation with high values during spring months as compared to other months. The results revealed high values of cloud fraction (CF), cloud water path (CWP) and cloud optical depth (COD) in winter months, while contrasting response was observed in summer months. Due to Twomey effect, clouds become thicker and brighter with maximum COD and liberation of latent heat, which modifies temperature gradient of vertical profile. Similarly, an uneven distribution of cloud effective radius (CER) was observed throughout the study period. An increasing trend of cloud top temperature (CTT) from February to September was observed, while an opposite response was found from September to January during the study period. Likewise, minimum and maximum cloud top pressure (CTP) was found in February and November, respectively. AOD is positively correlated with CF and COD due to high humidity and the existence of hydrophilic aerosols. The results of AOD and CER correlation were in good agreement with Twomey effect. However, AOD showed contrasting relationship with CWP over Diamir and Gilgit. The negative relationships of AOD with CTP and CTT indicated the suppression of precipitation process and variability of meteorological parameters. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between COD and CTP against top of the atmosphere shortwave cloud radiative forcing (TOASWCRF), which indicates the cooling effect due to increasing COD and CTP. With TOASWCRF, a variation in CWP and CER may also lead to cooling effect due to reflection of solar radiations. While the meteorology depicted an uneven relationship with cloud optical properties at observation sites.

TI  - Dual threat of tidal flat loss and invasive Spartina alterniflora endanger important shorebird habitat in coastal mainland China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China's coastal wetlands are critically important to shorebirds. Substantial loss of tidal flats, shorebirds' primary foraging grounds, has occurred from land claim and other processes, and is driving population declines in multiple species. Smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to the coast of China in 1979 to promote conversion of tidal flats into dry land and has since spread rapidly. The occurrence of S. alterniflora reduces the availability of foraging and roosting habitat for shorebirds, and may be particularly detrimental in places that have experienced other tidal flat loss. However, the extent to which S. alterniflora is encroaching upon important shorebird habitat throughout coastal mainland China, and its intersection with tidal flat loss, has not been quantified. Here, we i) estimate change in the spatial extent of tidal flats between 2000 and 2015 in coastal mainland China where internationally important numbers of shorebirds have been recorded; ii) map the extent of S. alterniflora coverage in 2015 at the same set of sites; and, iii) investigate where these two threats to important shorebird habitat intersect. Our analysis of remote sensing data indicated a 15% net loss in tidal flat area between 2000 and 2015 across all sites, including a net loss in tidal flat area in 39 of 53 individual sites (74%). Spartina alterniflora occurred at 28 of 53 sites (53%) in 2015, of which 22 sites (79%) also had a net loss in tidal flat area between 2000 and 2015. Combined pressures from tidal flat loss and S. alterniflora invasion were most severe in eastern coastal China. Species highly dependent on migrating through this region, which include the Critically Endangered Spoon-billed Sandpiper and Endangered Nordmann's Greenshank and Far Eastern Curlew, may be particularly impacted. Our results underscore the urgent need to arrest tidal flat declines and develop a comprehensive control program for S. alterniflora in coastal areas of mainland China that are important for shorebirds.

T2  - COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To assemble the genome of the marine water flea Diaphanosoma celebensis, a sentinel model for marine environmental monitoring, we constructed a high-quality genome using PromethION and HiSeq 2500 platforms. The total length of the assembled genome was 100.08 Mb, with N50 = 2.56 Mb (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs, 96.9%) and consisted of 179 scaffolds. A total of 15,427 genes were annotated, and orthologous gene clusters in D. celebensis were analyzed and compared with those of the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex. In addition, phase I, II, and III detoxification gene families of cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette were fully identified and revealed lineage-specific gene loss and/or expansion, suggesting that the evolution of detoxification gene families likely modulates fitness and susceptibility in response to environmental stressors. The study improves our understanding of the detoxification-related gene system and should contribute to future studies of molecular ecotoxicology in cladoceran species and their responses to emerging pollutants.

TI  - Assessment of long-range transboundary aerosols in Seoul, South Korea from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and ground-based observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand air quality issues in South Korea, it is essential to identify the main contributors of air pollution and to quantify the effects of transboundary transport. In this study, geostationary satellite measurements were used to assess the effects of aerosol transport on air quality in South Korea. This study proposes a method to define the long-range transport (LRT) of aerosols into the Korean Peninsula using remote sensing obervations and back-trajectories and estimates the LRT effects on air quality in Seoul using in-situ particulate matter (PM) measurements. Aerosol optical depths (AOD5) are obtained from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), and the back-trajectories are from the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYS-PLIT) model. For LRT events, satellite observations showed high AOD plumes over the Yellow Sea, a pathway between Eastern China and South Korea, and the movements of aerosol plumes transported to South Korea were also detected. PM2.5 concentrations, PM10 concentrations, and AOD during LRT increased by 52%, 49%, and 81%, respectively, relative to their average values for 2015-2018. To quantitatively characterize the LRT of aerosols, the effects of LRT on PM2.5 concentrations were estimated for each PM concentration category. The contribution of LRT to PM2.5 concentrations was estimated to be 33% during 2015-2018. When high concentrations of PM2.5 were observed in Seoul, they were likely to be associated with LRT events.

TI  - Visualisation of flooding along an unvegetated, ephemeral river using Google Earth Engine: Implications for assessment of channel-floodplain dynamics in a time of rapid environmental change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given rapid environmental change, the development of new, data-driven, interdisciplinary approaches is essential for improving assessment and management of river systems, especially with respect to flooding. In the world's extensive drylands, difficulties in obtaining field observations of major hydrological events mean that remote sensing techniques are commonly used to map river floods and assess flood impacts. Such techniques, however, are dependent on available cloud-free imagery during or immediately after peak discharge, and single images may omit important flood-related hydrogeomorphological events. Here, we combine multiple Landsat images from Google Earth Engine (GEE) with precipitation datasets and high-resolution (<0.65 m) satellite imagery to visualise flooding and assess the associated channel-floodplain dynamics along a 25 km reach of the unvegetated, ephemeral Rio Colorado, Bolivia. After cloud and shadow removal, Landsat surface reflectance data were used to calculate the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and map flood extents and patterns. From 2004 through 2016, annual flooding area along the narrow (<30 m), shallow (<1.7 m), finegrained (dominantly silt/clay) channels was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.83) with 2-day maximum precipitation totals. Rapid meander bend migration, bank erosion, and frequent overbank flooding was associated with formation of crevasse channels, splays, and headward-eroding channels, and with avulsion (shifting of flow from one channel to another). These processes demonstrate ongoing, widespread channel-floodplain dynamics despite low stream powers and cohesive sediments. Application of our study approaches to other dryland rivers will help generate comparative data on the controls, rates, patterns and timescales of channel-floodplain dynamics under scenarios of climate change and direct human impacts, with potential implications for improved river management.

TI  - Increase in occurrence of large glacier-related landslides in the high mountains of Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, a large number of glaciers are retreating due to global warming. Along with climate change, glacial melting has been identified as one of the main triggers of landslide activity in high mountain areas. Evaluations of the triggered mechanism alone do not provide comprehensive insight into the overall impact of glacier accumulation and ablation on landslide-induced denudation. To investigate recent trends, we built landslide and glacier datasets for the HMA using a Landsat time-series covering the past 21 years (1998-2018). Landslides that may have been caused by major earthquakes were identified and removed, leaving an inventory that is used to explore changes that may be related to climate change. Our results show a shift in the frequency-area distribution that indicates an increasing trend of large landslides in the HMA over the last decade. A decline in glacier area is associated with the increase in landslide area.

TI  - A verification of the lightning detection data from FY-4A LMI as compared with ADTD-2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper the match percentage (MP) of lightning frequency in Jiangsu, China from June to August in 2019 is analyzed, by comparing the lightning mapping imager (LMI) data from FengYun (FY)-4A geostationary meteorological satellite with the Advanced Direction and Time-of-arrival Detecting (ADTD)-2 total lightning location data and radar composite reflectivity. The results show that the MP increases with the spatial matching window, yet when the matching window is larger than 0.8 degrees (-80 km), the MP tends to be stable. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of lightning and the characteristics of the match lightning (ML) current are analyzed. The horizontal detection error of LMI for isolated thunderstorm clusters is about 0.15 +/- 0.003 degrees (-15 km). The amplitude of the lightning current is an important but not the only factor affecting the satellite's detection efficiency. Through the 10 min analysis of a large-scale and long-term thunderstorm process in Jiangsu province on July 6, 2019, it is found that the lightning detected by LMI and ADTD-2 occurred mostly in the region with strong echoes above 40 dBZ or in its vicinity. With the development of the thunderstorm, the lightning detected by ADTD-2 gradually increased and reached a maximum at 14:40. Subsequently, with the weakening of the thunderstorm system the lightning detected by ADTD-2 gradually decreased. However, the lightning detected by LMI was less all the time before 18:30 and then increased gradually. In the fourth stage (19:40 on July 6-00:20 on July 7), LMI has the highest relative detection efficiency of 12.78%-14.66% using ADTD-2 as a reference, indicating that the satellite detection is relatively less efficient during the daytime.

Herein is reported a patient with MM and non-V600-BRAF mutation who responded to iBRAF/iMEK therapy. In July 2014, a 63-year-old man presented with a 4.1mm-thick V600E-BRAF wild type melanoma on the back. Metastases were identified in one sentinel node and two of 11 subsequently excised lymph nodes, with no signs of distant metastatic disease. In September 2017, lung metastasis was observed and pembrolizumab was started. Progressive disease was apparent at cycle 10 and therapy was switched to ipilimumab. After four cycles, an asymmetric response was observed. In November 2017, next generation sequencing genomic profiling disclosed a rare L597K-BRAF mutation and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib therapy was initiated in January 2018. Seven days after treatment start, a remarkable clinical improvement was observed. In April 2018, the patient achieved partial response, which was sustained until October 2018. Cases of patients with non-V600-BRAF mutations responding to iBRAF/iMEK therapy have been reported over the last years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting response to combined iBRAF/iMEK therapy in a patient with metastatic melanoma harboring L597K mutation.

TI  - Mapping mangrove forests in the Red River Delta, Vietnam
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests (MFs), which occur along tropical and subtropical coastal zone, are among the most productive and richest carbon-rich ecosystems in the world. However, MFs have experienced great losses worldwide due to the impacts of intensive human activities and relative sea level rise. Here, the recent dynamic changes in the MFs of the Red River Delta (RRD), the second largest delta in Vietnam, were quantified using the random forest algorithm based on 328 remote images obtained by Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI during 1986-2019. The results show obvious increasing trends in the MF area with a change rate of 39 ha/y from 1,655 ha in 1986 to 2,944 ha in 2019. The change rates in the northern RRD (NP) and southern RRD (SP) were 8.44 ha/y and 30.62 ha/y, respectively, even though MFs in the tropics worldwide encountered significant losses. Further, approximately 1,091 ha of MF was converted into aquaculture ponds during 2000-2006 in the interior of the RRD, while the shoreline of MFs in the NP and SP continually expanded seaward to the northeast and southwest at average rates of 38.9 m/y and 17.9 m/y, respectively. Moreover, although the fluvial sediment supply declined dramatically from 199.57 to 16.41 mt/y during 1986-2017, the sediment supply was not responsible for the present seaward expansion of MFs. Wave action drove sediments to overwash barriers, and tidal dynamics carried this sediment into tidal channels, depositing sediments behind the barriers and on both sides of tidal channels with continuing MF growth. In addition, the conversion of MFs into aquaculture ponds by human activities was responsible for the massive losses of MFs in 2000-2006, but these impacts were alleviated as conservation policies were implemented by local governments in subsequent years. This study indicates that the growth, loss and recovery of MFs are affected by various factors, and it is vital to map the variations in MFs to better implement regional ecological restoration programs for coastal MFs.

TI  - On the dynamic mechanisms of intense rainfall events in the central Andes of Peru, Mantaro valley
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was aimed at analysing the main atmospheric dynamic mechanisms associated with the occurrence of intense rainfall events above the Huancayo observatory (12.05 degrees S, 75.32 degrees W, 3313 m asl) in the central Andes of Peru (Mantaro valley) from January 2018 to April 2019. To identify the rainfall events, we used a set of instruments from the laboratory of physics, microphysics and radiation (LAMAR) composed by in-situ pluviometric observations, satellite remote sensing data (GPM), Cloud Radar (MIRA-35c), Boundary Layer Tropospheric Radar (BLTR) and downscaling model simulations with WRF (resolutions: 18 km, 6 km and 2 km) and ARPS (0.5 km) models to analyse the dynamics of the atmosphere for the synoptic, meso and local processes that control the occurrence of these rainfall events. The results showed that all intense rainfall events are associated with the presence of thermal meso-scale circulations that transport moisture fluxes through passes with gentle slopes along both sides of the Andes. The easterly moisture fluxes come in from the South America Low Level Jet (SALLJ) and the westerly moisture fluxes from the Pacific Ocean. The arrival of these moisture flows to regions within the Mantaro valley depends on their coupling with the circulations at medium and high levels of the atmosphere. At the synoptic scale, the results show that the rainfall events can be separated into two groups: the first one associated with westerly circulations (WC) at the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere, generated by the weakening and eastern displacement of the anticyclonic Bolivian high-North east low (BH-NE) system, and the second associated with easterly circulations (EC) at the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere, generated by the intensification of the BH-NE system. The observed and simulated results showed that multicell convective systems of WC events are more extensive and deeper than EC events. This situation can be explained as the convergence of moisture fluxes from opposite directions occurred within the Mantaro basin for WC events. In contrast, for EC events, the convergence develops at the east Andes mountain range, following which the multicell storm system propagates westward, driven by easterly circulations. The EC events occur mostly in the summer months, while the WC events occur mostly in the autumn and spring months. Moreover, apparently the inertia gravity waves (IGWs) formed in the Amazon basin transport moisture and energy to the central Andes plateau and intensify the convection processes.

TI  - Dynamic GPS-based LEO orbit determination with 1 cm precision using the Bernese GNSS Software
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB) has been performing GPS-based Precise Orbit Determination (POD) for a large variety of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites since two decades. Traditionally, LEO orbits have been generated by a reduced-dynamic POD strategy using the Bernese GNSS Software, replacing an explicit modeling of non-gravitational forces by dedicated empirical orbit parametrizations. This LEO POD strategy can be advanced by two main developments: on the one hand, use is made of the GNSS Observation-Specific Bias (OSB) and clock products provided by the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), allowing for the resolution of single-receiver GNSS carrier-phase ambiguities. On the other hand, the main focus of this article, a refined satellite non-gravitational force modeling strategy is constructed to reduce the amount of empirical parameters used to compensate for force modeling deficiencies. LEO POD is first performed for Sentinel-3, a satellite formation currently consists of two identical satellites -3A and -3B, which experience a similar in-flight environment and allow for direct POD performance comparisons. A third satellite Swarm-C, which flies at a lower altitude and has a more sophisticated surface geometry, is selected to validate the robustness of the new POD strategy. As a result, both the internal consistency checks and external orbit validations suggest superior orbit quality obtained for the three satellites for a time span of 1.5 years (7 June, 2018 to 31 December, 2019). The ambiguity resolution adds strong constraints to the orbits and the satellite non-gravitational force modeling leads to more tightly constrained (towards zero) pseudo-stochastic empirical parameters. The final orbit solutions agree with external orbit solutions and independent satellite laser ranging measurements at levels of sub-cm, indicating approximately 20% improvement w.r.t. the nominal reduced-dynamic orbit solutions. This suggests potential benefits to the space geodesy community that always pursues best-possible satellite orbits. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-producing malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast: a rare case
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-producing tumors can cause leukocytosis despite an absence of infection. G-CSF-producing tumors have been reported in various organs such as the lung, esophagus, and stomach but rarely in the breast. We report a case of G-CSF-producing malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast.Case presentation: An 84-year-old woman visited our hospital complaining of a lump in her left breast without fever and pain. Laboratory tests revealed elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and G-CSF levels. A malignant tumor of the breast was diagnosed by core needle biopsy. We performed a total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The tumor was identified as a G-CSF-producing malignant phyllodes tumor. Within 7 days after surgery, the patient's WBC count and G-CSF level had decreased to normal levels. She is alive without recurrence 13 months after surgery.Conclusions: We encountered a rare case of G-CSF-producing malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. PET-CT revealed diffuse accumulation of FDG in the bone. Phyllodes tumors need to be differentiated from bone metastasis, lymphoma, and leukemia. We must be careful to not mistake this type of tumor for bone marrow metastasis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer has led to new clinical dilemmas in the management of node-positive cancers at diagnosis. Axillary lympha-denectomy is the standard approach for the staging and treatment, despite complete axillary response rates up to 40-60%. Recent prospective studies have shown good accuracy of non-invasive methods for axillary staging in cN1 patients post-NACT, and have led to the spreading of this practice among expert groups. The first results are presented with post-axillary re-evaluation of cN1 patients using Sentinel Lymph node biopsy (SLNB) axillary dissection with iodine-125 seed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Phenology of leaf optical properties and their relationship to mesophyll development in cool-temperate deciduous broad-leaf trees
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf optical properties (reflectance and transmittance spectra of a single leaf) are the key to interpreting remote sensing data regarding the structure and functions of vegetation canopies. These properties are determined by leaf biochemical and anatomical traits, which change seasonally in deciduous species. To reveal the speciesspecific seasonal patterns in leaf optical properties and their relationship to chlorophyll content and/or mesophyll structure in deciduous trees, we examined these mechanistic relationships in a pioneer species, Betula ermanii, and in sunlit and shade leaves of a late-successional species, Quercus crispula, during their seasonal development. Leaf optical properties were measured from leaf emergence to leaf fall in four years. After leaf unfolding, reflectance in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region decreased gradually, while transmittance dropped rapidly. Both reflectance and transmittance increased before leaf fall. In the near-infrared (NIR) region, reflectance increased and transmittance decreased during the development period. Values of parameter N (the number of compact layers within a leaf in PROSPECT-5 model) in young leaves was very low (1.1 for B. ermanii and 1.0 for sunlit and shade leaves of Q. crispula) but increased rapidly by 30% for B. ermanii and sunlit leaves of Q. crispula and by 20% for shade leaves. N was higher in the order of B. ermanii > Q. crispula sun leaves > shade leaves. The PROSPECT-5 simulation with our measured data showed that the development of mesophyll tissue increases reflectance and decreases transmittance in both NIR and PAR regions, and an increase in chlorophyll decreases both reflectance and transmittance in PAR region. Our results indicate that structural and biochemical development of leaf mesophyll and its interspecific variations are essential biological characteristics for understanding seasonal changes in canopy reflectance. The results of this study will help us to better analyze remotely sensed data.

TI  - The Green Revolution from space: Mapping the historic dynamics of main rice types in one of the world's food bowls
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a methodology to map the two main rice types in northwest Bangladesh from 1989 to 2016, when Green Revolution technologies and policies resulted in a 300% rice area expansion and localised unsustainable groundwater use. The mapping is performed for the largely irrigated dry season Boro rice (grown from November/December to May/June), and the largely rainfed Aman rice (grown from June/July to October/ November).The petabyte archive of Landsat reflectance data available via Google Earth Engine is used to extract monthly time-series of two remotely sensed vegetation indices - the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) - which can capture crop phenological dynamics as they correlate during crop growth stages and can be used to discriminate standing water when EVI is low and GVMI is high. This feature is exploited to detect the effects of flooding before transplanting Boro rice in January and to capture the late phenological phases of Aman rice through harvesting months (October to November).A gap-filled and smoothed EVI and GVMI monthly time-series sequences for both rice cropping months are grouped using machine learning unsupervised K-means clustering into clusters (25 used here), and manually aggregated using crop calendars and local expert knowledge into rice types, other vegetated areas, water, non-permanent water and bare areas. A representative subset of these data are then used to construct a training sample using additional covariates besides the monthly EVI and GVMI values and train a Random Forest (RF) model capable of predicting the land cover types in other years.The resulting RF maps for the two cropping seasons were evaluated against publicly available survey crop statistics (from 1989 to 2016) and published Boro 30 m resolution maps for 2013 to 2016. The maps provide qualitative evidence that unsustainable groundwater extractions can be linked to Boro rice irrigation in some parts of northwest Bangladesh. Further research, using these maps and other hydrological data, is required to quantitatively assess when, where, and how much irrigation contributes to unsustainable groundwater use. The results show that the methodology can accurately (generally within 20% absolute error) capture Boro and Aman rice over the Green Revolution period, and other landscape dynamic characteristics of importance for environmental assessments, such as areas of standing water.

TI  - Transboundary transport of ozone pollution to a US border region: A case study of Yuma
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of ground-level ozone affect human health, plants, and animals. Reducing ozone pollution in rural regions, where local emissions are already low, poses challenge. We use meteorological back-trajectories, air quality model sensitivity analysis, and satellite remote sensing data to investigate the ozone sources in Yuma, Arizona and find strong international influences from Northern Mexico on 12 out of 16 ozone exceedance days. We find that such exceedances could not be mitigated by reducing emissions in Arizona; complete removal of state emissions would reduce the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone in Yuma by only 0.7% on exceeding days. In contrast, emissions in Mexico are estimated to contribute to 11% of the ozone during these exceedances, and their reduction would reduce MDA8 ozone in Yuma to below the standard. Using satellite-based remote sensing measurements, we find that emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx, a key photochemical precursor of ozone) increase slightly in Mexico from 2005 to 2016, opposite to decreases shown in the bottom-up inventory. In comparison, a decrease of NOx emissions in the US and meteorological factors lead to an overall of summer mean and annual MDA8 ozone in Yuma (by similar to 1-4% and similar to 3%, respectively). Analysis of meteorological back-trajectories also shows similar transboundary transport of ozone at the US-Mexico border in California and New Mexico, where strong influences from Northern Mexico coincide with 11 out of 17 and 6 out of 8 ozone exceedances. 2020 is the final year of the U.S.-Mexico Border 2020 Program, which aimed to reduce pollution at border regions of the US and Mexico. Our results indicate the importance of sustaining a substantial cooperative program to improve air quality at the border area. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have remained relatively stable in the Karakoram over the past few decades, in contrast to rapid retreat in other regions of the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding mountains. This study investigated glacial changes in the Karakoram since the Little Ice Age (LIA) to examine if this relatively stable scenario has occurred for a longer term. We mapped 432 contemporary glaciers and their corresponding 313 LIA glaciers in the Hunza Basin, western Karakoram, using Google Earth and Landsat images. We also derived geomorphometric parameters for each glacier using the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model and reconstructed the equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) for both contemporary and LIA glaciers based on the toe-to-ridge altitude method. Our results revealed 6.6% decrease in the total area, 14.5% shortening in the total length along the flowline of each LIA glacier, and approximately 98 m rising in the mean ELA since the LIA. The relative area reduction was strongly affected by geomorphometric factors and small glaciers tended to experience relatively large areal reductions. In contrast, the change in ELA was not strongly affected by glacial area but had some correlations with slope and mean elevation. Compared to other areas on the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding mountains, glacial changes have been less extensive in the Hunza Basin since the LIA. These findings confirmed a relatively stable behavior of glaciers in this area since the LIA and a strong control of local geomorphometric characteristics on glacial change.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes the spectral behavior of tarmats and maps the tarmat deposits found along the coast of Ras Rakan Island off Qatar using WorldView-3 (WV-3) sensor data. The laboratory spectra of tar materials showed diagnostic absorptions features at 0.6 and 1.1 mu m in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and 1.52, 1.73, 2.04, and 2.31 mu m in the short wave infrared (SWIR) region. The panchromatic grayscale image and FCC showed the tarmat deposit as a linear warp feature between beach and water. The mapping of deposits using WV-3 data by decorrelation stretch and Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) methods discriminated the tarmats from the sandy soil, vegetation and sabkha features in a different tone. The capability of WV-3 sensor and the potential of image processing methods were verified by mapping the tar distribution of the Ras Ushayriq and NE of Al Ruwais.

TI  - Differential response of oak and beech to late frost damage: an integrated analysis from organ to forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense spring freezing events can kill the recently produced cohort of leaves, forcing trees to expend additional carbon and nutrient stocks to produce a second cohort of leaves. The future trends in the frequency of late spring frosts will affect the adaptation of some tree species to their current habitats. Here we studied the effect of a late frost which occurred in 2017 on a mixed beech (Fagus sylvatica)-oak (Quercus petraea) forest located in central Spain, where these species reach their southernmost distribution limits. We followed a multi-scale approach from organ to forest levels. At the organ level, leaf and stem morphological and biochemical traits were compared between frost-damaged and non-damaged trees. At the tree level, we compared the 2017 radial growth between damaged and non-damaged trees. At the stand level, the 2017 Leaf Area Index (LAI) and daily variations of NDVI during 2017 were compared with those of average years in areas dominated by beech and oak. Finally, at the forest scale, daily NDVI dynamics during 2017 were compared with those of the three previous years. According to our results, beech trees damaged by late frost kept non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations stable by drastically reducing wood production. This growth reduction could compensate for the drop in carbon inputs due to the death of the first leaf cohort, the need to form a second leaf cohort, the one-month delay between both leaf flushes and the smaller photosynthetic surface of the second leaf cohort. In contrast, although the frost-damaged oaks lost the first cohort of leaves and formed a second one, no differences in leaf individual area and phenology, nor stem NSC concentrations and radial growth were found when comparing damaged and non-damaged oaks. The differential response between both tree species seems to provide oak with a competitive advantage over beech.

T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deployment of Wolbachia to mitigate dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) transmission is ongoing in 12 countries. One way to assess the efficacy of Wolbachia releases is to determine invasion rates within the wild population of Aedes aegypti following their release. Herein we evaluated the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in estimating the time post death, ZIKV-, CHIKV-, and Wolbachia-infection in trapped dead female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes over a period of 7 days. Regardless of the infection type, time post-death of mosquitoes was accurately predicted into four categories (fresh, 1 day old, 2-4 days old and 5-7 days old). Overall accuracies of 93.2, 97 and 90.3% were observed when NIRS was used to detect ZIKV, CHIKV and Wolbachia in dead Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes indicating NIRS could be potentially applied as a rapid and cost-effective arbovirus surveillance tool. However, field data is required to demonstrate the full capacity of NIRS for detecting these infections under field conditions. Santos et al. demonstrate that the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) can accurately estimate the death time of trapped female Aedes aegypti and vector infection with Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, or Wolbachia in a 7-day trapping period. This study suggests that NIRS may provide an accurate and inexpensive tool that improves arbovirus surveillance systems.

TI  - Could "The Wonder Equation" help us to be more ethical? A personal reflection
T2  - ETHICS & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a personal reflection on what I have learnt as an academic, researching, teaching and participating in the public square in Bioethics for over four decades. I describe a helix metaphor for understanding the evolution of values and the current "culture wars" between "progressive" and "conservative" values adherents, the uncertainty people's "mixed values packages" engender, and disagreement in prioritizing individual rights and the "common good". I propose, as a way forward, that individual and collective experiences of "amazement, wonder and awe" have the power to enrich our lives, help us to find meaning and sometimes to bridge the secular/religious divide and experience a shared moral universe. They can change our worldview, our decisions regarding values and ethics, and whether we live our lives mainly as just an individual - a "me" - or also as a member of a larger community - a "We". I summarize in an equation - "The Wonder Equation" - what is necessary to reduce or resolve some current hostile values conflicts in order to facilitate such a transition. It will require revisiting and reaffirming the traditional values we still need as both individuals and societies and accommodating them with certain contemporary "progressive values.

TI  - Estimation of the Urban Heat Island Intensity Change and Its Relationships with Driving Factors Across China Based on the Human Settlement Scale
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering a background of global warming, the effect of urban heat island (UHI) has become a serious ecological and environmental problem that is commonly faced by modern cities worldwide, posing challenges to the physical and mental health of residents in urban areas, air quality, and the healthy growth of surface vegetation. Using time series MODIS land surface temperature data products from 2001 to 2018, we evaluated the urban heat island intensity (UHII) and its spatiotemporal patterns in 1232 major urban human settlement patches (area>10 km2) across China based on the consistency method. A random forest regression model (RF) was also used to reveal the driving mechanism of urban heat island intensity in China due to human activities, urban morphology, vegetation, topography, and meteorological factors. The results show that more than 90% of cities and towns in China have exhibited significant diurnal heat island phenomena on the scale of human settlements. The diurnal UHII reaches up to (0.75 +/- 0.6)? and (0.81 +/- 0.53)?, respectively. The daytime UHII in summer was significantly higher than that in winter, while there was little difference in nighttime UHII between summer and winter. During the past 18 years, the daytime UHII in China has shown a slight downward trend, while the nighttime UHII has increased significantly, with no significant change in summer and on mean annual scales. In terms of spatial distribution, the eastern coastal provinces have higher daytime UHII than those of the western or plateau provinces, while the nighttime UHII shows the opposite pattern. The RF regression results show that the average annual rainfall and latitudinal position of cities and towns are the two most important factors controlling the daytime and nighttime UHII in China. Narrowing the differences in vegetation growth between urban and rural environments will have a mitigating effect on the daytime UHII, and controlling the expansion of small and medium-sized towns will also play a positive role in the continuously rising nighttime UHII.

TI  - Diurnal (24 h) cycle and seasonal variability of cloud fraction retrieved from a Whole Sky Imager over a complex terrain in the Western Ghats and comparison with MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of cloud fraction (CF) using a Whole Sky Imager (WSI) equipped with an infrared (IR) camera, play a crucial role in validating satellite data and numerical models. WSI is operated at a high altitude station located in the complex terrain of Western Ghats (WG) of peninsular India from December 2016 to May 2019. CF is retrieved continuously for 24 h at a high temporal resolution (5 min) and a unique time series is constructed for thick, thin, and total cloud cover. The retrieved CF is compared with MODIS (Aqua and Terra satellites) CF during the overpass times over the study area. Good correlation is observed, however, more bias is observed during broken/partial clouds. The biases also arise due to the viewing angles, sensor field of view, and sensitivity of the measurement techniques. The diurnal (24 h) cycle of total CF showed high variability in all the seasons except in monsoon where 90-100% CF is observed throughout the season. The post-monsoon and winter showed high variability due to the occurrence of unusual cyclonic systems in the Arabian Sea as well as in the Bay of Bengal. The temporal monthly mean CF showed significant variability in day and night, with bi-modal and mono-modal distributions in winter and pre-monsoon, respectively during day time, while nights showed mostly flat distribution. Thin CF is also observed in all the months and showed high irregular variability in the range of 2-6%. On a seasonal scale, the observed CF is 50%, 45%, 100%, 60% for winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. The difference in day and night CF is observed only during winter with day CF more than night CF. The study infers that cloud events/characteristics observed on a temporal scale get averaged out on diurnal, monthly, and seasonal scales. When compared with MODIS diurnal and seasonal variability, large biases are observed on a regional scale due to high CF variability, and more importantly, fewer satellite observations representing the day average.

TI  - Effects of grazing exclusion on spring and autumn pastures in arid regions of China: Insights from field surveys and landsat images
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overgrazing has caused serious grassland degradation, and grazing exclusion (GE) has been considered an effective and economic approach for restoring vegetation and soils in degraded grassland. In this study, we evaluated the ecosystem restoration of two types of degraded spring and autumn pasture in arid regions of northwest China, based on field surveys (community structure characteristics, soil C and N) and Landsat images (greenness and wetness). In temperate typical steppe (TS), our findings indicated that GE significantly increased plant height, coverage, biomass, soil C and N, as well as greenness and wetness values from Landsat images, however GE decreased plant density and species diversity. Restoration on greenness and wetness peaked in the fourth and fifth years, respectively, following GE. The restoration of greenness and wetness showed bimodal curves during growing season. In temperate desert (TD), results revealed that community structure characteristics, greenness, and wetness improved after GE, and the restoration of greenness and wetness increased with duration of GE. Soil C and N however, did not recover significantly after six years of GE. The restoration of greenness and wetness remained stable during growing-season months. Our findings suggest that longer GE might be considered in the restoration of TD, whereas short-term (not more than 4-5 years) GE, reduction in the livestock load or mowing regularly may be more appropriate for TS. Decision to adopt measures of GE and the duration of GE should be reasonably determined according to the specific grassland type. This research can provide guidance for the restoration of degraded grassland ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions all over the world.

TI  - Real-time retrieval of aerosol chemical composition using effective density and the imaginary part of complex refractive index
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of aerosol chemical composition is essential for the research on aerosol climate effect, air quality and health issues. With the development of optical remote-sensing technology, numerous aerosol chemical composition retrieval methods based on optical properties were developed. However, the existing algorithms lack the verification with similar measurements of aerosol chemical composition. In this work, a novel algorithm based on effective density (rho(e)) and imaginary part (k) of the complex refractive index (CRI) at lambda = 365 and 532 nm was developed to retrieve four main aerosol components, including black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), mineral dust (MD), and sum of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium (SNA). rho(e) was derived by converting aerodynamic to electrical mobility diameter. CRI was retrieved from Mie code and simultaneous measurement of particle number size distribution (PNSD) and the extinction and scattering coefficients (b(ext) and b(scat)). Comprehensive sensitivity tests were performed to estimate the retrieval uncertainties from the measurements and a priori inputs. Validation of the algorithm was demonstrated using a series of observations at Shouxian (China) from November 30 to December 12, 2016. The measured and retrieved aerosol chemical compositions were compared and the two results showed good agreements, proving the reliability of the method. During one clean and two pollution periods, the variation of measured aerosol physical and optical properties and retrieved chemical composition were analyzed. The aerosol chemical composition changes can be well described by the transition of air mass sources for different pollution levels. This study provides a reliable, in-situ method for better constraining the relationship between aerosol chemical compositions and optical properties. This method will help monitor the pollution event, identify aerosol sources and verify the retrievals from remote sensing data.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of maize and soybean planted area, harvested area, gross primary production, and grain production in the Contiguous United States during 2008-2018
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States of America ranked first in maize export and second in soybean export in the world. Accurate and timely data and information on maize and soybean production in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) are important for food security at the regional and global scales. In this study, we firstly compare the maize and soybean planted area from cropland data layer (CDL) with NASS area statistics over the CONUS during 2008-2018, and evaluate the interannual changes of planted and harvested area based on the two datasets. Secondly, we investigate the relationship between grain production and gross primary production (GPP) simulated by Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) at national and county scales. Finally, we evaluate the linear regression models between grain production and cumulated GPP(VPM) over time at 8-day resolution. We found strong spatial-temporal consistency between CDL and NASS datasets in maize and soybean planted areas. Maize and soybean planted areas increased by mid-2010s, largely driven by markets and international trade. Severe summer drought in 2012 had little impact on soybean planted and harvested area and maize planted area, but substantially reduced maize harvested area. and grain production. Annual county-level GPP(VPM) had strong linear relationship with NASS grain production for maize and soybean. The Harvest Index, defined as the ratio between grain production and GPP(VPM) (HIGPP(VPM)), ranged from 0.25 (2012) to 0.36 for maize and from 0.13 to 0.15 for soybean. The linear regression models between grain production and cumulated GPP(VPM) (GPP(VPM_CUM)) over time at 8-day resolution showed that by the end of July, GPP(VPM_CUM) accounted for similar to 90% of variance in maize and soybean grain production, which was approximately two months before farmers started to harvest. This study clearly shows that VPM and GPP(VPM) data are useful for monitoring and in-season forecasting of maize and soybean grain production in the CONUS.

TI  - Effects of aerosols and water vapour on spatial-temporal variations of the clear-sky surface solar radiation in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Clear-sky solar radiation is an important indicator describing the potential of solar energy. The aerosols and water vapour, apart from geometrical/astronomical ones, are the main factors resulting in the losses of the surface solar radiation (SSR) under clear sky conditions. This study uses satellite aerosol data, reanalysis water vapour data, and the Mesoscale Atmospheric Irradiance Code to create the clear-sky SSR dataset for China in 2001-2015. The aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) and water vapour radiative effect (WVRE) are calculated to study the clear-sky SSR losses due to aerosols and water vapour. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the observations and simulations is 0.944. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 6.67% and 9.00%, respectively. The strongest attenuation in clear-sky SSR due to aerosols occurs in April in most areas of China, while in June in North China and the Yangtze River Delta, water vapour most strongly attenuates the clear-sky SSR in July, and the monthly solar radiation losses due to water vapour are higher than those due to aerosols. The high aerosol and water vapour contents are the reasons why the clear-sky SSR in North China and the Yangtze River Delta in June are lower than those in May. From 2001 to 2015, the clear-sky trend with the greatest increase of up to 0.389 W m(-2) per year (2.48% in 15 years) occurs over central Inner Mongolia, which is related to the reduction in dust. The increasing concentration of particulate matter in the atmosphere results in the most significant decreasing clear-sky trend in North China (-0.510 W m(-2) year(-1), 3.35% in 15 years). Generally, the ADRE variations are the main factor controlling the annual variations in clear-sky SSR.

TI  - Evaluation of the urban heat island over Abha-Khamis Mushait tourist resort due to rapid urbanisation in Asir, Saudi Arabia
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased knowledge of heat island surfaces (HIS) and intense heat island surfaces (IHIS) in urban environments is critical for the mitigation of excess urban heat and the associated burden on power grids. In this study, we propose a robust thermal remote sensing solution for the delineation of HIS and IHIS areas in Abha and Khamis, a tourist resort in southern Saudi Arabia. Land surface temperature (LST) classification images were retrieved by applying the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) to thermal band 10 of Landsat 08 data. The pixels of the LST images were grouped based on temperature ranges using ENVI 5.5 software, and were then delineated into classification images of HIS and IHIS areas. Analysis of these images revealed that the overall area of HIS dynamics in both Abha and Khamis ranged from 562 to 826 km(2), with temperature variations between 36.0 degrees C and 41.0 degrees C, while IHIS ranged from under 1 to 14 km(2) , with temperature fluctuations ranging between 40 and 46 degrees C. The city of Khamis had larger summer HIS and IHIS areas than the city of Abha. This study has a strong potential to support local stakeholders, including urban planners, in tracking and offsetting the negative urban heat island (UHI) effects that result from population growth and an increase in impervious surfaces.

TI  - Improving the global MODIS GPP model by optimizing parameters with FLUXNET data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global gross primary productivity (GPP) product derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is perhaps the most widely used GPP product. However, there is still a large uncertainty associated with the MODIS GPP product partly due to the uncertainty in the default Biome specified Parameters Look-Up Table (BPLUT) of the MODIS photosynthesis (PSN) model. Here, we used the Bayesian inference with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach and FLUXNET data from 110 sites to estimate the parameters of the MODIS PSN model (maximum light use efficiency: epsilon(max); temperature scalar-related parameters: Tmin(min) and Tmin(max); water scalar-related parameters: VPDmin and VPDmax) through individual and joint optimization. The spread of the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the parameters allowed for the calculation of parameter means and uncertainty estimates and also provided information on the behavior of the parameters. Each model parameter varied not only across sites but also across plant functional types (PFTs). The means of the optimized parameter values within each PFT were used to update the BPLUT. We also generated parameter estimates for wetlands and C4/C3 croplands in the BPLUT. Parameters from the joint optimization were more representative and less variable. The optimization improved the performance of the MODIS PSN model by 15% for deciduous broadleaf forests, 8% for savannas, and 3% for grasslands with well-constrained parameters. The performance of the optimized model depended on the effectiveness of parameter optimization. Our study is an effort towards quantifying and reducing parameter uncertainty of the MODIS PSN model and improving the global MODIS GPP product for better understanding global ecosystem carbon dynamics, plant productivity, and carbon-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Investigation of Spatial and Temporal Wind-Speed Variability During Open Cellular Convection with the Model for Prediction Across Scales in Comparison with Measurements
T2  - BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Open cellular convection (OCC) over, for example, the North Sea is often observed in connection with cold-air outbreaks. It is accompanied by large temporal and spatial variability in wind speed, which affects offshore wind energy in the area. This study uses the global Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), with regional mesh refinement down to convection-permitting scales of 2 km, to simulate an OCC episode in the North Sea, with a focus on wind-speed variability. Modelled data are combined with wind speeds retrieved from satellite data and in situ measurements to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of offshore wind speeds under OCC conditions from a synoptic to mesoscale perspective, and to examine the model's ability to represent the OCC structures and wind-speed variability. The model can simulate realistic OCC structures and mesoscale wind-speed variability within the limits set by the effective model resolution. Under OCC conditions, significant differences from climatological conditions are found in the spatial wind-speed power spectrum and in 10-min wind-speed step changes. The very high horizontal mesh-cell spacing in the refinement region of 2 km, and the focus on OCC wind-speed variability, makes this the first investigation of this kind using the MPAS modelling framework with mesh refinement.

TI  - Insights into the aging of biomass burning aerosol from satellite observations and 3D atmospheric modeling: evolution of the aerosol optical properties in Siberian wildfire plumes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-range transport of biomass burning (BB) aerosol from regions affected by wildfires is known to have a significant impact on the radiative balance and air quality in receptor regions. However, the changes that occur in the optical properties of BB aerosol during long-range transport events are insufficiently understood, limiting the adequacy of representations of the aerosol processes in chemistry transport and climate models. Here we introduce a framework to infer and interpret changes in the optical properties of BB aerosol from satellite observations of multiple BB plumes. Our framework includes (1) a procedure for analysis of available satellite retrievals of the absorption and extinction aerosol optical depths (AAOD and AOD) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) as a function of the BB aerosol photochemical age and (2) a representation of the AAOD and AOD evolution with a chemistry transport model (CTM) involving a simplified volatility basis set (VBS) scheme with a few adjustable parameters. We apply this framework to analyze a large-scale outflow of BB smoke plumes from Siberia toward Europe that occurred in July 2016. We use AAOD and SSA data derived from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite measurements in the near-UV range along with 550 nm AOD and carbon monoxide (CO) columns retrieved from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite observations, respectively, to infer changes in the optical properties of Siberian BB aerosol due to its atmospheric aging and to get insights into the processes underlying these changes. Using the satellite data in combination with simulated data from the CHIMERE CTM, we evaluate the enhancement ratios (EnRs) that allow isolating AAOD and AOD changes due to oxidation and gas particle partitioning processes from those due to other processes, including transport, deposition, and wet scavenging. The behavior of EnRs for AAOD and AOD is then characterized using nonlinear trend analysis. It is found that the EnR for AOD strongly increases (by about a factor of 2) during the first 20-30 h of the analyzed evolution period, whereas the EnR for AAOD does not exhibit a statistically significant increase during this period. The increase in AOD is accompanied by a statistically significant enhancement of SSA. Further BB aerosol aging (up to several days) is associated with a strong decrease in EnRs for both AAOD and AOD. Our VBS simulations constrained by the observations are found to be more consistent with satellite observations of strongly aged BB plumes than "tracer" simulations in which atmospheric transformations of BB organic aerosol were disregarded. The simulation results indicate that the upward trends in EnR for AOD and in SSA are mainly due to atmospheric processing of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), leading to an increase in the mass scattering efficiency of BB aerosol. Evaporation and chemical fragmentation of the SOA species, part of which is assumed to be absorptive (to contain brown carbon), are identified as likely reasons for the subsequent decrease in the EnR for both AAOD and AOD. Hence, our analysis reveals that the long-range transport of smoke plumes from Siberian fires is associated with major changes in BB aerosol optical properties and chemical composition.Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using available satellite observations for evaluating and improving representations in atmospheric models of the BB aerosol aging processes in different regions of the world at much larger temporal scales than those typically addressed in aerosol chamber experiments.

TI  - A 30 m resolution dataset of China's urban impervious surface area and green space, 2000-2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely maps of urban underlying land properties at the national scale are of significance in improving habitat environment and achieving sustainable development goals. Urban impervious surface (UIS) and urban green space (UGS) are two core components for characterizing urban underlying environments. However, the UIS and UGS are often mosaicked in the urban landscape with complex structures and composites. The "hard classification" or binary single type cannot be used effectively to delineate spatially explicit urban land surface property. Although six mainstream datasets on global or national urban land use and land cover products with a 30 m spatial resolution have been developed, they only provide the binary pattern or dynamic of a single urban land type, which cannot effectively delineate the quantitative components or structure of intra-urban land cover. Here we propose a new mapping strategy to acquire the multitemporal and fractional information of the essential urban land cover types at a national scale through synergizing the advantage of both big data processing and human interpretation with the aid of geoknowledge. Firstly, the vector polygons of urban boundaries in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 were extracted from China's Land Use/cover Dataset (CLUD) derived from Landsat images. Secondly, the national settlement and vegetation percentages were retrieved using a sub-pixel decomposition method through a random forest algorithm using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Finally, the products of China's UIS and UGS fractions (CLUD-Urban) at a 30 m resolution were developed in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018. We also compared our products with six existing mainstream datasets in terms of quality and accuracy. The assessment results showed that the CLUD-Urban product has higher accuracies in urban-boundary and urban-expansion detection than other products and in addition that the accurate UIS and UGS fractions were developed in each period. The overall accuracy of urban boundaries in 2000-2018 are over 92.65 %; and the correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of UIS and UGS fractions are 0.91 and 0.10 (UIS) and 0.89 and 0.11 (UGS), respectively. Our result indicates that 71 % of pixels of urban land were mosaicked by the UIS and UGS within cities in 2018; a single UIS classification may highly increase the mapping uncertainty. The high spatial heterogeneity of urban underlying covers was exhibited with average fractions of 68.21 % for UIS and 22.30 % for UGS in 2018 at a national scale. The UIS and UGS increased unprecedentedly with annual rates of 1605.56 and 627.78 km(2) yr(-1) in 2000-2018, driven by fast urbanization. The CLUD-Urban mapping can fill the knowledge gap in understanding impacts of the UIS and UGS patterns on ecosystem services and habitat environments and is valuable for detecting the hotspots of waterlogging and improving urban greening for planning and management practices. The datasets can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4034161 (Kuang et al., 2020a).

TI  - Using remote sensing to assess peatland resilience by estimating soil surface moisture and drought recovery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland areas provide a range of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, carbon storage, clean water, and flood mitigation, but many areas of peatland in the UK have been degraded through human land use including drainage. Here, we explore whether remote sensing can be used to monitor peatland resilience to drought. We take resilience to mean the rate at which a system recovers from perturbation; here measured literally as a recovery timescale of a soil surface moisture proxy from drought lowering. Our objectives were (1) to assess the reliability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter as a proxy for water table depth (WTD); (2) to develop a method using SAR to estimate below-ground (hydrological) resilience of peatlands; and (3) to apply the developed method to different sites and consider the links between resilience and land management. Our inferences of WTD from Sentinel-1 SAR data gave results with an average Pearson's correlation of 0.77 when compared to measured WTD values. The 2018 summer drought was used to assess resilience across three different UK peatland areas (Dartmoor, the Peak District, and the Flow Country) by considering the timescale of the soil moisture proxy recovery. Results show clear areas of lower resilience within all three study sites, which often correspond to areas of high drainage and may be particularly vulnerable to increasing drought severity/events under climate change. This method is applicable to monitoring peatland resilience elsewhere over larger scales, and could be used to target restoration work towards the most vulnerable areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Response of downstream lakes to Aru glacier collapses on the western Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower parts of two glaciers in the Am range on the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) collapsed on 17 July and 21 September 2016, respectively, causing fatal damage to local people and their livestock. The giant ice avalanches, with a total volume of 150 x 10(6) m(3), had almost melted by September 2019 (about 30 % of the second ice avalanche remained). The impact of these extreme disasters on downstream lakes has not been investigated yet. Based on in situ observation, bathymetry survey and satellite data, we explore the impact of the ice avalanches on the two downstream lakes (i.e., Am Co and Memar Co) in terms of lake morphology, water level and water temperature in the subsequent 4 years (2016-2019). After the first glacier collapse, the ice avalanche slid into Aru Co along with a large amount of debris, which generated great impact waves in Aru Co and significantly modified the lake's shoreline and underwater topography. An ice volume of at least 7.1 x 10(6) m(3) was discharged into Aru Co, spread over the lake surface and considerably lowered its surface temperature by 2-4 degrees C in the first 2 weeks after the first glacier collapse. Due to the large amount of meltwater input, Memar Co exhibited more rapid expansion after the glacier collapses (2016-2019) than before (2003-2014), in particular during the warm season. The melting of ice avalanches was found to contribute to about 23 % of the increase in lake storage between 2016 and 2019. Our results indicate that the Am glacier collapses had both short-term and long-term impacts on the downstream lakes and provide a baseline in understanding the future lake response to glacier melting on the TP under a warming climate.

TI  - Seasonal variation in photosynthetic rates and satellite-based GPP estimation over mangrove forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of increasing anthropogenic influences and global changes, quantification of carbon assimilation through photosynthesis has gained tremendous significance. Precise estimation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is essential for several ecosystem models and is typically done using coarser scale satellite data. The mangrove ecosystem, which offers significant protection to the coastal environment, is one of the critical habitats from a global change point of view. Light use efficiency (LUE) was measured using diurnal in situ photosynthetic rate observations for 13 dominant mangrove species for 3 seasons at each of the three mangrove dominant test-sites situated along the east and west coast of India. Variations in photosynthetic rates among these species were studied for 3 seasons that indicated varying responses of mangrove ecosystem at each site. Among all species, Rhizophora mucronata and Sonneratia apetala indicated higher values at two of the test-sites. IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV datasets were used for the estimation of GPP. Mean GPP for all the sites varied from 1.2 to 7.7 g C m(-2) day(-1) with maximum value of 14.4 g C m(-2) day(-1). Mean values of GPP varied across the sites, based on its maximum LUE values and available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The results provide GPP values at much better spatial resolution for a threatened habitat like mangroves that typically survive in a narrow habitat along the coasts.

TI  - Satellite-based habitat monitoring reveals long-term dynamics of deer habitat in response to forest disturbances
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances play a key role in driving forest ecosystem dynamics, but how disturbances shape wildlife habitat across space and time often remains unclear. A major reason for this is a lack of information about changes in habitat suitability across large areas and longer time periods. Here, we use a novel approach based on Landsat satellite image time series to map seasonal habitat suitability annually from 1986 to 2017. Our approach involves characterizing forest disturbance dynamics using Landsat-based metrics, harmonizing these metrics through a temporal segmentation algorithm, and then using them together with GPS telemetry data in habitat models. We apply this framework to assess how natural forest disturbances and post-disturbance salvage logging affect habitat suitability for two ungulates, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), over 32 yr in a Central European forest landscape. We found that red and roe deer differed in their response to forest disturbances. Habitat suitability for red deer consistently improved after disturbances, whereas the suitability of disturbed sites was more variable for roe deer depending on season (lower during winter than summer) and disturbance agent (lower in windthrow vs. bark-beetle-affected stands). Salvage logging altered the suitability of bark beetle-affected stands for deer, having negative effects on red deer and mixed effects on roe deer, but generally did not have clear effects on habitat suitability in windthrows. Our results highlight long-lasting legacy effects of forest disturbances on deer habitat. For example, bark beetle disturbances improved red deer habitat suitability for at least 25 yr. The duration of disturbance impacts generally increased with elevation. Methodologically, our approach proved effective for improving the robustness of habitat reconstructions from Landsat time series: integrating multiyear telemetry data into single, multi-temporal habitat models improved model transferability in time. Likewise, temporally segmenting the Landsat-based metrics increased the temporal consistency of our habitat suitability maps. As the frequency of natural forest disturbances is increasing across the globe, their impacts on wildlife habitat should be considered in wildlife and forest management. Our approach offers a widely applicable method for monitoring habitat suitability changes caused by landscape dynamics such as forest disturbance.

TI  - Design of parametric risk transfer solutions for volcanic eruptions: an application to Japanese volcanoes
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions are rare but potentially catastrophic phenomena, affecting societies and economies through different pathways. The 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption in Iceland, a medium-sized ash-fall-producing eruption, caused losses in the range of billions of dollars, mainly to the aviation and tourism industries. Financial risk transfer mechanisms such as insurance are used by individuals, companies, governments, etc., to protect themselves from losses associated with natural catastrophes. In this work, we conceptualize and design a parametric risk transfer mechanism to offset losses to building structures arising from large, ash-fall-producing volcanic eruptions. Such a transfer mechanism relies on the objective measurement of physical characteristics of volcanic eruptions that are correlated with the size of resulting losses (in this case, height of the eruptive column and predominant direction of ash dispersal) in order to pre-determine payments to the risk cedent concerned. We apply this risk transfer mechanism to the case of Mount Fuji in Japan by considering a potential risk cedent such as a regional government interested in offsetting losses to dwellings in the heavily populated prefectures of Tokyo and Kanagawa. The simplicity in determining eruptive column height and ash fall dispersal direction makes this design suitable for extrapolation to other volcanic settings worldwide where significant ash-fall-producing eruptions may occur, provided these parameters are reported by an official, reputable agency and a suitable loss model is available for the volcanoes of interest.

TI  - Ozone over Mexico City during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, emissions of primary criteria pollutants in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) were substantially reduced, as in many other cities in the world. Unexpectedly, the daily average ozone concentration profile was practically indistinguishable from that of the past two years for the same time span in the calendar. So, we compared surface meteorology data, CO, NOx and O-3 hourly concentrations in the MCMA from the ozone season (from March 1 to May 31) for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Also, TROPOMI satellite data on column count of CO, NO2 and HCHO, above a sparse grid of surface points in the MCMA, were also compared for March, April, and May 2020 with those from 2019. Population density used as a background variable to increase understanding of the observed differences allowed us to propose that reductions in NOx were so drastic that ozone formation moved rapidly from a VOC sensitive region towards a NOx sensitive region. The relevance of that unplanned policy provides impacts of contingent short-term emissions control actions during very high pollution episodes. Further analysis of these and other related data concerning VOC speciation and emissions patterns during the coronavirus lockdown may provide guidelines to enhance emission control policies in the post-COVID-19 times to come.

TI  - Comparative accuracies of genetic values predicted for economically important milk traits, genome-wide association, and linkage disequilibrium patterns of Canadian Holstein cows
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Genomic selection methodologies and genome-wide association studies use powerful statistical procedures that correlate large amounts of high-density SNP genotypes and phenotypic data. Actual 305-d milk (MY), fat (FY), and protein (PY) yield data on 695 cows and 76,355 genotyping-by-sequencing-generated SNP marker genotypes from Canadian Holstein dairy cows were used to characterize linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of Canadian Holstein cows. Also, the comparison of pedigree-based BLUP, genomic BLUP (GBLUP), and Bayesian (BayesB) statistical methods in the genomic selection methodologies and the comparison of Bayesian ridge regression and BayesB statistical methods in the genome-wide association studies were carried out for MY, FY, and PY. Results from LD analysis revealed that as marker distance decreases, LD increases through chromosomes. However, unexpected high peaks in LD were observed between marker pairs with larger marker distances on all chromosomes. The GBLUP and BayesB models resulted in similar heritability estimates through 10-fold cross-validation for MY and PY; however, the GBLUP model resulted in higher heritability estimates than BayesB model for FY. The predictive ability of GBLUP model was significantly lower than that of BayesB for MY, FY, and PY. Association analyses indicated that 28 high-effect markers and markers on Bos taurus autosome 14 located within 6 genes (DOP1B, TONSL, CPSF1, ADCK5, PARP10, and GRINA) associated significantly with FY.

TI  - Small Waterbody Extraction With Improved U-Net Using Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water extraction is an important prerequisite for the protection and rational use of water resources. The existing waterbody extraction methods are mostly used for the extraction of large- and medium-sized waterbodies, whereas less attention has been paid to small waterbodies. In this letter, we adapt the U-Net convolutional neural network to extract small waterbodies from Zhuhai-1 satellite hyperspectral remote sensing image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that U-Net framework has been used for small waterbody extraction from satellite hyperspectral image. Specifically, we increase the depth of the network, and because there are far more negative samples (non-waterbodies) in remote sensing data than positive samples (waterbodies), Intersection over Union (IoU) is used as an evaluation indicator during model training. The results show that this method can accurately extract small waterbodies in the complex scenes. Compared with the traditional methods of support vector machine and the normalized waterbody index, the accuracy of this method is significantly higher, and both the Recall and the Precision are close to 90%.

TI  - An atlas of tsetse and animal African trypanosomiasis in Zimbabwe
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the 1980s and 1990s, great strides were taken towards the elimination of tsetse and animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) in Zimbabwe. However, advances in recent years have been limited. Previously freed areas have been at risk of reinvasion, and the disease in tsetse-infested areas remains a constraint to food security. As part of ongoing control activities, monitoring of tsetse and AAT is performed regularly in the main areas at risk. However, a centralized digital archive is missing. To fill this gap, a spatially explicit, national-level database of tsetse and AAT (i.e. atlas) was established through systematic data collation, harmonization and geo-referencing for the period 2000-2019.Methods: The atlas covers an area of approximately 70,000 km(2), located mostly in the at-risk areas in the north of the country. In the tsetse component, a total of 33,872 entomological records were assembled for 4894 distinct trap locations. For the AAT component, 82,051 samples (mainly dry blood smears from clinically suspicious animals) were collected at 280 diptanks and examined for trypanosomal infection by microscopy.Results: Glossina pallidipes (82.7% of the total catches) and Glossina morsitans morsitans (17.3%) were the two tsetse species recorded in the north and northwest parts of the country. No fly was captured in the northeast. The distribution of AAT follows broadly that of tsetse, although sporadic AAT cases were also reported from the northeast, apparently because of transboundary animal movement. Three trypanosome species were reported, namely Trypanosoma brucei (61.7% of recorded infections), Trypanosoma congolense (28.1%) and Trypanosoma vivax (10.2%). The respective prevalences, as estimated in sentinel herds by random sampling, were 2.22, 0.43 and 0.30%, respectively.Discussion: The patterns of tsetse and AAT distributions in Zimbabwe are shaped by a combination of bioclimatic factors, historical events such as the rinderpest epizootic at the turn of the twentieth century and extensive and sustained tsetse control that is aimed at progressively eliminating tsetse and trypanosomiasis from the entire country. The comprehensive dataset assembled in the atlas will improve the spatial targeting of surveillance and control activities. It will also represent a valuable tool for research, by enabling large-scale geo-spatial analyses.

TI  - The external realities of people with type 2 diabetes-Understanding disease perspective and self-management behaviour via Grounded Theory Approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundQualitative strategies can uncover the relationship between the external realities of people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the barriers that are associated with disease self-management. Information from in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) can be used to devise psychological models that could potentially facilitate behaviour changes in people with T2D. We aim to identify salient factors that govern the external realities of people with T2D in relation to disease management.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted at a regional primary care clinic in Malaysia using a Grounded Theory Approach. People with T2D were recruited through purposeful sampling to determine their living experiences with the disease. A total of 34 IDIs with 24 people with T2D and 10 health care professionals, followed by two FGDs with people with T2D, were conducted.ResultsThree major processes that arbitrate self-management practices include- 1) external reality, 2) internal reality, 3) mediators of behaviour. Within the context of external reality, three important sub-themes were identified-intrinsic background status, personal experience, and worldview. Lifestyle habits of persons with T2D play a central role in their disease management. Another common recurring concern is the issue of a low-quality food environment in the country. More importantly, individuals with T2D have a high degree of expectations for a more person-centered approach to their illness.ConclusionsWe identified modifiable and non-modifiable behavioural factors that influence the daily living environment of people with T2D. This information can be used to customize the management of T2D through targeted behavioural interventions.

TI  - Development of a large-scale remote sensing ecological index in arid areas and its application in the Aral Sea Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea Basin in Central Asia is an important geographical environment unit in the center of Eurasia. It is of great significance to the ecological protection and sustainable development of Central Asia to carry out dynamic monitoring and effective evaluation of the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin. In this study, the arid remote sensing ecological index (ARSEI) for large-scale arid areas was developed, which coupled the information of the greenness index, the salinity index, the humidity index, the heat index, and the land degradation index of arid areas. The ARSEI was used to monitor and evaluate the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin from 2000 to 2019. The results show that the greenness index, the humidity index and the land degradation index had a positive impact on the quality of the ecological environment in the Aral Sea Basin, while the salinity index and the heat index exerted a negative impact on the quality of the ecological environment. The eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin demonstrated a trend of initial improvement, followed by deterioration, and finally further improvement. The spatial variation of these changes was significant. From 2000 to 2019, grassland and wasteland (saline alkali land and sandy land) in the central and western parts of the basin had the worst ecological environment quality. The areas with poor ecological environment quality are mainly distributed in rivers, wetlands, and cultivated land around lakes. During the period from 2000 to 2019, except for the surrounding areas of the Aral Sea, the ecological environment quality in other areas of the Aral Sea Basin has been improved in general. The correlation coefficients between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the heat index and between the change in the eco-environmental quality and the humidity index were -0.593 and 0.524, respectively. Climate conditions and human activities have led to different combinations of heat and humidity changes in the eco-environmental quality of the Aral Sea Basin. However, human activities had a greater impact. The ARSEI can quantitatively and intuitively reflect the scale and causes of large-scale and long-time period changes of the eco-environmental quality in arid areas; it is very suitable for the study of the eco-environmental quality in arid areas.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Densification Through Capon-Based SAR Reprocessing for Sentinel-1 TOPS Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several researchers have shown that the Capon algorithm can be applied to reprocess SAR images, resulting in super-resolution reconstructed scenes with lower sidelobe levels. Thus by employing the Capon-based reprocessed images in Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), the persistent scatterer (PS) density can be increased. In this letter, we exploit the Capon-based PS densification method for Sentinel-1 (S-1)Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans(TOPS) data. We propose a revised robust approach of the Capon algorithm, which applies the automatic diagonal loading (DL) method when the condition number of the covariance matrix is big enough. The proposed approach is robust and can avoid spurious persistent scatterer candidate (PSC) points introduced by DL approaches. We also consider and analyze the spectral property caused by the scanning mode of TOPS in the reprocessing. We applied the revised-robust-Capon-based reprocessing algorithm to a stack of real-life S-1 data and selected PSCs from them. The final result shows that the number of PSs increases by approximately 30% with respect to the original stack.

TI  - Detection of urban LULC changes and its effect on soil organic carbon stocks: A case study of Beni Mellal City (Morocco)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing population and economic development in Beni Mellal City (Morocco) caused rapid urbanization leading to the loss of fertile agricultural lands. So, the present study aimed to identify changes in the land use/land cover (LULC) and their potential effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Beni Mellal City. Geospatial techniques and CA-Markov model were employed to evaluate and to predict LULC patterns based on Landsat images for the years 1985, 2000, and 2018. Forty samples of topsoil taken at all LULC classes have been analyzed to provide SOC contents and soil texture. The LULC results revealed that arboriculture and forest lands mainly tend to be more resistant to degradation, while the estimated built-up surface changes of 10% and 15% of the total study area during, respectively, 1985-2018 and 2050 are being done to the detriment of arable and bare lands. The mean SOC stocks under all land use were about 42.29-278.54 kg m(-2) by 2018, and varied following the order: forest > arable fields > barren land > arboriculture. This indicated that land use and management and consequently the vegetation types impacted the SOC distribution characteristics in the topsoil in the studied area. The urbanization linked to population growth and economic development also had a significant impact on the LULC change and tended to reduce the agricultural field surface and, implicitly, the SOC sequestration. The information from this study could be used by environmentalists and decision makers for better land use planning

TI  - Prediction of aboveground biomass and dry-matter content in <i>brachiaria</i> pastures by combining meteorological data and satellite imagery
T2  - GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) data are important for profitable and sustainable pasture management. In this study, we hypothesized that vegetation indexes (VIs) obtained through analysis of moderate spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and meteorological data can accurately predict the AGB of Brachiaria (syn. Urochloa) pastures in Brazil. We used AGB field data obtained from pastures between 2015 and 2019 in four distinct regions of Brazil to evaluate (i) the relationship between three different VIs-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI)-and meteorological data with pasture aboveground fresh biomass (AFB), aboveground dry biomass (ADB) and dry-matter content (DMC); and (ii) the performance of simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) algorithms for the prediction of pasture AGB based on VIs obtained through satellite imagery combined with meteorological data. The results highlight a strong correlation (r) between VIs and AGB, particularly NDVI (r = 0.52 to 0.84). The MLR and RF algorithms demonstrated high potential to predict AFB (R-2 = 0.76 to 0.85) and DMC (R-2 = 0.78 to 0.85). We conclude that both MLR and RF algorithms improved the biomass prediction accuracy using satellite imagery combined with meteorological data to determine AFB and DMC, and can be used for Brachiaria (syn. Urochloa) AGB prediction. Additional research on tropical grasses is needed to evaluate different VIs to improve the accuracy of ADB prediction, thereby supporting pasture management in Brazil.

TI  - Spatio-temporal monitoring of soil and plant indicators under forage cactus cultivation by geoprocessing in Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to characterize the spectral responses of soil and plant indicators utilizing the SoilAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) in areas under the cultivation of ?Orelha de Elefante Mexicana? forage cactus (Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw.) and ?Mi?da? (Nopalea cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck) in Brazilian semi-arid region and to establish a model for characterizing vegetation cover in crop production areas. The research was conducted in Brazilian semi-arid region, which had two areas under the cultivation of forage cactus in the period from 2017 to 2020. Soil physical attributes and plant morphometric variables were recorded, concomitantly the determination of SAVI and LAI, from images from the Sentinel-2 satellite. The recorded data were submitted to principal component analysis. The cumulative total variance of the principal components showed satisfactory results for both areas. There was a correlation between plant height, the number of cladodes, and vegetation indices, selected to compose the predictive variables of the multiple regression model. It is recommended to use images from the Sentinel-2 satellite in small areas, given its lower spatial resolution in capturing different spectral responses.

TI  - Supporting habitat conservation with automated change detection in Google Earth Engine
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant limitation in biodiversity conservation has been the effective implementation of laws and regulations that protect species' habitats from degradation. Flexible, efficient, and effective monitoring and enforcement methods are needed to help conservation policies realize their full benefit. As remote sensing data become more numerous and accessible, they can be used to identify and quantify land-cover changes and habitat loss. However, these data remain underused for systematic conservation monitoring in part because of a lack of simple tools. We adapted 2 algorithms that automatically identify differences between pairs of images. We used free, publicly available satellite data to evaluate their ability to rapidly detect land-cover changes in a variety of land-cover types. We compared algorithm predictions with ground-truthed results at 100 sites of known change in the United States. We also compared algorithm predictions to manually created polygons delineating anthropogenic change in 4 case studies involving imperiled species' habitat: oil and gas development in the range of the Greater Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus); sand mining operations in the range of the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus); loss of Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) coastal habitat after Hurricane Michael (2018); and residential development in St. Andrew beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus peninsularis) habitat. Both algorithms effectively discriminated between pixels corresponding to land-cover change and unchanged pixels as indicated by area under a receiver operating characteristic curve >0.90. The algorithm that was most effective differed among the case-study habitat types, and both effectively delineated habitat loss as indicated by low omission (min. = 0.0) and commission (min. = 0.0) rates, and moderate polygon overlap (max. = 47%). Our results showed how these algorithms can be used to help close the implementation gap of monitoring and enforcement in biodiversity conservation. We provide a free online tool that can be used to run these analyses (https://conservationist.io/habitatpatrol).

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma in elderly patients: preliminary results in a Latin-American population
T2  - ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In melanoma, lymph node status constitutes the most important prognostic factor among patients with locoregional disease. It has been postulated that elderly patients present less metastatic involvement in sentinel lymph node (SLN). Our objective was to analyse the results and evolution of patients >= 70 years-old with cutaneous melanoma in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was carried out.Methods: Retrospective analysis of 194 patients with primary CM who had a SLNB between 2005 and 2020 was included. Demographic and tumour data, SLN status, recurrence rate, morbidity and evolution were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to age: Group 1 (<70 years old) and Group 2 (>= 70 years old).Results: One hundred and fifty patients were included in Group 1 and 44 patients in Group 2. Median Breslow thickness was 1.7 mm in Group 1 and of 2 mm in Group 2 (p = 0.015).Forty-seven patients had positive SLNB; 38 (25%) belonged to Group 1 and 9 (20.5%) to Group 2 (p = 0.55). Recurrence was found in 34 patients: 25 belonging to Group 1 and 9 corresponding to Group 2 (p = 0.65). Morbidity was of 4% in Group 1 and 9% in Group 2 (p = 0.23). With an average follow-up of 30.6 months, 5-year overall survival was of 87% in Group 1 and of 63% in Group 2 (p = 0.04).Conclusion: Advanced age was not associated with differences regarding positivity of SLN and recurrence but difference in overall survival was observed. According to our results and the low morbidity rate, we consider SLNB should not be omitted in such age group, since it improves staging and gives the possibility to evaluate adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Operative and Oncological Outcomes Comparing Sentinel Node Mapping and Systematic Lymphadenectomy in Endometrial Cancer Staging: Meta-Analysis With Trial Sequential Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the utility of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLN) in endometrial cancer (EC) patients in comparison with lymphadenectomy (LND).MethodsComprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, OVID, Web of science databases, and three clinical trials registration websites, from the database inception to September 2020. The primary outcomes covered operative outcomes, nodal assessment, and oncological outcomes. Software Revman 5.3 was used. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were performed.ResultsOverall, 5,820 EC patients from 15 studies were pooled in the meta-analysis: SLN group (N = 2,152, 37.0%), LND group (N = 3,668, 63.0%). In meta-analysis of blood loss, SLN offered advantage over LND in reducing operation bleeding (I-2 = 74%, P<0.01). Z-curve of blood loss crossed trial sequential monitoring boundaries though did not reach TSA sample size. There was no difference between SLN and LND in intra-operative complications (I-2 = 7%, P = 0.12). SLN was superior to LND in detecting positive pelvic nodes (P-LN) (I-2 = 36%, P<0.001), even in high risk patients (I-2 = 36%, P = 0.001). While no difference was observed in detection of positive para-aortic nodes (PA-LN) (I-2 = 47%, P = 0.76), even in high risk patients (I-2 = 62%, P = 0.34). Analysis showed no difference between two groups in the number of resected pelvic nodes (I-2 = 99%, P = 0.26). SLN was not associated with a statistically significant overall survival (I-2 = 79%, P = 0.94). There was no difference in progression-free survival between SLN and LND (I-2 = 52%, P = 0.31). No difference was observed in recurrence. Based on the GRADE assessment, we considered the quality of current evidence to be moderate for P-LN biopsy, low for items like blood loss, PA-LN positive.ConclusionThe present meta-analysis underlines that SLN is capable of reducing blood loss during operation in regardless of surgical approach with firm evidence from TSA. SLN mapping is more targeted for less node dissection and more detection of positive lymph nodes even in high risk patients with conclusive evidence from TSA. Utility of SLN yields no survival detriment in EC patients.

TI  - Spin reorientation in antiferromagnetic Dy<sub>2</sub>FeCoO<sub>6</sub>double perovskite
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
M3  - Article
AB  - We explored the electronic and magnetic properties of the lanthanide double perovskite Dy(2)FeCoO(6)by combining magnetization, Raman and Mossbauer spectroscopy and neutron diffraction along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our magnetization measurements revealed two magnetic phase transitions in Dy2FeCoO6. First, a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition atT(N)= 248 K and subsequently, a spin reorientation transition atT(SR)= 86 K. In addition, a field-induced magnetic phase transition with a critical field ofH(c)approximate to 20 kOe is seen at 2 K. Neutron diffraction data suggested cation-disordered orthorhombic structure for Dy(2)FeCoO(6)inPnmaspace group which is supported by Raman scattering results. The magnetic structures ascertained through representational analysis indicate that atT(N), a paramagnetic state is transformed to Gamma(5)(Cx,Fy,Az) antiferromagnetic structure while, atT(SR), Fe/Co moments undergo a spin reorientation to Gamma(3)(Gx,Ay,Fz). The refined magnetic moment of (Fe/Co) is 1.47(4)mu(B)at 7 K. The antiferromagnetic structure found experimentally is supported through the DFT calculations which predict an insulating electronic state in Dy2FeCoO6.

TI  - Contralateral Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in a Patient with Relapsed Breast Cancer: Locoregional Event or Distant Metastasis Disease?
T2  - ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Contralateral axillary lymph node metastasis (CAM) is a rare clinical condition in patients with breast cancer. It can be explained from hematogenous spread from the original primary tumor (stage IV) to aberrant regional lymphatic drainage to the contralateral axilla. However, according to the current clinical guidelines, regardless of its origin, CAM is considered as metastatic disease. Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman presented with relapsed right breast cancer; lymphoscintigraphy showed only one sentinel lymph node (SLN) in the contralateral axilla (left region). Twenty-four hours later, the patient underwent upper internal quadrantectomy and bilateral selective lymph node biopsy. The final pathological analysis revealed one contralateral macrometastasis (>4 mm) in one left SLN. Subsequently, second-level left lymphadenectomy was performed. Currently the patient is being treated with chemotherapy, with appropriate clinical response. Discussion: Our patient was considered to be node-positive rather than having metastatic disease since the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated contralateral lymphatic drainage. Through preoperative scan in patients with relapsed breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes and CAM, it is possible to identify those cases that would benefit from therapy with curative intention.

TI  - Relevance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early endometrial cancer: A series of 249 cases
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the impact of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy on adjuvant therapy, recurrence and survival in early endometrial cancer (EC).Study design: We retrospectively included all patients who underwent SLN biopsy for EC between February 2007 and March 2018.Results: Of the 249 EC patients included, the overall SLN detection rate was 91 %. SLNs were positive in 36 (14.4 %) cases. Nine of the 13 preoperative low-risk patients with positive SLNs were re-operated and 22 presented positive non-SLNs. No second surgery was required for the 10 patients upstaged to intermediate risk after negative SLN biopsy. Nine of the 11 preoperative intermediate-risk patients with positive SLNs were re-operated and 33 % presented positive non-SLNs. Eleven of the 24 preoperative high-risk patients with negative SLNs were re-operated and 27 % presented positive non-SLNs. For the whole population, 3-year overall survival was 99 % (CI 95 % (97-1)) and 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 92 % (CI 95 % (0.87-0.95)).Conclusion: Our study supports the feasibility of the SLN procedure for assessing risk recurrence in patients with early-stage EC. SLN biopsy should lead to major reductions in secondary staging and better adaptation of adjuvant therapy. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spectral characterization, radiative forcing and pigment content of coastal Antarctic snow algae: approaches to spectrally discriminate red and green communities and their impact on snowmelt
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we present radiative forcing (RF) estimates by snow algae in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region from multi-year measurements of solar radiation and ground-based hyperspectral characterization of red and green snow algae collected during a brief field expedition in austral summer 2018. Our analysis includes pigment content from samples at three bloom sites. Algal biomass in the snow and albedo reduction are well-correlated across the visible spectrum. Relative to clean snow, visibly green patches reduce snow albedo by similar to 40 % and red patches by similar to 20 %. However, red communities absorb considerably more light per milligram of pigment compared to green communities, particularly in green wavelengths. Based on our study results, it should be possible to differentiate red and green algae using Sentinel-2 bands in blue, green and red wavelengths. Instantaneous RF averages were double for green (180 W m(-2)) vs. red communities (88 W m(-2)), with a maximum of 228 W m(-2). Based on multi-year solar radiation measurements at Palmer Station, this translated to a mean daily RF of similar to 26 W m(-2) (green) and similar to 13 W m(-2) (red) during peak growing season - on par with midlatitude dust attributions capable of advancing snowmelt. This results in similar to 2522 m(3) of snow melted by green-colored algae and similar to 1218 m(3) of snow melted by red-colored algae annually over the summer, suggesting snow algae play a significant role in snowmelt in the AP regions where they occur. We suggest impacts of RF by snow algae on snowmelt be accounted for in future estimates of Antarctic ice-free expansion in the AP region.

TI  - Land use/land cover (LU/LC) change dynamics using indices overlay method in Gautam Buddha Nagar District-India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed to analyze the dynamics of land use/ land cover (LU/LC) change in a newly created special economic zone, Gautam Buddha Nagar district during 2003-2015. The Landsat satellite data has been used to map the LU/LC pattern of 2003 and 2015 of the study area, using indices overlay method. Consequently, the indices overlay have been created using three land-use indices, i.e. modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI), and then the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) has been used for the LU/LC classification. The result illustrates that the built-up area (419.35%) and open land (388.36%) have increased during 2003-2015 while the cropland (- 34.38%), scrubland (- 73.25%), and water bodies (- 58.37%) have declined. Further, northern parts of the district have experienced maximum change in the LU/LC while the southern parts have experienced comparatively low change. The study also reveals that the increase in the built-up area occurred mostly at the cost of cropland and scrubland. The statistical analysis shows that the EBBI and SAVI have high relationships with LU/LC while the MNDWI has a comparatively low relationship. The study concludes that cropland and scrubland are the main LU/LC types that get transformed due into the built-up area the study area and the SAVI, MNDWI, and EBBI are the good indicators in the study of LU/LC classification and change analysis.

TI  - Coupling InSAR and numerical modeling for characterizing landslide movements under complex loads in urbanized hillslopes
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides, as a representative geohazard in fault zones, threaten the safety of buildings and infrastructure. Landslide movements are often subject to multiple loads in urbanized hillslopes from both natural and human activity. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) has been used to measure landslide movements. Used independently, InSAR can measure only surface deformation, and the points are sparse. Numerical modeling can simulate the full-scale movements, but it requires a prior knowledge of soil properties that are often not available in practice. To address these limitations, we proposed to couple InSAR and numerical modeling for characterizing landslide movements under multiple loads. We used 60 ascending and 56 descending Sentinel-1 images to measure surface movements in urbanized Daguan County Town. Of 31 landslides in the inventory map, 24 were successfully identified. The InSAR results assisted in determining the optimal soil properties through back-analysis. We used geological, geotechnical, and meteorological data to set three boundary conditions, that is, body loads, precipitation-induced hydraulic conditions, and construction-induced forces. Landslide mobility was demonstrated more distinctly using the coupled analysis. The numerical results revealed that body loads dominated the cumulative downslope movements by squeezing water and air from voids, and precipitation caused seasonal movements with the direction perpendicular to the slope surface. Construction works caused permanent changes (accelerating and decelerating) in time-series trends. Coupling InSAR and numerical modeling can facilitate analysis of the effects of complex loads and potentially predict future deformation. The method developed can be extended to study other urbanized landslide areas for early warning and risk mitigation.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Assessment and Prediction of Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity Using Multiple Linear Regression Techniques Over Ahmedabad City, Gujarat
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study intends to understand the variability in land surface temperature and urban heat island over Ahmedabad city, Gujarat, from 2003 to 2018 using MODIS thermal data. The spatio-temporal variability of land surface temperature dynamics is understood by pixel to pixel linear regression analysis along with Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests. A Gaussian fitting technique is employed to estimate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) signature with respect to the surrounding rural area. An overall increase in the surface urban heat island magnitude is profoundly visible during the winter season. The spatial extent of SUHI shows a uniform distribution of urban heat inside the city and its accumulation within a high dense central urban area in both summer and winter seasons. A multiple linear regression method is used to predict the SUHI magnitude in the next 16 years, i.e. in 2034, based on enhanced vegetation index, white sky albedo, and evapotranspiration as predicting variables considering two different scenarios presuming the present rate of change of predicting variables as first scenario and a double changing rate as compared to present rate in the second scenario.

TI  - A two-step approach for detecting Striga in a complex agroecological system using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on weed occurrence within croplands is vital but is often unavailable to support weeding practices and improve cropland productivity assessments. To date, few studies have been conducted to estimate and map weed abundances within agroecological systems from spaceborne images over wide-area landscapes, particularly for the genus Striga. Therefore, this study attempts to increase the detection capacity of Striga at subpixel size using spaceborne high-resolution imagery. In this study, a two-step classification approach was used to detect Striga (Striga hermonthica) weed occurrence within croplands in Rongo, Kenya. Firstly, multidate and multiyear Sentinel-2 (S2) data (2017 to 2018) were utilized to map cropland and non-cropland areas using the random forest algorithm within the Google Earth Engine. The non-cropland class was thereafter masked out from a single date S2 image of the 13th of December 2017. The remaining cropland area was then used in a subpixel multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to detect Striga occurrence and infestation using endmembers (EMs) obtained from the in-situ hyperspectral data. The gathered in-situ hyperspectral data were resampled to the spectral waveband configurations of S2 and three representative EMs were inferred, namely: (1) Striga, (2) crop and other weeds, and (3) soil. Overall classification accuracies of 88% and 78% for the pixel-based cropland mapping and subpixel Striga detection were achieved, respectively. Furthermore, an F-score (0.84) and a root mean square error (0.0075) showed that the MESMA subpixel algorithm provides plausible results for predicting the relative abundance of Striga within each S2 pixel at a landscape scale. The capability of MESMA together with a cropland classification hierarchical approach was thus proven to be suited for Striga detection in a heterogenous agroecological system. These results can be used to guide in the adaptation, mitigation, and remediation of already infested areas, thereby avoiding further Striga infestation of new croplands. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Explainable identification and mapping of trees using UAV RGB image and deep learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and mapping of trees via remotely sensed data for application in forest management is an active area of research. Previously proposed methods using airborne and hyperspectral sensors can identify tree species with high accuracy but are costly and are thus unsuitable for small-scale forest managers. In this work, we constructed a machine vision system for tree identification and mapping using Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this system, we first calculated the slope from the three-dimensional model obtained by the UAV, and segmented the UAV RGB photograph of the forest into several tree crown objects automatically using colour and three-dimensional information and the slope model, and lastly applied object-based CNN classification for each crown image. This system succeeded in classifying seven tree classes, including several tree species with more than 90% accuracy. The guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) showed that the CNN classified trees according to their shapes and leaf contrasts, which enhances the potential of the system for classifying individual trees with similar colours in a cost-effective manner-a useful feature for forest management.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a concentrations in 82 large alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during 2003-2017: temporal-spatial variations and influencing factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As essential parts of the unique ecosystem of Tibetan Plateau (TP), the sizes and associated physical properties of alpine lakes have long been investigated. However, little is known about one of the most critical biogeochemical properties, i.e. the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Here, for the first time, we presented a comprehensive investigation of the temporal-spatial variations in Chl-a in 82 lakes (>50 km(2)) across the entire TP region, based on MODIS observations in the period of 2003-2017. The results showed that the 82 lakes exhibited an average long-term mean Chl-a of 3.3 +/- 4.3 mg m(-3), with high Chl-a lakes concentrated in the eastern and southern inner TP basin and northeastern parts of the TP. An interannual trend analysis revealed that lakes exhibiting (significantly) decreasing Chl-a trends and (significantly) increasing Chl-a trends were comparable in numbers but differed in distribution patterns. A correlation analysis indicated that at least 70% of the interannual variability in Chl-a values of lakes was significantly correlated with one of the four environmental factors (wind speed, ice cover duration, lake water surface temperature and surface runoff) and lake size. In addition, glacier meltwater tended to reduce lake Chl-a while salinity levels showed minor influences.

TI  - Secondary school students' experiences of presence in daily classroom practice
T2  - CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents findings from a qualitative study among 50 secondary school students from 10 schools in the Netherlands, aiming to understand how they experience 'presence' - being fully (with one's entire being) engaged in the here-and-now - in class. Although presence was a non-regular experience, students experienced it as personally relevant for a broadened worldview and becoming more confident and autonomous in their thinking and acting. Using a phenomenological approach, the authors found three general themes, as well as many variations and nuances within them, in students' experiences of presence, related to the subject matter, interaction and students' self. The similarities found in the situational contexts in which presence occurred - meaningfulness, student participation, responsivity and otherness - can inform teaching. Implications for teaching in order to realise such a situational context are discussed.

TI  - Optimal feature selection for SAR image classification using biogeography-based optimization (BBO), artificial bee colony (ABC) and support vector machine (SVM): a combined approach of optimization and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is one of the most important applications of POLSAR images. In this paper, a hybrid biogeography-based optimization support vector machine (HBBOSVM) has been introduced to classify POLSAR images of RADARSAT 2 in band C acquired from San Francisco, USA. The main purpose of this classification is to minimize the number of features and maximize classification accuracy. The proposed method consists of three main steps: preprocessing, feature selection and classification. As preprocessing, radiometric calibration, speckle reduction and feature extraction have been performed. In the proposed HBBO, the combination of onlooker bee of artificial bee colony (ABC) and migration operator of biogeography-based optimization has been applied in order to optimal feature selection. Then, SVM has been used to classify the pixels into specific labels of land-covers. The ground truth samples have been generated by google earth image, Pauli RGB image, high resolution image and national land cover database (NLCD 2006). The performance of HBBOSVM has been compared with BBOSVM, ABCSVM, particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSOSVM) and the results of previous studies. In addition, the performance of HBBO is evaluated upon 20 well-known benchmark problems. According to the obtained results, the overall accuracy and average accuracy of HBBOSVM are 96.01% and 93.37% respectively which is the best result in comparison with other results. The HBBOSVM has better performance than other algorithms in terms of overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, average accuracy, convergence trend, and stability. In addition, the HBBO can be considered as a successful meta-heuristic for benchmark problems. This paper displays that the combined approach of optimization and machine learning methods provides powerful results.

TI  - An encryption-decryption framework to validating single-particle imaging
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an encryption-decryption framework for validating diffraction intensity volumes reconstructed using single-particle imaging (SPI) with X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) when the ground truth volume is absent. This conceptual framework exploits each reconstructed volumes' ability to decipher latent variables (e.g. orientations) of unseen sentinel diffraction patterns. Using this framework, we quantify novel measures of orientation disconcurrence, inconsistency, and disagreement between the decryptions by two independently reconstructed volumes. We also study how these measures can be used to define data sufficiency and its relation to spatial resolution, and the practical consequences of focusing XFEL pulses to smaller foci. This conceptual framework overcomes critical ambiguities in using Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) as a validation measure for SPI. Finally, we show how this encryption-decryption framework naturally leads to an information-theoretic reformulation of the resolving power of XFEL-SPI, which we hope will lead to principled frameworks for experiment and instrument design.

TI  - Integrating mechanistic models and climate change projections to predict invasion of the mussel, <i>Mytilopsis sallei</i>, along the southern China coast
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Species invasion is an important cause of global biodiversity decline and is often mediated by shifts in environmental conditions such as climate change. To investigate this relationship, a mechanistic Dynamic Energy Budget model (DEB) approach was used to predict how climate change may affect spread of the invasive mussel Mytilopsis sallei, by predicting variation in the total reproductive output of the mussel under different scenarios. To achieve this, the DEB model was forced with present-day satellite data of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and SST under two warming RCP scenarios and decreasing current Chl-a levels, to predict future responses. Under both warming scenarios, the DEB model predicted the reproductive output of M. sallei would enhance range extension of the mussel, especially in regions south of the Yangtze River when future declines in Chl-a were reduced by less than 10%, whereas egg production was inhibited when Chl-a decreased by 20-30%. The decrease in SST in the Yangtze River may, however, be a natural barrier to the northward expansion of M. sallei, with colder temperatures resulting in a strong decrease in egg production. Although the invasion path of M. sallei may be inhibited northwards by the Yangtze River, larger geographic regions south of the Yangtze River run the risk of invasion, with subsequent negative impacts on aquaculture through competition for food with farmed bivalves and damaging aquaculture facilities. Using a DEB model approach to characterise the life history traits ofM. sallei, therefore, revealed the importance of food availability and temperature on the reproductive output of this mussel and allowed evaluation of the invasion risk for specific regions. DEB is, therefore, a powerful predictive tool for risk management of already established invasive populations and to identify regions with a high potential invasion risk. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study proposed a novel approach to investigate variability in the acoustic behavior of a number of deciduous tree-dominated narrow and long urban parks in Isfahan city, central Iran, between winter leaf fall and summer foliage. Noise levels (L-q30 in dB) were measured along two adjacent sides of the parks: along the road-adjacent side (Ro transect) and the relatively calmer river-adjacent side of the parks (Ri transect) during 4-17 January 2018 and 7-14 August 2019. Using Sentinel-2 images, two NDVI maps were also produced for these two periods to determine how changes in green biomass were associated with changes in noise levels. Using ANOVA, a significant difference was found in Ri-L-q30 and NDVI maps between winter and summer (p = 0.0), while the difference was insignificant for Ri-L-q30 (p = 0.1). We also developed two multiple linear regressions, one for each season, to assess the dependency of Ri-L-q30 to the intensity of vegetation and Ro-L-q30 and compare the two seasons by performing a t test analysis on the intercept and slope of the models, with results suggesting there is a significant difference in the association of green biomass and noise levels measured inside the parks between leaf fall and foliage time (p = 0.04). Our results indicated the temporal variability of park characteristics in providing calmer urban landscapes throughout the year.

TI  - Evaluating the suitability of urban development land with a Geodetector
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring the suitability of urban development land is essential for delineating spatial growth boundaries and urban spatial layouts. However, the significant impact of subjective uncertainty on the suitability evaluation process significantly reduces the reliability of the evaluation results. Thus, in this study, we developed a new method to address this issue and improve the accuracy of the evaluation results. Zhengzhou in China was considered as the research area and the data utilized were obtained from the following primary sources: Landsat TM/ETM/OLI image data, land use data, digital elevation model data, spatial primary geographical data, and digital map data. A new method for evaluating the suitability of urban development land was developed by combining logistic regression, principal component analysis, kriging interpolation, K-means, and the Geodetector method to evaluate and classify the suitability of urban development land in Zhengzhou City during 2013. By using logistic regression, we could accurately evaluate the effects of a single factor, thereby avoiding subjective assessments. The principal component can be used to reduce the dimensions of the evaluation results for a single factor where the weight of the principal component is determined by using the cumulative contribution rate in order to obtain the comprehensive evaluation result. Kriging interpolation can be used to predict the evaluation results for the grid surface by using the principal component to comprehensively evaluate the sample points. K means can be used to automatically classify the evaluation results for the grid surface. Geodetector was used to detect the spatial differentiation of the results in order to confirm the validity of the spatial partition results. These methods can avoid interference due to human factors and yield more objective and accurate evaluation results. The results indicated that the proposed evaluation method can avoid the subjective influence of the evaluation index classification and the determination of the index weight to obtain extremely accurate evaluations and high effectiveness. The suitability grading and evaluation values were highly consistent with the spatial pattern, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the evaluation results. The method and evaluation results may provide a scientific reference to support decisions regarding land resource allocation during urban development.

TI  - Comparison of Landsat OLI, ASTER, and Sentinel 2A data in lithological mapping : A Case study of Rich area (Central High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern part of the Rich area consists of the massive Paleozoic and Meso-Cenozoic cover formations that present the geodynamic development of the study area, where is characterized by various carbonate facies of Jurassic age. The geographical characteristic of the study area leaves the zone difficult to map by conventional methods. The objective of this work focuses on the mapping of the constituent lithological units of the study area using multispectral data of Landsat OLI, ASTER, and Sentinel 2A MSI. The processing of these data is based on a precise methodology that distinguishs and highlights the limits of the different lithological units that have an approximate similarity of spectral signature. Three techniques were used to enhance the image including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Lithological mapping was performed using two types of supervised classification : Maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).The results of processing data show the effectiveness of Sentinel 2A data in mapping of lithological units than the ASTER and Landsat OLI data. The classification evaluation of two methods of the Sentinel 2A MSI image showed that the SVM method give a better classification with an overall accuracy of 93,93% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.93, while the MLC method present an overall accuracy of 82,86% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.80. The results of mapping obtained show a good correlation with the geological map of the study area as well as the efficiency of remote sensing in identification of different lithological units in the Central High Atlas.

TI  - National-scale assessment of decadal river migration at critical bridge infrastructure in the Philippines
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River migration represents a geomorphic hazard at sites of critical bridge infrastructure, particularly in rivers where migration rates are high, as in the tropics. In the Philippines, where exposure to flooding and geomorphic risk are considerable, the recent expansion of infrastructural developments warrants quantification of river migration in the vicinity of bridge assets. We analysed publicly available bridge inventory data from the Philippines Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to complete multi-temporal geospatial analysis using three decades worth of Landsat satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE). For 74 large bridges, we calculated similarity coefficients and quantified changes in width for the active river channel (defined as the wetted channel and unvegetated alluvial deposits) over decadal and engineering (30-year) timescales. Monitoring revealed the diversity of river planform adjustment at bridges in the Philippines (including channel migration, contraction, expansion and avulsion). The mean Jaccard index over decadal (0.65) and engineering (0.50) timescales indicated considerable planform adjustment throughout the national-scale inventory. However, planform adjustment and morphological behaviour varied between bridges. For bridges with substantial planform adjustment, maximum active channel contraction and expansion was equal to 25% of the active channel width over decadal timescales. This magnitude of lateral adjustment is sufficient to imply the need for bridge design to accommodate channel dynamism. For other bridges, the planform remained stable and changes in channel width were limited. Fundamental differences in channel characteristics and morphological behaviours emerged between different valley confinement settings, and between rivers with different channel patterns, indicating the importance of the local geomorphic setting. We recommend satellite remote sensing as a low-cost approach to monitor river planform adjustment with large-scale planimetric changes detectable in Landsat products; these approaches can be applied to other critical infrastructure adjacent to rivers (e.g. road, rail, pipelines) and extended elsewhere to other dynamic riverine settings.

TI  - In vivo sentinel lymph node identification using fluorescent tracer imaging in colon cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The use of fluorescence might improve the performance of the sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with colon cancer. This systematic review was conducted to gain insight in the performance and applicability of the sentinel lymph node procedure using fluorescence. Method: A systematic literature search was performed. Databases were searched for prospective studies concerning sentinel node identification using fluorescence in colon cancer. Detection rate, accuracy rate and sensitivity of the sentinel lymph node procedure were calculated for early stage (T1-T2) and more invasive (T3 T4) tumours. Results: Analyses of five included studies showed for respectively T3-T4 and T1-T2 tumours a detection rate of 90 % and 91 %, an accuracy rate of 77 % and 98 %, and a sensitivity of 30 % and 80 %. Conclusion: The sentinel lymph node procedure using fluorescence in early stage (T1-T2) colon cancer seems to be promising. Larger cohorts are necessary to confirm these results.

TI  - Satellite-based radiative forcing by light-absorbing particles in snow across the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is the most reflective natural surface on Earth and consequently plays an important role in Earth's climate. Light-absorbing particles (LAPs) deposited on the snow surface can effectively decrease snow albedo, resulting in positive radiative forcing. In this study, we used remote-sensing data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model to quantify the reduction in snow albedo due to LAPs before validating and correcting the data against in situ observations. We then incorporated these corrected albedo-reduction data in the Santa Barbara DISORT (Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer) Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model to estimate Northern Hemisphere radiative forcing except for midlatitude mountains in December-May for the period 2003-2018. Our analysis reveals an average corrected reduction in snow albedo (Delta(LAPs)(alpha MODIS,corrected)) of similar to 0.021 under all-sky conditions, with daily radiative forcing (RFMODIS,dailyLAPs) values of similar to 2.9 W m(-2), over land areas with complete or near-complete snow cover and with little or no vegetation above the snow in the Northern Hemisphere. We also observed significant spatial variations in Delta(LAPs)(alpha MODIS,corrected) and RFMODIS,dailyLAPs, with the lowest respective values (similar to 0.016 and similar to 2.6 W m(-2)) occurring in the Arctic and the highest (similar to 0.11 and similar to 12 W m(-2)) in northeastern China. From MODIS retrievals, we determined that the LAP content of snow accounts for 84 % and 70 % of the spatial variability in albedo reduction and radiative forcing, respectively. We also compared retrieved radiative forcing values with those of earlier studies, including local-scale observations, remote- sensing retrievals, and model-based estimates. Ultimately, estimates of radiative forcing based on satellite-retrieved data are shown to represent true conditions on both regional and global scales.

TI  - An ensemble deep learning based shoreline segmentation approach (WaterNet) from Landsat 8 OLI images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shorelines constantly vary due to natural, urbanization and anthropogenic effects such as global warming, population growth, and environmental pollution. Sustainable monitoring of coastal changes is vital in terms of coastal resource management, environmental preservation and planning. Publicly available Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Manager) images provide accurate, reliable, temporal and up-to-date information about coastal areas. Recently, the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become widespread. In this study, we used our public Landsat 8 OLI satellite image dataset to create a majority voting method which is an ensemble automatic shoreline segmentation system (WaterNet) to obtain shorelines automatically. For this purpose, different deep learning architectures have been utilized namely as Standard U-Net, Dilated U-Net, Fractal U-Net, FC-DenseNet, and Pix2Pix. Also, we have suggested a novel framework to create labeling data from OpenStreetMap service to create a unique dataset called YTU-WaterNet. According to the results, IoU and Fl scores have been calculated as 99.59% and 99.79% for the WaterNet. The results indicate that the WaterNet method outperforms other methods in terms of shoreline extraction from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Monitoring surface deformation of deep salt mining in Vauvert (France), combining InSAR and leveling data for multi-source inversion
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt mining industrial exploitation located in Vauvert (France) has been injecting water at high pressure into wells to dissolve salt layers at depth. The extracted brine has been used in the chemical industry for more than 30 years, inducing a subsidence of the surface. Yearly leveling surveys have monitored the deformation since 1996. This dataset is supplemented by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and since 2015, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data have also continuously measured the deformation. New wells are regularly drilled to carry on with the exploitation of the salt layer, maintaining the subsidence. We make use of this careful monitoring by inverting the geodetic data to constrain a model of deformation. As InSAR and leveling are characterized by different strengths (spatial and temporal coverage for InSAR, accuracy for leveling) and weaknesses (various biases for InSAR, notably atmospheric, very limited spatial and temporal coverage for leveling), we choose to combine SAR images with leveling data, to produce a 3-D velocity field of the deformation. To do so, we develop a two-step methodology which consists first of estimating the 3-D velocity from images in ascending and descending acquisition of Sentinel 1 between 2015 and 2017 and second of applying a weighted regression kriging to improve the vertical component of the velocity in the areas where leveling data are available. GNSS data are used to control the resulting velocity field. We design four analytical models of increasing complexity. We invert the combined geodetic dataset to estimate the parameters of each model. The optimal model is made of 21 planes of dislocation with fixed position and geometry. The results of the inversion highlight two behaviors of the salt layer: a major collapse of the salt layer beneath the extracting wells and a salt flow from the deepest and most external zones towards the center of the exploitation.

TI  - Lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer - achieving more with less?
T2  - MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Review
AB  - The lymph node status of patients with endometrial cancer is known to be a crucial determinant for the prognosis of the disease. It also provides the indication for further adjuvant treatment. The staging of endometrial cancer by surgery has been a controversial issue for more than 30 years. The significant complication rate after lymphadenectomy and the development of minimally invasive surgery have led to the use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. In the present review, we present the development of surgical staging procedures in patients with endometrial cancer and summarize the recently expanding body of published literature on the subject. SLN mapping is a safe and accurate technique, especially when indocyanine green is used as a tracer. SLN mapping appears to reduce complication rates as well as costs without affecting the oncologic outcome. Large prospective studies are needed to establish the effects of SLN mapping on the outcome of disease, especially in high-risk patients with endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the need for additional systematic lymphadenectomy prior to adjuvant radio-chemotherapy in patients diagnosed with isolated lymph node metastasis during SLN biopsy must be investigated further. This might pave the way for a new surgical approach in patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Thorstein Veblen on economic man: toward a new method of describing human nature, society, and history
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The fact that Veblen was a keen critic of the neo-classical concept of "economic man" is well known. However, the following issues have not been discussed in enough depth: how he rebuilt the traditional theory of human nature through his new methodology of economics, how much his methodological revision broadened the scope of economics, and what kind of phenomena Veblen's economic theory elucidates. This article examines these issues and aims to show the logical connection between Veblen's controversial proposal on the methodology of economics and his analysis of economic phenomena. Specifically, it reconsiders Veblen's analysis of economic action using a unique concept of instincts, his logic of explaining the relation between society and human nature, his way of drawing history from the relativistic worldview, and his characteristic method of grasping the cause and effect of economic phenomena. Finally, it highlights the importance of modifying the concept of "economic man" by focusing on the qualitative aspect. Particular reference is made to the economic concepts of utility, efficiency, and intangibility.

TI  - Predicting the surface urban heat island intensity of future urban green space development using a multi-scenario simulation
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and morphology of urban green space (UGS) have a significant impact on its ability to mitigate surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII). In this study, the Future Land Use Simulation model was used to predict land use in Xuchang City by 2030 under three different scenarios. Landsat Operational Land Imager images from 2014 were used to calculate SUHII. And, the relationships and regression models between summer SUHII and land use data were analyzed and developed. The SUHII in 2030 based on simulated land use was predicted using regression models in 2014. Results showed that reductions in SUHII were greater under present land use scenario with a greater proportion of UGS. Furthermore, the degree of aggregation, average patch area, maximum patch shape index, and complexity of the green space also impacted the effectiveness of SUHII mitigation. In future land use scenarios with different constraints, the ecological service function guided scenario was the most effective at mitigating SUHII. These findings provide a reference for the reasonable allocation of urban land and the optimization of UGS in terms of SUHII reduction in small-and medium-sized cities where there is a need for expansion.

TI  - Population exposure across central India to PM<sub>2.5</sub> derived using remotely sensed products in a three-stage statistical model
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface PM2.5 concentrations are required for exposure assessment studies. Remotely sensed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been used to derive PM2.5 where ground data is unavailable. However, two key challenges in estimating surface PM2.5 from AOD using statistical models are (i) Satellite data gaps, and (ii) spatio-temporal variability in AOD-PM2.5 relationships. In this study, we estimated spatially continuous (0.03 degrees x 0.03 degrees) daily surface PM2.5 concentrations using MAIAC AOD over Madhya Pradesh (MP), central India for 2018 and 2019, and validated our results against surface measurements. Daily MAIAC AOD gaps were filled using MERRA-2 AOD. Imputed AOD together with MERRA-2 meteorology and land use information were then used to develop a linear mixed effect (LME) model. Finally, a geographically weighted regression was developed using the LME output to capture spatial variability in AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Final Cross-Validation (CV) correlation coefficient, r(2), between modelled and observed PM2.5 varied from 0.359 to 0.689 while the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) varied from 15.83 to 35.85 mu g m(-3), over the entire study region during the study period. Strong seasonality was observed with winter seasons (2018 and 2019) PM2.5 concentration (mean value 82.54 mu g m(-3)) being the highest and monsoon seasons being the lowest (mean value of 32.10 mu g m(-3)). Our results show that MP had a mean PM2.5 concentration of 58.19 mu g m(-3) and 56.32 mu g m(-3) for 2018 and 2019, respectively, which likely caused total premature deaths of 0.106 million (0.086, 0.128) at the 95% confidence interval including 0.056 million (0.045, 0.067) deaths due to Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), 0.037 million (0.031, 0.045) due to strokes, 0.012 million (0.009, 0.014) due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and 1.2 thousand (1.0, 1.5) due to lung cancer (LNC) during this period.

TI  - Estimating hourly full-coverage PM<sub>2.5</sub> over China based on TOA reflectance data from the Fengyun-4A satellite
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to retrieve hourly ground-level PM2.5 on a national scale in China due to the sparse site measurements and the limited coverage of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite observations. The new geo-stationary meteorological satellite of China, Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), provides a unique opportunity to fill this gap. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was applied to retrieve hourly PM2.5 of China directly from FY-4A Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data. A one-year PM2.5 retrieval shows a strong agreement to ground-based measurements, with the averaged R-2 approaching 0.92, while the RMSE was only 10.0 mg/m(3). An analysis of the regional differences of the performance and the dependency on satellite Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) show that sparse measurements, high VZA, and solar zenith angle (SZA) are the primary sources of the uncertainty. The use of the FY-4A improved 17% spatial coverage compared to the Himawari-8-based PM2.5 retrievals, enabling full-coverage, hourly PM2.5 monitoring over China, and potentially could improve PM2.5 predictions from air quality models after data assimilation.

TI  - Layer detection algorithm for CALIPSO observation based on automatic segmentation with a minimum cost function
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - CALIPSO (cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observation) provides unique opportunities for profiling global cloud and aerosol. It is crucial to accurately detect the boundaries of cloud and aerosol layers from CALIPSO observation because the detecting error will be passed to further retrieval. Considered superior to other layer detection methods, the threshold method is the core of the selective iterated boundary location (SIBYL) algorithm developed for producing the CALIPSO official products. However, the threshold method can miss many tenuous layers, and the use of the slope method to refine the layer base in SIBYL leads to considerable uncertainty due to its high sensitivity to noise. This study proposed a new layer detection algorithm based on an automatic segmentation method with a minimum cost function. Results show that the new algorithm determines 21% and 13% more layers than SIBYL at 1 km and 1-5 km resolution, respectively, which indicates that the new algorithm has higher detection efficiency. Moreover, the layers detected by the new algorithm are 170 m thicker than that detected by SIBYL on average, which indicates that the SIBYL misses layer edges where the signal to noise ratio is low. The new algorithm can improve the accuracy and resolution of the layer products of CALIPSO as well as other space-based lidars. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nationwide urban ground deformation monitoring in Japan using Sentinel-1 LiCSAR products and LiCSBAS
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence in urban areas is a significant problem because it increases flood risk, damages buildings and infrastructure, and results in economic loss. Continual monitoring of ground deformation is important for early detection, mechanism understanding, countermeasure implementation, and deformation prediction. The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation has globally and freely provided frequent and abundant SAR data and enabled nationwide deformation monitoring through InSAR time series analysis. LiCSAR, an automatic Sentinel-1 interferometric processing system, has produced abundant interferograms with global coverage, and the products are freely accessible and downloadable through a web portal. LiCSBAS, an open source InSAR time series analysis package integrated with LiCSAR, enables users to obtain the deformation time series easily and quickly. In this study, spatially and temporally detailed deformation time series and velocities from the LiCSAR products using LiCSBAS for 73 major urban areas in Japan during 2014-2020 were derived. All LiCSBAS processing was automatically performed using predefined parameters. Many deformation signals with various temporal and spatial features, such as linear subsidence in Hirosaki, Kujyukuri, Niigata, and Kanazawa, episodic subsidence in Sanjo, annual vertical fluctuation in Hirosaki, Yamagata, Yonezawa, Ojiya, and Nogi, and linear uplift in Chofu were detected. Unknown small nonlinear uplift signals were found in Nara and Osaka in 2018. Complex postseismic deformations from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake were also revealed. All the deformation data obtained in this study are available on an open repository and are expected to be used for further research, investigation, or interpretation. This nationwide monitoring approach using the LiCSAR products and LiCSBAS is easy to implement and applicable to other areas worldwide.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing availability of satellite data of high temporal resolution, a more robust classifier is needed which can exploit the temporal information along with the spectral information of the remote sensing images. Specific fuzzy-based and learning-based algorithms are two broad categories and have the potential to perform well in spectral-temporal domain. In the present study, for mapping paddy fields as a specific class two classification algorithms, viz. fuzzy-based modified possibilistic c-mean (MPCM) algorithm and learning-based 1D-convolutional neural networks (CNN), were tested using Sentinel-2A/2B temporal data. The overall accuracy for learning-based 1D-CNN and fuzzy-based MPCM classifiers was found to be 96% and 93%, respectively. The F-measure values were found to be 0.95 and 0.92 for 1D-CNN- and MPCM-based classifier, respectively. Thus, it can be inferred from this study that the 1D-CNN classifier performed better than the traditional fuzzy-based classifier and can handle heterogeneity within class.

TI  - Ecological effects analysis of <i>Spartina</i> <i>alterniflora</i> invasion within Yellow River delta using long time series remote sensing imagery
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora has caused serious ecological problems in the coastal zone of mainland China. We used Landsat and HJ-1 satellite remote sensing images covering the Yellow River delta from 1989 to 2018 to quantitatively evaluate and understand the ecological effects of S. alterniflora invasion in the estuary delta. The remote sensing spectral indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI); the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) model; and the effective intertidal zone sedimentation width (EISW) analysis model were applied to these images. The effects on coastal protection, the impact on local vegetation ecosystems and the contribution to the greenhouse effect of S. alterniflora were studied. The main results showed that: (1) S. alterniflora invasion slows coastal erosion but, to achieve coastal stabilization, its distribution width needs to be greater than 700 m; (2) S. alterniflora invasion has caused serious degradation of local ecosystems. Among these, the area of Phragmites communis and Suaeda salsa decreased by more than 50%, and the seagrass bed ecosystem was seriously degraded; and (3) S. alterniflora invasion weakens the carbon storage capacity of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River delta, and intensifies the release of methane, reducing the ability of coastal vegetation wetlands to resist global warming.

TI  - Modelling the spatiotemporal patterns of urban sprawl in Ibadan metropolis between 1984 and 2013 in Nigeria
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl is typically associated with negative environmental, economic, and socio-psychological consequences arising from distorted or improperly managed planning regulations. Addressing the challenges, most especially in developing countries with high birth rate, high net migration and unregulated land use policies require an understanding of the urban sprawl status of not only cities but also smaller admininstrative units (LGA, counties etc.) components of cities. Satellite imageries and geographic information systems (GIS), coupled with existing rule-based algorithms offer a unique and a rapid way of assessing urban sprawl dynamics. This study not only identified the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/landcover change but also morphologically characterised urban sprawl at metropolitan and LGA units in the Ibadan metropolis using Landsat imagery of 1984, 2000, 2008 and 2013.The LAC, LAR, SDI, SEI and LPI indicators of urban sprawl were computed for the urban built-up patch for each year. The annual rate of urban expansion was 1284.73 ha, while the population grew at 55,513 per annum between 1984 and 2013. Hence, the city grew rapidly between 1984 and 2000, however, the rate of growth has slowed down drastically since 2000. Also, leapfrog and edge developments type of sprawl were decreasing, while infilling was increasing, although at a slower rate in the metropolis. Increases in salaries, increasing transportation cost, dispersed activity space and desire to live closer to workplaces are some of the factors responsible for the increasing compact city development. Urban compactness rather than sprawl will most likely continue beyond 2013 based on the results of the Markov Chain analysis. Remotely sensed imageries are suitable for the assessment of not only urban growth but also morphological pattern of urban sprawl at metropolitan and LGA units.

TI  - A difficult-to-diagnose fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma of the breast: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma (FLMCa), classified as a metaplastic carcinoma of the breast, is a very rare type of metaplastic carcinoma. We report a case of FLMCa that was difficult to diagnose. Case presentation The patient was a 56-year-old postmenopausal woman who presented with a left-sided breast mass. A 1.3-cm irregular mass was found in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast on breast ultrasonography. She underwent core needle biopsy and vacuum-assisted biopsy, but the pathological findings only revealed inflammatory cell infiltration and a high level of fibrosis, with no malignant findings. At 3 months follow-up, she underwent a repeat breast ultrasonography, which revealed an increase in the size of the mass to 1.8 cm, and a repeat core needle biopsy, which showed a few spindle cells and squamous cells positive for cytokeratin (CK)5/6 and AE1/AE3, leading to the suspicion of FLMCa. Since the amount of tissue was insufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis, she underwent a lumpectomy. We found low-grade and slightly atypical spindle cells and partly atypical spindle cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. CK5/6 and alpha-SMA were positive, thus confirming FLMCa. Because the margins on the edge of the nipple side and anterior side were "ink on tumor", she underwent a mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. After the surgery, she received adjuvant chemotherapy. At 3 years and 8 months of follow-up, no recurrent or metastatic lesions were identified in her body. Conclusions FLMCa should be considered in the differential diagnosis when collagenous fibers are proliferating and malignancy is clinically suspected. Immunohistochemical analysis may be helpful in confirming this diagnosis.

TI  - Energy balance and irrigation performance assessments in lemon orchards by applying the SAFER algorithm to Landsat 8 images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semiarid conditions of the Sa similar to o Francisco River Basin, Brazil, irrigated fruit crops are replacing natural vegetation, being lemon highlighted by incentives for the national and international markets. This paper aimed to support the rational water management of lemon orchards under different irrigation systems under these conditions. We present a methodology based on the use of the visible and near infrared images from Landsat 8 (L8) satellite together with weather and actual yield data (Y-a), to assess the energy balance components and irrigation performance indicators (IPI) by applying the SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) in six commercial farms under different irrigation systems inside the basin in the northern Minas Gerais state, Southeast Brazil. The ET rates averaged 2.7 mm d(-1), 2.9 mm d(-1), and 3.7 mm d(-1), for drip, micro sprinkler, and pivot irrigated orchards, respectively. The evaporative fraction (latent heat flux by the available energy) reached above 1.00 for localized irrigation (drip and micro sprinkler), and 1.30 for pivots, during the lemon phenological stages from fruit growth to harvest peaks. Pivot irrigation systems were not recommended under the semi-arid conditions, due to large water direct evaporated from the soil and air close to the surface. For drip and micro sprinkler irrigated orchards, crop coefficient curves were modeled based on the accumulated degree-days (DDac) to estimate lemon crop water requirements. Drip irrigated orchards presented better water productivity levels being recommended together with deficit irrigation strategies which could allow good lemon yields with saving water savings. The most important findings of the current research are that the SAFER algorithm can be applied to estimate crop ET with satellite images without the thermal bands which together with modelled Ya data, irrigation assessments can be carried out at high spatial resolution following the principles of precision agriculture. For replication of the methods in other regions, simple calibrations of the modelling equations can be performed to infer the specific environmental conditions.

TI  - Renewable energy from biomass surplus resource: potential of power generation from rice straw in Vietnam
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass, one of the renewable resources, is expected to play an important role in the world's energy future. In Asia, rice straw is an abundant agricultural surplus because rice is one of the leading staple food crops in the region. Often, rice straw is burned directly in the field via uncontrolled combustion methods that emit large amounts of short-lived air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants. In Vietnam, the energy and environment protection sectors are facing great challenges because of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. A national strategic choice is to exploit renewable energy, including biomass-derived energy, to achieve energy security and CO2 emission reduction. This study investigates the potential of rice straw as an energy source for power plants at a local scale in Vietnam using data derived from satellite Sentinel-1 images. The results show that Vietnam can produce 2,565 MW from rice straw, for which 24 out of 63 provinces have a potential capacity higher than 30 MW, and the Kien Giang province has the highest capacity (245 MW). The study also analyses limitations and obstacles overcoming which can promote the biomass energy sector in the country.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of typical temperate glaciers in China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's temperate glaciers have a relatively warm and humid climate and hydrothermal conditions at low latitudes. Temperate glaciers, however, have larger ablation, higher ice temperatures, relatively fast movement speeds, and a significant sliding process at the bottom. As a result, these glaciers are more significantly affected by climate change. On the basis of topographic maps, aerial photography, and Landsat OLI images, and combined with existing research results, this paper systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of typical temperate glaciers. The results are as follows: (1) From the 1950s to the 1970s, compared with other types of glaciers, temperate glaciers showed strong retreat and ablation trends in terms of area, length, speed, and mass balance. (2) The reduction rates of glacier areas of Kangri Garpo, Dagu Snow Mountain, Yulong Snow Mountain (YSM), and Meili Snow Mountain (MSM) in China's temperate glacier areas all exceeded 38%, which was far above the national average of 18% from the 1950s to the 2010s. (3) The recent length retreat rates of Azha Glacier, Kangri Garpo, and Mingyong Glacier, MSM, Hailuogou Glacier (HG), Gongga Snow Mountain (GSM), and Baishui River Glacier No. 1 (BRGN1), YSM were above 22 m/a, which was faster than the retreat rates of other regions. (4) Consistent with glacier retreat, temperate glaciers also had a faster ice flow speed. The ice flow velocities of the BGN1, HG, Parlung River Glaciers No. 4 and 94, and Nyainqentanglha were, respectively, 6.33-30.78 m/a, 41-205 m/a, 15.1-86.3 m/a, and 7.5-18.4 m/a, which was much faster than the velocity of other types of glaciers. (5) Mass loss of temperate glaciers was most dramatic during the observation period (1959-2015). The annual mass balance from eight typical temperate glaciers fluctuated between-2.48 and 0.44 m w.e., and the annual average change rate of mass balance (-0.037 m w.e./a) was much higher than that in China (-0.015 m w.e./a, p<0.0001) and globally (-0.013 m w.e./a, p<0.0001).

TI  - Characterization of ice shelf fracture features using ICESat-2-A case study over the Amery Ice Shelf
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractures are important structural features that affect the stress condition and stability of ice shelves. Previous studies have mainly focused on the measurement of fractures in the horizontal dimension. However, the vertical morphology of fractures could also be potentially important in determining their evolution and role in ice shelf stability. In this regard, the dense and high-resolution surface elevation measurements collected by the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provide an excellent opportunity for studying fractures in the vertical dimension over a regional scale. Here we developed an object-oriented algorithm to automatically detect and characterize fracture features (including rifts, surface fractures, and the surface expressions of basal fractures) from ICESat-2 data. We successfully applied the algorithm to ICESat-2 L3A Land Ice Height (ATL06) data over the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, and retrieved the vertical structural information of two major fracture fields. The detected fracture features match well with the visible fracture lines in Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and the edges of fracture features are well-captured from the ATL06 data. We analyzed the fracture patterns in terms of surface depth, width, vertical shape, length, and orientation. We found that the fracture feature depth is a key factor determining the formation of new fractures and the spatial pattern of depth is closely related to rift formation. We anticipate that further application of the object-oriented method over other ice shelves will produce important insights regarding fracture formation and ice shelf vulnerability by combining ICESat-2-derived vertical information with the horizontal structure retrieved from satellite imagery.

TI  - The potential risk of contralateral non-sentinel groin node metastasis in women with early primary vulvar cancer following unilateral sentinel node metastasis: a single center evaluation in University Hospital of Dusseldorf
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since the introduction of sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) in unifocal vulvar cancer (diameter of < 4 cm) and unsuspicious groin lymph nodes, the morbidity rate of patients has significantly decreased globally. In contrast to SLNB, bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) has been associated with increased risk of common morbidities. Current guidelines (NCCN, ESGO, RCOG, and German) recommend that in cases of unilaterally positive sentinel lymph node (SLN), bilateral IFL should be performed. However, two recent publications by Woelber et al. and Nica et al. contradict the current guideline, since a significant rate of positive non sentinel lymph nodes in IFL contralaterally was not observed [Woelber et al. 0% (p = 0/28) and Nica et al. 5.3% (p = 1/19)].Methods: A retrospective single-center analysis conducted in the University Hospital of Dusseldorf, evaluating vulvar cancer patients treated with SLNB from 2002 to 2018.Results: 22.2% of women (n = 4/18) were found to have contralateral IFL groin metastasis after an initial diagnosis of unilateral SLN metastasis. The depth of tumor infiltrating cells correlated significantly and positively with the rate of incidence of groin metastasis (p = 0.0038).Conclusion: Current guideline for bilateral IFL should remain as the standard management. Therefore, this depth may be taken into account as an indication for bilateral IFL. The management of VC and SLNB should be performed in a high volume center with an experienced team in marking SLN and performing the adequate surgical procedure. Well conducted counseling of the patients outlining advantages but also potential oncological risks of this technique especially concerning rate of groin recurrence is critical.

TI  - Evaluating the sensitivity of vegetation and water indices to monitor drought for three Mediterranean crops
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding drought effects on vegetative health for crop producing locations, such as the Seferihisar-Kavakdere region in western Turkey, is vital for water and crop management. This study used Landsat-derived spectral vegetation indices, specifically normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI) to evaluate and compare their performance and sensitivity for three major crops (citrus, grape, and olive) under dry (2008), wet (2010), and normal (2015) climatic conditions. Results showed that all three crops were affected by drought despite two (citrus and grape) being irrigated. However, grape and olive were more affected by drought than citrus. Drought conditions were exacerbated during September and October because of lack of precipitation and because irrigation is not a common practice during these months in this region. Therefore, this study aimed to use and compare drought sensitivities of Landsat-derived spectral vegetation indices. All studied indices were closely related (.48 <= R-2 <= .98) for citrus, grape, and olive. The EVI and LSWI were greater than NDVI when NDVI values were greater than 0.65 for citrus, and LSWI values were larger than NDVI when NDVI values were greater than 0.6 for grape and olive during the wet year. The results showed that different vegetation indices are needed to detect drought from one crop to another under different climatic conditions. Our findings indicate that the irrigation applications in 2008 (drought year) were not sufficient to alleviate the severe drought stress experienced throughout the winter and growing seasons.

TI  - Assessing human interactions and sustainability of Wetlands in Jammu, India using Geospatial technique
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide it has been observed that wetlands are facing severe threats due to ever-increasing anthropogenic activities. Therefore, this study is aimed to examine the threat and criticalities faced by the wetlands in different physiographic regions of Jammu Division. The study encompassing all the selected wetlands ecosystem aspects including limnology, eutrophication, biodiversity, and land use/land cover (LU/LC), so as to frame an ecologically balanced conservation strategy for the aquatic ecosystem of the region. The Landsat data has been used for LU/LC classification of the selected wetlands and finally change detection technique was used to quantify the changes. Evaluation of LU/LC revealed that all the selected wetlands are under stress due to diverse anthropogenic pressure. Except for Sanasar the two other wetlands under study showed human encroachment. Maximum encroachment was noticed around Gharana wetland (about 5 hectares area) and water body decreased by 02 hectares during the period 2008-2018. For threat assessment of the wetlands parameters such as biodiversity, the area under water bodies, Eutrophication and water quality were taken into consideration. The result showed that water quality was badly affected in terms of nitrogen and dissolved oxygen which could a cause for the sustainability of aquatic flora and fauna. Gharana wetland was found most threatened whereas Mansar, moderately and Sanasar the least threatened wetland. Further, the analysis shows that the impact of anthropogenic activities on wetlands decreases with an increase in altitude. All possible factors causing threats to wetlands have been discussed to formulate proper management strategies to conserve the wetlands.

TI  - Detection and characterization of agroforestry systems in the Colombian Andes using sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Colombian Andes, agroforestry is a traditional form of agriculture, characterized by a heterogeneous and often diversified composition of trees and crops. This form of land use provides important ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, reduction of soil erosion and the maintenance of biodiversity by providing a structural complex habitat. Satellite remote sensing is widely used for studying land use patterns and forest cover, however the discrimination between agroforestry systems and forests is still a challenge, especially in heterogeneous landscapes and in rough terrain. Here, we aim to advance the remote sensing of agroforestry systems using field measurements of vegetation structure in combination with Sentinel-2 images. We use spectral and textural variables derived from Sentinel-2 imagery to predict above ground biomass (AGB), leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure (CC). The relationship between predicted and observed values obtained from Random Forest regression models showed good fits: for AGB with an R-2 = 0.92 and relative RMSE = 34%; for LAI with an R-2 = 0.91 and relative RMSE = 19%; and for CC an R-2 = 0.89 and relative RMSE = 9%. This allowed us to map these important ecosystem variables at landscape scale and establish empirical thresholds, with which a discrimination of agroforestry systems from forests was possible with an accuracy of 94%. Our results suggest that the relationship between vegetation structure and the spectral information obtained by Sentinel-2 can contribute to the detection and characterization of agroforestry systems and thus help quantifying the ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation potential provided by this type of tropical agriculture.

TI  - Establishment of sentinel surveillance of human clinical campylobacteriosis in Ireland
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was the establishment of a national laboratory sentinel surveillance service for human clinical Campylobacter in Ireland. This included detailed genomic molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter for 2019. For February-December 2019, 24 clinical microbiology laboratories in Ireland submitted all PCR/culture-positive clinical Campylobacter spp. specimens to Public Health Laboratory (PHL) Dublin one week out of every four. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria was carried out for Campylobacter spp. isolates for ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and erythromycin. Batch whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on cultures and analysis was performed to determine species, genotype, identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence determinants and identify clusters. A total of 75 isolates and 366 PCR-positive stools were received, and 277 isolates recovered (55.7% recovery from stools). Of 257 isolates characterized by WGS, 86.4% (n = 222) were Campylobacter jejuni, 11.7% (n = 30) Campylobacter coli and 1.9% (n = 5) Campylobacter lari. There were 20 clonal complexes with ST-21 clonal complex most prevalent at 26.8% (n = 69). 50.5% (n = 140) of isolates were susceptible to all three antimicrobials tested. 39.3% (n = 109) isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant, 26.3% (n = 73) tetracycline resistant and two isolates erythromycin resistant. Congruence between phenotypic and genotypic AST was observed. There was 95.9% and 95.6% sensitivity and specificity for WGS to predict ciprofloxacin sensitivity and 98.6% and 99.5% sensitivity and specificity for WGS to predict tetracycline sensitivity. Virulence factors flaA, racR, ciaB and cdtB were detected in all isolates. WGS identified 31 potential clusters for public health alert. This sentinel surveillance of human campylobacteriosis in Ireland establishes the basis for a national reference service. Linking with other partners in a 'One Health' framework will help us better understand sources of infection to reduce disease burden and the threat of AMR.

TI  - Evaluation of classical swine fever E2 (CSF-E2) subunit vaccine efficacy in the prevention of virus transmission and impact of maternal derived antibody interference in field farm applications
T2  - PORCINE HEALTH MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Classical swine fever (CSF) is one of the most devastating pig diseases that affect the swine industry worldwide. Besides stamping out policy for eradication, immunization with vaccines of live attenuated CSF or the CSF-E2 subunit is an efficacious measure of disease control. However, after decades of efforts, it is still hard to eliminate CSF from endemically affected regions and reemerging areas. Most of previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of different CSF vaccines in laboratories under high containment conditions, which may not represent the practical performance in field farms. The inadequate vaccine efficacy induced by unrestrained factors may lead to chronic or persistent CSF infection in animals that develop a major source for virus shedding among pig populations. In this study, a vaccination-challenge-cohabitation trial on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs and long-term monitoring of conventional sows and their offspring were used to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of maternally derived antibody (MDA) interference on CSF vaccines in farm applications.Results: The trials demonstrated higher neutralizing antibody (NA) titers with no clinical symptoms and significant pathological changes in the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine immunized group after CSFV challenge. Additionally, none of the sentinel pigs were infected during cohabitation indicating that the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine could provoke adequately acquired immunity to prevent horizontal transmission. In field farm applications, sows immunized with CSF-E2 subunit vaccine revealed an average of higher and consistent antibody level with significant reduction of CSF viral RNA detection via saliva monitoring in contrast to those of live attenuated CSF vaccine immunized sows possessing diverse antibody titer distributions and higher viral loads. Furthermore, early application of the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine in 3-week-old piglets illustrated no MDA interference on primary immunization and could elicit consistent and long-lasting adequate antibody response suggesting the flexibility of CSF-E2 subunit vaccine on vaccination program determination.Conclusions: The CSF-E2 subunit vaccine demonstrated significant efficacy and no MDA interference for immunization in both pregnant sows and piglets. These advantages provide a novel approach to avoid possible virus shedding in sow population and MDA interference in piglets for control of CSF in field farm applications.

TI  - Preliminary report of a catastrophic landslide that occurred in Gokseong County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea, on August 7, 2020
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a catastrophic landslide occurred in Gokseong County, South Korea, on August 7, 2020. Torrential rain, with a cumulative rainfall of more than 250 mm for the preceding 3 days, contributed as a trigger or a primer to an initiation of slope failure and ensuing evolution to a debris flow. The runout length, area, and volume of the Gokseong landslide are estimated to be approximately 678 m, 4.63 x 10(4) m(2), and 2-5 x 10(4) m(3), respectively. This Gokseong landslide, with its long runout, has caused severe damage to the village located downstream with a total of five fatalities and five buried houses. This study not only reports the damaged area, rainfall characteristics, and triggering factors but also presents the terrain changes obtained through a field survey using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) conducted 5 days after the event and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Monitoring sick leave data for early detection of influenza outbreaks
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWorkplace absenteeism increases significantly during influenza epidemics. Sick leave records may facilitate more timely detection of influenza outbreaks, as trends in increased sick leave may precede alerts issued by sentinel surveillance systems by days or weeks. Sick leave data have not been comprehensively evaluated in comparison to traditional surveillance methods. The aim of this paper is to study the performance and the feasibility of using a detection system based on sick leave data to detect influenza outbreaks.MethodsSick leave records were extracted from private French health insurance data, covering on average 209,932 companies per year across a wide range of sizes and sectors. We used linear regression to estimate the weekly number of new sick leave spells between 2016 and 2017 in 12 French regions, adjusting for trend, seasonality and worker leaves on historical data from 2010 to 2015. Outbreaks were detected using a 95%-prediction interval. This method was compared to results from the French Sentinelles network, a gold-standard primary care surveillance system currently in place.ResultsUsing sick leave data, we detected 92% of reported influenza outbreaks between 2016 and 2017, on average 5.88weeks prior to outbreak peaks. Compared to the existing Sentinelles model, our method had high sensitivity (89%) and positive predictive value (86%), and detected outbreaks on average 2.5weeks earlier.ConclusionSick leave surveillance could be a sensitive, specific and timely tool for detection of influenza outbreaks.

TI  - Associations between mortality from COVID-19 in two Italian regions and outdoor air pollution as assessed through tropospheric nitrogen dioxide
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - After the appearance of COVID-19 in China last December 2019, Italy was the first European country to be severely affected by the outbreak. The first diagnosis in Italy was on February 20, 2020, followed by the establishment of a light and a tight lockdown on February 23 and onMarch 8, 2020, respectively. The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the 'Padan Plain' area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel-5P satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus Earth Observation Programme before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, 2020. Using amultivariable negative binomial regressionmodel, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality. Although ecological data provide only weak evidence, these findings indicate an association between air pollution levels and COVID-19 severity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed fire datasets across the southwestern Mediterranean Basin
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, many remote-sensing datasets providing features of individual fire events from gridded global burned area products have been released. Although very promising, these datasets still lack a quantitative estimate of their accuracy with respect to historical ground-based fire datasets. Here, we compared three state-of-the-art remote-sensing datasets (RSDs; Fire Atlas, FRY, and GlobFire) with a harmonized ground-based dataset (GBD) compiled by fire agencies monitoring systems across the southwestern Mediterranean Basin (2005-2015). We assessed the agreement between the RSDs and the GBD with respect to both burned area (BA) and number of fires (NF). RSDs and the GBD were aggregated at monthly and 0.25 degrees resolutions, considering different individual fire size thresholds ranging from 1 to 500 ha. Our results show that all datasets were highly correlated in terms of monthly BA and NF, but RSDs severely underestimated both (by 38 % and 96 %, respectively) when considering all fires > 1 ha. The agreement between RSDs and the GBD was strongly dependent on individual fire size and strengthened when increasing the fire size threshold, with fires > 100 ha denoting a higher correlation and much lower error (BA 10 %; NF 35 %). The agreement was also higher during the warm season (May to October) in particular across the regions with greater fire activity such as the northern Iberian Peninsula. The Fire Atlas displayed a slightly better performance with a lower relative error, although uncertainty in the gridded BA product largely outpaced uncertainties across the RSDs. Overall, our findings suggest a reasonable agreement between RSDs and the GBD for fires larger than 100 ha, but care is needed when examining smaller fires at regional scales.

TI  - Field evaluation of two mosquito traps in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne Diseases are a common but severe public health threat. However, there is a lack of consensus on the effect of different mosquito trapping devices in China. This study firstly compared the BGM trap with the CDC light trap, commonly used in Chinese mosquito surveillance. Field trials of traps' efficiency were conducted in Yiwu city, China, from May 21st, 2018 to November 31st, 2018. Sixty-five comparisons were completed in five different biotopes (an urban residential area, a rural residential area, a park, a hospital, and a pig shelter). Concerning the number of mosquitoes per trap, the BGM trap outperformed three out of five biotopes. In contrast, the CDC light trap only showed better performance in the pig shelter. For specific species, the BGM trap outperformed in capturing Ae. albopictus, while the CDC light trap caught significantly more Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Regarding Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens s.l. surveillance, the BGM trap is more suitable. The BGM trap shows significantly higher or similar efficiency than the CDC light trap in trapping common mosquito species in China, except in the pig shelter. Therefore, we recommend that Chinese researchers and public health practitioners use the BGM trap in future mosquito surveillance.

TI  - The response of mesospheric H<sub>2</sub>O and CO to solar irradiance variability in models and observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor (H2O) is the source of reactive hydrogen radicals in the middle atmosphere, whereas carbon monoxide (CO), being formed by CO2 photolysis, is suitable as a dynamical tracer. In the mesosphere, both H2O and CO are sensitive to solar irradiance (SI) variability because of their destruction/production by solar radiation. This enables us to analyze the solar signal in both models and observed data. Here, we evaluate the mesospheric H2O and CO response to solar irradiance variability using the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1) simulations and satellite observations. We analyzed the results of four CCMI models (CMAM, EMAC-L90MA, SOCOLv3, and CESM1-WACCM 3.5) operated in CCMI reference simulation REF-C1SD in specified dynamics mode, covering the period from 1984-2017. Multiple linear regression analyses show a pronounced and statistically robust response of H2O and CO to solar irradiance variability and to the annual and semiannual cycles. For periods with available satellite data, we compared the simulated solar signal against satellite observations, namely the GOZCARDS composite for 1992-2017 for H2O and Aura/MLS measurements for 2005-2017 for CO. The model results generally agree with observations and reproduce an expected negative and positive correlation for H2O and CO, respectively, with solar irradiance. However, the magnitude of the response and patterns of the solar signal varies among the considered models, indicating differences in the applied chemical reaction and dynamical schemes, including the representation of photolyzes. We suggest that there is no dominating thermospheric influence of solar irradiance in CO, as reported in previous studies, because the response to solar variability is comparable with observations in both low-top and high-top models. We stress the importance of this work for improving our understanding of the current ability and limitations of state-of-the-art models to simulate a solar signal in the chemistry and dynamics of the middle atmosphere.

TI  - False Negativity of Targeted Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) has been proposed as an alternative method for the staging of patients with node-positive breast cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, not much is known yet about the false-negative rate (FNR) of the method and the subsequent risk of underestimation of residual axillary disease. Methods: This study reviews published articles with calculations of false negativity of TAD and potential factors that may influence it. Results: The FNR of TAD is usually reported as being <10%, but this calculation is usually based on small study populations. Lower FNR is a common finding along with lower N status, while not enough data are available yet for greater axillary involvement. When a marked node is revealed to be a sentinel lymph node (SLN) at surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), this seems to be another factor that contributes to reliable TAD. With regard to the methods used to mark the positive node before chemotherapy and retrieval at surgery, there is no clear advantage of one over the other. The availability of relevant resources, the costs, and local legislation must all be taken into account for the selection of the optimal strategy. Conclusion: Although still in its early days, the FNR of TAD can be low, at least in patients with relatively little axillary involvement and when the marked node is the SLN. All reported methods of lymph node marking seem reliable.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports daily, monthly, and seasonal variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) using aerosol robotic network (AERONET), MICROTOPS-II Sunphotometer, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over three most polluted cities such as Kanpur, Varanasi, and Jaipur in the Indo-Gangetic Plain during 2011-2015. The monthly mean variations of AOD and Angstrom Exponent were also presented and compared with the meteorological parameters for all three cities. The concentrations of AODs in Kanpur and Varanasi were observed higher than in Jaipur throughout the study period. Overall maximum correlation (R-2 = 0.74) was found in between AERONET and MODIS AOD in the winter season over Kanpur during 2011-2015, whereas the lowest correlation (R-2 = 0.41) was found in between MICROTOPS-II Sunphotometer and MODIS AOD over Varanasi for the same period in the pre-monsoon season. Spectral variations of AODs at five different wavelengths, i.e., 380, 440, 500, 675, and 870 nm, were derived using AERONET for Jaipur and Kanpur and using MICROTOPS-II Sunphotometer for Varanasi during 2011-2015 inferred clearly that increasing wavelength provides decreasing AODs. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectories model was used for the backward trajectories analysis to assess the sources of large aerosol loadings over Jaipur, Kanpur, and Varanasi cities during some typical days.

TI  - Gully Erosion Mapping by Multi-criteria Decision Analysis Techniques and Geoinformatics in Adana Province, Turkey
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is one of the exogenetic processes which changes the curvature of the earth. The rate of gully erosion is high in the arid and semi-arid regions experiencing less amount of vegetation cover. Adana Province being one of the major provinces in the Mediterranean Sea Region due to the presence of fertile lands, agricultural activities, and densely populated areas. This research produces gully erosion susceptibility surfaces over the cukurova Plain in the Adana sub-region of Turkey. To estimate gully erosion susceptibility, various inputs such as land use map, lithology map slope map, and aspect map were used as gully erosion prediction factors. A classified 30-m spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagery and digital elevation models were used as the ancillary data inputs to provide the best results. The objective of this study is to find out the areas affected by gully erosion in the Adana Province of Turkey. For the purpose of analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis techniques have been applied. The vegetation of this proposed area is sparse which leads to the rapid erosion of soil and also most of the areas are associated with the badlands and gullies which are associated with steep slopes. This study reveals that the impact of gully erosion is high on the northern and north western sides of the provinces where the density of the drainage network is high. Those non-perennial small rivers create many small badlands in this area which leads to loss of fertile soil. This research is very helpful to take various planning strategies for the physical and social development of the study area where agricultural activities are dominant. The maps which are produced in this study will be helpful for the planners, decision makers to develop future planning strategies for the sustainable growth and development of this area. Therefore, the used methodology can be used to generate gully erosion susceptibility surfaces in other areas of the Mediterranean region of Turkey that have similar geographical conditions.

TI  - Does lunar synodic cycle affect the rates of psychiatric hospitalizations and sentinel events?
T2  - CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The lunar synodic cycle is often believed to be associated with psychiatric emergencies and exacerbation in various countries, including India. However, the scientific literature regarding this matter is inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between lunar cycle phase and admission rates plus occurrence of sentinel events in the psychiatric ward of a tertiary care general hospital in India. All admissions and transfer-ins (N = 780) to the Department of Psychiatry between August 1st, 2016 and July 31st, 2017 were evaluated from hospital records by a blinded author to obtain sentinel events, like requirement of physical restraint (PR) and chemical restraint (CR), occurring on full moon days (FM), new moon days (NM), and control days (CD). Statistical analysis was done by comparison of proportions. Significant positive differences were found when CR applied exclusively [p = .0008] on FM and NM days, and its frequency [p ] in comparison to CD. Frequencies of parenteral [p = .0001] and per oral [p = .0064] modes of CR applied on FM and NM days showed significant positive results when compared with CD. Use of all restraints (PR plus CR) [p = .0017] and their frequencies [p ] on FM and NM days were also positively significant. Sentinel events, such as use of restraints, especially chemical ones, in psychiatry in-patients are significantly more common during full moon and new moon phases.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continental glacier melts directly influence the environment, resulting in sea-level rise affecting the settlements along the coast. The increase in global warming and constant change in the glacier mass grabbed the attention of researchers in understanding the evolution and distribution of glaciers. Despite the increase in the number of glacier studies, the difficulty is experienced by the researchers in understanding the supra-glacial debris cover and its characteristics. Supraglacial debris cover affects surface melt by increasing and decreasing ablation under thin and thick debris cover. In the present study, estimation of supraglacial debris cover (SDC) over Austre Broggerbreen and Vestre Broggerbreen glaciers of Ny-Alesund is carried out with the aid of Landsat 5/7/8 datasets between 2000 and 2020. Supraglacial debris-cover is mapped using NDSI and band ratio techniques based on thresholding and it is estimated that Austre Broggerbreen and Vestre Broggerbreen glaciers are covered by 7.29% and 15.19% of SDC respectively. Results obtained are validated by a field visit to Arctic glacier, which is the first of its kind enhancing India's scientific credentials in Polar research.

AB  - This study attempts to understand the climatic resilience of two forest types of central India-that is, Tectona grandis (Teak) forest of Satpura Tiger Reserve and Shorea robusta (Sal) forest of Kanha Tiger Reserve-using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extracted from MODIS, and climate variable data sets at highest spatial and temporal scales. Teak and Sal forests within the core area of the selected tiger reserves represent the least anthropogenic disturbances, and therefore, the observed changes in NDVI and EVI over the past 16 years could be analyzed in the context of climate change. The correlation analysis between climatic variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, and total annual rainfall) and forest response indicators (NDVI/EVI) at seasonal and annual scales revealed that Teak and Sal forests are more sensitive to change in past temperature as compared with rainfall. Also, the changes in NDVI and EVI of Sal forest are correlated more to minimum temperature, and that of Teak forest to maximum temperature. The analysis of sapling girth class of Sal and Teak further revealed that Sal as compared with Teak is more affected because of the changing climate variables of the recent past. The findings of the study will help manage forests more efficiently in the context of changing climate.Study Implications: Currently, the silvicultural practice and forest management plan in India lack information on species' response to changing climatic variables. In this context, the study attempted to understand the resilience of two dominant forest types-Shorea robusta (Sal) and Tectona grandis (Teak)-of central India using high spatiotemporal data sets of vegetation indices and climatic data sets for the period between 2000 and 2015. The study was intentionally conducted in the core zones of two protected areas (Kanha Tiger Reserve and Satpura Tiger Reserve) with the known least human disturbances so that the changes in vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] and enhanced vegetation index [EVI]) of Teak and Sal forests could be attributed to changing climatic variables. The analysis concluded that the Sal and Teak species are more sensitive to change in temperature as compared with rainfall. Additionally, Sal is found to be more sensitive to minimum temperature, and Teak to maximum temperature. Such findings could contribute to developing site-/species-specific limate-resilient silvicultural strategies in the context of climate change.

TI  - Optimizing respiratory virus surveillance networks using uncertainty propagation
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious disease prevention, control and forecasting rely on sentinel observations; however, many locations lack the capacity for routine surveillance. Here we show that, by using data from multiple sites collectively, accurate estimation and forecasting of respiratory diseases for locations without surveillance is feasible. We develop a framework to optimize surveillance sites that suppresses uncertainty propagation in a networked disease transmission model. Using influenza outbreaks from 35 US states, the optimized system generates better near-term predictions than alternate systems designed using population and human mobility. We also find that monitoring regional population centers serves as a reasonable proxy for the optimized network and could direct surveillance for diseases with limited records. The proxy method is validated using model simulations for 3,108 US counties and historical data for two other respiratory pathogens - human metapneumovirus and seasonal coronavirus - from 35 US states and can be used to guide systemic allocation of surveillance efforts. Lack of a widespread surveillance network hampers accurate infectious disease forecasting. Here the authors provide a framework to optimize the selection of surveillance site locations and show that accurate forecasting of respiratory diseases for locations without surveillance is feasible.

TI  - Co-seismic deformation and slip distribution of 5 April 2017 Mashhad, Iran earthquake using InSAR sentinel-1A image: implication to source characterization and future seismogenesis
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed interferometric synthetic aperture radar sentinel-1A-based observations to characterize the source of 5 April 2017 Mashhad, Iran mainshock (Mw 6.1), for the first time to understand the seismogenic potential of the source area using the estimates of co-seismic displacement and slip distribution on applying the steepest descent method (SDM). SAR pixel offsets (SPO) provided a deep insight into the co-seismic surface deformation of the entire source zone. Based on iterations of a total of 451 models, our analysis of sentinel-1A data from ascending and descending tracks revealed surface deformation occurred in an area of 40 x 30 km with a maximum co-seismic uplift of 10 cm. We estimated geodetic moment of 1.9 x 10(20) Nm corresponding to the magnitude (Mw 6.0) of the Mashhad mainshock for which the rupture has a planner geometry with uniform slip dislocation in an elastic half-space with slip of 0.35 +/- 0.1 m; strike of N313 degrees E having dip of 48 degrees of the thrust fault associated with oblique motion. The rupture length of 45 +/- 3 km along-strike and 30 +/- 3 km down dip has been estimated. The best-fit fault model geometry derived from SDM suggests that rupture occurred in the vicinity of the Kashafrud thrust fault, located west to the main Kopeh-Dagh Fault with its strike of 315 degrees E. It is observed that a maximum slip of 0.35 m occurred at a depth of 8 km that extended to 10 km in the crust, which is found to be in unison to the Coulomb stress model that showed low-stressed zone is associated with the majority of events of lower magnitude (M <= 4.5) in NE-SW to the mainshock, whilst the EW zone to the mainshock found relatively highly stressed as a probable source for generating relatively higher magnitude earthquakes (M > 4.5) in the future. We infer that the estimates of co-seismic source attributes are essentially important for understanding the nature and extent of earthquake risks for Mashhad, Iran earthquake source area and of the areas of analogous geotectonic settings, elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Changing patterns in aerosol vertical distribution over South and East Asia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing patterns in aerosol concentrations over the Asian region is well documented with a concurrent increase over India and a marked reduction over China. However, aerosol vertical distribution in the changing climate is not fully understood. By combining long-term satellite observations from MODIS and CALIOP, here we show rapid changes in the aerosol vertical distribution over the South and East Asia covering India and China. A statistically significant decreasing (increasing) trend in the boundary layer (free troposphere) aerosol concentrations is noticed over India. ERA-Interim reanalysis model suggests that this increase in free tropospheric aerosol concentrations are due to the lifting of boundary layer pollutants through an increase in convection (and vertical velocity) in a changing climate. In contrast, a consistent decreasing trend is observed over China irrespective of the altitude. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in Aerosol Optical Depth is observed over the northwest India and we relate this to an observed increase in precipitation leading to increase in the vegetation. It is also found that long-term oscillations like QBO, ENSO and solar cycle significantly affect the aerosol concentrations. Thus, it is prudent to conclude that background meteorology and dynamics play an important role in changing patterns of aerosol vertical distribution.

TI  - Development of a small unmanned aircraft system to derive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of anthropogenic point sources
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A reduction of the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 (carbon dioxide) is necessary to stop or slow down man-made climate change. To verify mitigation strategies, a global monitoring system such as the envisaged European Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission (CO2M) is required. Those satellite data are going to be complemented and validated with airborne measurements. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based measurements can provide a cost-effective way to contribute to these activities. Here, we present the development of an sUAS (small unmanned aircraft system) to quantify the CO2 emissions of a nearby point source from its downwind mass flux without the need for any ancillary data. Specifically, CO2 is measured by an NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) detector, and the wind speed and direction are measured with a 2-D ultrasonic acoustic resonance anemometer. By means of laboratory measurements and an in-flight validation at the ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) atmospheric station Steinkimmen (STE) near Bremen, Germany, we estimate that the individual CO2 measurements have a precision of 3 ppm and that CO2 enhancements can be determined with an accuracy of 1.3 % or 0.9 ppm, whichever is larger. We introduce an anemometer calibration method to minimize the effect of rotor downwash on the wind measurements. This method derives the fit parameters of a linear calibration model accounting for scaling, rotation, and a potential constant bias. For this purpose, it analyzes wind measurements taken while following a suitable flight pattern and assuming stationary wind conditions. From the calibration and validation experiments, we estimate the single measurement precision of the horizontal wind speed to be 0.40 m s(-1) and the accuracy to be 0.33 m s(-1). By means of two flights downwind of the ExxonMobil natural gas processing facility in Grossenkneten about 40 km west of Bremen, Germany, we demonstrate how the measurements of elevated CO2 concentrations can be used to infer mass fluxes of atmospheric CO2 related to the emissions of the facility.

TI  - Assessing contamination from maritime trade and transportation on Iberian waters: Impact on <i>Platichthys flesus</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime trade and transportation of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) have been increasing in European waters, augmenting the risk of accidental spills from ships or in harbours. Despite their reported toxicity and hazardousness, information on HNS levels in the aquatic environment is still lacking. Therefore, an assessment combining a chemical and a multi-biomarker evaluation on HNS contamination was done in NW Iberian estuaries of Rivers Minho, Lima and Douro using Platichthys flesus (flounder). Of the twenty-five HNS measured, fifteen were found in flounder liver and muscle, and a few in sediments, though at generally low levels. Principal component analysis produced a clear distinction among sites, with Douro River estuary arising as the most impacted. Oxidised proteins and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) were the biomarkers contributing to site discrimination. Correlations between biomarkers and HNS levels provided important baseline information for the study area and potential biological effects of HNS on this sentinel species.

TI  - Effect of low-fat dairy products fortified with 1500IU nano encapsulated vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on cardiometabolic indicators in adults with abdominal obesity: a total blinded randomized controlled trial
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & aimsVitamin D deficiency is widespread worldwide. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a nano encapsulated form of vitamin D used for fortifying low-fat dairy products (milk and yogurt) on anthropometric indices, glycemic status, and lipid profile in subjects with abdominal obesity.MethodsIn a totally (quadruple) blinded, randomized, and parallel-controlled trial, 306 individuals with abdominal obesity were randomly allocated to one of four groups: fortified low-fat yogurt (FY, 1500 IU nano encapsulated vitamin D-3 per 150 g/d), non-fortified low-fat yogurt (nFY), fortified low-fat milk (FM, 1500 IU nano encapsulated vitamin D-3 per 200 g/d), non-fortified low-fat milk (nFM), for 10 weeks (nFM and nFY, were considered as the control groups). Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and after a ten-week trial in Mashhad, Iran.ResultsAfter the ten-week intervention, we found a significant increase in serum concentration of 25(OH)D in both the FM and FY groups compared to the respective control groups (19.10 +/- 5.69 ng/mL and 20.88 +/- 5.76 ng/mL respectively, p < .001). We observed a significant reduction in weight to hip ratio (p = .04) and a significant improvement in triglyceride (p < .001) and HDL-C (p = .01) only in FM group compared to nFM group. Also, we found a significant reduction in fasting serum insulin (p < .001), and a significant improvement of HOMA-IR (p < .001) and QUICKI (p < .001) in both intervention groups compared to their placebos.ConclusionsAn intake of fortified dairy products containing nano-encapsulated vitamin D-3 was associated with an improvement in some measures of anthropometric indices, glucose homeostasis, and lipid profiles, particularly in individuals receiving fortified milk. Hence, along with other benefits, fortification of dairy products with vitamin D may be an effective approach to improve some cardiometabolic indicators, such as insulin resistance.

TI  - Clinical benefit of baseline imaging in Merkel cell carcinoma: Analysis of 584 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) guidelines derive from melanoma and do not recommend baseline cross-sectional imaging for most patients. However, MCC is more likely to have metastasized at diagnosis than melanoma.Objective: To determine how often baseline imaging identifies clinically occult MCC in patients with newly diagnosed disease with and without palpable nodal involvement.Methods: Analysis of 584 patients with MCC with a cutaneous primary tumor, baseline imaging, no evident distant metastases, and sufficient staging data.Results: Among 492 patients with clinically uninvolved regional nodes, 13.2% had disease upstaged by imaging (8.9% in regional nodes, 4.3% in distant sites). Among 92 patients with clinically involved regional nodes, 10.8% had disease upstaged to distant metastatic disease. Large (>4 cm) and small (<1 cm) primary tumors were both frequently upstaged (29.4% and 7.8%, respectively). Patients who underwent positron emission tomography-computed tomography more often had disease upstaged (16.8% of 352), than those with computed tomography alone (6.9% of 231; P = .0006).Limitations: This was a retrospective study.Conclusions: In patients with clinically node-negative disease, baseline imaging showed occult metastatic MCC at a higher rate than reported for melanoma (13.2% vs <1%). Although imaging is already recommended for patients with clinically node-positive MCC, these data suggest that baseline imaging is also indicated for patients with clinically node-negative MCC because upstaging is frequent and markedly alters management and prognosis.

T2  - CHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is increasingly being used in various areas of abdominal surgery. The constant improvement in the technology enables easy intraoperative use and progressively influences operative decision-making, also in robotically assisted colorectal surgery.Objective. Summation of current evidence on the use of ICG fluorescence imaging in robotically assisted colorectal surgery. Material and methods The assessment of evidence is based on a comprehensive literature search (PubMed).Results. First individual studies (feasibility, case matched, prospective cohort, multicenter phase II, single center randomized controlled study/trial) showed a significant reduction in the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) after colorectal anastomosis through the use of ICG fluorescence angiography (FA, 9.1% vs. 16.3%; p = 0.04). First feasibility studies demonstrated lymph node detection or navigation as well as ureter visualization.Conclusion. The ICG-FA reliably detects tissue perfusion, quickly and effectively with few side effects. It can influence intraoperative decision-making and reduce AL rates. In addition, patients may be offered more precise tumor therapy via ICG sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection and lateral pelvic lymph node (LPN) mapping and navigation. Iatrogenic lesions, such as ureteral injuries can be sufficiently prevented by appropriate visualization; however, valid data in order to be able to derive standardized operative consequences require further convincing multicenter, randomized controlled trials (mRCT).

TI  - Divergent responses of ecosystem water-use efficiency to extreme seasonal droughts in Southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recurrent drought extremes have resulted in deleterious impacts on ecological security. Despite that many attempts have been made to explore ecosystem responses to different severities of droughts, a deep understanding of how ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) responds to extreme seasonal droughts is critical for predicting the trends under future climate change, especially in the ecologically-fragile karst ecosystem across Southwest China. This study systematically examined the spatio-temporal variations of ecosystem WUE over the karst and non-karst areas, as well as their divergent responses to different seasonal droughts. Our findings revealed the apparent increase in drought frequency, duration, and severity in Southwest China during the past four decades. Meanwhile, spring and summer drought events were the prevailing drought types. Compared with the non-karst area, multi-year mean WUE in the karst area was relatively lower, whereas the area exhibiting significant increase in WUE (p < 0.01) accounted for 39.3% and 22.3%, respectively. However, the effects of drought on ecosystem WUE varied in different seasons with more severe consequence in the karst ecosystem. During the early stage of autumn-spring drought in 2009/2010, ecosystem WUE was apparently larger than the baseline condition with the difference turning to be negative anomalies during the peak period, whereas the effect of summer drought in 2011 led to negative anomalies nearly throughout the duration. Further analysis revealed that the anomalies in evapotranspiration acted a prominent role in altering WUE at the onset of both droughts, while ecosystem WUE was mainly determined by the sensitivity of gross primary production during the later stage. All analyses are beneficial for expecting the coupling relationship between global carbon and water cycles to future climate change, particularly as droughts are projected to increase in terms of frequency and severity.

TI  - Organochlorine compounds pose health risks to the Qinling Giant Panda (<i>Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis</i>)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess organochlorine compound (OC) contamination, its possible sources, and adverse health impacts on giant pandas, we collected soil, bamboo, and panda fecal samples from the habitat and research center of the Qinling panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis)-the rarest recognized panda subspecies. The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) concentrations were comparatively low which suggests that moderate sources of OC pollution currently. OC levels were lower in samples from nature reserve than in those collected from pandas held in captivity, and OC levels within the reserve increased between functional areas in the order: core, buffer and experimental. The distribution patterns, and correlation analyses, combined with congener distributions suggested PCBs and OCPs originated from similar sources, were dispersed by similar processes, being transported through atmosphere and characterized by historical residues. Backward trajectory analyses results, and detected DRINs (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin and isodrin) both suggest long-range atmospheric transport of pollution source. PCBs pose potential cancer risk, and PCB 126 was the most notable toxicant as assessed be the high carcinogenic risk index. We provide data for health risk assessment that can guide the identification of priority congeners, and recommend a long-term monitoring plan. This study proposes an approach to ecotoxicological threats whereby giant pandas may be used as sentinel species for other threatened or endangered mammals. By highlighting the risks of long-distance transmission of pollutants, the study emphasizes the importance of transboundary cooperation to safeguard biodiversity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Green urban garden landscape architects, primarily for large-scale applications, such as planning and managing the local environment, ecology and natural resources, have been using a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS applications explore an urban landscape of the block with the local community analysis is very difficult. Geographic Information System (GIS) provides a means to collect and use geographic data to support the development of agricultural technology. The proposed Support Geographic Regression (SGR) algorithm is responsible for assessing the conditions and global growth estimate crop area, yield and production of crops, cereals, oilseeds and cotton. Digital map is usually higher than printed on paper. The digital version can be used for the analysis presented in combination with other information data sources in much the same map graphics. GIS software, in combination with the management of another information layer to be synthesized in large quantities a variety of data, can get the data more effectively. GIS, to serve them better farmers and breeding community, provides a powerful means of agriculture. The proposed SGR and GIS determine the production, estimate the yield and area extraction procedure, several different satellite data sources, and use the climate data crop model and data.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 lockdown upon the air quality and surface urban heat island intensity over the United Arab Emirates
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus Diseases (COVID-19) has posed a substantial threat to public health and major global economic losses. The Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (NEUAE) had imposed intense preventive lockdown measures. On the first of April 2020, a lockdown was implemented. It was assumed, clue to lower emissions, that the air quality and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) had been strengthened significantly. In this research, three parameters for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and SUHII variables were examined through the NEUAE. we evaluated the percentage of the change in these parameters as revealed by satellite data for 2 cycles in 2019 (March 1st to June 30th) and 2020 (March 1st to June 30th). The core results showed that during lockdown periods, the average of NO2, AOD, and SUHII levels declined by 23.7%, 3.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Validation for results demonstrates a high agreement between the predicted and measured values. The agreement was as high as R-2 =0.7, R-2 =0.6, and R-2 =0.68 for NO2, AOD, and night LST, respectively, indicating significant positive linear correlations. The current study concludes that due to declining automobile and industrial emissions in the NEUAE, the lockdown initiatives substantially lowered NO2, AOD, and SUHII. In addition, the aerosols did not alter significantly since they are often linked to the natural occurrence of dust storms throughout this time of the year. The pandemic is likely to influence several policy decisions to introduce strategies to control air pollution and SUHII. Lockdown experiences may theoretically play a key role in the future as a possible solution for air pollution and SUHII abatement. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Continues monitoring of subsidence water in mining area from the eastern plain in China from 1986 to 2018 using Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern plain of China is one of the most important grain production areas in China. Meanwhile, the plain is also an important coal production area with a large number of "coal-grain composite regions". Coal mining causes land subsidence and waterlogging, which destroys a significant amount of cultivated land. However, there is no dataset for the spatio-temporal distribution of subsidence water to assist related decision-making on a regional scale. Accurate monitoring of subsidence water is still a challenge, especially distinguishing among subsidence water, natural water and artificially excavated water by only using remote sensing data. Here, A new method to generate a dynamic map for the subsidence ponding year and the restoration year using the Google Earth Engine platform with 33-year-old Landsat imagery was created. The time segmentation method was used to first extract the change water pixels corresponding to subsidence water and artificially excavated water with similar trajectory features. Then, the morphological characteristics of the two types of change water at the beginning year of water accumulation are used to construct 13 landscape indexes. This approach utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to distinguish between subsidence water and artificially excavated water. The Huang-Huai-Hai plain area in eastern China was selected as the study area and extracted the subsidence water areas from 1986 to 2018. The identification accuracies for subsidence ponding year and restoration year are 88% and 85%. 79% of the subsidence water areas are located in cultivated land, which shows significant impacts to agricultural activities. The method proposed could be applied to other similar areas, the results could provide reference and data for decision-making and related land reclamation planning. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration Using Soil Moisture Balance and Remote Sensing
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of actual evapotranspiration is an important step for simulating the crop growth models in agricultural decision-making process. In this study, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) values for the main crops cultivated in Shahrekord plain, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Iran, are estimated based on real-time modeling and compared with the results obtained from the remote sensing data. Soil moisture balance was simulated considering the variation rate of crop canopy cover and its effects on evaporation and transpiration parameters. Daily values of ETa were predicted in a repeatable cycle based on the available soil moisture in root zone. Moreover, remote sensing images were analyzed as a data source to achieve the crop water requirement in critical times. For this objective, surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was used to characterize the evapotranspiration and then derived ETa. Preliminary results obtained by applying satellite information showed a good agreement between the SEBAL estimates of evapotranspiration fluxes and the corresponding values simulated by the soil moisture estimation technique.

TI  - Interannual variability of dust height and the dynamics of its formation over East Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical structure of dust layers is rarely investigated, despite its critical role in exploring the radiative and microphysical effects of dust aerosols. In this study, we primarily investigate the temporal variability of most probable dust height (MPDH) over dust source regions in East Asia and its interactions with climate parameters using CALIPSO lidar measurements under cloud-free conditions in spring from 2007 to 2018. The vertical profile of dust aerosols exhibits significant interannual variability over this time; dust is mainly concentrated below 7 km and associated with a dust occurrence frequency (DOF) of 0.6, and the DOF is much higher than that over the Sahara and West Asia. We also found that high Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) significantly contributes to the transport of dust aerosols to downstream areas by changing the circulation field near the equator and in the mid-low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which results in low MPDH over northern China. MPDH is significantly negatively correlated with 500-hPa westerly wind and precipitation, and is positively correlated with surface air temperature (SAT) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, MPDH is positively correlated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), but negatively correlated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The correlation coefficient between AMO and MPDH is 0.71 after detrending, which indicates that the AMO also plays an important role in the interannual variability of MPDH over East Asia. Furthermore, the Indian Ocean SST is the main influencing factor of the interannual variability of MPDH over northern China, but zonal wind is probably only the intermediate mechanism.

TI  - Assessment of colour changes in Lonar lake, Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India using remote sensing data
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This communication presents results of a preliminary study to understand and assess the colour changes in Lonar lake, Buldhana district, Maharashtra, India, using remote sensing data of recent years (2019 and 2020). In addition, the study has utilized IMD gridded weather data and spectral profiles of algal pigments from the published literature. In order to verify whether the colour change is a cyclic event, long-term satellite data of Landsat 8-OLI and Sentinel 2-MSI sensors from 2014 onwards were analysed using spectral response in red and green bands. It was observed that even though a cyclic pattern exists, the colour change events occurred only during the 2019 and 2020 periods. The present analysis showed a change in colour of the lake from green to brown twice during April-June 2019. However, in 2020, there was a change in colour of the lake from green to brown and eventually to pinkish-red, which was not observed earlier. Rainfall and temperature were used to identify possible causes of abiotic stress on algae population of the lake. The study observed light rainfall and reduction in temperature just prior to the colour change event during both the years. In the absence of field data, the published literature on absorption spectra of different algal pigments was reviewed to identify pigments causing brown- and red-coloured appearance of the lake. Though cause of stress on the algae population is not known and is to be precisely identified by field surveys, the change in colour of Lonar lake appears to be caused by pigment(s), like phycoerythrin and carotenoids. However, this needs to be verified in the ground through water quality analysis.

TI  - Surface urban heat islands in Italian metropolitan cities: Tree cover and impervious surface influences
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) predictors, such as impervious and vegetated surfaces, strongly influence the urban landscape mosaic, also changing microclimate conditions and exacerbating the surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon. The aim of this study was to investigate the summer daytime SUHI phenomenon and the role played by impervious and tree cover surfaces in the 10 Italian peninsular metropolitan cities. Summer daytime LST values were assessed by using MODIS data referred to the months of June, July and August from 2016 to 2018. High spatial resolution (10 m) of impervious surface and tree cover layers was calculated based on open-data developed by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research. A novel informative urban surface landscape layer was developed combining impervious surfaces and tree cover densities and its mapping for metropolitan cities was performed. Summer daytime SUHI rose significantly, increased especially in inland cities, by increasing the size of areas with low tree cover densities in the metropolitan core (or decreasing areas with low tree cover densities outside the metropolitan core), further increasing its intensity when the impervious density grew. A mitigating effect of the sea on daytime LST and SUHI was observed on coastal cities. The most intense SUHI phenomenon was observed in Turin (the largest Italian metropolitan city): for every 10% increase in areas with highly impervious surfaces and low tree cover densities in the metropolitan core, the SUHI significantly (p < 0.001) increased by 4.0 degrees C. Increased impervious surfaces combined with low tree cover densities represented the main driving process to increase the summer daytime SUHI intensity in most studied cities. These findings are useful to identify summer daytime LST critical areas and to implement the most efficient urban-heat-island mitigation strategies in order to safeguard the vulnerable urban environment and enhance quality of life for the population.

TI  - Predicting soil water content using support vector machines improved by meta-heuristic algorithms and remotely sensed data
T2  - GEOMECHANICS AND GEOENGINEERING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water content characteristics included field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) are key soil indicators to study permeability, soil water retention capacity, drainage, irrigation, plant water stress and solute movement. It is necessary to use an appropriate model for predicting these characteristics because of the hardness of their measurement. The present research shows a comparison of intelligent models included ANN, ANFIS, SVM and SVM optimised by firefly and particle swarm meta-heuristic algorithms (SVM-FFA and SVM-PSA) to predict soil water content at -33 and -1500 kPa matric potentials in agricultural soils. Results showed that the SVM-PSA and SVM-FFA hybrid models presented the best performance rather than the others, with predictor variables included geometric mean diameter (dg) of soil particles, bulk density, organic carbon, NDVI and NSMI and the values of R-2 and NRMSE in validation dataset, 0.94, 0.081, 0.96 and 0.077 for FC and PWP in SVM-PSA, respectively, and 0.96, 0.079, 0.97 and 0.075 for FC and PWP in SVM-FFA model. Therefore, these intelligent machines are preferable for accurate prediction and could be used to predict soil water content of soils with different soil textures in other regions of Iran or even the world.

TI  - Topographic controls on subpixel change detection in western Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over Himalayas, the detection of seasonal snow cover variations via remote sensing is challenging due to the presence of rugged terrain and shadow effects. Moreover, traditional per-pixel-based change detection methods less competent to identify the inner-pixel subtle variations with coarse resolution satellite imagery. In the present work, we have proposed the subpixel-based change detection (SCD) algorithm to examine the impact of topographic correction (TC) on the SCD algorithm. For experimental purposes, the SCD has been implemented over a part of the Himalayas (Himachal Pradesh, India) using two satellite sensor datasets i.e. AWiFS and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS. Experimental outcomes have confirmed the effectiveness of topographically corrected SCD (86.17% with AWiFS and 85.38% with Landsat-8) as compared to topographically uncorrected SCD (81.82% with AWiFS and 84.19% with Landsat-8). The proposed framework is proven to be significant in terms of both information extraction from shadowed areas and detection of inner-pixel subtle variations. This study has many applications especially in the field of climatology, glaciology, and hydrology.

TI  - Does short-interval fire inhibit postfire recovery of chaparral across southern California?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regrowth after fire is critical to the persistence of chaparral shrub communities in southern California, which has been subject to frequent fire events in recent decades. Fires that recur at short intervals of 10 years or less have been considered an inhibitor of recovery and the major cause of 'community type-conversion' in chaparral, primarily based on studies of small extents and limited time periods. However, recent sub-regional investigations based on remote sensing suggest that short-interval fire (SIF) does not have ubiquitous impact on postfire chaparral recovery. A region-wide analysis including a greater spatial extent and time period is needed to better understand SIF impact on chaparral.This study evaluates patterns of postfire recovery across southern California, based on temporal trajectories of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from June-solstice Landsat image series covering the period 1984-2018. High spatial resolution aerial images were used to calibrate Landsat NDVI trajectory-based estimates of change in fractional shrub cover (dFSC) for 294 stands. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess effects of time between fires and number of burns on recovery, using stand-aggregate samples (n = 294) and paired single- and multiple-burn sample plots (n=528), and (2) to explain recovery variations among predominant single-burn locations based on shrub community type, climate, soils, and terrain. Stand-aggregate samples showed a significant but weak effect of SIF on recovery (p<0.001; R-2=0.003). Results from paired sample plots showed no significant effect of SIF on dFSC among twice-burned sites, although recovery was diminished due to SIF at sites that burned three times within 25 years. Multiple linear regression showed that annual precipitation and temperature, chaparral community type, and edaphic variables explain 28% of regional variation in recovery of once-burned sites. Many stands that exhibited poor recovery had burned only once and consist of xeric, desertfringe chamise in soils of low clay content. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of water quantity-quality, floodplain landuse, and land surface temperature (LST) of Turag River in Bangladesh: an integrated approach of geospatial, field, and laboratory analyses
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and development activities are posing numerous threats to the rivers of Bangladesh. In the recent decade, Turag River has been exposed to severe threats due to anthropogenic activities. The present research deals with the evaluation of water quantity-quality, landuse and landcover (LULC), and land surface temperature (LST) of Turag River and its floodplain by using an integrated approach of field study, laboratory analysis, and geospatial techniques. LULC mapping of the study area has been done using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images by unsupervised method, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index indices (NDWI) approach. From LULC classification, the study shows that the average reduction of water bodies from 1989 to 2019 is about 60-66%, and the rate of reduction is about 14.25 ha per year. Due to anthropogenic activities and rapid urbanization, a large number of water bodies have been depleting. The average temperature of the river water from filed observed data is 30.23 degrees C and from image processed data is about 28.32 degrees C. The minimum and maximum values of pH, EC, TDS, and Eh are 6.87-8.44, 808-1192 mu s/cm, 406-739 ppm, - 31 to - 150 mV, respectively. The concentration ranges of cations (Na, Ca, Mg, K, Fe, and Mn) are 85.43-247.60, 28.59-39.47, 11.1-13.58, 5.21-13.261_07-1.14_006-.47 mg/l consecutively.The ranges of anions concentration (HCO3-,Cl-, SO42-, NO3-) are 165.45-388.87, 54.81-194.07, 52.49-289.63, 19.63-126.93 mg/l, respectively. It is evident that HCO3-, NO3-, and Mn exceed the standard limit of Bangladesh Water Quality Standard (BWQS) and World Health Organization (WHO), indicating that the water of the Turag River is deteriorating that is not safe for human consumption and aquaculture purposes. The study will assist to take some effective measures to control the pollution and uphold the water quality and natural riparian processes. So, the outputs of the study will contribute to the future urban landuse planning in the river floodplain area to mitigate ongoing alarming pollution and unplanned industrialization.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a methodological framework for accurate forest cover mapping of Shivamogga taluk, Karnataka, India using multi-sensor remote sensing data. For this, we used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data. These datasets were fused using principal component analysis technique, and forest and non-forest areas were classified using a random forest (RF) algorithm. Backscatter analysis was performed to understand the variation in gamma(0) values between forest and non-forest sample points. The average gamma(0) values of forest were higher than the non-forest samples in VH and VV polarizations. The average gamma(0) backscatter difference between forest and non-forest samples was 8.50 dB in VH and 5.64 dB in VV polarization. The highest classification accuracy of 92.25% was achieved with the multi-sensor fused data compared to the single-sensor SAR (78.75%) and optical (83.10%) data. This study demonstrates that RF classification of multi-sensor data fusion improves the classification accuracy by 13.50% and 9.15%, compared to SAR and optical data.

TI  - Dynamics of euphotic zone depth in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) plays an important role in studies of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques are ideal tools to investigate Z(eu) distributions because of their advanced observation ability with broad spatial coverage and frequent observation intervals. This study aims to develop a new approach that derives Z(eu) directly from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) values rather than by using other intermediate variables and then reveals the dynamic characteristics of Z(eu) in the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS). To do this, in situ data collected from various seasons were first used to assess the ability of several spectral indicators of Rrs(lambda) for deriving Z(eu) and the optimal spectral indicator was determined to build a Z(eu) retrieval model. This model was further applied to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data to study the spatial and temporal variations in Z(eu). The results showed that the new Zeu retrieval model performed well with R-2, RMSE and MAPE values of 0.843, 4.42 m and 17.9%, respectively. High Z(eu) levels were generally observed during summer for both coastal and offshore waters while the lowest Z(eu) values were observed during winter. Changing concentrations of total suspended matter, which are often modulated by sediment resuspension and transportation, are probably the main factor responsible for the spatial and temporal variability of Z(eu). These findings provide crucial information for modeling primary production, carbon flux, and heat transfer, etc., in the BS and YS, as well as contribute a useful alternative approach that will be easily implemented to study Z(eu) from satellite data for other water environments.

TI  - Effects of land use on groundwater recharge of a loess terrace under long-term irrigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relation between land use and groundwater recharge is of direct interest in areas that are prone to geohazards. This study was performed to characterize the effects of land use on groundwater table (GWT) distribution in the Heifangtai (HFT) loess terrace under long-term flood irrigation, as irrigation intensity was governed by the crop types. In light of the regional temperature-vegetable dryness index (TVDI) and optical images obtained in different seasons over four years, the dataset incorporated the growth cycles of the local crops, which in turn improved the workload and accuracy of land use detection. Irrigation intensities for different crops were recorded during field investigations. A total of 26 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles were conducted to estimate the GWT distribution of HFT terrace, which was further utilized to reveal the relation between land use (i.e. irrigation) and GWT fluctuations. The results indicated that high local GWT was associated with vegetable fields which had the highest irrigation intensity, and by contrast, low local GWT was attributed to the perennial fruit tree fields with the lowest irrigation intensity. The discharge was monitored intermittently for over three years to analyze the effect on the local GWT close to margin of HFT. The result showed a strong correlation between spring discharge and GWT fluctuations along the margin of HFT, indicating that groundwater recharge was affected by both irrigation and spring discharges. These results suggested that incorporating growth cycles of crops can effectively facilitate the interpretation of remote sensing data for land use detection, and the results can provide useful guidance for improving irrigation programs and for alleviating geohazards in regions that are under long-term irrigation.

TI  - Acceleration of vegetation dynamics in hydrologically connected wetlands caused by dam operation
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic responses of wetlands to upstream water conservancy projects are becoming increasingly crucial for watershed management. Poyang Lake is a dynamic wetland system of critical ecological importance and connected with the Yangtze river. However, in the context of disturbed water regime in Poyang Lake resulting from human activities and climate change, the responses of vegetation dynamics to the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) have not been investigated. We addressed this knowledge gap by using daily water level data and Landsat images from 1987 to 2018. Landsat images were acquired between October and December to ensure similar phenological conditions. Object-oriented Artificial Neural Network Regression for wetland classification was developed based on abundant training and validation samples. Interactions between vegetation coverage and water regimes pre and post the operation of the TGD were compared using classification and regression trees and the random forest model. Since the implementation of the TGD in 2003, Poyang Lake has become drier, especially during the dry season. A more rapid plant growth rate was observed post TGD (44.74 km(2) year(-1)) compared to that of the entire study period (12.9 km(2) year(-1)). Average water level for the antecedent 20 days most significantly affected vegetation before 2003, whereas average water level for the antecedent 5 or 10 days was more important after 2003. The impoundment of the TGD after the flood season accelerated the drawdown processes of Poyang Lake, and the rapidly exposed wetlands accelerated vegetation expansion during the dry seasons, resulting in shrinkage and degradation of the lake area. This study deepens our knowledge of the influences of newly developed dams on lakes and rivers.

TI  - Prehospital Resuscitation Decision Making: A model of ambulance personnel experiences, preparation and support
T2  - EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This paper presents the first Naturalistic Decision Making model of prehospital resuscitation decision-making, which has clear implications for education, practice and support.Methods: A mixed-methods exploratory sequential research design consisting of interviews with ambulance personnel (study 1), focus groups with ambulance educators, managers and peer supporters (study 2), and an online survey of graduating paramedic students (study 3). This paper reports the model developed from integrated findings, across all three studies. All research was undertaken in New Zealand and underpinned by a critical realist worldview.Results: The Prehospital Resuscitation Decision Making model identifies key processes, challenges and facilitators before, during and after ambulance personnel attend a cardiac arrest event. It is the only descriptive model of resuscitation decision making which acknowledges the decision-maker, nonprognostic factors and the importance of adequate preparation and support.Conclusions: This research project is the first to comprehensively explore and model ambulance personnel perspectives on decisions to start, continue or stop resuscitation. The decision-making process is complex and difficult to simply formularise. Education and supports must assist ambulance personnel in navigating this complexity. Where resuscitation is withheld or terminated, ambulance personnel need to feel confident that they can effectively provide after-death care.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the proposals of the final report of the Commission on Religious Education (CoRE 2018) and its controversial conclusion that the law should require religious education to include teaching about non-religious worldviews alongside religions, presumably in equal measure. Attention is given both to Trevor Cooling's recent defence of CoRE's proposals against already expressed criticisms and to additional criticisms, that of the abstract nature of a worldview as a highly ramified, philosophical concept, which is educationally ill-suited to the interests and intellectual capabilities of many pupils, and that of the failure of the proposals to indicate in what ways they overcome current systemic weaknesses. It is concluded that religious education should not be reconceptualised as the study of religious and non-religious worldviews nor should it adopt a framework that construes religions primarily as worldviews.

TI  - Spatial sensitivity analysis of COVID-19 infections concerning the satellite-based four air pollutants levels
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first reported in late December 2019, has affected the lives of many people throughout the world. Significant studies have been conducted on this pandemic, some of which have addressed understanding the relationship between different air pollutants and confirmed cases. In this study, the effects of four air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide) were assessed from February 19 to March 22, 2020 to explore how they can affect COVID-19 contagion in Iran. The mean concentrations of air pollutants were extracted from Sentinel 5P data. The COVID-19 confirmed case densities of two provinces, Semnan and Qom, were more than all other provinces. The effect of pollutants on the confirmed case densities was analyzed using multiple linear regression in order to estimate the impact coefficients for individual provinces. The impact coefficients determine the level of each pollutant's contribution to the density of total confirmed cases. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone had both considerable negative and positive correlations with the density of confirmed COVID-19 cases, although sulfur dioxide was correlated more negatively than positively. In Semnan, a high hot spot province, nitrogen dioxide had the most significant effect on the density of confirmed cases among all pollutants, while the effect of carbon monoxide was greater in Qom. The results indicated that even short-term exposure to higher concentrations of the pollutants could lead to an increased risk of COVID-19 outbreaks, which should be considered in adopting adequate and appropriate control policies to manage the disease.

TI  - Decadal change and inter-annual variability of net primary productivity on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator of plant dynamics and the net carbon exchange between the terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere. Both the long-term shifts in climate mean (climate change) and short-term variations around the climate mean (climate variability) have impacts on NPP but studies examining both aspects of climate variations are rare especially in the data-scarce regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here, we used a dynamic vegetation model to investigate the impacts of the changes and variabilities in temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and CO2 on NPP on the TP. The simulated NPP was evaluated using field and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NPP and was found to be reasonable. At monthly time scale, NPP significantly correlated concurrently and at 1-month lag with temperature, precipitation and cloud cover (coefficient of determination, R-2, in 0.52-0.77). Annual NPP variability was high (low) where mean annual NPP was low (high). The effects of annual precipitation, cloud cover and temperature variability on annual NPP variability were spatially heterogeneous, and temperature variability appeared to be the dominant factor (R-2 of 0.74). Whereas, NPP changes were very similar to CO2 increases across the TP (spatial correlation of 0.60), indicating that long-term changes in NPP were dominated by CO2 increases. For both variability and long-term changes in NPP, temperature was the major factor of influence (highest spatial correlation of 0.67). These findings could assist in making informed mitigation policies on the impacts of climate change and variability on ecosystem and local nomadic communities.

TI  - Outlook from the soil perspective of urban expansion and food security
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of soil as support for built-up areas represents only one of its several functions. Farmlands at the fringe of conurbations have more chance of being converted into built-up areas due to the favourable topography and the accessibility to existing infrastructure, being in the vicinity of urban areas. We analysed the global land-take during the period 2000-2014. The data are based on a global dataset describing the spatial evolution of human settlements using the Global Human Settlement Layer, which was derived from Landsat images collected in 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014. Although the global land-take represents roughly 0.1% of the global terrestrial Earth, it affects 1% of the naturally fertile soils, according to the proposed Soil Productivity Indexes (SPI), based upon the potential soil productivity, calculated on the basis of the Harmonized World Soil Database. We have found that, few large conurbations develop on potentially high productive soil, while scarcely productive soils sustain the expansion of several megalopolises. On a global scale and through the centuries, considered comparatively as individual overall age of settlements, a trend between the intrinsic quality of the soils and its use for settlement purposes as major competitor, was not observed.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Despite the less frequent use of surgery in patients with vulvar cancer, the high rates of postoperative complications are still a matter of concern. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors that influence postoperative complications rates in vulvar cancer and identify specific clinical parameters that may influence their incidence.Materials Patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva from 2003 to 2018 were selected. All patient characteristics were analyzed as risk factors for the development of postoperative lymphocele, lymphedema, and wound dehiscence. The patients were followed up for 2 years postoperatively.Results The investigation comprised 121 patients, of whom 18.1% developed wound dehiscence, 17.7% a lymphocele, and 20.4% lymphedema. We found no significant evidence of an association between patient's characteristics and postoperative complications. The depth of tumor invasion and the appearance of lymph-node metastasis were significantly associated with postoperative complications. Free resection margins of 5 mm or more were associated with a reduced risk of postoperative complications compared to resection margins less than 5 mm. No complications were encountered after sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Complication rates were associated with inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, but not with the extent of lymphadenectomy. The development of a lymphocele or wound dehiscence may be correlated with the development of long-term lymphedema.Conclusion FIGO stage at diagnosis influences the risk of postoperative complications. The use of SNB minimized postoperative complications. Correlations between the free microscopic resection margin distance and the risk of postoperative wound dehiscence must be investigated further.

TI  - Frequency and Characteristics of First-Time Palliative Care Referrals During the Last Day of Life
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Palliative care referrals (PCRs) improve symptom management, provide psychosocial and spiritual support, clarify goals of care, and facilitate discharge planning. However, very late PCR can result in increased clinician distress and prevent patients and families from benefiting from the full spectrum of interdisciplinary care.Objectives. To determine the frequency and predictors of PCR within 24 hours of death.Methods. Consecutive first-time inpatient PCR from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2017 was identified to determine the frequency and predictors of referrals within 24 hours of death. We compared the clinical characteristics with a random sample of patients discharged alive or died more than 24 hours after first-time PCR as a control, stratified by year of consult in a 1:1 ratio.Results. Of 7322 first-time PCRs, 154 (2%) died within 24 hours of referral. These patients were older (P= 0.003) and had higher scores for depression (P = 0.0009), drowsiness (P = 0.02), and shortness of breath (P = 0.008) compared with a random sample of 153 patients discharged alive or died more than 24 hours after first-time PCR. Patients who received a PCR within 24 hours of death were more likely than the control group to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 4 (95% vs. 25%, P < 0.0001), delirium (89% vs. 17%, P < 0.0001), do-not-resuscitate code status (81% vs. 18%, P < 0.0001), and hematologic malignancies (39% vs. 16%, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, depression (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; P = 0.005), do-not-resuscitate code status (OR 9.1; P = 0.003), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 4 (OR 9.8; P = 0.003) were independently associated with first-time PCR within 24 hours of death.Conclusion. Although only a small proportion of first-time PCR occurred in the last 24 hours of life, the patients had a significant amount of distress, indicating a missed opportunity for timely palliative care intervention. These sentinel events call for specific guidelines to better support patients, families, and clinicians during this difficult time. Further research is needed to understand how to minimize very late PCR. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

TI  - Uptake of Breast Cancer Clinical Trials at Minority Serving Cancer Centers
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Most minorities receive cancer care at minority-serving hospitals (MSHs) that have been associated with disparate treatment between Black and White patients. Objective Our aim was to examine the uptake of clinical trials that have changed axillary management in breast cancer patients at MSH and non-MSH cancer centers. Methods The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients eligible for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 and Z1071 trials, and mastectomy patients fulfilling the European AMAROS trial. Uptake of trial results (omission of axillary lymph node dissection) was analyzed between patients treated at MSHs and non-MSHs and adjusted for patient, tumor, and facility factors. MSHs were defined as the top decile of hospitals according to the proportion of Black and Hispanic patients treated. Results Of 7167 patients eligible for Z0011, 4546 for Z0171, and 9433 for AMAROS from 2015 to 2016, clinical trial uptake was seen in 1195 (74.6%) MSH and 4056 (72.9%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.173) for Z0011, 588 (41.9%) MSH and 1366 (43.5%) non-MSH patients for Z1071 (p = 0.302), and 272 (11.7%) MSH and 996 (14.0%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.005) for AMAROS. On adjusted analyses, MSH status was not significant for uptake of any of the three trials. Black race, socioeconomic status, and insurance were not associated with clinical trial uptake. Conclusion The uptake of three landmark clinical trials of axillary management in breast cancer was not different at MSH and non-MSH centers despite adjustment for social determinants of health. At the Commission on Cancer-accredited centers in this analysis, MSH status did not affect the uptake of evidence-based care.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral satellite remote sensing imagery have several applications including detection of objects or distinguishing land surface areas based on amount of greenery or water etc. The enhancement of spectral images helps extracting and visualizing spatial and spectral features. This paper identifies some specific regions of interest (RoI) of the earth's surface from the remotely sensed spectral or satellite image. The RoI are extracted and identified as major segments. Trivially, uni-variate histogram thresholding is used for gray images as a tool of segmentation. However, for color images multivariate histogram is effective to get control on color bands. It also helps emphasizing color information for clustering purpose. In this paper, the 2D and 3D histograms are used for clustering pixels in order to extract the RoI. The RGB color bands along with the infrared (IR) band information are used to form the multivariate histogram. Two datasets are used to carry out the experiment. The first one is an artificially designed dataset and the next is Indian Remotely Sensed (IRS-1A) satellite imagery. This paper proves the correctness of the proposed mathematical implication on the artificial dataset and consequently perform the application on LandSat Spectral data. The test result is found to be satisfactory.

TI  - Soil erosion in future scenario using CMIP5 models and earth observation datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall and land use/land cover changes are significant factors that impact the soil erosion processes. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the impact of rainfall and land use/land cover changes in the current and future scenarios to deduce the soil erosion losses using the state-of-the-art Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). In this study, we evaluated the long-term changes (period 1981-2040) in the land use/land cover and rainfall through the statistical measures and used subsequently in the soil erosion loss prediction. The future land use/land cover changes are produced using the Cellular Automata Markov Chain model (CA-Markov) simulation using multi-temporal Landsat datasets, while long term rainfall data was obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v5 (CMIP5) and Indian Meteorological Department. In total seven CMIP5 model projections viz Ensemble mean, MRI-CGCM3, INMCM4, canESM2, MPI-ESM-LR, GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL-CM3 of rainfall were used. The future projections (2011-2040) of soil erosion losses were then made after calibrating the soil erosion model on the historic datasets. The applicability of the proposed method has been tested over the Mahi River Basin (MRB), a region of key environmental significance in India. The finding showed that the rainfall-runoff erosivity gradually decreases from 475.18 MJ mm/h/y (1981-1990) to 425.72 MJ mm/h/y (1991-2000). A value of 428.53 MJ mm/h/y was obtained in 2001-2010, while a significantly high values 661.47 MJ mm/h/y has been reported for the 2011-2040 in the ensemble model mean output of CMIP5. The combined results of rainfall and land use/land cover changes reveal that the soil erosion loss occurred during 1981-1990 was 55.23 t/ha/y (1981-1990), which is gradually increased to 56.78 t/ha/y in 1991-2000 and 57.35 t/ha/y in 2000-2010. The projected results showed that it would increase to 71.46 t/h/y in 2011-2040. The outcome of this study can be used to provide reasonable assistance in identifying suitable conservation practices in the MRB.

AB  - The Sanjiangyuan region is the source of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lantsang rivers and is an important water conservation area in China. Due to the high altitude and cold climate in the region, the vegetation ecosystem has become very sensitive to environmental changes. In recent decades, due to the impact of climate change and human activities, the grassland degradation and desertification in this region have become very serious. In order to study the changes in aeolian desertification of grassland (ADG) in Sanjiangyuan, the Landsat images and GIS technology were used to monitor the dynamics of ADG from 1975 to 2015, and the driving factors behind this were analyzed. The results revealed that from 1975 to 2000, the area of ADG increased by 2855.8 km(2), and the growth rate was 114.23 km(2) a(-1). In contrast, the ADG was restored from 2000 to 2015, with a decrease of 1286.54 km(2) and a rate of 85.77 km(2) a(-1). The main reasons for the expansion of ADG in the early stage were the rising temperature, the fluctuation of precipitation and wind speed, and the increase in intensified human activities. The main reasons for the reversal of ADG in the later stage were the warming and humidification of the climate, the reduction in wind speed, and the reduction in human activities and restoration of grassland caused by the ecological protection project.
