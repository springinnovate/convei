TI  - A scientific algorithm to simultaneously retrieve carbon monoxide and methane from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important atmospheric constituent affecting air quality, and methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas contributing to human-induced climate change. Detailed and continuous observations of these gases are necessary to better assess their impact on climate and atmospheric pollution. While surface and airborne measurements are able to accurately determine atmospheric abundances on local scales, global coverage can only be achieved using satellite instruments.The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, which was successfully launched in October 2017, is a spaceborne nadir-viewing imaging spectrometer measuring solar radiation reflected by the Earth in a push-broom configuration. It has a wide swath on the terrestrial surface and covers wavelength bands between the ultraviolet (UV) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR), combining a high spatial resolution with daily global coverage. These characteristics enable the determination of both gases with an unprecedented level of detail on a global scale, introducing new areas of application.Abundances of the atmospheric column-averaged dry air mole fractions XCO and XCH4 are simultaneously retrieved from TROPOMI's radiance measurements in the 2.3 mu m spectral range of the SWIR part of the solar spectrum using the scientific retrieval algorithm Weighting Function Modified Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFM-DOAS). This algorithm is intended to be used with the operational algorithms for mutual verification and to provide new geophysical insights. We introduce the algorithm in detail, including expected error characteristics based on synthetic data, a machine-learning-based quality filter, and a shallow learning calibration procedure applied in the post-processing of the XCH4 data. The quality of the results based on real TROPOMI data is assessed by validation with ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) measurements providing realistic error estimates of the satellite data: the XCO data set is characterised by a random error of 5.1 ppb (5.8 %) and a systematic error of 1.9 ppb (2.1 %); the XCH4 data set exhibits a random error of 14.0 ppb (0.8 %) and a systematic error of 4.3 ppb (0.2 %). The natural XCO and XCH4 variations are well-captured by the satellite retrievals, which is demonstrated by a high correlation with the validation data (R = 0.97 for XCO and R = 0.91 for XCH4 based on daily averages).We also present selected results from the mission start until the end of 2018, including a first comparison to the operational products and examples of the detection of emission sources in a single satellite overpass, such as CO emissions from the steel industry and CH4 emissions from the energy sector, which potentially allows for the advance of emission monitoring and air quality assessments to an entirely new level.

TI  - Primary Melanoma: from History to Actual Debates
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review This review describes the long scientific background followed to design guidelines and everyday clinical practice applied to melanoma patients. Surgery is the first option to cure melanoma patients (PTS) at initial diagnosis, since primary cutaneous lesions are usually easily resectable. An excisional biopsy of the lesion, with minimal clear margins, can be obtained in the vast majority of cases. Punch biopsies may be proposed only in case of large lesions located on specific cosmetic or functional areas like the face, extremities, or genitals where a mutilating complete resection would not be performed without prior histological diagnosis. Recent Findings After the histologic confirmation of melanoma, definite surgical excision of the scar and surrounding tissue is planned, to obtain microsatellite free margins. The width of these margins has been identified following the results of several clinical trials and it is either 1 or 2 cm, depending on the Breslow thickness of the primary tumor. Following the latest staging system proposed by the American Joint Cancer commission (AJCC), a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is usually performed in case of a primary lesion > 0.8 mm thickness or for high-risk thinner lesions, if no evidence of nodal involvement has been identified clinically or radiographically. Surgical management of primary melanoma is well established. There is debate on the optimal surgical margins for 1-2 mm melanomas. There are specific considerations for special primaries (bulky, extremity, mucosal). Sentinel node (SN) evaluation does not improve survival, but is routinely used as staging.

TI  - Application of deep learning with stratified K-fold for vegetation species discrimation in a protected mountainous region using Sentinel-2 image
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of vegetation species is essential to gain knowledge on the recovery process of an ecosystem. Few studies have used deep learning and machine learning models for image processing focusing on forest/crop classification. This study, therefore, makes use of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) deep neural network to discriminate grass species in a mountainous region using Sentinel-2 images. Vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 and ASTER DEM were combined with Sentinel-2 images to improve classification accuracy. Stratified K-fold was used to ensure balanced training and test data. The results, when compared with other commonly used machine learning models, outperformed them all. It produced a better discriminate of the grass species when ASTER DEM was combined with Sentinel-2 images, with overall F1 score of 92%. The results of the species discrimination show a general increase in increaser II species such as Eragrostis curvula and a decrease in decreaser species like Phragmites australis.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS thermal emissive bands calibration performance using deep convective clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The core of deep convective clouds (DCC) is one of the most consistent Earth targets. When viewed from space, the measurements have minimal impact from water vapor and aerosols and have been used as invariant scenes for calibration assessment for reflectance solar bands. DCC is also one of the coldest targets and can be used for assessing the calibration and product stability for infrared thermal emissive bands (TEB). The stability from the years 2003 to 2019 is analyzed for both Terra and Aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) long-wave infrared bands. Most bands exhibit very stable long-term trending. Terra band 30 shows the largest rate of change of 0.19 K/year. The Terra-Aqua difference is also analyzed. In general, for both Terra and Aqua, the long-wave infrared bands show good and stable detector uniformity. The impact of response change due to anomalies and events has been analyzed. Since the measurement bias over cold DCC is dominated by the offset term in the calibration equation, an assessment model is developed to estimate the offset bias between the mirror sides. The impact model is also developed to estimate the impact on higher brightness temperature measurements. The offset bias from the assessment modeling in this analysis is used as the input for impact modeling. The measurements over Dome-C, Ocean, and desert scenes are used to verify the impact model. These assessments are very helpful for MODIS TEB calibration and look-up table update procedure improvements. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Applicability evaluation of Landsat-8 for estimating low concentration colored dissolved organic matter in inland water
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters, characterized by small scale but a large number, play an important role in the carbon budget and global carbon cycle. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a significant indicator used for tracing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters. Accurate remote-sensing estimation of CDOM concentration is still a challenge due to complex optical properties of inland waters. Many efforts have been made to estimate high concentration CDOM, leading to a knowledge gap in using remote sensing to estimate low concentration CDOM, which results in difficulty and uncertainty for estimating total carbon storage in global inland waters. Currently, few studies are devoted to estimating low concentration CDOM, while Landsat-8's applicability for estimating low concentration CDOM is still unknown. In this study, two datasets, NRL_SFE and Lake_Erie, were collected to represent extremely low CDOM conditions that a(CDOM) (440) (the absorptions of CDOM at 440 nm) ranges 0.215-1.165 m(-1), and 0.066-1.242 m(-1), respectively. The best CDOM retrieval model (validation results: R-2 = 0.78; RMSE = 0.161 m(-1); MRE = 26.02%), a(CDOM)(440) = 0.483x(-1.776), x = R-rs(B2)/R-rs(B4), was developed for monitoring CDOM in the two regions. Results show that Landsat-8 and the best model work well for estimating low concentration CDOM in inland waters. In addition, we have proved that Landsat-8 surface reflectance products, which are freely provided by USGS, are convenient and useful for developing remote sensing algorithm of CDOM estimation after correcting water surface reflectance. The image-derived CDOM's spatial patterns in Lake Erie demonstrate the Landsat-8's applicability to observe spatiotemporal variations of low concentration CDOM.

TI  - Representing Grasslands Using Dynamic Prognostic Phenology Based on Biological Growth Stages: Part 2. Carbon Cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are one of the most widely distributed and abundant vegetation types globally, and land surface models struggle to accurately simulate grassland carbon dioxide, energy, and water fluxes. Here we hypothesize that this is due to land surface models having difficulties in reproducing grassland phenology, in particular in response to the seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation. Using leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity, and flux data at 55 sites spanning climate zones, the aim of this study is to evaluate a novel prognostic phenology model (Simple Biosphere Model, SiB4) while simultaneously illustrating grassland relationships across precipitation gradients. Evaluating from 2000 to 2014, SiB4 predicts daily LAI, carbon, and energy fluxes with root-mean-square errors < 15% and individual biases <10%; however, not including management likely reduces its performance. Grassland mean annual LAI increases linearly with mean annual precipitation, with both SiB4 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) showing a 0.13 increase in LAI per 100-mm increase in precipitation. Both gross primary production and ecosystem respiration increase with growing season length by similar to 8.5 g C m(-2) per day, with SiB4 and Fluxnet estimates within 18%. Despite differences in mean annual precipitation and growing season length, all grassland sites shift to seasonal carbon sinks one month prior to peak uptake. During a U.S. drought, MODIS and SiB4 had nearly identical LAI responses, and the LAI change due to drought was less than the LAI change across the precipitation gradient, indicating that grassland drought response is not as strong as the overlying climate response.

TI  - Self-Correction of Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Soil Moisture Dry Bias
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites produce global monitoring data, while field measurements are made at a local station over the land. Due to difference in scale, it has been a challenge how to define and correct the satellite retrieval biases. Although the relative approach of cumulative distribution functions (CDF) matching compares a long-term climatology of reference data with that of satellite data, it does not mitigate the retrieval biases generated from Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) measurements over short timescales. As an alternative, we suggest stochastic retrievals (using probabilistic distribution function) to reduce the dry bias in soil moisture retrievals from the satellite SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) that occurs at the time scale of several days. Rank Probability Skill Score (RPSS) is also proposed as non-local Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of a probabilistic version to optimize stochastic retrievals. With this approach, the time-averaged RMSEs of retrieved SMOS soil moisture is reduced from 0.072 to 0.035 m(3)/m(3). Dry bias also decreases from -0.055 to -0.020 m(3)/m(3). As the proposed approach does not rely on local field measurements, it has a potential as a global operational scheme.

TI  - Estimation of Summer Air Temperature over China Using Himawari-8 AHI and Numerical Weather Prediction Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed an instantaneous summer air temperature (T-air) estimation model using the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) brightness temperatures (BTs) in split-window channels and other auxiliary data. Correlation analysis and stepwise linear regression were used to select the predictors for T-air estimation. Nine predictors such as AHI BTs in channels 14 and 15, elevation, precipitable water vapor (PWV), and relative humidity (RH) were finally selected. Stepwise linear regression and neural network (NN) methods were applied to construct summer T-air estimation models over China, respectively. The estimated T-air by linear and NN models was evaluated using the observed T-air from 272 meteorological stations over China. The results showed that AHI BTs in channels 14 and 15, elevation, PWV, and RH were more important for T-air estimation than other predictors. The accuracy of the NN models was better than the linear models. The correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias were 0.97, 1.72 degrees C, and 0.04 degrees C, respectively, for the NN model and were 0.89, 3.28 degrees C, and 0.07 degrees C, respectively, for the linear model. About 75.6% of the T-air differences by the NN model were within 2.0 degrees C, and even 45.8% were within 1.0 degrees C. The performance of the T-air estimation model for each site was also investigated, and the accuracy of T-air estimation in southeast China is better than northwest China.

TI  - Satellite-derived vegetation temperature condition index to infer root zone soil moisture in semi-arid province of Rajasthan, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is one of the key state variable to regulate the water and energy budgets at the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. This study demonstrates the utility of Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI), developed from interpretation of NDVI-Ts space using MODIS, to estimate soil moisture status at a spatial resolution of 1-km in Rajasthan province. The key findings reveal that VTCI at 1-km resolution and computed for the whole image (Method-1) was found to be more representative of the average profile soil moisture condition than the other methods. Statistical regression between VTCI and in-situ volumetric soil moisture for the surface and at depths of 15, 30 and 45 cm for the prominent crops in Eastern Rajasthan showed a strong relation (R-2 = 0.63, p-value <0.01). Thus, it is suggested that VTCI is useful to infer soil moisture beneath the surface over semi-arid areas for agricultural drought assessment.

TI  - Evaluating uncertainty in Landsat-derived postfire recovery metrics due to terrain, soil, and shrub type variations in southern California
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal trajectories of apparent vegetation abundance based on the multi-decadal Landsat image series provide valuable information on the postfire recovery of chaparral shrublands, which tend to mature within one decade. Signals of change in fractional shrub cover (FSC) extracted from time-sequential Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data can be systematically biased due to spatial variation in shrub type, soil substrate, or illumination differences associated with topography. We evaluate the effects of these variables in Landsat-derived metrics of FSC and postfire recovery, based upon three chaparral sites in southern California which contain shrub community ecotones, complex terrain, and soil variations. Detailed validations of prefire and postfire FSC are based on high spatial resolution ortho-imagery; cross-stratified random sampling is used for variable control. We find that differences in the composition and structure of shrubs (inferred from ortho-imagery) can substantially influence FSC-NDVI relations and impact recovery metrics. Differences in soil type have a moderate effect on the FSC-NDVI relation in one of the study sites, while no substantial effects were observed due to variation of terrain illumination among the study sites. Arithmetic difference recovery metrics - based on NDVI values that were not normalized with unburned control plots - correlate in a moderate but significant manner with a change in FSC (R-2 values range 0.47-0.59 at two sites). Similar regression coefficients resulted from using Landsat visible reflectance data alone. The lowest correlations to FSC resulted from Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and are attributed to the effects of the soil-adjustment factor in sparsely vegetated areas. The Normalized Burn Ratio and Normalized Burn Ratio 2 showed a moderate correlation to FSC. This study confirms the utility of Landsat NDVI data for postfire recovery evaluation and implies a need for stratified analysis of postfire recovery in some chaparral landscapes.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies (WBs), such as lakes, ponds, and impoundments, provide essential ecosystem services for human society, yet their characteristics and changes over large areas remain elusive. Here we used unprecedented data layers derived from all Landsat images available between 1984 and 2015 to understand the overall characteristics and changes of WBs between 2 epochs (i.e., 1984 to 1999 and 2000 to 2015) in China. Results show that the abundance estimate of WBs greater than 1 km(2) and the total WB surface area were 0.3 to 1.5 times and 0.2 to 0.5 times more than the previous estimates, respectively. The size-abundance and shoreline-area relationships of WBs in China conformed to the classic power scaling law, in contradiction to most previous studies. WB changes with various occurrence probabilities show widespread coexistence of disappearance of existent and emergence of new WBs across China driven primarily by human activities and climate change. Our results highlight the importance of using appropriate long-term satellite data to reveal the true properties and dynamics of WBs over large areas, which is essential for developing scaling theories and understanding the relative impacts of human activities and climate change on water resources in the world.

AB  - Striping noise is intrinsic to the process of image acquisition via scanning systems. Although it can be mitigated by radiometric calibration, the residual noise can jeopardize the quantitative analysis of the images and the extraction of physical parameters. This paper presents a new approach for evaluating destriping algorithms by means of a synergic use of: (1) distortion measurements, (2) quality indexes and relevant benchmark values calculated from simulated data, and (3) evaluation of effects on parameters extraction. The proposed procedure is here used to evaluate the performance of three destriping algorithms: Destriping Algorithm based on Statistics and Filtering (DASF), ENVI (R) algorithm and Wavelet-Fourier Filtering (WFF), on two different scenarios of hyperspectral push-broom data. The study pointed out the need of an approach based on the analysis of several aspects in order to identify the best performing algorithm. In addition, the results showed a good performance of both DASF and WFF that preserved the original radiometry without introducing spectral distortion.

TI  - Mapping Regional Turbulent Heat Fluxes via Assimilation of MODIS Land Surface Temperature Data into an Ensemble Kalman Smoother Framework
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of turbulent heat fluxes via variational data assimilation (VDA) approaches has been the subject of several studies. The VDA approaches need an adjoint model that is difficult to derive. In this study, remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are assimilated into the heat diffusion equation within an ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) approach to estimate turbulent heat fluxes. The EnKS approach is tested in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwest China. The results show that the EnKS approach can estimate turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating low temporal resolution LST data from MODIS. The findings indicate that the EnKS approach performs fairly well in various hydrological and vegetative conditions. The estimated sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes are compared with the corresponding observations from large aperture scintillometer systems at three sites (namely, Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the HRB. The turbulent heat flux estimates from EnKS agree reasonably well with the observations, and are comparable to those of the VDA approach. The EnKS approach also provides statistical information on the H and LE estimates. It is found that the uncertainties of H and LE estimates are higher over wet and/or densely vegetated areas (grassland and forest) compared to the dry and/or slightly vegetated areas (cropland, shrubland, and barren land).

TI  - Performance of the NCMRWF convection-permitting model during contrasting monsoon phases of the 2016 INCOMPASS field campaign
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses INCOMPASS aircraft, radiosonde and satellite observations for verifying hydrometeors and associated state variables predicted by the regional model of the NCMRWF (NCUM-R) for contrasting phases of the 2016 monsoon. INCOMPASS flights B957 and B975 took place between Lucknow in northern India and Bhubaneswar near the east coast, and represent a contrast between dry pre-monsoon and active monsoon conditions, respectively. A moist profile above 4 km in Bhubaneswar measured on B957 showed a dry-air intrusion being eroded by mid-level clouds, whereas the Lucknow profile showed a drier, pre-monsoon profile. Aerosol extinction coefficient and cloud-top height measured using lidar showed an influx of continental aerosol, and intermittent multiple clouds below the aircraft in the mid-troposphere and boundary layer. Measurements from B975 match well with cyclonic wind patterns estimated from satellite observations and the convective tendency represented in radiosonde profiles. Extensive clouds were detected below 5 km during the active monsoon. Two model formulations for cloud representation (prognostic cloud and prognostic condensate, PC2, and diagnostic schemes, Diag) are compared with observations during the campaign. Vertical structures of state variables from both schemes are generally in agreement along the flight tracks. Surface energy budget and cloud diagnoses indicate higher cloud cover in Diag consistent with lower surface temperatures through reduced surface downwelling short-wave flux than in PC2, while the latent-heat flux is found to be insensitive to cloud scheme chosen. In-cloud water content is larger in PC2 for lower cloud fraction, and the autoconversion process is faster with respect to Diag. Higher total condensed-water content in the model with respect to aircraft measurements and an enhanced light precipitation bias with respect to satellite data is common to both cloud schemes. Further work to improve the representation of clouds and precipitation for the tropical implementation of the model is clearly warranted.

TI  - Targeted axillary dissection after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in patients with node-positive breast cancer
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Over the last decade, neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) has gained considerable popularity and its use has been extended to include breast cancer patients with operable node-positive disease. It may no longer be necessary to commit patients who are node-positive at presentation to axillary dissection if they become clinically node-negative after completing NAST. Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is a technique where the marked pre-NAST positive node is excised along with the sentinel nodes and its response to chemotherapy is assessed and thus helps guide further treatment to the axilla. Methods The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of marking positive axillary nodes with a clip and removing the clipped node after neoadjuvant treatment. We also assessed the concordance of the sentinel node with the clipped node. Results We prospectively evaluated 37 clinically and/or radiologically node-positive patients who underwent NAST. The overall identification rate of the clipped node was 78%. The identification rate was 100% if the clipped node was localized preoperatively and was much lower at 68% in patients who did not have the clipped node localized. The clipped node was not retrieved as the sentinel node in 14% of patients. Conclusion We present the first Australian series on the feasibility of TAD. TAD is a feasible option in patients having NAST and with every new technique there is a learning curve. With the increasing experience globally and the refinement in marking and localization techniques, the accuracy of performing TAD will likely continue to improve.

TI  - Spatial pattern and temporal trend of land degradation in the Heihe River Basin of China using local net primary production scaling
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical processes and people's livelihoods largely depend on ecosystem productivity; thus, land degradation is harmful for local sustainable development. Most previous assessments of land degradation used a comprehensive index system or trend analysis without localized benchmarks; thus, they were not fully objective. Here, we assessed the land degradation in the Heihe River Basin (HRB), China using the local net primary production (NPP) scaling (LNS) method. We improved the method by dividing land capability classes (LCC) using remote sensing data, and determining the reference NPP for each LCC to represent the productivity under optimal environmental conditions. To assess the extent, severity and trend of land degradation, we obtained LNS percent values which was defined as the ratio of present NPP to reference NPP. We categorized our identified land degradation hotspots, determined their causes and proposed potential strategies for land conservation. Our results showed that nearly one quarter of the area was degraded land, mainly located in the upper stream. The average NPP was 35.75% lower than the reference NPP, with a reduction amount of 0.82 GgC yr(-1). Only the lower stream showed a significant decreasing trend in LNS percent values. The areas with a positive trend in LNS percent values were primarily observed in the middle stream croplands. We found the degradation condition deteriorated first and recovered later in the HRB. Land use change contributed more than climate change to the local NPP of the degraded areas. Our research provides a more general framework for assessing land productivity reduction induced by anthropogenic and natural processes in the drylands.

TI  - Coastal Inundation Mapping From Bitemporal and Dual-Polarization SAR Imagery Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops an effective and robust method to mine bitemporal and dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery information for coastal inundation mapping, based on deep convolutional neural networks. The specially tailored deep convolutional neural network-based SAR coastal flooding mapping network (SARCFMNet) leverages two modifications to improve the accuracy and robustness: the physics-aware input information design and the regularization. The proposed SARCFMNet is applied to the mapping and impact analysis of the coastal inundation caused by 2017 Hurricane Harvey near Houston, Texas, USA. Six pairs of Sentinel-1 SAR images are analyzed along with corresponding ground truth data from Copernicus Emergency Management Service Rapid Mapping products and land-cover types from Google Earth and OpenStreetMap. Flooded areas of 4,000 km(2) are extracted and analyzed. In an analyzed scene, 76% of the flooded area was agriculture area like pasture and cultivated crops field. A flooding map series shows the inundation shrinking rate is about 1% of the analyzed scene per day after the passage of Harvey. However, there was a delayed inundation in Glen Flora, Texas, after the heavy raining period. The average mapping accuracy and F1 score, that is, the harmonic mean of recall and precision, are 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. The impact of wind and cost-sensitive loss functions on the development of SARCFMNet is also discussed. This study demonstrates the proposed method can accurately map hurricane-induced inundation. The method can also be readily extended to other multitemporal SAR imagery classification applications.

TI  - Water level fluctuations of Lake Tana and its implication on local communities livelihood, northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana is a shallow inland lake with an average depth of 9 m. It is fresh water lake with the total area of 3150 km(2).The lake level has experienced a rapid water level fluctuation in recent years. The study was aimed at analysing the water level fluctuation of Lake Tana. Four Landsat images acquired at different times from the United States Geological Survey have been processed and analysed by using the ERDAS and ARC-GIS softwares to detect changes in the lake area through time. In addition to this, the long-time lake level and climate data obtained from National Metrological Agency were analysed using a linear regression model to complement the lake level change. Focus group discussion, key informant interview and direct observation were held to analyse the impact of lake level fluctuation on the livelihood of the community. The result of the study indicated that more than 180 km(2) of Lake Tana area has been converted to farm and other land uses during the last 35 years. The climate variability has been observed for the study period. There was continuous lake level fluctuation because of land-use changes, climate variability and water regulation for hydropower productions. Water level fluctuation of the lake had impacted on land use and its environment. The land use and regulated water at Chara Chara weirs, which are the contributing factors for Lake Tana water level fluctuation, should be managed regularly and critically.

AB  - A very simple algorithm with which to assess cloudiness over the Baltic Sea has been developed. The algorithm involves analysis of cloud longwave emissivity, supplemented with available information on shortwave emissions. The simple classification method is based on the split-window technique and compares a signal recorded in the neighbouring spectral bands with results of cloud-free atmosphere modelling. The algorithm was tested using data from the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) satellite radiometer, but the method can be easily implemented for other data sources. Compatibility with instant shipborne radiation measurements was obtained. The effectiveness of the comparison was determined from the Hanssen-Kuiper score. The CM SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) data comparison shows that the system correctly classified areas in 88%, the satellite map accuracy was 46% with a 54% overvaluation error. The accuracy of the detection system was 44%, and the underestimation error was 56%. The comparison of modelling results showed 71% of correctly classified areas, the accuracy of the satellite map was 35%, and the repricing error was 65%. The accuracy of the detection system was 36%, and the underestimation error was 64%. The concordance of satellite measurements (Cohen's kappa coefficient) was at a level of 98% and 99% between the satellite and model. Statistically, the analysis is based on the results of measurements for the Baltic Sea basin in 2015. The obtained data on the monthly cloudiness was compared with the operational, model and lidar data. A difference between the solution proposed and the approaches derived from prognostic models is demonstrated. The regional scale solution is shown to be a better representation of the true state of the atmosphere, compared to global-scale models. The results obtained show cloudiness assessments to differ depending on the model applied (CM SAF, UMPL - Unifed Model for Poland). The average annual cloudiness of the Baltic Sea is around 58.5%. It is a repeatable value by other solutions based on various methods and sources (MODIS - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), including lidar ones (CALIPSO - Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation). In addition, a potential for applying the regional cloudiness assessment to estimate the top-down components of the radiation budget is illustrated.

TI  - Detecting northern peatland vegetation patterns at ultra-high spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Within northern peatlands, landscape elements such as vegetation and topography are spatially heterogenic from ultra-high (centimeter level) to coarse scale. In addition to within-site spatial heterogeneity, there is evident between-site heterogeneity, but there is a lack of studies assessing whether different combinations of remotely sensed features and mapping approaches are needed in different types of landscapes. We evaluated the value of different mapping methods and remote sensing datasets and analyzed the kinds of differences present in vegetation patterns and their mappability between three northern boreal peatland landscapes in northern Finland. We utilized field-inventoried vegetation plots together with spectral, textural, topography and vegetation height remote sensing data from 0.02- to 3-m pixel size. Remote sensing data included true-color unmanned aerial vehicle images, aerial images with four spectral bands, aerial lidar data and multiple PlanetScope satellite images. We used random forest regressions for tracking plant functional type (PFT) coverage, non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination axes and fuzzy k-medoid plant community clusters. PFT regressions had variable performance for different study sites (R-2 -0.03 to 0.69). Spatial patterns of some spectrally or structurally distinctive PFTs could be predicted relatively well. The first ordination axis represented wetness gradient and was well predicted using remotely sensed data (R-2 0.64 to 0.82), but the other three axes had a less straightforward explanation and lower mapping performance (R-2 -0.09 to 0.53). Plant community clusters were predicted most accurately in the sites with clear string-flark topography but less accurately in the flatter site (R-2 0.16-0.82). The most important remote sensing features differed between dependent variables and study sites: different topographic, spectral and textural features; and coarse-scale and fine-scale datasets were the most important in different tasks. We suggest that multiple different mapping approaches should be tested and several remote sensing datasets used when maps of vegetation are produced.

TI  - The sensitivity of Southern Ocean aerosols and cloud microphysics to sea spray and sulfate aerosol production in the HadGEM3-GA7.1 chemistry-climate model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With low concentrations of tropospheric aerosol, the Southern Ocean offers a "natural laboratory" for studies of aerosol-cloud interactions. Aerosols over the Southern Ocean are produced from biogenic activity in the ocean, which generates sulfate aerosol via dimethylsulfide (DMS) oxidation, and from strong winds and waves that lead to bubble bursting and sea spray emission. Here, we evaluate the representation of Southern Ocean aerosols in the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3, Global Atmosphere 7.1 (HadGEM3-GA7.1) chemistry-climate model. Compared with aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from two satellite instruments (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS-Aqua c6.1, and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer, MISR), the model simulates too-high AOD during winter and too-low AOD during summer. By switching off DMS emission in the model, we show that sea spray aerosol is the dominant contributor to AOD during winter. In turn, the simulated sea spray aerosol flux depends on near-surface wind speed. By examining MODIS AOD as a function of wind speed from the ERA-Interim reanalysis and comparing it with the model, we show that the sea spray aerosol source function in HadGEM3-GA7.1 overestimates the wind speed dependency. We test a recently developed sea spray aerosol source function derived from measurements made on a Southern Ocean research voyage in 2018. In this source function, the wind speed dependency of the sea spray aerosol flux is less than in the formulation currently implemented in HadGEM3-GA7.1. The new source function leads to good agreement between simulated and observed wintertime AODs over the Southern Ocean; however, it reveals partially compensating errors in DMS-derived AOD. While previous work has tested assumptions regarding the seawater climatology or sea-air flux of DMS, we test the sensitivity of simulated AOD, cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplet number concentration to three atmospheric sulfate chemistry schemes. The first scheme adds DMS oxidation by halogens and the other two test a recently developed sulfate chemistry scheme for the marine troposphere; one tests gas-phase chemistry only, while the second adds extra aqueous-phase sulfate reactions. We show how simulated sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid profiles over the Southern Ocean change as a result and how the number concentration and particle size of the soluble Aitken, accumulation and coarse aerosol modes are affected. The new DMS chemistry scheme leads to a 20% increase in the number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei and cloud droplets, which improves agreement with observations. Our results highlight the importance of atmospheric chemistry for simulating aerosols and clouds accurately over the Southern Ocean.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop mapping is a challenging task due to spectral similarity of various crops. This study aims to: (1) identify major crops in Roorkee, India, using Sentinel-2A data. (2) test the efficacy of ensemble methods, i.e. extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost) Adaboost.M1, stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), random forest (RF) in comparison to support vector machine (SVM) for crop mapping. Results show that Xgboost outperformed with Overall accuracy of 86.91%, followed by RF whereas SVM produced lowest classification accuracy. All classifier's performance is significantly different on the basis of McNemar's test (chi-squared value >3.84). Here, major crops like wheat and sugarcane are identified at maximum accuracy of 88.04% and 85.95%, respectively. Derived variable importance revealed that Red-Edge2, Red-Edge3 and NIR band are most important predictor for crop classification. Interestingly, Red-Edge1 shown the least variable importance. Xgboost has great potential for classification in a heterogeneous agricultural environment need to be explored for future research.

TI  - Snow cover change assessment in the upper Bhagirathi basin using an enhanced cloud removal algorithm
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research paper proposes a new five-step protocol to enhance the result of existing cloud removal algorithms using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products (SCPs). The study has been carried out for the upper Bhagirathi basin (up to Maneri Hydropower Project) located in the Western Himalaya. Gafurov and Bardossy test employed to validate the performance of the proposed method, followed by comparing with the field observed snow cover duration (SCD) data. The result shows that the mean overall accuracy of the proposed method for cloud removal is about similar to 95%. However, the cloud removal method by Gafurov and Bardossy also achieved similar mean overall accuracy but with the higher variability within the individual images as compared with the variability within the results obtained by the proposed method. SCD computed from cloud removed SCPs matched significantly with the field observed SCD for a point location, supporting the accuracy achieved by the cloud removal method. This study also examines the spatiotemporal variability of the snow cover in the study area during the past 18 years (2000-2018). During the observation period, no specific trend was observed for annual maximum snow cover, while yearly minimum snow cover in the basin showed an increasing trend since 2010. Seasonally, December and June month witnessed significant changes. December experienced a declining trend in snow cover between 3000-6000 m a.s.l. covering 88% of the basin area, whereas, June showed an increasing trend between 4500 to 6000 m (a.s.l.). This elevation range covers 61% of the basin area, including core 86% of the glacier area within the basin. September and October experienced the highest inter-annual snow cover variability. Maximum snow cover month of February and minimum snow cover month of August experienced the least variability. The present study suggests significant elevation-dependent increasing as well as the decreasing trend in the snow cover with seasonal contrast, which may affect the glaciers as well as the hydrological behavior of the basin.

TI  - Sensitivity of Global Pasturelands to Climate Variation
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasturelands are globally extensive, sensitive to climate, and support livestock production systems that provide an essential source of food in many parts of the world. In this paper, we integrate information from remote sensing, global climate, and land use databases to improve understanding of the resilience and resistance of this ecologically vulnerable and societally critical land use. To characterize the effect of climate on pastureland productivity at global scale, we analyze the relationship between satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index data from MODIS and gridded precipitation data from CHIRPS at 3- and 6-month time lags. To account for the effects of different production systems, we stratify our analysis by agroecological zones and by rangeland versus mixed crop-livestock systems. Results show that 14.5% of global pasturelands experienced statistically significant greening or browning trends over the 15-year study period, with the majority of these locations showing greening. In arid ecosystems, precipitation and lagged vegetation index anomalies explain up to 69% of variation in vegetation productivity in both crop-livestock and rangeland-based production systems. Livestock production systems in Australia are least resistant to contemporaneous and short-term precipitation anomalies, while arid livestock production systems in Latin America are least resilient to short-term vegetation greenness anomalies. Because many arid regions of the world are projected to experience decreased total precipitation and increased precipitation variability in the coming decades, improved understanding regarding the sensitivity of pasturelands to the joint effects of climate change and livestock production systems is required to support sustainable land management in global pasturelands.

TI  - Could land cover influence <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito populations?
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti is mainly found in urban environments, where human activity guarantees the permanent availability of potential larval habitats. The present study aimed to test for a possible association between Ae. aegypti infestation and land cover classes. From 23 February to 22 May 2015, immature mosquitoes (except eggs) were sampled in artificial containers identified in dwellings in Cordoba city, Argentina. The proportion of each land cover class was determined by SPOT-5 (Satellites Pour 1'Observation de la Terre or Earth-observing Satellites) image classification. Generalized linear models were developed to assess a suite of predetermined hypotheses and identified cover class variables associated with Ae. aegypti infestation. Arboreal vegetation was identified as the land cover with the greatest relative importance, negatively associated with Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. More infestation was find in areas with less arboreal vegetation, which corresponds to more urbanized areas.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> over North China based on MODIS AOD and effect of meteorological elements during 2003-2015
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past 40 years, PM2.5 pollution in North China has become increasingly serious and progressively exposes the densely populated areas to pollutants However, due to limited ground data, it is challenging to estimate accurate PM2.5 exposure levels, further making it unfavorable for the prediction and prevention of PM2.5 pollutions. This paper therefore uses the mixed effect model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations of North China between 2003 and 2015 with ground observation data and MODIS AOD satellite data. The tempo-spatial characteristics of PM2.5 and the influence of meteorological elements on PM2.5 is discussed with EOF and canonical correlation analysis respectively. Results show that overall R-2 is 0.36 and the root mean squared predicted error was 30.1 mu g/m(3) for the model prediction. Our time series analysis showed that, the Taihang Mountains acted as a boundary between the high and low pollution areas in North China; while the northern part of Henan Province, the southern part of Hebei Province and the western part of Shandong Province were the most polluted areas. Although, in 2004, 2009 and dates after 2013, PM2.5 concentrations were relatively low. Meteorological/topography conditions, that include high surface humidity of area in the range of 34 degrees-40 degrees N and 119 degrees-124 degrees E, relatively low boundary layer heights, and southerly and easterly winds from the east and north area were common factors attributed to haze in the most polluted area. Overall, the spatial distribution of increasingly concentrated PM2.5 pollution in North China are consistent with the local emission level, unfavorable meteorological conditions and topographic changes.

TI  - Satellite-based (2000-2015) drought hazard assessment with indices, mapping, and monitoring of Potohar plateau, Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the deadly natural disasters that leave tearstained faces and broken dreams in its wake. Lifecycle as we know it comes to a halt during a dry season in a region. The purpose of this study was to observe the temporal and spatial variation of droughts in the rain-fed area of Potohar plateau (22,254 km(2)), Punjab, Pakistan, from 2000 to 2015, through remotely sensed satellite data, available at the database of Google Earth Engine. Potohar consists of four major districts of the country; Chakwal, Attock, Rawalpindi, and Jhelum. From 2000 to 2015, indices calculated were: standard precipitation index (SPI), standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), vegetation condition index (VCI), precipitation condition index (PCI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI), and temperature condition index (TCI). In this study, SPI and SPEI pointed out meteorological droughts in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2012, which were taken as base years for drought in the study. The study concluded that the main factor involved in the drought severity is not one, but rather a combined accumulation of temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture. Soil moisture and precipitation affect the vegetation in the area more so than the temperature of the land surface. Soil moisture was heavily influenced by the amount of precipitation. The land surface temperature was seasonal dependent. The surface temperature was warmest in Chakwal and Attock, while Rawalpindi had the coldest land surface temperature. Soil moisture increased with precipitation. Soil moisture was high in Rawalpindi and Attock during drought years.

TI  - Ernst Haeckel in the history of biology
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The German zoologist Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) was arguably the most influential champion of Darwin's theory of evolution on the European continent and one of the most significant worldwide. As his biographer Robert Richards emphasized: "More people at the turn of the century learned of evolutionary theory from his pen than from any other source, including Darwin's own writings" [1]. Furthermore, Darwin himself considered Haeckel a crucial proponent of his theory. How can we explain the mismatch between Haeckel's extraordinary influence among his contemporaries and his relatively modest place in the current historiography of biology? Why are Haeckel-studies nothing like the 'Darwin-industry'? To answer these questions, we outline Haeckel's contribution to evolutionary biology and anthropology and - to a lesser extent - the general history of ideas. We argue that Haeckel is currently underestimated, because history written by the advocates of the modern synthesis focused on neo-Darwinian schools of thought and neglected 'old-school-Darwinism' which Haeckel was part of. Besides, Haeckel's militant anti-clericalism and his exotic philosophy of 'monism' made him an uncomfortable figure in European intellectual history. In contrast to Darwin, Haeckel from the very beginning tried to turn Darwinism into a universal worldview, thus jeopardizing his credibility as a scientist.

TI  - Aerosol Properties Over Tibetan Plateau From a Decade of AERONET Measurements: Baseline, Types, and Influencing Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a decade long measurement of aerosol optical properties at two AERONET stations (Nam Co during 2006-2016 and QOMS during 2009-2017) in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a region sensitive to climate change and human perturbation, is presented. The baseline value of aerosol optical depth (AOD) was 0.029 and 0.027 at Nam Co and QOMS, respectively, which are comparable to or even lower than those at some Arctic and remote ocean locations. The seasonality of AOD values were the order of spring > summer > winter > autumn. Based on AOD and Angstrom exponent (alpha), major aerosol types over the TP were further identified as continental background, biomass burning, and dust. Although continental background aerosol was the main feature in remote areas of TP, biomass burning plumes frequently occurred, especially during spring (March-April). In one of such biomass burning event in April 2014, MODIS observations demonstrated that intensive open fires occurred in South Asia, covering the foothills of Himalayas and Indo-Gangetic Plain. The air mass back trajectories and CALIOP observations further revealed that biomass burning plume could be uplifted to higher altitudes and reach the Himalayas. Moreover, an occasional dust event detected in April 2008 over the TP demonstrated that the dust from Taklamakan Desert may impact the main body of TP episodically, although the local dust from the inside of TP cannot be excluded and warrants further study.

TI  - The Arctic Front and its variability in the Norwegian Sea
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic Front (AF) in the Norwegian Sea is an important biologically productive region which is well-known for its large feeding schools of pelagic fish. A suite of satellite data, a regional coupled ocean-sea ice data assimilation system (the TOPAZ reanalysis) and atmospheric reanalysis data are used to investigate the variability in the lateral and vertical structure of the AF. A method, known as "singularity analysis", is applied on the satellite and reanalysis data for 2-D spatial analysis of the front, whereas for the vertical structure, a horizontal gradient method is used. We present new evidence of active air-sea interaction along the AF due to enhanced momentum mixing near the frontal region. The frontal structure of the AF is found to be most distinct near the Faroe Current in the south-west Norwegian Sea and along the Mohn Ridge. Coincidentally, these are the two locations along the AF where the air-sea interactions are most intense. This study investigates in particular the frontal structure and its variability along the Mohn Ridge. The seasonal variability in the strength of the AF is found to be limited to the surface. The study also provides new insights into the influence of the three dominant modes of the Norwegian Sea atmospheric circulation on the AF along the Mohn Ridge. The analyses show a weakened AF during the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO-), even though the geographical location of the front does not vary. The weakening of AF during NAO- is attributed to the variability in the strength of the Norwegian Atlantic Front Current over the Mohn Ridge associated with the changes in the wind field.

TI  - Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology guidelines for surgical treatment of endometrial cancer in regions with limited resources
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Approximately 70% of cancer-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to social and racial inequalities, treatment options in these countries are usually limited because of the lack of trained staff and equipment, limited patient access to health services, and a small number of clinical guidelines. Objectives The Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology developed this guideline to address these barriers and guide physicians treating patients with endometrial cancer (EC) in regions with limited resources and few specialized centers. Methods The guideline was prepared from 10 January to 25 October 20192019 by a multidisciplinary team of 56 experts to discuss the main obstacles faced by EC patients in Brazil. Thirteen questions considered critical to the surgical treatment of these patients were defined. The questions were assigned to groups that reviewed the literature and drafted preliminary recommendations. Following a review by the coordinators and a second review by all participants, the groups made final adjustments for presentations in meetings, classified the level of evidence, and voted on the recommendations. Results For all questions including staging, fertility spearing treatment, genetic testing, sentinel lymph node use, surgical treatment, and other clinical relevant questions, major agreement was achieved by the participants, always using accessible alternatives. Conclusions It is possible to provide adequate treatment for most EC patients in resource-limited areas, but the first option should be referral to specialized centers with more resources.

TI  - Rapid urbanisation threatens fertile agricultural land and soil carbon in the Nile delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture land in Egypt represents only 3.8% of the total area. The Nile delta provides two thirds of Egypt's agriculture land, but is threatened by urban sprawl. The paper aims to quantify urban expansion over a 45 year period using 6 time points from 1972 to 2017, and its impacts on agricultural potential, soil organic carbon stocks, and implications for water use. The study used multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques (Maximum Likelihood supervised classification, and NDVI), soil sampling and analysis, data on water irrigation, and agroecological system and ecosystem services model (MicroLEIS, InVEST) to assess the effects of land use change.Urban area increased by a factor of 5, from 452 km2 in 1972 to 2644 km2 in 2017. The greatest losses occurred to the fertile Vertic Torrifluvent soils on the older delta, which lost 1734 km2. Soil organic carbon (0-75 cm depth) lost as a result of soil sealing from urbanisation rose from 25,000 to 141,000 Mg C over the 45 years. As a result of increased pressure on delta land, agriculture expanded into the higher desert areas outside the delta, on marginal land sustained by intensive fertiliser use and irrigation, which in turn puts pressure on water use. Therefore, rapid urban expansion has resulted in a loss of soil carbon and a shift in agriculture from fertile soils to marginal soils, requiring more capital inputs, which is ultimately less sustainable. Modelling suggested that soil management improvement could make better use of fertile soils within the Delta currently affected by high salinity and poor drainage.Future planning should encourage urban expansion on the less fertile soils outside of the delta, while improving suitability of existing agricultural land and minimising land degradation within the delta.

TI  - Estimating fine particulate concentration using a combined approach of linear regression and artificial neural network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is directly associated with the degradation of air quality and environmental health effects. PM2.5 is gaining much attention through its environmental impacts, but the inadequacy of ground based measurements limits the understanding of PM2.5 over many regions. This study is aimed to employ a new and integrated approach of multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the ground level PM2.5 concentration using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), land use data and meteorological parameters. AOD from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol products (MOD04) with Dark Target Deep Blue Combined algorithm at 10 km spatial resolution were retrieved for the most urbanized and industrialized city of Karachi, Pakistan during 2015-2017. The results of the MLR model revealed a good agreement with the ground observed data through correlation (R) 0.96, 0.87 and 0.76 for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The ANN with error back propagation algorithm was developed using AOD with binning of land use and meteorological parameters with associated spatio-temporal terms. The data sets were assembled into three groups, with 80% data for training and 10% each for validation and testing. ANN revealed good correlation coefficients (R) 0.80, 0.80 and 0.78 for training, test and validation, respectively. The proposed study has shown the enhanced accuracy in estimating PM2.5 concentration by including meteorological and land use data with satellite AOD. The results showed that both MLR and ANN are in closed agreement and capable to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. Overall, for the estimation of particulate concentration, ANN is more powerful technique and can be used to estimate long term particulate matter concentration with associated guidelines to monitor air quality in any region.

TI  - Environmental contaminants in coastal populations: Comparisons with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and resident dolphins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: People living in coastal communities are at risk for exposure to environmental hazards, including legacy chemicals. We can use databases such as NHANES to assess whether contaminants in coastal communities are present in higher levels than in the United States overall. We can use information from studies of local animal populations to assess which of these contaminants could have been transferred to people from their shared environment.Objective: Our objectives were to examine the POP profiles in human populations in areas where there are published POP profiles in resident dolphins and to compare our results with data from NHANES and the dolphin studies.Methods: We identified three areas where POPs have been analyzed in local resident dolphin populations (total N = 73). We identified human communities in the same areas, and asked 27 eligible adults to read and sign a consent form, complete a questionnaire about demographics and seafood consumption, provide nine 10-mL blood samples, and provide one sample of seafood (N = 33). Blood and seafood were analyzed for a suite of POPs similar to those analyzed in published dolphin population studies. We compared the results from human blood analyses with NHANES and with data from the published reports of dolphin studies.Results: Levels and proportions of specific POPs found in people and animals reflect POPs found in the local environment. Compared with the nationally representative data reported in NHANES, the levels of many POPs found in high levels in dolphins were also higher in the corresponding human communities.Conclusions: Contaminants measured in marine animals, such as dolphins, can be used to identify the types and relative levels of environmental contaminants expected to occur in people sharing the same environment. Likewise, contaminants measured in coastal human populations can provide insight into which contaminants may be found in nearby animal populations. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Global validation of the collection 6 MODIS burned area product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a Stage 3 validation of the recently released Collection 6 NASA MCD64A1 500 m global burned area product. The product is validated by comparison with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image pairs acquired 16 days apart that were visually interpreted. These independent reference data were selected using a stratified random sampling approach that allows for probability sampling of Landsat data in both time and in space. A total of 558 Landsat 8 OLI image pairs (1116 images), acquired between March 1st, 2014 and March 19th , 2015, were selected and used to validate the MCD64A1 product. The areal accuracy of the MCD64A1 product was characterized at the 30 m resolution of the Landsat independent reference data using standard accuracy metrics derived from global and from biome specific confusion matrices. Because a probability based Stage 3 sampling protocol was followed, unbiased estimators of the accuracy metrics and associated standard errors could be used. Globally, the MCD64A1 product had an estimated 40.2% commission error and 72.6% omission error; the prevalence of omission errors is reflected by a negative estimated bias of the mapped global area burned relative to the Landsat independent reference data ( - 54.1%). Globally, the standard errors of the accuracy metrics were less than 6%. The lowest errors were observed in the boreal forest biome (27.0% omission and 23.9% estimated commission errors) where burned areas tend to be large and distinct, and remain on the landscape for long periods, and the highest errors were in the Tropical Forest, Temperate Forest, and Mediterranean biomes (estimated > 90% omission error and > 50% commission error). The product accuracy was also characterized at coarser scale using metrics derived from the regression between the proportion of coarse resolution grid cells detected as burned by MCD64A1 and the proportion mapped in the Landsat 8 interpreted maps. The errors of omission and commission observed at 30 m resolution compensate to a considerable extent at coarser resolution, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (r(2) > 0.70), slope ( > 0.79) and intercept ( - 0.0030) of the regression between the MCD64A1 product and the Landsat independent reference data in 3 km, 4 km, 5 km, and 6 km coarse resolution cells. The Boreal Forest, Desert and Xeric Shrublands, Temperate Savannah and Tropical Savannah biomes had higher r(2) and slopes closer to unity than the Temperate Forest, Mediterranean, and Tropical Forest biomes. The analysis of the deviations between the proportion of area burned mapped by the MCD64A1 product and by the independent reference data, performed using 3 km x 3 km and 6 km x 6 km coarse resolution cells, indicates that the large negative bias in global area burned is primarily due to the systematic underestimation of smaller burned areas in the MCD64A1 product.

TI  - Analysis of equivalent black carbon multi-year data at an oil pre-treatment plant: Integration with satellite data to identify black carbon transboundary sources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes a multi-year dataset of equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentration collected in 2012-2015 by a 7-wavelengths Aethalometer at Centro Olio Val d'Agri (COVA) in southern Italy, which is the largest European oil pre-treatment plant. These data, together with the local air circulation analysis, were used to identify the black carbon (BC) sources in Agri valley, specifically the COVA plant and vehicular traffic. During a limited period of 2012-2013, simultaneous measurements of PM10 concentration were available for comparison with the EBC data, which revealed correlation values of 0.31-0.43 between PM10 and EBC indicating a relevant contribution of BC to particulate matter at the site. On average, EBC/PM10 ratio is 7%, a value equal to that found at an urban-background site in Rome measured during non-rush hours.Moreover, an ad hoc procedure combining EBC data, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory back-trajectories (HYSPLIT), and satellite fire data enabled detection of days affected by the transport of carbonaceous particles. Both Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were used as input for the algorithm, and the corresponding results were compared and discussed. VIIRS showed a better performance in detecting smaller/cooler hotspots especially in cases of flaring, as observed during flaring events at the COVA plant itself.Application of the procedure suggests that both regional and non-regional biomass burning episodes, which occur mainly during summer, could contribute to the BC load at the site.The approach applied to the case study of the present work can be useful for estimating the relative contributions of local and remote sources of BC.

TI  - Optimization of a remote sensing energy balance method over different canopy applied at global scale
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameterization methods which calculate turbulent heat and water fluxes with thermal remote sensing data were evaluated in the revised remote sensing surface energy balance system (SEBS) model (Chen et al., 2013). The model calculates sensible heat (H) based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and determines latent heat (LE) as the residual of energy balance. We examined the uncertainties of H and LE in the SEBS model due to five key parameters at the local station point scale. Observations at 27 flux towers located in seven land cover types (needle-leaf forest, broadleaf forest, shrub, savanna, grassland, cropland, and sparsely vegetated land) and an artificial intelligence particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was combined to calibrate the five parameters (leaf drag coefficient, leaf heat transfer coefficients, roughness length for soil, and two parameters for ground heat calculation) in the SEBS model. The root-mean-square error at the site scale was reduced by 9Wm(-2) for H, and 92Wm(-2) for LE, and their correlation coefficients were increased by 0.07 (H) and 0.11 (LE) after using the calibrated parameters. The updated model validation was further conducted globally for the remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) calculations. Overestimation of SEBS global ET was significantly improved by using the optimized values of the parameters. The results suggested PSO was able to consistently locate the global optimum of the SEBS model, and appears to be capable of solving the ET model optimization problem.

TI  - Fluid lensing and machine learning for centimeter-resolution airborne assessment of coral reefs in American Samoa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel NASA remote sensing technique, airborne fluid lensing, has enabled cm-resolution multispectral 3D remote sensing of aquatic systems, without adverse refractive distortions from ocean waves. In 2013, a drone-based airborne fluid lensing campaign conducted over the coral reef of Ofu Island, American Samoa, revealed complex 3D morphological, ecological, and bathymetric diversity at the cm-scale over a regional area. In this paper, we develop and validate supervised machine learning algorithm products tailored for accurate automated segmentation of coral reefs using airborne fluid lensing multispectral 3D imagery. Results show that airborne fluid lensing can significantly improve the accuracy of coral habitat mapping using remote sensing.The machine learning algorithm is based on multidimensional naive-Bayes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Provided a user-selected training subset of 3D multispectral images, comprising -1% of the total dataset, the algorithm separates living structure from nonliving structure and segments the coral reef into four distinct morphological classes - branching coral, mounding coral, basalt rock, and sand. The user-selected training data and algorithm classification results are created and verified, respectively, with sub-cm-resolution ground-truth maps, manually generated from extensive in-situ mapping, underwater gigapixel photogrammetry, and visual inspection of the 3D dataset with subject matter experts.The algorithm generates 3D cm-resolution data products such as living structure and morphology distribution for the Ofu Island coral reef ecosystem with 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. By comparison, classification of m-resolution remote sensing imagery, representative of the effective spatial resolution of commonly-used airborne and spaceborne aquatic remote sensing instruments subject to ocean wave distortion, typically produces data products with 68% accuracy. These results suggest existing methodologies may not resolve coral reef ecosystems in sufficient detail for accurate determination of percent cover of living structure and morphology breakdown.The methods presented here offer a new remote sensing approach enabling repeatable quantitative ecosystem assessment of aquatic systems, independent of ocean wave distortion and sea state. Aquatic remote sensing imagery, free from refractive distortion, appears necessary for accurate and quantitative health assessment capabilities for coral reef ecosystems at the cm-scale, over regional areas. The accurate and automated determination of percent cover and morphology distribution at cm-resolution may lead to a significantly improved understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and responses in a rapidly-changing global climate.

TI  - Current state of knowledge on biological effects from contaminants on arctic wildlife and fish
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the last Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) effort to review biological effects of the exposure to organohalogen compounds (OHCs) in Arctic biota, there has been a considerable number of new Arctic effect studies. Here, we provide an update on the state of the knowledge of OHC, and also include mercury, exposure and/or associated effects in key Arctic marine and terrestrial mammal and bird species as well as in fish by reviewing the literature published since the last AMAP assessment in 2010. We aimed at updating the knowledge of how single but also combined health effects are or can be associated to the exposure to single compounds or mixtures of OHCs. We also focussed on assessing both potential individual as well as population health impacts using population-specific exposure data post 2000. We have identified quantifiable effects on vitamin metabolism, immune functioning, thyroid and steroid hormone balances, oxidative stress, tissue pathology, and reproduction. As with the previous assessment, a wealth of documentation is available for biological effects in marine mammals and seabirds, and sentinel species such as the sledge dog and Arctic fox, but information for terrestrial vertebrates and fish remain scarce. While hormones and vitamins are thoroughly studied, oxidative stress, immunotoxic and reproductive effects need further investigation. Depending on the species and population, some OHCs and mercury tissue contaminant burdens post 2000 were observed to be high enough to exceed putative risk threshold levels that have been previously estimated for non-target species or populations outside the Arctic. In this assessment, we made use of risk quotient calculations to summarize the cumulative effects of different OHC classes and mercury for which critical body burdens can be estimated for wildlife across the Arctic. As our ultimate goal is to better predict or estimate the effects of OHCs and mercury in Arctic wildlife at the individual, population and ecosystem level, there remain numerous knowledge gaps on the biological effects of exposure in Arctic biota. These knowledge gaps include the establishment of concentration thresholds for individual compounds as well as for realistic cocktail mixtures that in fact indicate biologically relevant, and not statistically determined, health effects for specific species and subpopulations. Finally, we provide future perspectives on understanding Arctic wildlife health using new in vivo, in vitro, and in silico techniques, and provide case studies on multiple stressors to show that future assessments would benefit from significant efforts to integrate human health, wildlife ecology and retrospective and forecasting aspects into assessing the biological effects of OHC and mercury exposure in Arctic wildlife and fish.

TI  - Prediction of soil organic matter using multi-temporal satellite images in the Songnen Plain, China
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to confounding factors such as crop residue and soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM) is usually estimated from soil samples in a laboratory or in the field at a local scale. In this study, laboratory and field data of crop residue, soil moisture, crop management practices, and SOM content were used in concert with multi-temporal MODIS images captured during bare soil periods over three years to construct spectral indices, which were then used as input variables to build a regional-scale SOM prediction model. Results showed that: (1) multi-temporal satellite images can be used to predict SOM content at a regional scale; (2) crop residue cover and time interval between snow melt, rainfall, and ploughing determined the optimal input variables for SOM prediction; (3) compared to a SOM model based on a single image, a multi-temporal model reduced the influence of soil moisture and improved both the stability and the accuracy of SOM prediction; (4) the best models generally used the ratio of MODIS Band 6 and Band 1 (R-61) as an input variable, as R-61 showed good correlation with SOM and less correlation with moisture; and (5) comparing different models in different years showed that models performed better in years with less crop residue. The study results can be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the soil organic carbon pool and provide assistance in digital soil mapping.

TI  - The Estimation and Projection Package Age-Sex Model and the r-hybrid model: new tools for estimating HIV incidence trends in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Improve models for estimating HIV epidemic trends in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design: Mathematical epidemic model fit to national HIV survey and ANC sentinel surveillance (ANC-SS) data. Methods: We modified EPP to incorporate age and sex stratification (EPP-ASM) to more accurately capture the shifting demographics of maturing HIV epidemics. Secondly, we developed a new functional form for the HIV transmission rate, termed 'r-hybrid', which combines a four-parameter logistic function for the initial epidemic growth, peak, and decline followed by a first-order random walk for recent trends after epidemic stabilization. We fitted the r-hybrid model along with previously developed r-spline and r-trend models to HIV prevalence data from household surveys and ANC-SS in 177 regions in 34 SSA countries. We used leave-one-out cross validation with household survey HIV prevalence to compare model predictions. Results: The r-hybrid and r-spline models typically provided similar HIV prevalence trends, but sometimes qualitatively different assessments of recent incidence trends because of different structural assumptions about the HIV transmission rate. The r-hybrid model had the lowest average continuous ranked probability score, indicating the best model predictions. Coverage of 95% posterior predictive intervals was 91.5% for the r-hybrid model, versus 87.2 and 85.5% for r-spline and r-trend, respectively. Conclusion: The EPP-ASM and r-hybrid models improve consistency of EPP and Spectrum, improve the epidemiological assumptions underpinning recent HIV incidence estimates, and improve estimates and short-term projections of HIV prevalence trends. Countries that use general population survey and ANC-SS data to estimate HIV epidemic trends should consider using these tools.

TI  - Combining allometry and landsat-derived disturbance history to estimate tree biomass in subtropical planted forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Planted forests are a key component of sustainable forest management, as their fast-growing biomass can provide many important ecosystem goods and services essential to human well-being. Accurate estimation of forest biomass is important for global carbon accounting and afforestation policy making, yet saturated reflectance signals over vegetation and a shortage of cloud-free images during the growing season largely limit the utility of optical remote sensing for biomass estimation of planted forests in subtropical and tropical regions. Stand age is a crucial factor in determining forest growth and stand development but hasn't been widely used in remote sensing-based biomass estimation approaches. The main objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of an allometric analysis approach combined with Landsat-derived forest age structure to estimate stand biomass of fast-growing forest plantations in a subtropical landscape of China. We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) approach and Landsat time series data from 1986 to 2016 to detect annual stand-replacing disturbance and estimate forest stand age. Allometric equations and relative growth rate functions were combined to establish the linkage between tree biomass and forest stand age. We also modeled the spatial distribution of tree biomass using a conventional remote sensing (CRS) method that only utilizes spectral and textural variables and an extended CRS method that incorporates stand age (CRS_EX). We then compared the CRS and CRS_EX methods with the allometric analysis method to highlight the importance of stand age and post-disturbance forest regrowth for biomass estimation. The Landsat-derived disturbance history was significantly correlated with stand age (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 3.7 year, p < 0.01). The CRS_EX and allometric analysis methods substantially improved tree biomass estimates (R-CRS_EX(2) = 0.77, RMSECRS_Ex = 37.7 t/ha; R-Allometric(2) = 0.70, RMSEAllometric = 43.5 t/ha) compared to the CRS method (R-CRS( )2= 0.53, RMSE (CRS) = 54.38 t/ha). Tree biomass estimated from the allometric analysis method aligned better with the allometric growth curves, while CRS_EX and CRS methods both exhibited notable overestimation for young and mid-aged forests. This study suggests that allometric models have the potential to be applied in subtropical forest plantations through the use of the existing forest stand development knowledge and increasingly open access remote sensing data.

TI  - Role of atmospheric nutrient pollution in stimulating phytoplankton growth in small area and shallow depth water bodies: Arabian Gulf and the sea of Oman
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited investigations into the role of dust deposition in enhancing phytoplankton growth in small and shallow water areas have been reported in the remote sensing literature. In this work, we show that phytoplankton growth was stimulated by nutrients supplied by dust deposition over sea water following three major dust storms that blew over the Arabian Gulf (AG) and the Sea of Oman (SO). Shallow water conditions, as those found in the AG and SO, limit convection and the role of mixing processes in supplying nutrients and in mediating bloom growth. Using satellite data, we analyzed three major dust events over the AG and SO in 2009, 2012, and 2015, and the phytoplankton bloom enhancement that ensued. We used the Mixed Layer Depth model to simulate water mixing and convection currents during and after the high dust events. We also applied the Regional Climate Model RegCM 4.5 to derive dust depositions patterns over AG and SO following the dust outbreak. Additionally, we computed potential requirement versus supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron nutrients to support the observed phytoplankton growth using published nutrient data. Carbon to nitrogen to phosphorus, and carbon to chlorophyll ratios were obtained from in situ measurements in the AG and SO. Shallow depth mixed layers can likely still supply phosphate, but not enough nitrate and iron, leading to potential nitrate and dissolved iron limitations. Our work shows that dust storms are playing a significant role in providing nitrate supplies to support phytoplankton growth in shallow waters such as the AG and SO.

TI  - Remotely sensed estimation of vegetation shifts in the polar and alpine tree line ecotone in Finnish Lapland during the last three decades
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is predicted to affect ecosystems, particularly in high-latitude regions where polar amplification accelerates temperature rise and environmental changes. Here, where plants grow under adverse conditions, a warmer climate provides more favourable conditions for growth and regeneration. At the alpine and polar tree line in Finnish Lapland, rising temperatures are assumed to promote densification and expansion of conifers towards fell tops and treeless boreal heathlands beyond the recent tree-line position. In this study, we analysed vegetation changes in the pine treeline ecotone in six study sites in Finnish Lapland using multi-spectral satellite data during 1984-2017. All of the six sites were established in fell areas, covering the transition from closed forest stands of the lower elevations to the open fell tops beyond the treeline position. The southern sites were located in pine dominated-stands, where treelines were of alpine character. The northern sites were located in the polar treeline ecotone where mountain birch forests already dominate the landscape. We assessed shifts in the vegetation pattern of the fell sites using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a RandomForest land-cover classification as indicators of potential change. We did not find clear trends for advancing coniferous tree lines towards open fell tops or treeless heath vegetation, neither by NDVI change detection nor by the land-cover classification. However, we found evidence for densification of open forest stands and sparse vegetation cover in lower elevations and the expansion of deciduous vegetation in higher elevations of previously vegetation-free or sparsely covered fell tops. Increasing stand density was detected mostly in the southern, pine-dominated sites, while the northern sites indicated increasing biomass near the fell tops. Prominent changes in vegetation patterns originated rather from human impact in the southern sites appearing as recent roads, clear-cuttings or infrastructure constructions in skiing areas. In the northern sites, distinctive changes arose from human impact or from biotic disturbance events such as moth outbreaks defoliating mountain birch stands at site Karigasniemi.

TI  - Developing a soil water index-based Priestley-Taylor algorithm for estimating evapotranspiration over East Asia and Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of hydrological processes. Reliable estimates of ET variation are of vital importance for natural hazard adaptation and water resource management. In order to improve the accuracy of ET estimation, this study first developed a soil water index (SWI)-based Priestley-Taylor algorithm (SWI-PT) based on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), SWI, net radiation, and temperature. The algorithm was then compared with a modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor ET model (MS-PT). After examining the performance of the two models at 10 flux tower sites in different land cover types over East Asia and Australia, the validation results showed that the daily estimates from the SWI-PT model were closer to observations than those of the MS-PT model in each land cover type. The average correlation coefficient of the SWI-PT model was 0.81, compared with 0.66 in the original MS-PT model. The average value of the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 36.46 W/m(2) to 23.37 W/m(2) in the SWI-PT model, which used different variables of soil moisture and vegetation indices to capture soil evaporation and vegetative transpiration, respectively. Overall, the results showed that the newly developed SWI-PT model captured ET more accurately than the MS-PT model. In comparison with the NDVI in the MS-PT model with high values, the low seasonal EVI values indicated that vegetative transpiration accounts for a smaller part of ET in the SWI-PT model. The ranges of fraction of soil moisture (f(sm)) inMS-PT remained unchanged in each season, while a clear seasonal change of the SWI was found in SWI-PT which indicated that the temperature change-based f(sm) could not capture soil water conditions well compared with the SWI. The estimated ET from the MS-PT model was most sensitive (to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in forests) to net radiation (R-n) in grassland and cropland. The estimated ET from the SWI-PT model was most sensitive to R-n, followed by SWI, air temperature (T-a), and the EVI in each land cover type.

TI  - Combining generalized complementary relationship models with the Bayesian Model Averaging method to estimate actual evapotranspiration over China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration, commonly classified as actual evapotranspiration (AET), wet evapotranspiration (WET), and potential evapotranspiration (PET), is an important component of hydrological processes. Several models have been developed for estimating AET, but none are applicable under all conditions due to the complexity of the algorithms and limitations in parameterization. However, PET and WET can be easily calculated using several simple equations based on available climate data. In this study, a regional reanalysis dataset, the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Dataset for the SWAT model (CMADS), was used to estimate PET and WET, and a generalized complementary relationship (GCR) was used to convert from PET and WET to AET. Then a Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method was applied to merge the GCR-based AETs to improve the accuracy of AET estimations in China. After examining the performance of GCR and BMA models at the flux tower sites in different climate zones, we found that other PET models were better than the PM model for predicting AET using GCR. In addition, the BMA estimations were closer to flux tower observations than were those of the GCR-based AET in each climate zone. The average RMSE of BMA-merged AET was reduced to 0.66 mm/day, compared to 1.82 mm/day in the original GCR model. Moreover, the performance of AET estimated by CMADS and other AET products, such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Global Evapotranspiration Project was examined at the flux tower sites. The results showed that the CMADS AET product performed better than other AET products in each climate zone with better statistical values. In general, the results showed that the GCR estimates are promising when combined with BMA for future studies to characterize global AET.

TI  - ASQ-MPHAAS: Multi-Payload Observation System From High Altitude Airship
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the critical advantages of a high-altitude airship (HAA) is its ability to carry multiple-task payloads for remote sensing monitoring on the plateau. We developed a multi-payload observation system based on the HAA (ASQ-MPHAAS) for remote sensing monitoring of the Qinghai plateau. In this paper, we demonstrate the design, development, implementation of the ASQ-MPHAAS. The ASQ-MPHAAS includes two parts; one part is our HAA (ASQ-HAA380), and the other part is our multi-payload observation system (ASQ-MPOS-1). The ASQ-MPOS-1 consists of two hyperspectral push-broom imaging sensors, a multispectral imaging sensor, a high-resolution RGB camera, a video sensor, a Position and Orientation System (POS), and other components. The ASQ-MPOS-1 is installed under the ASQ-HAA380. We also introduce some key methods of data processing we propose to solve unique problems brought by HAA. Four real-world field experiments are presented in this paper to demonstrate that the ASQ-MPHAAS can capture different kinds of remote sensing data at a high spatial resolution of a few or dozen centimeters.

TI  - Agricultural drought monitoring using European Space Agency Sentinel 3A land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index imageries
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is one of most damaging agricultural hazards worldwide that can bring significant agricultural losses and water scarcity. The use of satellite images for monitoring agricultural drought has received increasing research attention and has also been applied at both the regional and global scales. In this paper, the land surface temperature (LST) and radiance products of the new Sentinel-3A SLSTR (sea and land surface temperature radiometer) launched by European Space Agency (ESA) are used for the first time for estimating the vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), which in turn is used for monitoring agricultural drought in the Hetao Plain of Inner Mongolia, China. This paper initially analyzes the correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) by using time series time MODIS LST and NDVI products under different vegetation growth conditions. The findings reveal that VTCI can only be used in warm seasons (late spring and summer periods) when negative correlations between LST and NDVI are observed. Therefore, VTCI images are captured in the study area between July and August 2017 by using Sentinel-3A SLSTR LST and NDVI and are utilized for drought investigation. These images reveal that the average VTCI of the cultivated land pixels in the study area has increased from 0.4511 on July 28 to 0.5229 on August 12 before declining to 0.4710 on August 18 due to the rainfall in the first period, thereby indicating that VTCI has a timely response to rainfall. Meanwhile, cross-comparison of VTCI values from Sentinel-3A SLSTR shows high consistency in terms of spatial distribution with that estimated from EOS MODIS products. The difference between these indices ranged from -0.1 to 0.1 for most points, especially in the cultivated land cover. Overall, the findings support the use of the LST and NDVI products of Sentinel-3A SLSTR in monitoring agricultural drought.

TI  - A multi-temporal binary-tree classification using polarimetric RADARSAT-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) signal contains more parameters than single or dual polarized SAR when using a scattering matrix to characterize targets. The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multitemporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82. In cases with pairs of classes that are difficult to separate, such as barley and wheat, MBTC is shown to be superior in this research application.

TI  - Lidar provides novel insights into the effect of pixel size and grazing intensity on measures of spatial heterogeneity in a native bunchgrass ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a strong link between vegetation heterogeneity and biodiversity in grassland ecosystems. However, quantifying spatial patterns of key metrics, such as aboveground biomass, at landscape scales remains a challenge. This stems from difficulties in accurately estimating grassland biomass at fine scales over large areas and determining what spatial scale is most appropriate to monitor how grassland impacts (e.g., livestock grazing) affect spatial patterns of biomass (i.e., spatial heterogeneity). Here, we use lidar metrics (volume, max height, and intensity) in Random Forest models to quantify fine-resolution (pixel size 1.0668 m (3.5 ft)) aboveground biomass estimates (pseudo R-2 = 0.59; RMSD = 139.4 g m(-2)) across a bunchgrass prairie grassland system. To determine both the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and which pixel size is most sensitive to the effects of livestock grazing on grassland heterogeneity, we aggregated fine-resolution biomass maps to coarser pixel resolutions (3 m, 5 m, 8 m, 20 m, 30 m) across 23 pastures with varying levels of grazing intensity. Following aggregation to coarser pixel resolutions, we observed that semivariogram models produced statistically different (alpha = 0.05) measures of biomass heterogeneity. The range statistic was the only pasture-level semivariogram metric sensitive to grazing, and this relationship was only significant when using the finer-resolution datasets (similar to 1 m to 8 m pixels). Our results demonstrate 1) the applicability of lidar data for quantifying biomass in short-statured grasslands, 2) that grazing in pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie can decrease spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and 3) that fine-resolution satellite data ( < 10 m pixel sizes) are necessary to effectively monitor the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation biomass, an indirect metric of biodiversity at management scales (pasture sizes ranged from 40 to 745 ha) in this grassland ecosystem.

TI  - Evaluation of modeled actual evapotranspiration estimates from a land surface, empirical and satellite-based models using <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> observations from a South African semi-arid savanna ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in the land-atmosphere interaction and climate variability, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Accurate estimates of ET are important in hydrological and climate modeling. This study evaluates eight ET data products from different models used for ET estimation. The data products are classified into three main categories depending on the type of modeling approaches: namely process-based land surface model, empirical models, and satellite data derived estimates. The different model estimates are evaluated against in situ measurements from the Skukuza flux tower which is situated in a semi-arid savanna in South Africa. The correlation score and cantered root mean square error computed on monthly ET averages indicate that the satellite-derived model and land surface model estimates are closer to the observed ET signal for the Skukuza site, both in-phase and magnitude. The empirical models' outputs tend to reflect a relatively pronounced departure from observations in magnitude. The normalised mean bias computed for different seasons reveals that the estimates from all modeling approaches are close to the observed signal during the transition period (March-May) to the austral summer. In general, all models overestimate ET during summer and underestimate it in winter. A qualitative analysis of the year-to-year variation for different seasons reveals that all model estimates are qualitatively consistent with the observed seasonal pattern of the signal. Satellite and process-based land surface models (LSMs) also show a response to extremes events such as drought years. The study identifies satellite-derived model outputs as a candidate for understanding spatio-temporal variability of ET across different landscapes within the study region, and process-based models to potentially be used for climate change impact studies on ET.

TI  - The observed and model-simulated response of southern African vegetation to drought
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a frequent disturbance in many regions of the globe and can have a particularly severe impact on vegetation. Over southern Africa, where drought is a regular occurrence, relatively little is known about how quickly vegetation responds to droughts. We characterized the meteorological drought occurrence in southern Africa from 1981 to 2005 and examined the impacts on vegetation productivity, as derived from satellite data. The spatio-temporal extent and severity of droughts were assessed at different timescales (1- to 18-month timescales) using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Thereafter, we examined the impacts of droughts on southern African vegetation using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results of this study show that southern African vegetation responds differently to drought over the different timescales. During the 1981-2005 period, droughts had extensive impacts over central parts of South Africa, Namibia and western areas of Botswana and the responses of vegetation varied according to season and biome, likely due to the differences in the levels of water needed by vegetation during various growth/phenological phases. In addition, the magnitude of the drought's impact on vegetation is sensitive to the type of drought index that is used to characterize its severity.We further investigated the response of vegetation as simulated by an Earth System Model (the Community Earth Systems Model, CESM) over the same period. The intensity of drought impacts on vegetation is underestimated by CESM, while the timescales at which vegetation responds to droughts are overestimated by it. Different model ensemble members show a substantial spread in the simulation of vegetation response across different biomes and seasons, which may be due to inherent errors and biases in the land component of the model (CLM4.5), or in the atmospheric model and/or the parameterizations. However, we demonstrate that the land component of the CESM (CLM4.5) does provide an adequate representation of the response of vegetation to drought and would provide useful information about the response of vegetation to future drought. If the uncertainties we identified could be reduced, a more realistic simulation of the vegetation response to drought could be realized.

TI  - Autumn phenology of a temperate deciduous forest: Validation of remote sensing approach with decadal leaf-litterfall measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn (i.e., leaf-fall) phenology plays an important role in regulating the canopy duration and is often monitored using near-surface and satellite remote sensing techniques, but the measurements have rarely been validated by the ground observation. The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate the performance of radiometer-based broadband vegetation index (VIB) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VIM) in monitoring the autumn phenology of a Chinese temperate deciduous forest with decadal (2008 - 2018) leaf-litterfall measurements, and (2) explore the feasibility of using VIB to validate the VIM products for monitoring the autumn phenology. We found that the seasonal and interannual trends of both VIB and VIM agreed well with those of the leaf-litterfall (correlation coefficients r > 0.93). The broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIB) best tracked the interannual variation in the end-of-season (EOS) among the six metrics of the VIB investigated, while the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVIM) did so among the six metrics of the VIM, with the corresponding determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and 0.44 with the EOS estimated by the leaf-litterfall. The EOS estimated by VIB and VIM was 0 - 11 d earlier than that by the leaf-litterfall. Comparing the six metrics of VIM with the corresponding ones of VIB, the EOS derived from the NDVI had the closest correlation with each other (R-2 = 0.67). Conclusively, our study validated the remote-sensed leaf-fall phenology with decadal ground measurements, and suggested that radiometer and MODIS could effectively track the autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forests and the leaf-litterfall collection could be used as a complementary approach.

TI  - Influence of Land Use Change on Ecosystem Service Value Based on GEE in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region from 1998 to 2018
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In sustainable development assessment of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the ability to dynamically estimate the value of ecosystem services is of great significance. This study considers the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as the research area, based on the google earth engine (GEE); the classification and decision tree (CART) classification algorithm was adopted to supervise and classify the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Operational Land Imager (TM/OLI) images in the study area in 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018, and land use types in these five periods were obtained. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes of land use in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 1998 to 2018 was carried out. Then, the ecosystem service value (ESV) equivalent estimation method was used to quantitatively estimate the ESV in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and combine it with a 15 kmx15 km scale grid to detect its temporal and spatial dynamics. The main results were as follows. (1) From 1998 to 2018, the area of construction land (increased by 16.67%) and grassland (reduced by 13.73%) in the six land use types in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region was the largest, and the change in the proportion of water bodies (0.2%) was the smallest. (2) The total value of ESV in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region experienced a short-term increase from 1998 to 2003 (an increase of 91.97x10(8) yuan), and continued to decrease from 2003 to 2018 (a decrease of 239.07x10(8) yuan), mainly related to the expansion of construction land area in the other three time periods excluding 1998 and 2003. Among the six land use types, the forest provides the highest value of ecosystem services, and the construction land and unused land provide the lowest value of ecosystem services. (3) The ESV time-space analysis based on the 15 kmx15 km scale grid showed that the ESV medium area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region gradually decreased from 1998 to 2018, the ESV lower area and the higher area gradually increased, and the ESV lower-area growth rate was higher than for the higher area. (4) The revised value of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (sensitivity coefficient range 0-0.83) has good significance and reliability. In future economic development, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should rationally optimize the land use pattern and strengthen the protection of forest land, grassland, water bodies and cultivated land.

TI  - Integration of <i>in situ</i> and satellite data for top-down mapping of <i>Ambrosia</i> infection level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach of integration of remote sensing data with in situ pollen measurements is developed to explore the effect of changing land use on the local pollen records variability. It was conducted in a predominantly agricultural region of Serbia, with the focus on Ambrosia, an invasive weed that is the source of highly allergenic pollen. The land use characteristics were extracted from the Corine Land Cover and more precise crop classification maps for years 2013-2017 created using machine learning from the available satellite (RapidEye, Landsat, Sentinel) and ground truth data. Airborne pollen was collected at five locations for the same period. To integrate in situ and products derived from satellite data we defined catchment areas surrounding pollen measurements stations. Different shapes of assumed catchment areas equivalent to 5 km, 10 km and 30 km radius were tested: circular, wind rose and footprint from SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition). The simple fixed circle, used as the rule of thumb in the literature, is a reasonable approximation of the representativeness of the aerobiological data. A gridded Ambrosia distribution and abundance map over Vojvodina was produced by using top-down approach that combines distribution of suitable habitats and airborne pollen concentrations. The results confirmed that variation in the agriculture-associated land use area explains notable amount of variability in the amount of Ambrosia airborne pollen. Detailed crop classification inferred from satellite data revealed the strongest relationship between pollen and variation in areas under soya bean and sugar beet. Maps of Ambrosia infection levels, based on distribution of sugar beet and soya bean fields, instead of total arable land, reveal its additional spatial variability in Vojvodina region.

TI  - Research on PM2.5 estimation and prediction method and changing characteristics analysis under long temporal and large spatial scale - A case study in China typical regions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentration of fine particulatematter (PM2.5) has been shown to be a major contributor to hazeweather, which has been associated with an increased prevalence in lung cancer. An accurate estimation and predication of PM2.5 historical levels, and its spatial-temporal variability can assist in strategically improving regional air quality and reducing its harmful effects on population health. This paper targets Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province (BTH), three northeast province of china (TNPC), Yangtze river delta (YRD) and pearl river delta (PRD) as the study areas. Data used in this study include PM2.5 measurements from April 2013 to December 2016, MODIS AOD raster imageries and five meteorological factors from2000 to 2016. By combining back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and e-support vector regression (e-SVR), a novel hybrid model was constructed to impute the historical PM2.5 missing values in the long time series from 2000 to 2012, and to predict the concentration of PM2.5 from April 2014 to December 2017. The hybrid model produced results superior to BPANN and eSVR with a higher accuracy, lower error rate, and a stable performance. This model can be applied to the other four regions with consistent results. Results of spatial-temporal analysis indicated that the PM2.5 concentration has increased along with a pollution range expansion in BTH from 2000 to 2010. In addition, the PM2.5 concentration decreased slowly in PRD. The concentration and pollution range of PM2.5 in TNPC and YRD showed a stable trend. In 2012, the four research areas all showed decreased trend, and the pollution range narrowed. From 2013 to 2016, the PM2.5 concentration increased shortly then decreased; in particular, the high pollution areas saw a decrease in PM2.5 concentration, which correlated with control measures adopted by the state during the same time period. The hot spots of PM2.5 were mainly distributed in the inland cities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - HIV estimates through 2018: data for decision-making
T2  - AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Global targets call for a 75% reduction in new HIV infections and AIDS deaths between 2010 and 2020. UNAIDS supports countries to measure progress towards these targets. In 2019, this effort resulted in revised national, regional and global estimates reflecting the best available data. Methods: Spectrum software was used to develop estimates for 170 countries. Country teams from 151 countries developed HIV estimates directly and estimates for an additional 19 country were developed by UNAIDS based on available evidence. 107 countries employed models using HIV prevalence data from sentinel surveillance, routinely collected HIV testing and household surveys while the remaining 63 countries applied models using HIV case surveillance and/or reported AIDS deaths. Model parameters were informed by the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modeling and Projections. Results: HIV estimates were available for 170 countries representing 99% of the global population. An estimated 37.9 million (uncertainty bounds 32.7-44.0 million) people were living with HIV in 2018. There were 1.7 million (1.4-2.3 million) new infections and 770 000 (570 000-1.1 million) AIDS-related deaths. New HIV infections declined in five of eight regions and AIDS deaths were declining in six of eight regions between 2010 and 2018. Conclusion: The estimates demonstrate progress towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, however, through 2018 declines in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths were not sufficient to meet global interim targets. The UNAIDS estimates have made important contributions to guide decisions about the HIV response at global, regional and country level.

TI  - A geostatistical approach for multi-source data fusion to predict water table depth
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate water table depth mapping is important for water management and activity planning. The joint use of exhausted geospatial raster data with sparse field measurements could improve predictions. The aim of this work was to fuse different support data, collected with remote sensors, with point soil field observations to improve water table depth prediction. A method for multi-source data fusion is described in detail, based on multivariate geostatistics and exemplified with a case study in a conservation area of 5700 ha in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. TanDEM-X digital surface model with 90 m resolution and SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) data calculated from Sentinel-2 images with 20 m resolution, were jointly used with water table depth and soil physical variables measured at 56 locations to predict water table depth in two hydrological years (2015-16 and 2016-17). Data were transformed to normal distributions using the Gaussian anamorphosis approach. A Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC), calculated for all direct and cross-variograms of the eleven variables of study, was regularized at block support for multi-collocated block cokriging predictions. Support change correction was made to reduce punctual variance to block variances. Univariate and multivariate geostatistical interpolation methods were compared through cross validation. The uncertainty associated to the water table depths estimated by multivariate approach was lower than those by the univariate approach. Moreover, multivariate predictions incorporated the influences induced by local relief, vegetation and soil properties. Confidence interval maps, presented as uncertainty measure, reveal areas with higher and lower precision of groundwater level prediction that could be effectively used as support in land use management.

TI  - Satellite-based identification of aerosol particle species using a 2D-space aerosol classification model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of aerosol types using remote sensing tools is crucial for improving our knowledge on the impacts of aerosol species on global and regional climate. Ground-based classification methods have proven useful though they are limited by discontinuous spatial observations of aerosol optical properties. As such, there is a need to develop methods in aerosol species identification using satellite data. In this study, a 2D-space model suitable for MODIS AOD bands is developed to distinguish aerosol particle species based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol relative optical depth (AROD). The model can be used to classify five aerosol types, including biomass burning (BB: A0D(470) >= 0.45, AROD(660/470) < 0.58), urban industry (UI: AOD(470) >= 0.45, 0.68 > AROD(660)/470 >= 0.58), sub-continental (SB: AOD(470) >= 0.45, 0.91 > AROD(660/470) >= 0.68), desert dust (DD: AROD(660/470) > 0.91) and continental (CO: AOD(470) < 0.45, AROD(660/470) < 0.91). AROD values corresponding to different types of aerosols are calculated through Mie scattering theory using the aerosol particle size distribution parameters and spectral complex refractive index. The accuracy and applicability of the model are verified in three steps: 1) we compare aerosol discrimination results of model with ground-based data and the local atmospheric conditions over different regions, 2) we compare aerosol identification results from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD retrieval and ground-based data, and 3) we test our model to validate its use in individual cases studies and regional observations. Our results demonstrate that aerosol species classification for each study region is consistent with the characteristics of their atmospheric conditions, and the classification results using MODIS AOD retrieval are similar to the ground-based observation results. The differences in MODIS versus AERONET AOD, caused by MODIS observation errors, is the major contributor to the differences between ground-based and satellite-based recognition results. Our three-steps validation results indicate that the 2D-space model developed in this paper can accurately identify different types of aerosols and has strong applicability. This provides a basis for the use of satellite data for continuous spatial identification of aerosol type, which greatly promotes research in related fields.

TI  - Correlation of Tumor Burden in Sentinel Lymph Nodes with Tumor Burden in Nonsentinel Lymph Nodes and Survival in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: In patients with cutaneous melanoma, metastasis in a nonsentinel lymph node (non-SLN) is a strong independent adverse prognostic factor. However, patients with a tumor-involved SLN no longer routinely undergo completion lymph node dissection (CLND). We hypothesized that SLN tumor burden may predict non-SLN tumor burden.Experimental Design: We compared tumor burden parameters between SLN and non-SLN in patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent SLN biopsy with a positive SLN during 2003 to 2008 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.Results: We identified 336 eligible patients with a positive SLN. Of these, 308 (92%) underwent CLND, and 35 (10%) had non-SLNmetastasis. The median follow-up time was 6.0 years. For patients with maximum diameter of tumor in the SLN <= 2.0 mm, >2.0-5.0 mm, and >5.0 mm, non-SLN metastasis was detected in 5 of 200 patients (3%), 10 of 63 patients (16%), and 20 of 57 patients (35%), and the mean maximum diameters of the non-SLN tumor deposits were 0.09, 1.56, and 2.71 mm, respectively (P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients with both subcapsular and intraparenchymal non-SLN tumor was higher for patients with SLN tumor in both locations than for patients with SLN tumor in only one location (P < 0.0001). Extranodal extension in a non-SLN was more common in patients with extranodal extension in an SLN (P = 0.003).Conclusions: In patients with cutaneous melanoma who undergo CLND, SLN tumor burden predicts non-SLN tumor burden. SLN tumor burden parameters provide accurate prognostic stratification independent of non-SLN status and should be considered for incorporation into future staging systems and integrated risk models.

TI  - Fusing optical and SAR time series for LAI gap filling with multioutput Gaussian processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of satellite optical information is often hampered by the natural presence of clouds, which can be problematic for many applications. Persistent clouds over agricultural fields can mask key stages of crop growth, leading to unreliable yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery which can potentially overcome this limitation, but given its high and distinct sensitivity to different surface properties, the fusion of SAR and optical data still remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose the use of Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) regression, a machine learning technique that learns automatically the statistical relationships among multisensor time series, to detect vegetated areas over which the synergy between SAR-optical imageries is profitable. For this purpose, we use the Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series over a study area in north west of the Iberian peninsula. Through a physical interpretation of MOGP trained models, we show its ability to provide estimations of LAI even over cloudy periods using the information shared with RVI, which guarantees the solution keeps always tied to real measurements. Results demonstrate the advantage of MOGP especially for long data gaps, where optical-based methods notoriously fail. The leave-one-image-out assessment technique applied to the whole vegetation cover shows MOGP predictions improve standard GP estimations over short-time gaps (R-2 of 74% vs 68%, RMSE of 0.4 vs 0.44 [m(2)m(-2)]) and especially over long-time gaps (R-2 of 33% vs 12%, RMSE of 0.5 vs 1.09 [m(2)m(-2)]). A second assessment is focused on crop-specific regions, clustering pixels fulfilling specific model conditions where the synergy is profitable. Results reveal the MOGP performance is crop type and crop stage dependent. For long time gaps, best R-2 are obtained over maize, ranging from 0.1 (tillering) to 0.36 (development) up to 0.81 (maturity); for moderate time gap, R-2 = 0.93 (maturity) is obtained. Crops such as wheat, oats, rye and barley, can profit from the LAI-RVI synergy, with R-2 varying between 0.4 and 0.6. For beet or potatoes, MOGP provides poorer results, but alternative descriptors to RVI should be tested for these specific crops in the future before discarding synergy real benefits. In conclusion, active-passive sensor fusion with MOGP represents a novel and promising approach to cope with crop monitoring over cloud-dominated areas.

TI  - Growth and collapse of a littoral lava dome during the 2018/19 eruption of Kadovar Volcano, Papua New Guinea, analyzed by multi-sensor satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing volcanic islands and lava domes become structurally unstable, associated with sectoral collapses, explosive volcanism and related hazards. This article describes the rare case of a growing and collapsing lava dome at Kadovar Volcano, a small inhabited volcanic island located north of Papua New Guinea. The eruption began on January 5, 2018 and was monitored by multi-sensor satellite imagery, including optical, thermal and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. Results show that Kadovar began a new episode of volcanic activity at the central crater and then also at the eastern coast of the island. SAR amplitude imagery has made it possible to monitor the birth of a new peninsula on the eastern coast. This new peninsula has a blocky appearance and is associated with a localized thermal anomaly, which is indicative of an emerging lava dome. We analyzed the changes on the island and the peripheral lava dome and found that after a great increase in the size of the area, parts of the island and the lava dome then collapsed eastwardly into the ocean on February 9, 2018. The sector collapse caused small tsunami waves that hit the neighboring islands. A subsequent slower re-growth of the lava dome is evident from the satellite data, which has reached a final area of 40,000 m(2). This study provides details on the rapid growth and collapse of a peripheral lava dome and a destabilization episode in an island and dome sector, and underlines the great value of remote sensing data on remote volcanic islands.

TI  - A multi-disciplinary approach for the damage analysis of cultural heritage: The case study of the St. Gerlando Cathedral in Agrigento
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protocols for structural safety assessment methods for Cultural Heritage assets affected by ground instability phenomena have still not been standardized. Accordingly, huge attention is directed towards the development of innovative and reliable approaches for the damage analysis of the Cultural Heritage assets. Within this framework, this paper deals with an integrated approach for the combination of deformation time series, derived from the Tomographic processing of X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation, with ground-based measurements obtained by in-situ survey, laser scanner acquisition and structural analysis. The approach exploits satellite deformation measurements to validate the first interpretation of the structural behaviour of a construction threatened by ground instability based on visual inspection and the analysis of the crack pattern, when geotechnical studies and interpretation, as well as in-situ monitoring systems, are not available.The methodology has been tested on the St. Gerlando Cathedral, located on the westernmost and highest area of the Agrigento hill. The Cathedral is affected by complex ground instability phenomena, that have led to several and continuous cracks over centuries. The spatially dense Tomographic SAR measurements allows accessing differential displacement trends in the different sections of the Cathedral and thereby analyzing the overall kinematic behavior of such a complex and heterogeneous structure. This provides essential information for the definition of the structural models, which are fundamental to better understand the behavior and damage evolution of structures subject to ground instabilities and consequently address the most suitable restoration actions.

TI  - Unraveling the impacts of droughts and agricultural intensification on the Altiplano water resources
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, agriculture has drastically increased over the South American Andean Plateau (Altiplano), resulting in extensive changes in land cover from native vegetation to essentially Quinoa crop. Along with climatic variability, these land use changes appear as a catalyst in worsening the already existing drought events and water scarcity processes. Hence, understanding their relative contributions to the regional desertification process is crucial for sustainable water-use adaptation, but also is quite ambiguous because of water resource data scarcity over the Altiplano. Therefore, in the present study, an attempt to measure the impact of severe droughts and agricultural intensification on the water resources has been made using remote sensing datasets. The first step was dedicated to the validation of newly released CHIRPS v.2 precipitation and GLEAM v.3 potential evapotranspiration products by comparing their estimates with the results obtained from gauges data. Then, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to describe past hydro-meteorological drought events in terms of their spatial extent, duration, intensity and their impacts on the regional water resources. Finally, the dynamic trends in the spatial extent of the Quinoa crop and the meteorological conditions derived from CHIRPS v.2 and GLEAM v.3 were compared with the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Total Water Storage (TWS) derived from AVHRR and GRACE data respectively, to observe the respective influence of agriculture and climate variability on the regional hydrological system. A significant increase in Quinoa crop extent is observed from 2001 which corresponds to a significant decrease in regional VCI and TWS. Based on this trend, agriculture appears as a contributing factor in the water scarcity process over the Altiplano. The outcomes of this study will contribute to local decision making for a better water management and hydro-meteorological monitoring system.

TI  - Harmonizing Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2: A time-series-based reflectance adjustment approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a Time-series-based Reflectance Adjustment (TRA) approach for reducing the reflectance differences between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations. This TRA approach used the time series of matched Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations to build linear regression models to adjust reflectance differences between the two sensors for each individual pixel and each spectral band. We evaluated this approach for the NASA harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) surface reflectance product (V1.4; https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/v1.4/) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance with approximately 4 years of temporal coverage at five Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles. Using this approach, the surface reflectance difference between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 in the HLS product reduced 45% for the blue band, 42% for the green band, 38% for the red band, 30% for the Near Infrared (NIR) band, 37% for the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) 1 band, and 32% for the SWIR2 band. The TRA approach also reduced TOA reflectance difference between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 substantially, in which the blue band reduced 46%, the green and. NIR bands reduced 42%, the red band reduced 48%, and the SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands reduced 44%. If the high aerosol observations were screened, the reflectance differences in the HLS product could be further reduced by 2-4% and the TOA reflectance differences could be further reduced by 3-6% for the six spectral bands. The TRA approach has also shown good results in reserving the spatial patterns and the heterogeneity of land surface. The transformation parameters estimated from the TRA approach can be directly used for future Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 reflectance adjustment, with slightly lower (5%) reduction of reflectance difference.

TI  - Deep learning-based fusion of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images for a harmonized surface reflectance product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors together provide the most widely accessible medium-to-high spatial resolution multispectral data for a wide range of applications, such as vegetation phenology identification, crop yield estimation, and forest disturbance detection. Improved timely and accurate observations of the Earth's surface and dynamics are expected from the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which entails coordinating the spatial resolution gap between Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m or 20 m) images. However, widely used data fusion techniques may not fulfil community's needs for generating a temporally dense reflectance product at 10 m spatial resolution from combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 images because of their inherent algorithmic weaknesses. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, this study developed an extended super-resolution convolutional neural network (ESRCNN) to a data fusion framework, specifically for blending Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based fusion algorithm in yielding a consistent and comparable dataset at 10 m from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Further accuracy assessments revealed that the performance of the fusion network was influenced by both the number of input auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and temporal interval (i.e., difference in image acquisition dates) between auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and the target Landsat-8 image. Compared to the benchmark algorithm, area-to-point regression kriging (ATKPK), the deep learning-based fusion framework proved better in the quantitative assessment in terms of RMSE (root mean square error), correlation coefficient (CC), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). ESRCNN better preserved the reflectance distribution as the original image compared to ATPRK, resulting in an improved image quality. Overall, the developed data fusion network that blends Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images has the potential to help generate continuous reflectance observations of higher temporal frequency than that can be obtained from a single Landsat-like sensor.

TI  - Simple methods for satellite identification of algal blooms and species using 10-year time series data from the East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ocean color satellite missions have the ability to help monitor algal blooms. However, satellite identification of algal blooms and species in turbid coastal waters has been challenging. There is an urgent need for simple and effective methods to identify locations, areas, durations, and species present in algal blooms through satellite observation, to aid in the operational and emergency monitoring of the marine environment. In this study, based on a three-band blended model, we propose an indicator (Red tide Detection Index, RDI) that is suitable for the purpose of detecting algal blooms in turbid coastal waters using multi-source ocean color data. MERIS, MODIS, and GOCI data used for the detection of algal blooms demonstrate consistent results using the RDI indicator, and these results correlate with in situ investigations. Furthermore, based on a green-red spectral slope, we propose a method that uses MERIS data to identify dominant species of diatoms and dinoflagellates in algal blooms in the East China Sea (ECS). The 10-year time series MERIS data collected between 2003 and 2012 indicates that algal bloom occurrences are mainly distributed in the nearshore areas of the ECS, and possess a distinct climatological cycle. The 10-year time series MERIS data help discriminate diatom and dinoflagellate blooms in the ECS, and show the dissimilarity in the seasonal timing of their life cycles. We find that these two dominant species in algal blooms are usually distributed in different spatial locations in the ECS. Additionally, by defining a divergence index (DI), the limitations of spectral resolutions of satellite data used for algal bloom species differentiation are quantitatively assessed.

TI  - Estimating ground-level particulate matter concentrations using satellite-based data: a review
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is a widely used indicator of air quality. Satellite-derived aerosol products such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) have been a useful source of data for ground-level PM monitoring. However, satellite-based approaches for PM monitoring have limitations such as impacts of cloud cover. Recently, many studies have documented advances in modeling for monitoring PM over the globe. This review examines recent papers on ground-level PM monitoring for the past 10 years focusing on modeling techniques, sensor types, and areas. Satellite-based retrievals of AOD and commonly used approaches for estimating PM concentrations are also briefly reviewed. Research trends and challenges are discussed based on the review of 130 papers. The limitations and challenges include spatiotemporal scale issues, missing values in satellite-based variables, sparse distribution of ground stations for calibration and validation, unbalanced distribution of PM concentrations, and difficulty in the operational use of satellite-based PM estimation models. The literature review suggests there is room for further investigating: 1) the spatial extension of PM monitoring to global scale; 2) the synergistic use of satellite-derived products and numerical model output to improve PM estimation accuracy, gap-filling, and operational monitoring; 3) the use of more advanced modeling techniques including data assimilations; 4) the improvement of emission data quality; and 5) short-term (hours to days) PM forecasts through combining satellite data and numerical forecast model results.

TI  - Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Prognostic Molecular Signatures of Stage I Melanoma
T2  - CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Previously identified transcriptomic signatures have been based on primary and metastatic melanomas with relatively few American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I tumors, given difficulties in sampling small tumors. The advent of adjuvant therapies has highlighted the need for better prognostic and predictive biomarkers, especially for AJCC stage I and stage II disease.Experimental Design: A total of 687 primary melanoma transcriptomes were generated from the Leeds Melanoma Cohort (LMC). The prognostic value of existing signatures across all the AJCC stages was tested. Unsupervised clustering was performed, and the prognostic value of the resultant signature was compared with that of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and tested as a biomarker in three published immunotherapy datasets.Results: Previous Lund and The Cancer Genome Atlas signatures predicted outcome in the LMC dataset (P = 10(-8) to 10(-4)) but showed a significant interaction with AJCC stage (P = 0.04) and did not predict outcome in stage I tumors (P = 0.3-0.7). Consensus-based classification of the LMC dataset identified six classes that predicted outcome, notably in stage I disease. LMC class was a similar indicator of prognosis when compared with SNB, and it added prognostic value to the genes reported by Gerami and colleagues. One particular LMC class consistently predicted poor outcome in patients receiving immunotherapy in two of three tested datasets. Biological characterization of this class revealed high JUN and AXL expression and evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.Conclusions: A transcriptomic signature of primary melanoma was identified with prognostic value, including in stage I melanoma and in patients undergoing immunotherapy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addressed fracture mechanisms of nuclear fuel claddings in hypothetical Loss-Of-Coolant-Accident (LOCA) conditions. To this aim, laboratory-scale "semi-integral" thermal-mechanical tests were carried out, using an oxidation temperature of 1200 degrees C, slow cooling down to 700 degrees C and a final quench by reflooding under an axial load.Two fracture mechanisms were observed. Fracture in the burst zone was due to oxide formation and subsequent transformation of ductile beta into brittle oxygen-enriched alpha(O). The second fracture mechanism affected a region both enriched in oxygen and in hydrogen due to secondary hydriding.In the investigated conditions, fracture location was independent of burst morphology, oxidation time and axial loading. A fracture scenario as a function of the reflooding transient was proposed. Physical fracture mechanisms were elucidated with respect to microstructural evolution in these two regions. Based on the local distribution of chemical elements and phases, a fracture threshold function of the local, layered microstructure was suggested for each fracture location. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In environments where livelihoods depend on surface-water storage (SWS) structures, satellite altimetry-derived water levels are often unavailable. Therefore, seasonal reservoirs require a robust and cost-effective approach for estimating SWS. To approximate SWS throughout a typical environmental setting where irrigation reservoirs are found, we investigate the utility of TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) to extract bathymetry of seasonal reservoir structures. Empirically-derived SWS relationships are combined with estimates of SW area from radar and multisource optical satellites to illustrate the potential for rapid SWS estimation using satellite-based SW extent as input. Two application examples illustrate the approach: (i) estimating the maximum volume of water in a southern Indian river basin for two monsoon seasons; and (ii) a time-series analysis using a high-volume of satellite observations to show the cycle of water (inflow and outflow) at the reservoir scale. SWS volumes at water levels below 1.5 m were estimated within an absolute volume error range of 6-8%. This study illustrates the applicability and challenges of using satellite remote sensing observations to continuously monitor reservoir SWS. Despite the cloud independent capability for operational monitoring of SW area, Sentinel-1 data should be combined with frequent and high spatial resolution CubeSat observations for hydrometric monitoring of reservoirs to reduce observation errors. Furthermore, we highlight the multi-sensor approach (optical and radar) to achieve high spatio-temporal resolution monitoring of small reservoirs over large spatial scales.

TI  - Residual Dense Network for Pan-Sharpening Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is a multi-sensor fusion task that aims to enhance the spatial resolution of spectral data using panchromatic data of the same scene. This work proposes a deep Residual Dense Model (RDM) for Pan-Sharpening (PS) of satellite data which learns hierarchical features that can efficiently represent the local complex structures from panchromatic data. This work addresses the two general problems emphasized in pan-sharpening application viz., spectral and spatial preservation. The proposed Residual Dense Model for Pan-Sharpening network (RDMPSnet), preserves the spectral information by spectral mapping of Low-Resolution Multi-Spectral data (LRMS) while the spatial preservation is achieved by learning the hierarchical structural features from High-Resolution Panchromatic data (HRP). To extract this structural feature RDMPSnet is trained end to end with Low Resolution (LR) panchromatic patches and High Resolution (HR) residue patches to learn a non-linear mapping. The trained non-linear mapping network is capable to generate structural feature for any LRMS data which is injected into the mapped spectral data. The network is experimentally evaluated with Worldview2 and IKONOS2 satellite data and shows that the proposed RDMPS achieves favorable performance both visually and quantitatively against state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - A three-source satellite algorithm for retrieving all-sky evapotranspiration rate using combined optical and microwave vegetation index at twenty AsiaFlux sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) composed of transpiration from vegetation (ETveg) and evaporation from soil (ETsoil) and interception water (ETint) is a crucial process for driving global water and energy cycle. In this study, a three-source satellite ET algorithm is developed for estimating instantaneous ET rate (ETcal) under clear and non-rainy cloudy sky conditions and is validated at 20 AsiaFlux sites of multiple vegetation types (evergreen and deciduous forests, croplands and grasslands) in East Asia. The ET algorithm is completely independent from ground-based measurements and thus has the potential to be used on regional scale. All-sky surface net radiation flux is derived from satellite products. Satellite optical Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to partition the surface available energy into vegetated area and bare soil area. Satellite microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI), an indicator of vegetation water content, is utilized to estimate canopy resistance and transpiration from vegetation. Evaporation components from canopy interception water and soil surface are estimated based on Priestley-Taylor method. The estimated evaporation fraction (EF) for all sites can produce a small absolute bias of less than 0.03 (or 8.1%) with a good determination coefficient (R-2) larger than 0.42 when validated against the corrected in-situ measured EF on instantaneous and long-term mean scales. Instantaneous ETcal under all sky conditions are found to have a R-2 of 0.61, a bias of 16.5 Wm(-2) (13.7%) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 63.6 Wm(-2) (52.5%) over all sites, respectively. The performances of this algorithm are better achieved on 16-day (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 44.1 Wm(-2)) and monthly (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 39.1 Wm(-2)) scales. More importantly, EDVI-based ET method is able to produce ETcal with stable and good accuracy from clear sky to overcast sky (bias < 22 Wm(-2) or 18%, RMSE < 77 Wm(-2) or 59%). The daily ET and its components (ETveg, ETsoil and ETint) derived from our algorithm are further compared with those from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET products. EDVI-based ET (EDVI-ET) generally shows equal performances with GLEAM-ET when using in-situ ET as reference. EDVI-ET veg shows a fairly good correlation (R-2 = 0.21) and an underestimation of -0.32 mm/day compared with GLEAM-ETveg. EDVI-ETint shows a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.30) with GLEAM-ETveg after excluding three outlier tropical forest sites. Meanwhile, EDVI-ETsoil shows a fairly good positive correlation (R-2 = 0.15) and an overestimation of 0.23 mm/day compared with GLEAMET, ETsoil] . The results indicate that our method has great potential for regional ET estimation under various cloud conditions when combined with satellite optical and microwave remote sensing.

TI  - No pixel left behind: Toward integrating Earth Observations for agriculture into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.

TI  - An empirical algorithm to seamlessly retrieve the concentration of suspended particulate matter from water color across ocean to turbid river mouths
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a globally applicable algorithm (GAA(SPM)) to seamlessly retrieve the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) (C-SPM) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) across ocean to turbid river mouths without any hard-switching in its application. GAA(SPM) is based on a calibrated relationship between C-SPM and a generalized index for SPM (GI(SPM)) from water color. The GI(SPM) is mainly composed of three R-rs(lambda) ratios (671, 745, and 862 nm over 551 nm, respectively), along with weighting factors assigned to each ratio. The weighting factors are introduced to ensure the progressive application of R-rs(lambda) in the longer wavelengths for increasing C-SPM. Calibration of GAA(SPM) employed data collected from multiple estuarine and coastal regions of Europe, China, Argentina, and the USA with the measured C-SPM spanning from 0.2 to 2068.8 mg/L. Inter-comparison with several recalibrated well-known C-SPM retrieval algorithms demonstrates that GAA(SPM) has the best retrieval accuracy over the entire C-SPM range with a relative mean absolute difference (rMAD) of 41.3% (N = 437). This averaged uncertainty in GAA(SPM) -derived C-SPM is mostly attributed to the retrievals from less turbid waters where C-SPM < 50 mg/L (rMAD = 50%, N = 214). GAP(SPM) was further applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements over prominent coastal areas and produced reliable C-SPM maps along with realistic spatial patterns. In contrast, applications of other C-SPM algorithms resulted in less reliable C-SPM maps with either unjustified numerical discontinuities in the C-SPM spatial distribution or unsatisfactory retrieval accuracy. Therefore, we propose GAA(SPM) as a preferred algorithm to retrieve C-SPM over regions with a wide range of C-SPM, such as river plume areas.

TI  - A multi-frequency framework for soil moisture retrieval from time series radar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased availability of spaceborne radar data projected over the next decade provides a great opportunity for operational soil moisture mapping with high spatial ( < 50 m) and temporal ( < 3 days) resolution, by combining the data from multiple SAR missions. Accordingly, a multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval framework has been proposed, being applicable for SAR missions operating at the commonly used remote sensing frequencies of L-, C- and X-band. A combination of numerical, physical and semi-empirical scattering models was selected to build a series of forward modeling look up tables (LUTs) covering the typical radar configurations and nature surface conditions. An unsupervised change detection method was integrated to identify areas with abrupt roughness and vegetation changes, so that time-series data collected from different SARs can be combined with the assumption of time-invariant roughness and vegetation. The multi-frequency backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) with negligible scattering from soil surface (equivalent to calibration uncertainty) was then removed before soil moisture retrieval. Finally, soil moisture retrieval was carried out independently for each landcover type using an optimization method and forward LUTs. Evaluation based on the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment-5 dataset consisting of L-band airborne data, C-band RADARSAT-2 data and X-band COSMO-SkyMed data showed an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.058 cm(3)/cm(3) at the paddock scale (similar to 0.1 - 0.5 km). The comparison with single and dual frequency retrieval suggests that multi-frequency retrieval is not necessary to have the highest accuracy. However, it is still valuable to joint use multi-frequency data consider the limited deterioration in accuracy and the significantly enhanced temporal resolution.

TI  - An Assessment and Improvement of Satellite Ocean Color Algorithms for the Tropical Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical Pacific Ocean is a globally significant region of climate-driven biogeochemical variability. Satellite ocean color algorithms have been used for over 20 years, providing a substantial historical record of global ocean chlorophyll-a variability. Current chlorophyll algorithms perform better in the tropical Pacific than for the globe. Nevertheless, improvements can be made to produce a robust historical record of chlorophyll variability, which is essential to accurately identify ocean-atmosphere carbon fluxes and long-term trends in ocean productivity. We use a large in situ chlorophyll database to tune empirical ocean color algorithms to reduce bias in the equatorial Pacific. Traditional band ratio chlorophyll algorithms (OCx) perform adequately but exhibit errors at low chlorophyll concentrations. A new algorithm, the Ocean Color Index (OCI; Hu et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007395), is more effective at calculating low chlorophyll concentrations in the mesotrophic tropical Pacific Ocean. Existing ocean color algorithms underestimate tropical Pacific chlorophyll by 5.8%, 14%, and 2% for three satellite ocean color sensors: SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, and MERIS. In this paper, we develop regionally tuned sensor-specific coefficients and blending windows between the OCI to OCx algorithms to reduce systematic biases in the tropical Pacific. We assess cross-sensor consistency to produce robust 21-year time series trends. These updated estimates increase chlorophyll concentrations in open water and decrease around island and warm-pool regions, with implications for our understanding of El Nino-Southern Oscillation driven carbon fluxes and net primary productivity.

TI  - Modeling spatial pattern of dengue in North Central Mexico using survey data and logistic regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue is a major public health concern mainly in tropical and subtropical environments worldwide. Despite several attempts to prevent this disease occurring in tropical regions of Mexico, it has not yet been controlled. This work focused on spatial modeling of confirmed dengue fever cases that occurred during the period 2010-2014 in the Huasteca Potosina region of Mexico. Multivariable Logistic Regression Modeling (MLRM) was used to determine the relationship between explanatory variables and the presence/absence of dengue. Model performance was evaluated using the area under curve (AUC) of the relative operating characteristic (ROC); AUC > 0.95. A high spatial resolution map was created to reveal the most probable patterns of dengue risk. Our results can be used for targeted control and prevention programs at local and regional levels. This methodology can be applied to other major diseases that are spatially distributed in accordance with environmental factors.

TI  - Mid-Infrared Optical Constants of Labradorite, a Triclinic Plagioclase Mineral
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plagioclase feldspar is the most abundant rock-forming mineral in the crust of the Earth, Moon, and Mars and is also an important component in some minor bodies in the Solar System. The distribution, abundance, and precise composition of plagioclase on planetary surfaces from remote sensing data are important measurements for evaluating changing conditions during magma evolution. Optical constants are critical input parameters in radiative transfer theory, which enables modeling of spectra for the extraction of mineral abundances and grain sizes from a remotely sensed spectrum. Mid-infrared (MIR) optical constants of most triclinic rock-forming minerals are not available due to the complexity associated with the derivation of optical constants of low-symmetry minerals. In this work, we have calculated the MIR optical constants of a labradorite single crystal using dispersion theory and laboratory reflectance spectra at non-normal incidence. The optical constants we derived here will assist in modeling spectra in the MIR region and quantifying mineral composition, particle size, and abundances from remote sensing data.

TI  - Vegetation Response to Recent Trends in Climate and Landuse Dynamics in a Typical Humid and Dry Tropical Region under Global Change
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of global change on vegetation cover and processes has drawn increasing attention in the past few decades. In this study, we used remotely sensed rainfall and land surface temperature to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern and trend in vegetation condition using NDVI as proxy from 2001 to 2017 in a humid and dry tropical region. We also determined the partial correlation coefficient of temperature and rainfall with NDVI and the response of NDVI to changes in landcover categories due to human activities. We found that the mean annual maximum NDVI was 0.42, decreasing at a rate of 0.06 per decade. About 27.4% of the area was found to have experienced a significant negative trend in vegetation cover, while only 0.34% exhibited significant increasing vegetation vigour. Land surface temperature increased at a mean rate of 0.75 degrees C/decade, with higher rates in agriculture, savanna, settlements, woodlands, and riparian vegetation than in forest and mangrove vegetations. Precipitation also reduced at a mean rate of 58.69 mm/decade, with higher rates in agriculture savanna and riparian vegetation than in sahelian grasslands, mangrove, forest, and woodlands. NDVI was negatively correlated with temperature in savanna, settlements, degraded forest, and sahelian grasslands providing confirmation of ongoing land degradation. It was concluded that vegetation vigour will continue to decline under rainfall and increasing temperature conditions especially in dryer regions. The use of land surface temperature in this study is particularly valuable in highlighting areas where changes in NDVI occurred as a result of synergistic action between climate and human-induced landcover changes. Our findings underscore the importance of landuse policies that account for spatial variation in synergistic relationships between the nexus of climate and land conversion processes that influence vegetation cover change in different landcover types in tropical regions.

TI  - Contribution of changing precipitation and climatic oscillations in explaining variability of water extents of large reservoirs in Pakistan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major threat that Pakistan faces today is water scarcity and any significant change in water availability from storage reservoirs coupled with below normal precipitation threatens food security of more than 207 million people. Two major reservoirs of Tarbela and Mang la on Indus and Jhelum rivers are studied. Landsat satellite's data are used to estimate the water extents of these reservoirs during 1981-2017. A long-term significant decrease of 15-25% decade(-1) in water extent is found for Tarbela as compared to 37-70% decade(-1) for Mangla, mainly during March to June. Significant water extents reductions are observed in the range of -23.9 to -53.4 km(2) (1991-2017) and -63.1 to -52.3 km(2) (2001-2010 and 2011-2017) for Tarbela and Mang la, respectively. The precipitation amount and areas receiving this precipitation show a significant decreasing trend of -4.68 to -8.40 mm year(-1) and -358.1 to -309.9 km(2) year(-1) for basins of Mangla and Tarbela, respectively. The precipitation and climatic oscillations are playing roles in variability of water extents. The ensuing multiple linear regression models predict water extents with an average error of 13% and 16% for Tarbela and Mangla, respectively.

AB  - In this paper litho-sedimentological and morphodynamic maps of the coastal sector belonging to the Pisa Province are presented as an example of how increasing the accessibility to data on lithology, sedimentology, and morphodynamics may lead to a better approach to coastal management. The database used to build the maps includes an original rendering of remote sensing data (aerial imagery) and new field data (geologic survey), as well as data retrieved from the scientific literature (grain-size and past coastline positions). The maps show that the geometry of beach ridges is an indication of the evolution of the Arno River delta in the last 3000 years, highlighting the relationships between geological aspects and morphodynamic features. The maps represent the synthesis of different data available in the database, and they may be a useful support to coastal management as they are more easily understandable and straightforward than the database from which are created.

TI  - Deep Ecology and Ecofeminism: Social Work to Address Global Environmental Crisis
T2  - AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - There is emerging global agreement that environmental change is one of the greatest threats to ecosystems, culture, health, and economies of humankind. In response to these environmental changes and the expected human vulnerability they will continue to produce, the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare has highlighted intervention to address the human impacts of the changing climate as one of the profession's grand challenges. This article troubles the often anthropocentric worldview from which such responses emerge and proposes a framework informed by the wisdom of deep ecology and ecofeminism. Born from critical methodologies that question the rigid bifurcation and valuation of male/female and human/nonhuman, these perspectives invite social workers to think in novel ways about environmental challenges. We argue that the social work profession, which has historically sought to disturb power dynamics and reprioritize society's needs, is uniquely situated to think holistically about responding to this crisis. By honoring the interrelated nature of human and nonhumankind, social workers can more mindfully lead the social planning and advocacy efforts necessary to meet this grand challenge.

M3  - Article
AB  - A preliminary assessment of real-time multi-satellite precipitation products, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) IMERG real time (IMRT), TMPA 3B42 real time (TMPA), PERSIANN (PERS) and CMORPH (CMOR) was carried out in Pakistan on entire study area basis and by dividing the study area in to five regions. It is extended from 61(o)to 77(o)East and 23.5(o)to 37(o)North, with varied climatic and topographic conditions. In south coastline along the Arabian Sea, plateaus, deserts and plain areas in the center and in north snow caped mountains. A set of evaluating (continuous) statistical indices, correlation coefficient (CC), bias (Bias), root mean square error (RMSE) and detective (categorical) statistical indices, probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), critical success index (CSI) were applied to evaluate the satellite products against rain gauge data at daily time scales. However CC values were computed at monthly time scale and comparison between average annual values of satellite data and gauge values was also conducted. At annual basis significant resemblance was observed between spatial distribution of satellite and gauge data. At monthly time scale satellite products showed correlation in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 against reference data at major portion of the study area. But at daily time scale a weak correlation from 0.2 to 0.45, higher values of bias and RMSE in hilly terrains with highest average annual rainfall and the adjacent foot hill areas as compared to the plain areas, lower values of POD, CSI and higher values of FAR were observed. An inter comparison among the used satellite products revealed that overall performance of IMRT was better in the study area.

TI  - Mesoscale and synoptic scale dynamic phenomena in the Oyashio current region observed in SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite SAR images are an essential source of information on mesoscale and sub-mesoscale dynamic phenomena in the ocean with a resolution of 4-1000 m. They can be obtained irrespective of cloudiness and sun illumination. In this paper, the dynamic features in the large region in the Northwest Pacific associated with the cold Oyashio Current are considered. The combination of the Oyashio and Kuroshio currents, strong tides, and sharp changes in the topography of the Pacific Ocean shelf along the Kuril and Japan Islands together with storm winds accompanying the deep extratropical cyclones leads to a complicated water circulation. In the investigation, the attention is focused on dominant dynamic features including mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies, streamers and internal waves. They play a key role in physical and biological fluxes between waters of different origin. Under a clear sky, the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale features visualize themselves through prominent thermal and biological contrasts; however, under cloudy conditions, they can be detected in the sea surface roughness fields. The sea surface roughness contrasts caused by oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are observed on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by Envisat ASAR and Sentinel-1A/-1B C-SAR at C-band and mainly by ALOS-1/-2 PALSAR at L-band at various polarizations. Spatial characteristics and seasonal features of the sub-mesoscale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena have been revealed on SAR images. The satellite visible and infrared images (NOAA AVHRR, Terra and Aqua MODIS, Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS, SNPP VIIRS) and various products (SST, chlorophyll-a concentration, surface analysis map, etc.) substantially complemented the SAR data.

TI  - A neural network radiative transfer model approach applied to the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument aerosol height algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - To retrieve aerosol properties from satellite measurements of the oxygen A-band in the near-infrared, a line-by-line radiative transfer model implementation requires a large number of calculations. These calculations severely restrict a retrieval algorithm's operational capability as it can take several minutes to retrieve the aerosol layer height for a single ground pixel. This paper proposes a forward modelling approach using artificial neural networks to speed up the retrieval algorithm. The forward model outputs are trained into a set of neural network models to completely replace line-by-line calculations in the operational processor. Results comparing the forward model to the neural network alternative show an encouraging outcome with good agreement between the two when they are applied to retrieval scenarios using both synthetic and real measured spectra from TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on board the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-5 Precursor mission. With an enhancement of the computational speed by 3 orders of magnitude, TROPOMI's operational aerosol layer height processor is now able to retrieve aerosol layer heights well within operational capacity.

TI  - The Universal Cloud and Aerosol Sounding System (UCASS): a low-cost miniature optical particle counter for use in dropsonde or balloon-borne sounding systems
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A low-cost miniaturized particle counter has been developed by The University of Hertfordshire (UH) for the measurement of aerosol and droplet concentrations and size distributions. The Universal Cloud and Aerosol Sounding System (UCASS) is an optical particle counter (OPC), which uses wide-angle elastic light scattering for the high-precision sizing of fluid-borne particulates. The UCASS has up to 16 configurable size bins, capable of sizing particles in the range 0.4-40 mu m in diameter. Unlike traditional particle counters, the UCASS is an open-geometry system that relies on an external air flow. Therefore, the instrument is suited for use as part of a dropsonde, balloon-borne sounding system, as part of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or on any measurement platform with a known air flow. Data can be logged autonomously using an on-board SD card, or the device can be interfaced with commercially available meteorological sondes to transmit data in real time. The device has been deployed on various research platforms to take measurements of both droplets and dry aerosol particles. Comparative results with co-located instrumentation in both laboratory and field settings show good agreement for the sizing and counting ability of the UCASS.

TI  - Vegetation dynamic analysis based on multisource remote sensing data in the east margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the vegetation dynamic caused by global environmental change in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (EMQTP). The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is one of the most sensitive areas responding to global environmental change, particularly global climate change, and has been recognized as a hotspot for coupled studies on changes in global terrestrial ecosystems and global climates. An important component of terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation dynamic has become a key issue in global environmental change, and numerous case studies have been conducted on vegetation dynamic trends using multi-source data and multi-scale methods across different study periods. The EMQTP is regarded as a transitional area located between the QTP and the Sichuan basin, and has special geographical and climatic conditions. Although this area is ecologically fragile and sensitive to climate change, few studies about vegetation dynamics have been carried out in this area. Thus, in this study, we used long-term series datasets of GIMMS 3g NDVI and VGT/PROBA-V NDVI to analyze the vegetation dynamics and phenological changes from 1982 to 2018. Validation was performed based on Landsat NDVI and Vegetation Index & Phenology (VIP) data. The results reveal that the year 1998 was a vital turning point in the start of growing season (SGS) in vegetation ecosystems. Before this turning point, the SGS had an average slope of 9.2 days/decade, and after, the average slope was 3.9 days/decade. The length of growing season (LGS) was slightly prolonged between 1982 to 2015. Additionally, the largest national alpine wetland grassland experienced significant vegetation degradation; in autumn, the degraded area accounted for 63.4%. Vegetation degradation had also appeared in the arid valleys of the Yalong River and the Jinsha River. Through validation analysis, we found that the main causes of vegetation degradation are the natural degradation of wetland grassland and human activities, specifically agricultural development and residential area expansion.

TI  - Impacts of climate variability and landscape pattern change on evapotranspiration in a grassland landscape mosaic
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), a key component of the hydrological cycle, affects the transport of water and energy in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. Thus, quantifying the driving forces of ET dynamics is important to ensure rational water resource utilization. Based on meteorological and satellite data, spatiotemporal dynamics of ET were detected using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, and effects of climate variability and landscape pattern change on ET dynamics in an arid to semiarid landscape mosaic during the growing season (April-October) from 2001 to 2015 in Xilingol League, China were evaluated. The results indicated that (a) a significant increase (P < .05) in ET was found in the north-eastern Xilingol League, and a significant decrease (P < .05) in ET was confined to the southwest and (b) climate variability had significant effects on ET dynamics. All climatic factors showed a positive correlation relationship with ET dynamics, and mean temperature (Ta) was the most influential climatic factor on ET dynamics followed by relative humidity (Rh), wind speed (Ws), and precipitation (Pr), respectively. The influence of landscape pattern change on ET dynamics was mainly reflected in the increase of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) promoting ET dynamics. Several other landscape pattern metrics also had important impacts on ET dynamics, which were mainly reflected in the positive effect of the aggregation index (AI) on ET dynamics and the negative effects of the largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), and percentage of landscape (PLAND) on ET dynamics. To promote effective water resource utilization, landscape managers should continue to moderately implement vegetation restoration projects such as the Grain for Green Project, orient with conversion of low-quality cropland into grassland, and conserve large areas of grassland. Appropriate management measures for forests and cropland scattered in the landscape mosaic, based on local climate and soil properties, as well as socioeconomic goals, are also required.

TI  - TOPMELT 1.0: a topography-based distribution function approach to snowmelt simulation for hydrological modelling at basin scale
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced temperature-index distributed models for snowpack simulation, incorporating air temperature and a term for clear sky potential solar radiation, are increasingly used to simulate the spatial variability of the snow water equivalent. This paper presents a new snowpack model (termed TOPMELT) which integrates an enhanced temperature-index model into the ICHYMOD semi-distributed basin-scale hydrological model by exploiting a statistical representation of the distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation. This is obtained by discretizing the full spatial distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation into a number of radiation classes. The computation required to generate a spatially distributed water equivalent reduces to a single calculation for each radiation class. This turns into a potentially significant advantage when parameter sensitivity and uncertainty estimation procedures are carried out. The radiation index may be also averaged in time over given time periods. Thus, the model resembles a classical temperature-index model when only one radiation class for each elevation band and a temporal aggregation of 1 year is used, whereas it approximates a fully distributed model by increasing the number of the radiation classes and decreasing the temporal aggregation. TOPMELT is integrated within the semi-distributed ICHYMOD model and is applied at an hourly time step over the Aurino Basin (also known as the Ahr River) at San Giorgio (San Giorgio Aurino), a 614 km(2) catchment in the Upper Adige River basin (eastern Alps, Italy) to examine the sensitivity of the snowpack and runoff model results to the spatial and temporal aggregation of the radiation fluxes. It is shown that the spatial simulation of the snow water equivalent is strongly affected by the aggregation scales. However, limited degradation of the snow simulations is achieved when using 10 radiation classes and 4 weeks as spatial and temporal aggregation scales respectively. Results highlight that the effects of space-time aggregation of the solar radiation patterns on the runoff response are scale dependent. They are minimal at the scale of the whole Aurino Basin, while considerable impact is seen at a basin scale of 5 km(2).

TI  - Ongoing forest disturbance in Guatemala's protected areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas in Guatemala provide habitat for diverse tropical ecosystems, contain ancient archeological sites, sequester carbon, and support economic activity through eco-tourism. However, many of the forests in these protected areas have been converted to other uses or degraded by human activity, and therefore are considered "paper parks". In this study, we analyzed time series of satellite data to monitor deforestation, degradation, and natural disturbance throughout Guatemala from 2000 to 2017. A recently developed methodology, Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED), was used to detect forest disturbances of varying size and magnitude. Through sample-based statistical inference, we estimated that 854 137 ha (+/- 83 133 ha) were deforested and 1 012 947 ha (+/- 139 512 ha) of forest was disturbed but not converted during our study period. Forest disturbance in protected areas ranged from under 1% of a park's area to over 95%. Our estimate of the extent of deforestation is similar to previous studies, however, degradation and natural disturbance affect a larger area. These results suggest that the total amount of forest disturbance can be significantly underestimated if degradation and natural disturbance are not taken into account. As a consequence, we found that the protected areas of Guatemala are more affected by disturbance than previously realized.

TI  - Indeterminateness in industrial and organisational psychological research: A root metaphor analysis
T2  - SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Problematisation: Efendic and Van Zyl (2019) attribute the so-called replication crisis in psychological research and industrial and organisational (I/O) psychological research in particular to a series of systemic issues. Be that as it may, their opinion does not consider the worldview/world hypothesis/world theory/paradigm with its distinct, underlying logic/cognitive pathway and root metaphor in which the replication crisis is embedded.Implications: By considering the worldview in which they operate, researchers and practitioners may come to understand the basis of the reproducibility and replicability challenge in psychological research. By ignoring it, those researchers and practitioners may become increasingly frustrated with their research efforts. By understanding it, they should appreciate and value Efendic and Van Zyl's (2019) recommended strategies.Purpose: The purpose of this rebuttal in the form of an opinion paper is not to provide an opposing argument or dispute but rather to offer an extension to, or refinement of, these authors' opinion. This effort is initiated by the following question: what is the problem of indeterminateness (suggested by the replication crisis), which is endemic to the dominant I/O psychological research paradigm? By going beyond the systemic issues identified by Efendic and Van Zyl, this problem is addressed on a worldview level.Recommendation: In view of the evidence provided, it is concluded that - contrary to belief - psychologists employ a formistic, rather than a mechanistic, root metaphor or logic. As imprecision is an inherent weakness of formism, psychologists who research and practise from this worldview have no choice but to adhere to the recommendations or strategies proposed by Efendic and Van Zyl. In doing so, however, they will not be able to completely do away with the problem of indeterminateness in I/O psychology, but these authors' recommended strategies will provide them with the means for dealing with this weakness inherent in their research paradigm in a responsible manner.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse spatial resolution (CSR) time series have been successfully used at regional scale to produce homogeneous and up-to-date forest cover maps. This study aims to classify CSR time series using a nomenclature as detailed as national forest inventories nomenclatures. To identify best practices for classifying time series, three algorithms are compared: maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and random forest. For each algorithm, training, temporal compositing, and selection of input features have been optimized Results establish a clear improvement in classification accuracy when red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared spectral bands are used instead of vegetation indices. Temporal compositing has a major impact when the whole phenological cycle is used for 3 consecutive years. Random forest produces the best classification, support vector machine appears to be sensitive to overtraining, and maximum likelihood is unable to deal with the complex characteristics of forest and natural vegetation classes.

TI  - Area extraction and spatiotemporal characteristics of winter wheat-summer maize in Shandong Province using NDVI time series
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing to rapidly and accurately obtain information on the spatiotemporal distribution of large-scale wheat and maize acreage is of great significance for improving the level of food production management and ensuring food security. We constructed a MODIS-NDVI time series dataset, combined linear interpolation and the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series algorithm to smooth the time series data curve, and classified the data with random forest algorithms. The results show that winter wheat-summer maize planting areas were mainly distributed in the western plains, southern region, and north-eastern part of the middle mountainous regions while the eastern hilly regions were less distributed and scattered. The winter wheat-summer maize planting areas in the study area continued to grow from 2004-2016, with the most significant growth in the northern part of the western plains and Yellow River Delta. The spatial planting probability reflected the planting core area and showed an intensive planting pattern. During the study period, the peak value and time for the NDVI of the winter wheat were significantly different and showed an increasing trend, while these parameters for the summer maize were relatively stable with little change. Therefore, we mapped a spatial distribution of the winter wheat and summer maize, using the time series data pre-processing synthesis and phenology curve random forest classification methods. Through precision analysis, we obtained satisfactory results, which provided a straightforward and efficient method to monitor the winter wheat and summer maize.

TI  - Supervised fusion approach of local features extracted from SAR images for detecting deforestation changes
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation has become a major problem consisting of a continuous regression of forested areas in the world, and for this purpose, an efficient detection of these changes has become more than necessary. In this work, a new method for deforestation change detection is proposed. This approach is based on a supervised fusion of local texture features extracted from SAR images. ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) multi-temporal data have been used in this work. Normalised radar cross-section (NRCS) and polarimetric features extracted from HH and HV polarised data allowed recognising different categories of land covers termed as NRCS classification. Grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features were extracted by using a different moving window sizes applied on local regions previously obtained by binarisation of the NRCS results. A total of 300 samples of regions and five GLCM characteristics have been used here. The detection of deforestation appears clearly in the resulted images with a very satisfactory precision of the reached regions, and the obtained results of the proposed supervised approach have indeed led to very good detection results of the deforestation change.

TI  - Reproducing Protocol-Based Studies Using Parameterizable Tools-Comparison of Analytic Approaches Used by Two Medical Product Surveillance Networks
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Sentinel System and the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) are two medical product safety surveillance networks. Using Sentinel's preprogrammed, parameterizable analytic tools, we reproduced two protocol-based studies conducted by CNODES to assess the risks of acute pancreatitis and heart failure (HF) associated with the use of incretin-based drugs, compared with use of >= 2 oral hypoglycemic agents. Results from the replication new-user cohort analyses aligned with those from the CNODES nested case-control studies. The adjusted hazard ratios were 0.95 (0.81-1.12; vs. 1.03 (0.87-1.22) in CNODES) for acute pancreatitis and 0.91 (0.84-1.00; vs. 0.82 (0.67-1.00) in CNODES) for HF among patients without HF history. The CNODES's common protocol approach allows studies tailored to specific safety questions, whereas the Sentinel's common data model plus pretested program approach enables more rapid analysis. Despite these differences, it is possible to obtain comparable results using both approaches.

It highlights the fact that the BUSA' s mission orientation, predominantly evangelism and church planting, is still embedded in the colonial perspectives influenced by the thoughts of the 19th-century missiologists Henry Venn and Rufus Anderson. Hence, the key argument of this article is that the BUSA's mission orientation should be released from these colonial perspectives in order to give way to the emergence of an authentic and contextual Baptist missiona I agency in South Africa. A scrutiny of the BUSA reveals that it faces threefold challenges, namely, historical, philosophical and methodological challenges. Failure to address these challenges has (1) robbed the BUSA of imagination to measure up to contemporary contextual issues, (2) made it predominantly otherworldly in worldview and mainly membership-centred in focus and (3) made it embrace and practice on the ground 'missionary activist' and 'conversionist' reductionist shortcuts. To move forward, the BUSA is called to go through continuous conversions and reflexive process as a prerequisite for a deep transformation experience. This article concludes by contributing three solutions, namely, generating new mission insights befitting the South African context shou Id involve the collective, avoid missionary reductionist shortcuts by opting for an integrated and holistic mission praxis and embrace participatory action research as a way forward for BUSA's mission agenda.

TI  - Integrating Standard Precipitation Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index for near-real-time drought monitoring in Eswatini
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Eswatini, as the rest of southern Africa, is being frequented by drought over the last decade, and modelling experts are predicting that drought years will become more and severe. The expected increase in extreme climatic events makes the use of drought indices essential for drought monitoring and early warning. To enable Eswatini to better prepare, analyse and respond to drought, this study analysed the use of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Standard Precipitation index (SPD for near-real-time drought monitoring through the development of a model for drought severity. Meteorological stations across all agroecological zones with data for the period 1986-2017 were selected for analysis. The SPI computation was achieved through DrinC software. Primary NDVI data sources were CHIRPS gridded rainfall dataset and the MODIS NDVI CMG data. Results of the 3-month SPI indicated that moderate droughts were experienced in 1990/1991, 2005/2006, 2011/2012, 2012/2013 and 2015/2016. The Highveld and Middleveld had the lowest drought occurrence percentage of 3.3%, whereas the likelihood of having a moderate, severe and extreme drought was higher in the Lowveld. The study determined a positive correlation between the SPI and the NDVI at 3-month time scale, and a value of Y (drought severity) greater than 0.54 indicated a significant dry spell and could be used as a drought trigger threshold for early warning. The combined use of NDVI and SPI was deemed capable of providing a near-real-time indicator for drought conditions allowing planners to provide timely information for drought preparedness, mitigation and response planning, thereby helping to lower the eventual drought relief costs, protect food security and reduce the humanitarian impact on the population.

TI  - Evaluation of new generation macrolides for the treatment and metaphylaxis of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in cattle experimentally infected with <i>Mycoplasma mycoides</i> subspecies <i>mycoides</i>
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides (Mmm) is an important disease of cattle that causes serious economic losses. With the known effectiveness of new generation macrolides, tulathromycin and gamithromycin were assessed in comparison with oxytetracycline as a positive control and saline as a negative control for effectiveness in inhibiting lung lesion development, promoting resolution, preventing spread and bacteriological clearance in susceptible local cattle breeds in two separate studies in Kenya and Zambia. Animals were monitored for clinical signs, sero-conversion as well as detailed post-mortem examination for CBPP lesions. Results Using the Hudson and Turner score for lesion type and size, tulathromycin protected 90%, gamithromycin 80%, and oxytetracycline 88% of treated animals in Kenya. In Zambia, all animals (100%) treated with macrolides were free of lung lesions, while oxytetracycline protected 77.5%. Using the mean adapted Hudson and Turner score, which includes clinical signs, post-mortem findings and serology, tulathromycin protected 82%, gamithromycin 56% and oxytetracycline 80% of the animals in Kenya whereas in Zambia, tulathromycin protected 98%, gamithromycin 94% and oxytetracycline 80%. The saline-treated groups had 93 and 92% lesions in Kenya and Zambia respectively, with Mmm recovered from 5/14 in Kenya and 10/13 animals in Zambia. Whereas the groups treated with macrolides were free from lesions in Zambia, in Kenya 5/15 tulathromycin-treated animals and 6/15 gamithromycin-treated animals showed lesions. Oxytetracycline-treated animals showed similarities with 3/14 and 4/15 showing lesions in Zambia and Kenya respectively and Mmm recovery from one animal in Kenya and six in Zambia. In both studies, lesion scores of saline-treated groups were significantly higher than those of the antibiotic treated groups (p < 0.001). In sentinel animals, CBPP lesions were detected and Mmm recovered from one and two animals mixed with the saline-treated groups in Kenya and Zambia respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated that tulathromycin, a mycoplasmacidal, can achieve metaphylactic protection of up to 80%, while non-recovery of Mmm from sentinels suggests macrolides effectiveness in preventing spread of Mmm. It is recommended that further studies are conducted to evaluate strategies comparing vaccination alone or combining vaccination and antibiotics to control or eradicate CBPP.

TI  - The voice of minority faith and worldview students in post-primary schools with a Catholic ethos in Ireland
T2  - IRISH EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Review
AB  - This article gives voice to students of minority faith and worldview regarding their lived experiences of attending Irish post-primary schools with a Catholic ethos. The importance of listening to students' voice is supported by Article 12 of the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child (1992). The research methodology was qualitative, involving interviews with 18 post-primary students of minority faith or worldview. Gramsci's writings on cultural hegemony were then used as a theoretical lens to understand the emergent themes. The results suggest an operational Catholic hegemony in the participating schools, which is evidenced by Catholic-centric practices. Resultant inequalities exist in the facilitation for minority faith and worldview students to manifest their faith compared with Catholic students. Opting out of religion class is problematic, and the findings raise concerns, as it is evident that students' human right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is not a reality in their schools (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article18, 1948). It appears that a tacit arrangement exists whereby non-Catholic students resign themselves to conforming to Catholic school practices. On the other hand, students expressed positivity about their schools' ethos and wish to be educated together.

TI  - Deriving intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves using downscaled in situ rainfall assimilated with remote sensing data
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves play an important role in water resources engineering and management. The applications of IDF curves range from assessing rainfall events, classifying climatic regimes, to deriving design storms and assisting in designing urban drainage systems, etc. The deriving procedure of IDF curves, however, requires long-term historical rainfall observations, whereas lack of fine-timescale rainfall records (e.g. subdaily) often results in less reliable IDF curves. This paper presents the utilization of remote sensing sub-daily rainfall, i.e. Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), integrated with the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulses (BLRP) model, to disaggregate the daily in situ rainfall, which is then further used to derive more reliable IDF curves. Application of the proposed method in Singapore indicates that the disaggregated hourly rainfall, preserving both the hourly and daily statistic characteristics, produces IDF curves with significantly improved accuracy; on average over 70% of RMSE is reduced as compared to the IDF curves derived from daily rainfall observations.

TI  - Active dispersal of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>: a mark-release-recapture study using self-marking units
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Understanding the dispersal dynamics of invasive mosquito species is fundamental to improve vector surveillance and to target control efforts. Aedes albopictus has been deemed a poor flyer as its range of active dispersal is generally assumed to be limited to a few hundred metres, while laboratory studies suggest this mosquito could actually fly several kilometres. The discrepancy may be due to differences in the local environment or to the methodological approach. In Switzerland, Ae. albopictus has been present since 2003 and has since then expanded its range. While passive dispersal is a key driver, it remains unclear how far this mosquito spreads through active flight and what the age structure and size of the local population are, all important parameters for vector surveillance and control. Method We investigated the active dispersal, daily survival rate and population size of Ae. albopictus in mark-release-recapture studies in Coldrerio and Lugano, two areas of intensive control in Switzerland. To mark mosquitoes emerging from breeding sites, we used self-marking units with fluorescent pigment that have minimal impact on mosquito survival and behaviour. We recaptured the adult mosquitoes with BG-Sentinel traps within a radius of 1 km from the marking units over 22 consecutive days. Results We found that 77.5% of the recaptured Ae. albopictus individuals flew further than 250 m, the limit that is usually deemed sufficient for vector containment. The average age of females and males was 8.6 days and 7.8 days in Coldrerio and Lugano, respectively, while the estimated mosquito population densities were 134 mosquitoes/ha in Coldrerio and 767 mosquitoes/ha in Lugano. Conclusions Self-marking units are an effective tool to mark wild mosquitoes. Using this approach, we found that mosquitoes survive long enough to potentially transmit arboviral disease in our study area and that host-seeking Ae. albopictus females may travel further than previously assumed for European mosquito populations. This finding has direct implications for vector control as emergency treatments around positive cases, as well as surveillance and control around detections of new infestations, might need to be extended beyond the usual recommended range of just a few hundred metres.

TI  - The Role of the Intertropical Discontinuity Region and the Heat Low in Dust Emission and Transport Over the Thar Desert, India: A Premonsoon Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A severe dust storm occurred over north India during 12-16 June 2018 is analyzed using satellite observations, reanalysis, ground-based measurements, and model (Meso-NH) simulations focusing on the dynamic processes that caused the dust-storm generation, uplift, and propagation as well as its impacts on air quality. The initial dust emission was triggered by strong near-surface southwesterlies (15-20 m s(-1)) associated with the monsoon flow advancing northward, in response to the deepening of the thermal low over the Thar desert. The convergence between the northwesterlies and the monsoon flow along the Intertropical Discontinuity region caused high dust accumulation over northwest India in an area of weak winds. Convective mixing during daytime favors the vertical transport of dust to higher altitudes above the monsoon flow, but the towering Himalayas and the associated return northerly flow aloft play a blocking role leading to dust accumulation at heights between 1 and 3 km over northwest India. The prevailed northwesterlies in the middle troposphere favor the eastward transport of the dust plumes along the Ganges valley, helping to evacuate the dust toward east India. Based on Meso-NH model simulations, the dust storm was associated with dust loads higher than 30 gm(-2) and AODs higher than 3, in agreement with MODIS observations. The impact of the dust storm on the spatial-temporal evolution of the PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations is studied using data from 23 air-quality stations over northern India, indicating daily PM10 peaks reaching at 900 mu g m(-3), implying a severe degradation of air quality.

TI  - Understanding utilization patterns of biologics and biosimilars in the United States to support postmarketing studies of safety and effectiveness
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To describe utilization of filgrastim and infliximab, the first two products with biosimilars approved in the United States. Methods We identified use of filgrastim (reference, tbo-filgrastim, and filgrastim-sndz) and infliximab (reference, infliximab-dyyb, and infliximab-abda) in the Sentinel Distributed Database using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes and National Drug Codes (NDCs) from January 2015 to August 2018. We calculated the proportion of use by code type and assessed uptake over time. We compared baseline patient characteristics and treatment indications. Among patients with >1 exposure episode, we characterized gaps between episodes. Results Use was identified primarily via HCPCS codes (filgrastim: 86.4%-97.7%; infliximab: 87.8%-100%) although some was identified via NDCs (filgrastim: 2.2%-13.5%; infliximab: <0.1%-6.5%). Filgrastim reference product use declined from 89.4% in January 2015 to 30.3% in June 2018, with corresponding increases in filgrastim-sndz (0% to 49.3%) and tbo-filgrastim (10.6% to 20.4%). Infliximab biosimilar uptake was low (9.7% in June 2018). We identified 94 846 filgrastim reference product, 27 143 tbo-filgrastim, and 38 264 filgrastim-sndz users. For infliximab, we identified 125 412 reference product, 1034 infliximab-dyyb, 49 infliximab-abda, and 4855 undetermined biosimilar users. Patients receiving filgrastim products were largely similar, but differences in age, sex, and indication were observed across infliximab product users. The median exposure episode gap ranged from 1 to 3 days for filgrastim and 48 to 50 days for infliximab. Conclusion Use of biosimilar filgrastim has increased in the United States, but infliximab biosimilar use remains low. Data on identification of biosimilars in claims data and observed gaps between exposure episodes can be used to support drug safety studies of biosimilars.

TI  - Particle swarm optimization based water index (PSOWI) for mapping the water extents from satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Various spectral indices have been introduced to detect water extent from satellite images with different performances in various regions. The aim of this study is to provide an efficient index using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to detect water spread areas from satellite images with similar performance in different regions. This index is introduced for images containing water absorption bands from visible to middle infrared wavelengths. Eleven images were prepared from different satellites and water bodies with various environmental conditions. In addition, 40 pixels from water and 40 pixels from non-water regions were selected as training data for PSO algorithm. Results were evaluated using digitized polygons of water bodies on high-resolution images of Google Earth. The best results in PSO-based water index (PSOWI) were obtained by the combination of two bands (red and middle infrared). PSOWI represented proper performance in the selected various land covers and satellite images.

TI  - Applying the Dark Target aerosol algorithm with Advanced Himawari Imager observations during the KORUS-AQ field campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - For nearly 2 decades we have been quantitatively observing the Earth's aerosol system from space at one or two times of the day by applying the Dark Target family of algorithms to polar-orbiting satellite sensors, particularly MODIS and VIIRS. With the launch of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and the Advanced Baseline Imagers (ABIs) into geosynchronous orbits, we have the new ability to expand temporal coverage of the traditional aerosol optical depth (AOD) to resolve the diurnal signature of aerosol loading during daylight hours. The Korean-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign taking place in and around the Korean peninsula during May-June 2016 initiated a special processing of full-disk AHI observations that allowed us to make a preliminary adoption of Dark Target aerosol algorithms to the wavelengths and resolutions of AHI. Here, we describe the adaptation and show retrieval results from AHI for this 2-month period. The AHI-retrieved AOD is collocated in time and space with existing AErosol RObotic NETwork stations across Asia and with collocated Terra and Aqua MODIS retrievals. The new AHI AOD product matches AERONET, and the standard MODIS product does as well, and the agreement between AHI and MODIS retrieved AOD is excellent, as can be expected by maintaining consistency in algorithm architecture and most algorithm assumptions. Furthermore, we show that the new product approximates the AERONET-observed diurnal signature. Examining the diurnal patterns of the new AHI AOD product we find specific areas over land where the diurnal signal is spatially cohesive. For example, in Bangladesh the AOD increases by 0.50 from morning to evening, and in northeast China the AOD decreases by 0.25. However, over open ocean the observed diurnal cycle is driven by two artifacts, one associated with solar zenith angles greater than 70 degrees that may be caused by a radiative transfer model that does not properly represent the spherical Earth and the other artifact associated with the fringes of the 40 degrees glint angle mask. This opportunity during KORUS-AQ provides encouragement to move towards an operational Dark Target algorithm for AHI. Future work will need to re-examine masking including snow mask, re-evaluate assumed aerosol models for geosynchronous geometry, address the artifacts over the ocean, and investigate size parameter retrieval from the over-ocean algorithm.

TI  - Analysis of differences in vegetation phenology cycle of abandoned farmland, using harmonic analysis of time-series vegetation indices data: the case of Gwangyang City, South Korea
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, countries have experienced substantial increases in farmland abandonment. Although vegetation phenology is a key factor for the classification of land use, understanding of the phenological change of abandoned farmland is lacking. Using harmonic analysis of NDVI and NDWI extracted from Landsat imagery, this study investigates the distinctive phenological characteristics of abandoned farmland, which contrasts with that of three other agricultural types (paddy, agricultural field, orchard) in the study site of Gwangyang City in Jeollanam Province, South Korea. The results suggest that abandoned farmland has higher overall greenness coverage and overall water content in vegetation than the other uses. In terms of both indices, abandoned farmlands changed with relatively less fluctuation than those of other uses, suggesting the existence of constant and unmanaged vegetation from ecological succession, which differs from crop fields that undergo cultivation procedures. The significant harmonic components differed among agricultural types and vegetation indices. In paddy, NDVI was explained with multiple, higher-order harmonic components, while in other types only first-order components met the 5% statistical significance level. With NDWI, land types were more clearly discernible, because of the different cultivation procedures involving water: wet-field method (paddy), dryland farming (orchard, agricultural field), and no cultivation (abandoned farmland). The analysis confirms that harmonic analysis could be useful in discerning abandoned farmland among areas of active agricultural use and shows that the statistical significance of harmonic terms can be employed as indicators of different agricultural types. The observed pattern of the geographic distribution of abandoned farmland has policy implications for the promotion of sustainable reuse of marginal farmland.

T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate multi-scale ionospheric responses to the May 27, 2017, geomagnetic storm over the Asian sector by using multi-instrumental observations, including ground-based global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) network, constellation observing system for meteorology, ionosphere and climate radio occultation, the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) GNSS occultation sounder electron density profiles and in situ plasma density observations provided by both Swarm and defense meteorological satellite program missions. This geomagnetic storm was an intense storm with the minimum symmetric horizontal component reaching - 150 nT and was caused by a coronal mass ejection released on May 23. The main observations are summarized below: (1) two ionospheric positive storm periods were observed. The first one was observed in the noon-afternoon sector during the main phase of the storm on May 28, with nearly 120% TEC enhancement. The second one was of a smaller scale and occurred on the nightside during the recovery phase of the storm on May 29. The first dayside positive storm was initiated by the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz southward turning and eastward penetration electric field, while the second nightside one was terminated by a later southward turning of the IMF Bz since the Asian sector was on the nightside and the penetration electric field changed westward. (2) A negative storm occurred from 00:00 to 12:00 UT on May 30 over the Asian sector, nearly 2 days after the main phase, which was due to the thermospheric composition change, i.e., decrease in the O/N-2 ratio, as shown in the TIMED/GUVI measurements. (3) A band-like TEC enhancement was observed aligning in the northwest-southeast direction and propagated slowly southwestward from 15:00 to 20:00 UT (23:00-04:00 LT, near midnight) on May 28 during the recovery phase of the storm. In situ density observations from the Swarm B and DMSP F15&16 satellites confirmed the density enhancement at 510 km and 850 km, respectively, and revealed that this band-like TEC enhancement structure resembles the so-called plasma blob. The similarities of the observed plasma blob characteristics in terms of spatial structure, propagation trend and temporal evolution with the nighttime traveling ionospheric disturbance (TID) are consistent with the TID-blob theory.

AB  - A method is assessed which expands aerosol vertical profiles inferred from nadir-pointing lidars to cross-track locations next to nadir columns. This is achieved via matching of passive radiances at off-nadir locations with their counterparts that are collocated with lidar data. This spectral radiance matching (SRM) method is tested using profiles inferred from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar observations and collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) passive imagery for the periods 10-25 April and 14-29 September 2015. CALIPSO profiles are expanded out to 100 km on both sides of the daytime ground track. Reliability of constructed profiles that are removed from the ground track by number of kilometers are tested by requiring the algorithm to reconstruct profiles using only profiles that are removed from it along track by more than the number of kilometers. When sufficient numbers of pixels and columns are available, the SRM method can correctly match similar to 75% and similar to 68% of aerosol vertical structure at distances of 30 and 100 km from the ground track, respectively. The construction algorithm is applied to the eastern coast of Asia during spring 2015. Vertical distributions of different aerosol subtypes indicate that the region was dominated by dust and polluted dust transported from the continent. It is shown that atmospheric profiles and aerosol optical depth (AOD) inferred from ground-based measurements agree with those constructed by the SRM method. For profiles, the relative errors between those measured by ground-based lidar and those constructed in the surrounding area are similar to the relative errors between the ground-based station and CALIPSO overpass at the closest distance. For AOD, the measurements from the ground-based network agree with those inferred from constructed aerosol structure better than direct observations from CALIPSO and close to those inferred from MODIS radiances.

TI  - An increase in methane emissions from tropical Africa between 2010 and 2016 inferred from satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions of methane (CH4) from tropical ecosystems, and how they respond to changes in climate, represent one of the biggest uncertainties associated with the global CH(4 )budget. Historically, this has been due to the dearth of pan-tropical in situ measurements, which is particularly acute in Africa. By virtue of their superior spatial coverage, satellite observations of atmospheric CH(4)columns can help to narrow down some of the uncertainties in the tropical CH(4)emission budget. We use proxy column retrievals of atmospheric CH4 (XCH4) from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and the nested version of the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry and transport model (0.5 degrees x 0.625 degrees) to infer emissions from tropical Africa between 2010 and 2016. Proxy retrievals of XCH4 are less sensitive to scattering due to clouds and aerosol than full physics retrievals, but the method assumes that the global distribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) is known. We explore the sensitivity of inferred a posteriori emissions to this source of systematic error by using two different XCH4 data products that are determined using different model CO2 fields. We infer monthly emissions from GOSAT XCH4 data using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, allowing us to report seasonal cycles and trends in annual mean values. We find mean tropical African emissions between 2010 and 2016 range from 76 (74-78) to 80 (78-82) Tg yr(-1), depending on the proxy XCH4 data used, with larger differences in Northern Hemisphere Africa than Southern Hemisphere Africa. We find a robust positive linear trend in tropical African CH4 emissions for our 7-year study period, with values of 1.5 (1.11.9) Tg yr(-1) or 2.1 (1.7-2.5) Tg yr(-1), depending on the CO2 data product used in the proxy retrieval. This linear emissions trend accounts for around a third of the global emissions growth rate during this period. A substantial portion of this increase is due to a short-term increase in emissions of 3 Tg yr(-1) between 2011 and 2015 from the Sudd in South Sudan. Using satellite land surface temperature anomalies and altimetry data, we find this increase in CH4 emissions is consistent with an increase in wetland extent due to increased inflow from the White Nile, although the data indicate that the Sudd was anomalously dry at the start of our inversion period. We find a strong seasonality in emissions across Northern Hemisphere Africa, with the timing of the seasonal emissions peak coincident with the seasonal peak in ground water storage. In contrast, we find that a posteriori CH4 emissions from the wetland area of the Congo Basin are approximately constant throughout the year, consistent with less temporal variability in wetland extent, and significantly smaller than a priori estimates.

TI  - Application of MODIS NDVI for Monitoring Kenyan Rangelands Through a Web Based Decision Support Tool
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kenyan rangelands contribute significantly to the country's GDP through livestock production and tourism. With dependence on rain-fed pastures, climate variability coupled with human induced factors such as overgrazing have adversely affected the rangeland ecosystems. And while indigenous communities and conservation experts already use their knowledge of the landscape to make decisions, this information is usually localized. Earth observation imagery provides a bigger picture that can complement indigenous knowledge and improve decision making. This research leverages on data from the MODIS receiver located at the Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) to develop the indices for the web-based Rangelands Decision Support Tool (RDST). The tool (RDST) automates data processing and provides an easy to use interface for accessing indices for rangeland monitoring. MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), anomalies and deviation indices are provided on the tool at decadal, monthly, and seasonal time steps. Users begin their assessments by selecting their monitoring units and an NDVI index that responds to their specific questions. These questions respond to assessing current conditions, monitoring trends and changes in vegetation, and evaluating proxies for drought conditions. The information can then be overlaid with other ancillary datasets (roads, water sources, invasive species, protected areas, place names, conflict areas, migration routes), for context. At the click of a button, the information can be downloaded as a map for further analysis or application in sub regional decision making. Information and maps generated by this tool are being used decision making tool by rangeland managers in the counties and in other management units (conservancies and ranches). Specifically, inform adjustments to existing grazing plans, managing movement of livestock from designated grazing areas in wet and dry season, monitoring the success of rehabilitation efforts and resilience of the rangeland ecosystems, monitoring drought, managing scarce water resources, and monitoring the spread of invasive species. Successful implementation and application for decision making has relied heavily on local indigenous knowledge and capacity building on use of the earth observation indices. The SERVIR project service planning engagement approach was used in engagements with stakeholders. This improved their participation in co-development of the tool and indices; and in adoption of the tools for decision making.

TI  - Operational Flood Risk Index Mapping for Disaster Risk Reduction Using Earth Observations and Cloud Computing Technologies: A Case Study on Myanmar
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - People, livelihoods, and infrastructure in Myanmar suffer from devastating monsoonal flooding on a frequent basis. Quick and effective management of flood risk relies on planning and preparedness to ensure the availability of supplies, shelters and emergency response personnel. The mandated government agency Department of Disaster Management (DDM) as well as local and international organizations play roles in producing, disseminating, and using accurate and timely information on flood risk. Currently, systematic flood risk maps are lacking, which leaves DDM to rely on inconsistent historic reports and local knowledge to inform their emergency planning. Although these types of knowledge are critical, they can be complemented to reduce bias and human error to planning processes and decisions. As such, the present situation has led to ineffective distribution of emergency response resources prior to flooding, leaving vulnerable populations less-than-prepared for inevitable flood events. Given these issues, we have developed a flood risk decision-support tool in collaboration with DDM. The tool uses surface water maps developed by the Joint Research Center (JRC), which were derived from more than 30 years of Landsat imagery. We have also incorporated population data, land cover data, and other information on flood exposure and vulnerability to create the first scalable and replicable Flood Risk Index (FRI) for flood risk reduction in Myanmar.

TI  - REDD plus project design study for quantifying activity data for historic forest degradation in a Bangladesh forest using Landsat data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After fossil fuel burning, deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. In order to claim the carbon credit under the reducing from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) scheme, a United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change initiative for climate change mitigation, developing countries are required to prepare national reference emission levels for forests on the basis of historic data and national circumstances. Part of developing reference emission levels includes quantifying location, pattern, and rate of historic forest degradation, which are also called in a word the activity data for forest degradation. Applying Monte-Carlo spectral unmixing technique to Landsat images in the CLASlite (R) algorithm followed by a knowledge-based classification approach, this research quantified the activity data for forest degradation at Raghunandan Hills Reserve (6143 ha) in Bangladesh. Moderate spatial resolution Landsat images were able to detect the activity data for degradation in a spatially explicit manner with high accuracy (>90%). The research approach and findings can serve as valuable information for any future national level initiative for developing activity data for REDD+ projects.

TI  - Assessment of Local Climate Zone Classification Maps of Cities in China and Feasible Refinements
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zone (LCZ) maps that describe the urban surface structure and cover with consistency and comparability across cities are gaining applications in studies of urban heat waves, sustainable urbanization and urban energy balance. Following the standard World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) method, we generated LCZ maps for over 20 individual cities and 3 major economic regions in China. Based on the confusion matrices constructed by manual comparison between the predicted classes and ground truths, we highlight the following: (1) notable variation in overall accuracies (i.e., 60%-89%) among cities were observed, which was mainly due to class incompleteness and distinct proportions of natural landscapes; (2) building classes in selected cities were poorly classified in general, with a mean accuracy of 48%; (3) the sparsely built class (i.e., LCZ 9), which is rare in the selected Chinese cities, had the lowest classification accuracy (32% on average), and the class of low plants had the widest accuracy range. The findings indicate that the standard WUDAPT method alone is insufficient for generating LCZ products that demonstrate practical value, especially for built-up areas in China, and the misclassification is largely caused by the lack of building height data. This result is confirmed by a refinement test, in which the urban DEM retrieved from Sentinel-1 data with radar interferometry technique was used. The study shows a detailed and comprehensive assessment of applying the WUDAPT method in China and a feasible refinement strategy to improve the classification accuracy, especially for the built-up types of LCZ. The study could serve as a useful reference for generating quality-ensured LCZ maps. This study also examines and explores the relationship between socio-economic status and LCZ products, which is essential for further implementations.

TI  - How should we aggregate data? Methods accounting for the numerical distributions, with an assessment of aerosol optical depth
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applications of geophysical data - whether from surface observations, satellite retrievals, or model simulations - rely on aggregates produced at coarser spatial (e.g. degrees) and/or temporal (e.g. daily and monthly) resolution than the highest available from the technique. Almost all of these aggregates report the arithmetic mean and standard deviation as summary statistics, which are what data users employ in their analyses. These statistics are most meaningful for normally distributed data; however, for some quantities, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), it is well-known that distributions are on large scales closer to log-normal, for which a geometric mean and standard deviation would be more appropriate. This study presents a method of assessing whether a given sample of data is more consistent with an underlying normal or log-normal distribution, using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and tests AOD frequency distributions on spatial scales of 1 degrees and daily, monthly, and seasonal temporal scales. A broadly consistent picture is observed using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 Nature Run (G5NR) data. These data sets are complementary: AERONET has the highest AOD accuracy but is sparse, and MISR and MODIS represent different satellite retrieval techniques and sampling. As a model simulation, G5NR is spatiotemporally complete. As timescales increase from days to months to seasons, data become increasingly more consistent with log-normal than normal distributions, and the differences between arithmetic- and geometric-mean AOD become larger, with geometric mean becoming systematically smaller. Assuming normality systematically overstates both the typical level of AOD and its variability. There is considerable regional heterogeneity in the results: in low-AOD regions such as the open ocean and mountains, often the AOD difference is small enough (< 0.01) to be unimportant for many applications, especially on daily timescales. However, in continental outflow regions and near source regions over land, and on monthly or seasonal timescales, the difference is frequently larger than the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) goal uncertainty in a climate data record (the larger of 0.03 or 10 %). This is important because it shows that the sensitivity to an averaging method can and often does introduce systematic effects larger than the total goal GCOS uncertainty. Using three well-studied AERONET sites, the magnitude of estimated AOD trends is shown to be sensitive to the choice of arithmetic vs. geometric means, although the signs are consistent. The main recommendations from the study are that (1) the distribution of a geophysical quantity should be analysed in order to assess how best to aggregate it, (2) ideally AOD aggregates such as satellite level 3 products (but also ground-based data and model simulations) should report a geometric-mean or median AOD rather than (or in addition to) arithmetic-mean AOD, and (3) as this is unlikely in the short term due to the computational burden involved, users can calculate geometric-mean monthly aggregates from widely available daily mean data as a stopgap, as daily aggregates are less sensitive to the choice of aggregation scheme than those for monthly or seasonal aggregates. Furthermore, distribution shapes can have implications for the validity of statistical metrics often used for comparison and evaluation of data sets.The methodology is not restricted to AOD and can be applied to other quantities.

TI  - Assessment of geomorphological and hydrological variations in Bhagirathi River Drainage sub-basin with the help of morphometric studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpretation of geomorphic features and drainage characteristics of Bhagirathi River sub-basin was carried out with the help of morphometric analysis. Various, areal, linear and relief parameters were calculated to assess drainage basin characteristics quantitatively, determine infiltration and surface runoff behavior control of drainage. The drainage network was analyzed using IRS-PAN satellite data and Survey of India toposheets. Findings show that the Bhagirathi sub-basin from Gaumukh to Chirbas exhibits dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage patterns and is characterized by third-order streams up to Chirbas. Stream segments development in the basin is controlled by local relief and slope. The bifurcation ratio indicate disparity of bifurcation between the different stream orders owing to structural control and circularity ratio indicates sub-elongated shape of basin. This study will be helpful for making soil erosion prevention strategies and its conservation and facilitate the understanding of water retention function in river basins.

TI  - Airborne LiDAR and high resolution multispectral data integration in Eucalyptus tree species mapping in an Australian farmscape
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid decline and death of rural Eucalypts trees of all ages and species have been reported in the farmscapes of regional Australia due to various environmental and farming management related factors. The identification of existing farm tree species is important for long term management strategies to provide ecosystem stability in the region. This study explored the feasibility of structural attributes of LiDAR and spectral and spatial characteristics of high resolution remote sensing data to identify and map Eucalyptus tree species. An object based image segmentation and rule-based classification algorithm were developed to delineate tree boundaries and species classification. The integration of two datasets improved the classification accuracy (65%) against their separate classification (52% and 41%, respectively). The identification of tree species will help in getting first-hand information on existing farm trees, which may be used in assessing tree condition in time series related to management practices and complex dieback problem.

TI  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations in children and older adults-Data from South America, 2013-2017. A test negative design
T2  - VACCINE: X
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2013, the Pan American Health Organization established a multi-site, multi-country network to evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). We pooled data from five consecutive seasons in five countries to conduct an analysis of southern hemisphere VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations in young children and older adults.Methods: We used a test-negative design to estimate VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza in hospitalized young children (aged 6-24 months) and older adults (aged >= 60 years) in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay. Following country-specific influenza surveillance protocol, hospitalized persons with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) at 48 sentinel hospitals (March 2013-December 2017) were tested for influenza virus infection by rRT-PCR. VE was estimated for young children and older adults using logistic random effects models accounting for cluster (country), adjusting for sex, age (months for children, and age-in-year categories for adults), calendar year, country, preexisting conditions, month of illness onset and prior vaccination as an effect modifier for the analysis in adults.Results: We included 8426 SARI cases (2389 children and 6037 adults) in the VE analyses. Among young children, VE against SARI hospitalization associated with any influenza virus was 43% (95%CI: 33%, 51%) for children who received two doses, but was 20% (95%CI: -16%, 45%) and not statistically significant for those who received one dose in a given season. Among older adults, overall VE against SARI hospitalization associated with any influenza virus was 41% (95%CI: 28%, 52%), 45% (95%CI: 34%, 53%) against A(H3N2), 40% (95%CI: 18%, 56%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, and 20% (95%CI: -40%, 54%) against influenza B viruses.Conclusions: Our results suggest that over the five-year study period, influenza vaccination programs in five South American countries prevented more than one-third of laboratory confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in young children receiving the recommended two doses and vaccinated older adults.

TI  - Evaluation of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2012-2015
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Methods: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012-2015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: < 60% weak performance; 60-79% moderate performance; >= 80% good performance.Results: During 2012-2015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during December-May. Data quality and completeness was > 90% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored > 70% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics.Conclusions: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.

TI  - The call of the wild: Investigating the potential for ecoacoustic methods in mapping wilderness areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The critical importance of wilderness areas (WAs) for biodiversity conservation and human well-being is well established yet mapping criteria on which WA management policies are based take neither into account. Current WA mapping methods are framed in terms of absence of anthropogenic influence, and created using visual satellite data, obviating consideration of the ecological or anthropogenic value of WAs. In this paper we suggest that taking the acoustic environment into account could address this lacuna. We report the first investigation into the potential for ecoacoustic methods to complement existing geophysical approaches. Participatory walks, including in situ questionnaires and ecoacoustic surveys were carried out at points along transects traversing urban-wilderness gradients at four study sites in the Scottish Highlands and French Pyrenees. The relationships between a suite of six acoustic indices (AIs), wilderness classifications and human subjective ratings were examined. We observed significant differences between five out of six AIs tested across wilderness classes, demonstrating significant differences in the soundscape across urban-wild gradients. Strong, significant correlations between AIs, wilderness classes and human perceptions of wildness were observed, although magnitude and direction of correlations varied across sites. Finally, a compound acoustic index is shown to strongly predict mapped-wildness classes (up to 95% variance explained MSE 0.22); perceived wilderness and biodiversity are even more strongly predicted. Together these results demonstrate that the acoustic environment varies significantly along urban-wild gradients; AIs reveal details of environmental variation excluded under current methods, and capture key facets of the human experience of wildness. An important next step is to ascertain the ecological and anthropogenic relevance of these differences, and develop new automated acoustic analysis methods suited to mapping the environmental characteristics of WAs. Taken together, our results suggest that future management of WAs could benefit from ecoacoustic methods to take the biosphere and anthroposphere into account. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing volume of Earth science data available from climate simulations and satellite remote sensing offers unprecedented opportunity for scientific insight, while also presenting computational challenges. One potential area of impact is atmospheric correction, where physics-based numerical models retrieve surface reflectance information from top of atmosphere observations, and are too computationally intensive to be run in real time. Machine learning methods have demonstrated potential as fast statistical models for expensive simulations and for extracting credible insights from complex datasets. Here, we develop DeepEmSat: a deep learning emulator approach for atmospheric correction, and offer comparison against physics-based models to support the hypothesis that deep learning can make a contribution to the efficient processing of satellite images.

TI  - Climatology of aerosol optical depth over Eastern Europe based on 19 years (2000-2018) MODIS TERRA data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial-temporal evolution of aerosols, their optical properties (aerosol optical depth [AOD] and angstrom exponent [AE]) and the trend over a period of 19 years in the Eastern European countries. The data used for the study are from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra Collection 6.1 aerosol products with the use of Dark Target algorithm for the period from 2000 to 2018. The satellite-based AOD products were validated against the AERONET AOD measurements in four stations, located in different regions. The results demonstrate high coherence in the setting of high values of correlation (R = 0.8-0.9) and low values of root-mean-square error (RMSE [0.066-0.130]) and mean absolute error (MAE [0.048-0.067]). However, of the total amount of data from AERONET stations, only 68.9% of available data fall within expected error (EE) over land. Generally, all countries recorded a low AOD (83.2% less than 0.2) and high AE (82.5% higher than 1). Mean AOD and AE values varied from 0.17 +/- 0.12 and 1.31 +/- 0.27 (Russia) to 0.24 +/- 0.14 and 1.31 +/- 0.33 (Czech Republic). There was a gradual decrease in aerosol load in all countries, the highest tendencies of AOD reduction are observed in Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary (by -0.0028, -0.0027, -0.0026 and -0.0025 per year), while the lowest tendencies of reduction are observed in Russia and Moldova (by -0.001 and -0.0006 per year). Seasonal averaged AOD values have maximum values in summer and minimum values in winter. We studied predominant aerosol types, which are based on AOD and AE interrelation, the results showed the predominance of clean continental and mixed aerosols over all countries of the region.

TI  - Inversion of Land Surface Emissivity in China Based on FY-2G Infrared Satellite Data
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present the inversion of land surface emissivity (LSE) in the China land area based on the mid-infrared and thermal infrared channel day/night data received by the FengYun-2G (FY-2G) geostationary meteorological satellite. The atmospheric correction of the FY-2G data is based on MODTRAN, which is a radiation transfer model, using the atmospheric profile data, including data with respect to the temperature, humidity, and ozone, provided by the European Centre for Median-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). The modified Minnaerts bidirectional reflection distribution function model is used to calculate the hemispherical reflectivity of the mid-infrared channel in the surface direction. Further, the LSE distribution characteristics can be obtained with respect to the different surface vegetation types in China based on the temperature-independent thermal infrared spectral index. Finally, the LSE inversion results obtained from the images of Chinas land area are verified by selecting the surface emissivity products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The daytime and nighttime results are observed to be in good agreement with the existing LSE products in MODIS. The absolute LSE inversion errors of the hot infrared channels 1 and 2 during daytime are -0.0057 and -0.0068, respectively, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.0095 and 0.0103, respectively. Furthermore, the absolute LSE inversion errors of the hot infrared channels 1 and 2 during nighttime are -0.0010 and -0.0035, respectively, and the RMSEs are 0.0094 and 0.0096, respectively. Simultaneously, the LSE inversion results at different time slots on the same day are analyzed. These results indicate that the LSE at nighttime is lower than that at daytime.

TI  - Multiscale Data Fusion for Surface Soil Moisture Estimation: A Spatial Hierarchical Approach
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) has been identified as a key climate variable governing hydrologic and atmospheric processes across multiple spatial scales at local, regional, and global levels. The global burgeoning of SSM datasets in the past decade holds a significant potential in improving our understanding of multiscale SSM dynamics. The primary issues that hinder the fusion of SSM data from disparate instruments are (1) different spatial resolutions of the data instruments, (2) inherent spatial variability in SSM caused due to atmospheric and land surface controls, and (3) measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals of instruments. We present a data fusion scheme which takes all the above three factors into account using a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model (SHM), combining a geostatistical approach with a hierarchical model. The applicability of the fusion scheme is demonstrated by fusing point, airborne, and satellite data for a watershed exhibiting high spatial variability in Manitoba, Canada. We demonstrate that the proposed data fusion scheme is adept at assimilating and predicting SSM distribution across all three scales while accounting for potential measurement errors caused due to imperfect retrievals. Further validation of the algorithm is required in different hydroclimates and surface heterogeneity as well as for other data platforms for wider applicability.

TI  - Analysis and Removal of Stripe Noise in AGRI Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the primary sources of AGRI stripe noise arc analyzed, and an image-degradation model for this noise is established. A method of stripe-noise removal based on histogram matching and anisotropic total variation regularization is proposed. The method first implements histogram matching to suppress the nonuniformity response between detector pixels, and then implements the anisotropic total-variation-regularization model to remove the remaining stripe noise. Qualitative and quantitative indices arc used to evaluate the processing results of various methods. The evaluation results show that, compared with the existing leading stripe-removal algorithms, the proposed method achieves a superior stripe-noise-removal effect while effectively protecting the details of the original image.

TI  - Multicentre study of the risk of invasive cancer and use of sentinel node biopsy in women with a preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the breast that is diagnosed by biopsy implies a risk of upstaging to invasive carcinoma (IC) on final pathology. These patients require a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for axillary staging. A two-stage procedure is not always feasible and precise selection of patients who should be offered SLNB is crucial. The aims were: to determine the rate of upstaging, and use of redundant and required SLNB in women with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS; and to identify patient and tumour characteristics that increase the risk of upstaging. Methods Patients with DCIS treated between 2008 and 2016 were identified using Orbit operation planning system software, and those suitable for the study were selected based on review of the medical records. Upstaging rates and proportions of redundant and required SLNBs were calculated. Associations between clinicopathological characteristics and upstaging were analysed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results Of 1368 patients initially identified, 975 women with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS were included in the study. Tumours in 246 of these patients (25 center dot 2 per cent) were upstaged to IC. Redundant SLNB was performed in 392 of 975 women (40 center dot 2 per cent). Forty-four patients (4 center dot 5 per cent) with a final diagnosis of IC were not offered SLNB and thus potentially undertreated. In adjusted analysis, DCIS size, palpability and mass formation identified by breast imaging were associated with increased risk of upstaging. The Van Nuys classification was not associated with upstaging. Conclusion Most patients with IC on final pathology underwent SLNB, but a considerable number of patients with DCIS had a redundant SLNB. Lesion size, palpability and mass formation, but not Van Nuys classification group, are suggested risk factors for upstaging.

TI  - An Extremely Shallow <i>M<sub>w</sub></i>4.1 Thrust Earthquake in the Eastern Sichuan Basin (China) Likely Triggered by Unloading During Infrastructure Construction
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Triggered or induced earthquakes have been widely reported as resulting from various human activities, yet seismicity triggered by small-scale infrastructure construction is rare. Here, we report on an investigation of an extremely shallow M(w)4.1 earthquake which occurred on 11 August 2016 in the Sichuan Basin (China), a region with historically low seismicity. Our seismic waveform analyses indicate an almost pure thrust focal mechanism at a centroid depth of similar to 1 km. Furthermore, 18 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar interferograms, stacked to obtain subcentimeter accuracy, reveal up to 3 cm line-of-sight deformation which overlaps with an automotive testing site constructed in 2014. Removal of 10 m of a surface rock layer during the construction may have produced an unloading effect and resulted in up to 0.11 MPa Coulomb stress changes on a blind fault, larger than the 0.01 MPa threshold typically invoked in studies of tectonic earthquakes. However, the delayed triggering still requires further investigation.Plain Language Summary While induced earthquakes in the shallow part of the crust have been observed globally, a remaining knowledge gap is whether small-scale infrastructure construction can trigger earthquakes or not. We investigate these questions on an extremely shallow M(w)4.1 earthquake in the eastern Sichuan Basin (China). To determine earthquake source parameters, we combine seismological data with satellite imaging. We find this thrust event ruptured at the depth of similar to 1 km, located just beneath an automotive testing site constructed in 2014. Crucially, we note the testing site construction involved removal of a large volume of surface rock. We further analyze the stress changes produced by the unloading of the surface rock. We find a possible triggering relationship between the infrastructure construction and the occurrence of this shallow earthquake. Our results thus shed new light on the causes of shallow earthquakes associated with small-scale infrastructure construction.

TI  - Comparative education as cultural critique
T2  - COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Relating my experience of becoming a 'foreign' comparativist, I offer a vision of comparative education that both extends and challenges the field. It continues the work of Bereday and Lauwerys who sought to make visible the 'contrasting colours of the world' in order to affect deep self-reflection and imagine alternatives. But it also challenges that earlier iteration: calling for a drastic widening of the imaginative kosmos, an exorcising of our enduring Hegelian worldview, and more skilled work in bringing differences 'home'. It underscores the need for new modes of engagement: earnestness, humility, self-overcoming. Our time of heightened transnational academic mobility makes this sort of work practically possible for the first time, but the field's full potential to affect intellectual paradigms will occur only when we become immigrants of being.

TI  - Evaluation of a satellite-derived model parameterized by three soil moisture constraints to estimate terrestrial latent heat flux in the Heihe River basin of Northwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) models are useful tools to understand regional surface energy and water cycle processes for terrestrial ecosystems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) of Northwest China. This study developed a satellite-derived hybrid LE model parameterized by three soil moisture (SM) constraints: SM, relative humidity (RID, and diurnal air temperature range (DT); and assessed model performance and sensitivity. We used MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and eddy covariance (EC) data from 12 EC flux tower sites across the HRB. The hybrid model was trained using observed LE over 2012/ 2013-2014, and validated using observed LE for 2015 and leave-one-out cross-validation. The results show that the three SM constraints schemes exhibited some modeling differences at the flux tower site scale. LE estimation using SM achieved the highest correlation (R-2 - 0.87, p < 0.01) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 20.1 W/m(2)) compared to schemes using RH or DT schemes. We then produced regional daily LE maps at 1 km x 1 km across the HRB for 2013-2015. Regional analysis shows that our LE estimates from all three constraint models exhibited large spatial variability and strong seasonal and annual variations, attributed to differences in parameterizing the model water constraints. This study provides data and model based evidence to improve satellite-derived hybrid LE models with regard to water constraints. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Techniques and challenges in the assimilation of atmospheric water observations for numerical weather prediction towards convective scales
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - While contemporary numerical weather prediction models represent the large-scale structure of moist atmospheric processes reasonably well, they often struggle to maintain accurate forecasts of small-scale features such as convective rainfall. Even though high-resolution models resolve more of the flow, and are therefore arguably more accurate, moist convective flow becomes increasingly nonlinear and dynamically unstable. Importantly, the models' initial conditions are typically sub-optimal, leaving scope to improve the accuracy of forecasts with improved data assimilation. To address issues regarding the use of atmospheric water-related observations - especially at convective scales (also known as storm scales) - this article discusses the observation and assimilation of water-related quantities. Special emphasis is placed on background error statistics for variational and hybrid methods which need special attention for water variables. The challenges of convective-scale data assimilation of atmospheric water information are discussed, which are more difficult to tackle than at larger scales. Some of the most important challenges include the greater degree of inhomogeneity and lower degree of smoothness of the flow, the high volume of water-related observations (e.g. from radar, microwave and infrared instruments), the need to analyse a range of hydrometeors, the increasing importance of position errors in forecasts, the greater sophistication of forward models to allow use of indirect observations (e.g. cloud- and precipitation-affected observations), the need to account for the flow-dependent multivariate "balance" between atmospheric water and both dynamical and mass fields, and the inherent non-Gaussian nature of atmospheric water variables.

TI  - GOES-16/ABI Thermal Emissive Band Assessments Using GEO-LEO-GEO Double Difference
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary satellite (GOES)-16/Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) represent a significant improvement over the imagers on board previous GOES. Their bands 7-16 are infrared channels covering the 3.9- to 13.3-mu m spectral range and with a subpoint spatial resolution of 2 km. Their spectral coverage of the thermal emissive bands (TEBs) is almost identical, and both instruments employ similar calibration strategies using an on-board blackbody and a space look. The intercomparison between the two instruments will be very helpful for their calibration assessments and their product quality enhancements. GOES-16 was launched on 19 November 2016, initially to a test position at 89.5 degrees west and reached its operational position (longitude of 75.2 degrees west) on 11 December 2017. The Himawari-8 spacecraft was launched on 7 October 2014 and the observation focuses on Asia-Pacific region. In this work, an intercomparison of their TEB measurement is performed using double difference with Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The same type of scenes are selected for the two instruments, and their measurements with the closest observation times are compared with Aqua MODIS matching bands. The view angle effect is corrected and their spectral mismatching effect is estimated. The dependence on the scene uniformity is analyzed. The ABI-AHI differences are within 0.3K for bands 10 (7.35 mu m), 11 (8.44 mu m), 12 (9.64 mu m), and 14 (11.24 mu m), and up to 0.8K difference for bands 15 (12.38 mu m) and 16 (13.28 mu m). The ABI precision is better than AHI for all TEB and their image navigation and registration precisions are comparable. In general, the ABI performances before and after relocation are consistent.

TI  - Spatially explicit statistical modeling of random and systematic land cover transitions in the main grassland plain of Nech Sar National Park, Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main grassland plain of Nech Sar National Park (NSNP) is a federally managed protected area in Ethiopia designated to protect endemic and endangered species. However, like other national parks in Ethiopia, the park has experienced significant land cover change over the past few decades. Indeed, the livelihoods of local populations in such developing countries are entirely dependent upon natural resources and, as a result, both direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures have been placed on natural parks. While previous research has looked at land cover change in the region, these studies have not been spatially explicit and, as a result, knowledge gaps in identifying systematic transitions continue to exist. This study seeks to quantify the spatial extent and land cover change trends in NSNP, identify the strong signal transitions, and identify and quantify the location of determinants of change. To this end, the author classifies panchromatic aerial photographs in 1986, multispectral SPOT imagery in 2005, and Sentinel imagery in 2019. The spatial extent and trends of land cover change analysis between these time periods were conducted. The strong signal transitions were systematically identified and quantified. Then, the basic driving forces of the change were identified. The locations of these transitions were also identified and quantified using the spatially explicit statistical model. The analysis revealed that over the past three decades (1986-2019), nearly 52% of the study area experienced clear landscape change, out of which the net change and swap change attributed to 39% and 13%, respectively. The conversion of woody vegetation to grassland (similar to 5%), subsequently grassland-to-open-overgrazed land (28.26%), and restoration of woody vegetation (0.76%) and grassland (0.72%) from riverine forest and open-overgrazed land, respectively, were found to be the fully systematic transitions whereas the rest transitions were recorded either partly systematic or random transitions. The location of these most systematic land cover transitions identified through the spatially explicit statistical modeling showed drivers due to biophysical conditions, accessibility, and urban/market expansions, coupled with successive government policies for biodiversity management, geo-politics, demographic, and socioeconomic factors. These findings provide important insights into biodiversity loss, land degradation, and ecosystem disruption. Therefore, the model for predicted probability generally suggests a 0.75 km and 0.72 km buffers which are likely to protect forest and grassland from conversion to grassland and open-overgrazed land, respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage and its causes in China since the Chinese economic reform
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the economy over 40 years since the initiation of Chinese economic reform, terrestrial ecosystems in China have undergone large-scale changes. In this study, we investigated vegetation dynamics in China and their relationships with climatic factors and anthropogenic drivers over 15 progressive periods of 18-32 years starting in 1982. This was accomplished by using the third-generation global satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset, night-time satellite data, and climate data. Across China, NDVI increased significantly during 1982-2013; especially significant increases were observed in all periods during the growing season and spring. At the pixel scale, 21-38% of the vegetated area in the 15 periods experienced a significant positive trend in vegetation growth. This increase was mostly located in central and southern China. A significant negative trend was observed in 1-8% of the vegetated area pixels, and this pattern was mainly seen in northwestern China, the Yangtze River Delta region, and the Pearl River Delta region. The contribution of spring NDVI to vegetation improvement increased, while the contribution of summer NDVI decreased. Vegetation activity in China was mainly regulated by thermal factors, especially pronounced in mountainous regions of northern China. However, the restrictive effect of moisture factors was very marked to vegetation growth in areas with less than 400 mm of precipitation. Urbanization in China has led to vegetation degradation in most urban centers and surrounding areas in central and eastern China. The increase of agricultural plantations, the Grain for Green Project, and a series ecological restoration projects in some areas have promoted vegetation coverage.

TI  - Detection of bad data images in long-term MODIS land surface temperature image time series using statistical outlier detection methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) data are available for several years at a high acquisition rate from sensors such as a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). Advances in remote sensing technology have exploited this large volume of LST image time series (LITS) data for a clearer understanding of land surface processes. However, remotely sensed LST observations from spaceborne platforms are likely to be influenced by severe weather conditions (e.g., clouds, haze, heavy aerosols, heavy rainfall and flooding, hailstorms, and snowfall). Presence of bad data images in LITS can reduce the credibility of results from LITS data analysis. An algorithm to detect bad data images in a long-term MODIS LITS is proposed. Bad data in MODIS LITS were filtered at various stages. Initially, poor quality pixels were removed from LST maps based on quality control information provided in corresponding quality assurance maps. In further stages, thin cloud-contaminated LST pixels were removed that were left undetected by MODIS official cloud screening procedure. Finally, to remove bad data LST maps, median-based statistical outlier detection method was employed, and outliers were detected in LST pixel time series (LPTS) vectors generated at consistent normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pixel (CNP) locations. CNPs were selected by employing Mann-Kendall test statistics on annually aggregated MODIS NDVI time series vectors. Decisions were made to identify bad LST maps based on number of outlier LST values appeared in LPTS vectors at CNP locations for each LST map. The proposed algorithm was applied over parts of Gondwana coalfields situated in Jharkhand and West Bengal states of India. (C) 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Regional Biases in MODIS Marine Liquid Water Cloud Drop Effective Radius Deduced Through Fusion With MISR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements from Terra's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) represent our longest, single-platform, global record of the effective radius (Re) of the cloud drop size distribution. Quantifying its error characteristics has been challenging because systematic errors in retrieved Re covary with the structural characteristics of the cloud and the Sun-view geometry. Recently, it has been shown that the bias in MODIS Re can be estimated by fusing MODIS data with data from Terra's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). Here, we relate the bias to the observed underlying conditions to derive regional-scale, bias-corrected, monthly-mean Re-1.6, Re-2.1, and Re-3.7 values retrieved from the 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7 mu m MODIS spectral channels. Our results reveal that monthly-mean bias in Re-2.1 exhibits large regional dependency, ranging from at least 1 to 10 mu m (15 to 60%) varying with scene heterogeneity, optical depth, and solar zenith angle. Regional bias-corrected monthly-mean Re-2.1 ranges from 4 to 17 mu m, compared to 10 to 25 mu m for uncorrected Re-2.1, with estimated uncertainties of 0.1 to 1.8 mu m. The bias-corrected monthly-mean Re-3.7 and Re-2.1 show difference of approximately +0.6 mu m in the coastal marine stratocumulus regions and down to approximately -2 mu m in the cumuliform cloud regions, compared to uncorrected values of about -1 to -6 mu m, respectively. Bias-corrected Re values compare favorably to other independent data sources, including field observations, global model simulations, and satellite retrievals that do not use retrieval techniques similar to MODIS. This work changes the interpretation of global Re distributions from MODIS Re products and may further impact studies, which use the original MODIS Re products to study, for example, aerosol-cloud interactions and cloud microphysical parameterization.

TI  - Launching an unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing data carrier: concept, key components and prospects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based remote sensing is an emerging and important data source. Recently, the use of UAVs for remote sensing applications has been rapidly growing owing to their greater availability and the miniaturization of sensors. UAVs are surpassing satellites and aircraft in remote sensing data supply for many local requirements. In comparison with satellite remote sensing data, most UAV remote sensing data is characterized by high resolution, small coverage area, and heterogeneous multi-sources. However, UAVs lack a unified space-time framework and standardized data process. This paper describes a UAV remote sensing data carrier that can be used as an e-commerce platform for data sharing among registered members and a mission planner for new data acquisition. To the best of our knowledge, the data carriers described herein, are the first of their kind. Through seamless docking with UAVs, the data carrier will form a national UAV network, capable of dynamically obtaining very-high-resolution UAV remote sensing images. In practice, a pilot retrieval system of UAV meta data has been developed to provide a catalogue of data product services.

TI  - Seasonal Deformation of Permafrost in Wudaoliang Basin in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Revealed by StaMPS-InSAR
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is extremely sensitive to variance in external hydrothermal conditions. InSAR has advantages in monitoring surface deformation with decent temporal and spatial resolution as well as millimeter precision. In particular, the StaMPS-InSAR method can remove the disturbances of inaccurate digital elevation model (DEM), atmospheric delays and spatiotemporal decorrelation for an accurate estimation of temporal surface deformation. In this paper, a set of ascending and descending Sentinel-1 imageries spanning from March 2017 to June 2018 were acquired and processed by StaMPS-InSAR in order to investigate dynamic changes of permafrost in Wudaoliang Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The results revealed that significant seasonal changes of permafrost, namely subsidence (thawing) in summer and uplift (freezing) in winter, can be observed throughout the Wudaoliang region. This study shows the StaMPS-InSAR analysis on Sentinel-1 datasets has great potential in regional permafrost investigation.

TI  - Characterizing urban area dynamics in historic city of Kurukshetra, India, using remote sensing and spatial metric tools
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries like India are an urbanization hotspot with many upcoming towns and cities. Growth in small and medium sized towns and cities have been unnoticed and growing without appropriate urban planning. Utilizing the available medium resolution satellite data and geospatial platforms, the growth dynamics of Kurukshetra city was analysed over a period of 24 years. The study employed a combination of change detection technique and spatial metrics (six each of class and landscape levels) analysis to delineate the growth track of the city and its environs. A significant increase in urban built up (dense 237%; open 1038%) is seen majorly at the cost of open area (70%) and tree clad (58%). Phases of city?s aggregation and diffusion are observed using class and landscape level spatial metrics. Understanding and monitoring of land use changes in and around city limits using integrated spatial tools provide better decision making capability.

TI  - A new spectral index for the extraction of built-up land features from Landsat 8 satellite imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting built-up areas from remote sensing data like Landsat 8 satellite is a challenge. We have investigated it by proposing a new index referred as built-up land features extraction index (BLFEI). The BLFEI index takes advantage of its simplicity and good separability between the four major component of urban system, namely built-up, barren, vegetation and water. The histogram overlap method and the spectral discrimination index (SDI) are used to study separability. BLFEI index uses the two bands of infrared shortwaves, the red and green bands of the visible spectrum. OLI imagery of Algiers, Algeria, was used to extract built-up areas through BLFEI and some new previously developed built-up indices used for comparison. The water areas are masked out leading to Otsu?s thresholding algorithm to automatically find the optimal value for extracting built-up land from waterless regions. BLFEI, the new index improved the separability by 25% and the accuracy by 5%.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantation mapping is important for understanding deforestation and climate change. While most existing plantation products are created manually, in this paper we study an ensemble learning based framework for automatically mapping plantations in southern Kalimantan on a yearly scale using remote sensing data. We study the effectiveness of several components in this framework, including class aggregation, data sampling, learning model selection and post-processing, by comparing with multiple baselines. In addition, we analyze the quality of our plantation mapping product by visual examination of high resolution images. We also compare our method to existing manually labeled plantation datasets and show that our method can achieve a better balance of precision (i.e., user's accuracy) and recall (i.e., producer's accuracy).

TI  - Asian and Trans-Pacific Dust: A Multimodel and Multiremote Sensing Observation Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust is one of the dominant aerosol types over Asia and the North Pacific Ocean, but quantitative estimation of dust distribution and its contribution to the total regional aerosol load from observations is challenging due to the presence of significant anthropogenic and natural aerosols and the frequent influence of clouds over the region. This study presents the dust aerosol distributions over Asia and the North Pacific using simulations from five global models that participated in the AeroCom phase II model experiments, and from multiple satellite remote sensing and ground-based measurements of total aerosol optical depth and dust optical depth. We examine various aspects of aerosol and dust presence in our study domain: (1) the horizontal distribution, (2) the longitudinal gradient during trans-Pacific transport, (3) seasonal variations, (4) vertical profiles, and (5) model-simulated dust life cycles. This study reveals that dust optical depth model diversity is driven mostly by diversity in the dust source strength, followed by residence time and mass extinction efficiency.

TI  - Investigating the land use characteristics of urban integration based on remote sensing data: experience from Guangzhou and Foshan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban integration is an increasingly popular phenomenon. It is important to characterize the dynamic processes of urban integration from the perspective of geography. However, previous studies mainly focussed on the overall characteristics of a single entity and failed to consider inter-city influences. Therefore, this study aims to systematically investigate this phenomenon. Firstly, spatial clustering technique and landscape metric were used to analyze the temporal change of spatial layout. Secondly, we built multiple ring buffers of city boundary to reveal the directional differences in urban expansion. Lastly, we compared the observed land use data with the results simulated by cellular automata model. These experiments have shown that the urban expansion characteristics during the urban integration process are rather different from those of a single city, and the above methodology can effectively characterize the urban integration phenomenon. The successful example of Guangzhou?Foshan integration could also provide practical experience for other similar attempts.

AB  - Decentralized environmental management is a widespread conservation strategy in Africa, yet a better understanding of how community-based programs evolve is critical to success. We conducted 10 focus groups to assess how stakeholder groups in community-based conservancies mature with time, comparing two older, more established conservancies with three younger ones. We tested a Group Maturity Model to determine how conservancy age relates to group characteristics, including worldview, internal processes, external links, and lifespan. Conservancies changed over time, with older programs having higher maturity scores than younger programs. Stakeholder maturity scores within groups did not differ, yet qualitative differences among conservancies revealed important developmental elements for community-based programs. Our results suggest ways to use the Group Maturity Model to facilitate environmental management evaluation. Community-based environmental management projects can use group maturity evaluation to identify potential interventions for enhancing program efficacy.

TI  - Why is a live chicken banned from the kindergarten? Two lessons learned from teaching posthuman pedagogy to university students
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hierarchical human-centric paradigm has been criticized by various movements of posthuman philosophy because this paradigm forgets and dismisses nonhuman beings and entities: animals, nature, objects, and technology. When I developed a course called 'Education and Adaptations of Animal Studies' for university students in 2015, I learned two lessons in practice. First, many humans, pedagogues, and academics want to hold on to their anthropocentric worldview that separates them from other species. Second, in pedagogical practices humans prefer to avoid confronting the violence they do toward animals. In this article, I reflect on these two lessons learned and consider what they tell us about the dichotomies, anthropocentrism, and speciesism visible in pedagogical practices. I also discuss how posthuman pedagogy and posthuman ethics can help us ask uneasy questions that fracture the uncertain conception of human superiority.

TI  - Potential of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A composite for land use land cover analysis
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes the development of a multi-sensor, multi-spectral composite from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery referred to as ?LSC? for land use land cover (LULC) characterisation and compared with respect to the hyperspectral imagery of the EO1: Hyperion sensor. A three-stage evaluation was implemented based on the similarity observed in the spectral response, supervised classification results and endmember abundance information obtained using linear spectral unmixing. The study was conducted for two areas located around Dhundi and Rohtak in Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, respectively. According to the analysis of the spectral reflectance curves, the spectral response of the LSC is capable of identifying major LULC classes. The kappa accuracy of 0.85 and 0.66 was observed for the classification results from LSC and Hyperion data for Dhundi and Rohtak datasets, respectively. The coefficient of determination was found to be above 0.9 for the LULC classes in both the datasets as compared to Hyperion, indicating a good agreement. Thus, these three-stage results indicated the significant potential of a composite derived from freely available multi-sensor multi-spectral imagery as an alternative to hyperspectral imagery for LULC studies.

TI  - Residences information extraction from Landsat imagery using the multi-parameter decision tree method
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate grasp of changes in residences is crucial for urban planning and urbanisation. However, the traditional methods for extracting residences exists several problems, which lead to inaccurate extraction results. In this study, the Landsat image is used to establish a new method for extracting the residences quickly and accurately. The specific steps are as follows: (1) We calculate surface albedo to exclude the interference of waters and shadows; (2) Using single-band threshold method, we eliminate the interference of shadows; (3) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is calculated to exclude the effects of vegetation; (4) Roads are removed by calculating the shape index. Verification shows that the accuracy of this extraction method is 92.81%, which is more accurate than the traditional methods and solves the problems existed in the traditional methods. This novel method is a new reference for other land cover research on the technical aspect.

TI  - Midlatitude Lightning NO<sub>x</sub> Production Efficiency Inferred From OMI and WWLLN Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxides of nitrogen are critical trace gases in the troposphere and are precursors for nitrate aerosol and ozone, which is an important pollutant and greenhouse gas. Lightning is the major source of NOx (NO + NO2) in the middle to upper troposphere. We estimate the production efficiency (PE) of lightning NOx (LNOx) using satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and the ground-based World Wide Lightning Location Network in three northern midlatitudes, primarily continental regions that include much of North America, Europe, and East Asia. Data were obtained over five boreal summers, 2007-2011, and comprise the largest number of midlatitude convective events to date for estimating the LNOx PE with satellite NO2 and ground-based lightning measurements. In contrast to some previous studies, the algorithm assumes no minimum flash-rate threshold and estimates freshly produced LNOx by subtracting a background of aged NOx estimated from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument data set itself. We infer an average value of 180 +/- 100 moles LNOx produced per lightning flash. We also show evidence of a dependence of PE on lightning flash rate and find an approximate empirical power function relating moles LNOx to flashes. PE decreases by an order of magnitude for a 2 orders of magnitude increase in flash rate. This phenomenon has not been reported in previous satellite LNOx studies but is consistent with ground-based observations suggesting an inverse relationship between flash rate and size.

TI  - Modeling of the spatial and temporal dynamics of erosivity in the Amazon
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is one of the main factors of soil erosion, and the intensity, duration and frequency of precipitation can aggravate the erosive process. The objective of the study was to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall erosivity in the Amazon. Data were collected from 334 rainfall gauge stations distributed throughout the region, composing a series of 20 years (1997-2016). The gaps in this series were filled with satellite data using the CPC MORPHing technique. The erosivity equations used were those available in the literature and based on the modified Fournier index. The values of precipitation and erosivity were interpolated using GIS software, and thematic maps were generated for these variables. The annual value of rainfall erosivity ranged from 7060 to 36767 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1)). On the monthly scale, the highest rates of erosivity were recorded in the rainy season, i.e., February and March, at approximately 1548 and 2651 (Mj mm ha(-1) h(-1) month(-1)), respectively. In the context of erosion risk, the region was classified as having very strong erosivity. Therefore, it is imperative that land management and conservation policies be implemented to minimize erosion in the region, which, at its borders, undergoes intense land use change, i.e., forests are being transformed into pastures and grain crops.

TI  - Data quality in healthcare: A report of practical experience with the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Data quality (DQ) is the degree to which a given dataset meets a user's requirements. In the primary healthcare setting, poor quality data can lead to poor patient care, negatively affect the validity and reproducibility of research results and limit the value that such data may have for public health surveillance. To extract reliable and useful information from a large quantity of data and to make more effective and informed decisions, data should be as clean and free of errors as possible. Moreover, because DQ is defined within the context of different user requirements that often change, DQ should be considered to be an emergent construct. As such, we cannot expect that a sufficient level of DQ will last forever. Therefore, the quality of clinical data should be constantly assessed and reassessed in an iterative fashion to ensure that appropriate levels of quality are sustained in an acceptable and transparent manner. This document is based on our hands-on experiences dealing with DQ improvement for the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database. The DQ dimensions that are discussed here are accuracy and precision, completeness and comprehensiveness, consistency, timeliness, uniqueness, data cleaning and coherence.

TI  - An integrated study on change detection and environment evaluation of surface water
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water pollution is one of the serious environment pollution problems, posing threat to human and other creatures. Extraction, change detection and environment evaluation of surface water are prerequisite for water resource management. Undoubtedly, remote sensing data play an important role in these researches because of its large geographic coverage and high temporal frequency. In this study, the Tianjin Binhai New Area was chosen as the study area and the surface water extraction method Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used by combining with adaptive dynamic threshold to extract surface water and detect its change. Comparing with single-band threshold, model of multi-band spectral relationship, Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm and MNDWI, MNDWI-based adaptive dynamic threshold method performed better, which considered the influence of background. Analysis on dynamic change of water showed the area of lake and river had increased and the area of seawater had decreased. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis between area change of surface water and impact factors indicated both climatic and anthropogenic factors made positive contribution to the present water environment situation. Finally, an improved model of surface water environment evaluation was established to evaluate water quality by combining genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation (BP) neural network model. And the test results proved that the optimized GA-BP neural network is better than the single BP neural network. The environment evaluation indicated that water quality of the Haihe River section in the study area was poor. Therefore, water environment protection should be strengthened in this area. Some suggestions on practical management were given accordingly.

TI  - Desmoplastic melanoma: The role of pure and mixed subtype in sentinel lymph node biopsy and survival
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is an uncommon type of melanoma. Two histological subtypes of DM can be distinguished: pure and mixed (PDM and MDM). We hypothesized that discrimination between these subtypes is associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status and survival. Methods Clinicopathological data from PALGA, the Dutch Pathology Register were retrieved from patients diagnosed with DM in The Netherlands between 2000 and 2014. Clinical and pathological variables were extracted from pathology text files, including pure or mixed desmoplastic morphology. A Cox proportional hazard model was performed for overall and recurrence-free survival (OS and RFS). Results A total of 239 patients with DM were included, representing 0.4% of all primary cutaneous melanoma in The Netherlands. A total of 114 PDM and 125 MDM patients were identified. MDM was significantly associated with positive SLNB status (P = .035). In multivariable analysis, age (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.14, P < .001) and ulceration (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, P = .036) were significant predictors for OS. For RFS, mixed subtype (HR 2.72 95% CI 1.07-6.89, P = .035), male gender (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.03-6.27, P = .043), and Breslow thickness (HR 1.13 per mm, 95% CI 1.05-1.21, P = .001) were significant predictors. Conclusion MDM is significantly associated with a positive SLNB status. Mixed subtype is significantly correlated with RFS, but not with OS. The distinction between pure and mixed desmoplastic subtype therefore seems to be of clinical importance.

TI  - Soil erosion rates assessed by RUSLE and PESERA for a Chinese Loess Plateau catchment under land-cover changes
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Chinese Loess Plateau, soil erosion models are often employed to predict erosion rates and responses to land-use/-cover changes (LUCCs). Previous Loess Plateau studies employed individual models with specific emphases but model comparisons have not been undertaken so the relative performance of different models is not known. In this study we employed two extensively applied models (RUSLE and PESERA) to investigate the impact of LUCCs during 1990-2000 and 2000-2011 on soil erosion rates for a typical Loess Plateau catchment (i.e. Huangfuchuan), and compared their modelling results. Land-cover patterns for 1990, 2000 and 2011 were derived from Landsat images. The catchment was dominated by grassland (over 70%) and experienced considerable LUCCs: vegetation coverage increased from 38.3% in 1990 to 48.7% in 2011. Modelling results suggested that mean soil erosion rates of the catchment increased under the 1990-2000 LUCC and decreased under the 2000-2011 LUCC. Sandy land and scrubland were found to suffer from most severe soil erosion and thus should be the focus of future conservation work. Mean soil erosion rates on steep slopes (i.e. > 25 degrees) were predicted to increase under the 2000-2011 LUCC, implying that further work is still needed to study soil erosion processes and their conservation on steep slopes. Model comparisons showed that RUSLE predictions were higher than PESERA predictions for most areas (particularly for steep slopes), and the former were generally closer than the latter to check-dam sediment yield measurements. RUSLE and PESERA results were not linearly correlated, possibly due to differences in their underlying principles and their sensitivity to crucial parameters - RUSLE is more sensitive to slope gradients while PESERA is more sensitive to vegetation coverage. PESERA needs improvement to better account for steep slope erosion processes on the Loess Plateau, while RUSLE needs improvement in the description of vegetation effects.

TI  - The spatio-temporal patterns of the topsoil organic carbon density and its influencing factors based on different estimation models in the grassland of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The grassland soils of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) store a large amount of organic carbon because of the cold, humid climate, and topsoil organic carbon is quite sensitive to global climate changes. However, the spatio-temporal dynamics and factors that influence the soil organic carbon (SOC) on the QTP's grassland are not understood well. Moreover, there are few comparative analyses of different approaches to estimate the QTP' SOC. In this study, we estimated the storage and patterns of SOC density (SOCD) using several methods, including MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) retrieval, field data and previous empirical models (Models1-4, and soil organic matter (SOM)). And their relations with aboveground biomass, soil moisture, temperature, elevation, and soil conductivity were further explored. The results showed that SOC showed a similar variation trend in the different models, in which it decreased with increasing bulk density (BD) in the topsoil at 30 cm. For meadow and steppe grasslands, Models 1, 2, and 4 showed similar estimated values of SOCD, while Model3 had a lower value than them. SOC storage in the BD 3 and SOM methods had abnormal values, while the MODIS-NDVI, BD 1, 2, and 4 methods had similar SOC stock values for meadow and steppe grassland. Moreover, meadow grassland had a higher SOC storage than did steppe grassland, with means values of 397.9x10(10) kg and 242.2x10(10) kg, respectively. SOCD's spatial distribution using MODIS-NDVI method differed clearly from the empirical models, with a significant tendency for spatial variation that increased from the northwestern to southeastern regions on the QTP. Therefore, based on the values estimated and spatial variation features, the MODIS-NDVI method may be a more feasible and valid model to estimate SOC. Moreover, the mean annual SOCD values during 2000-2015 showed an increasing trend, with a higher mean value in meadow and a lower mean value in steppe. Further, SOCD was correlated significantly and positively with aboveground biomass and soil moisture, and negatively correlated with elevation and soil conductivity. Increasing temperature had negative effects on SOCD, which was consistent with the global trend. These results indicated that topsoil moisture plays a key role in SOCD spatial patterns. Our results provide valuable support for the long-term estimation of SOCD in future research on the QTP.

TI  - Influence of traffic accessibility on land use based on Landsat imagery and internet map: A case study of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration, with its rapid economic and social development and dramatic changes in land use, as an example with which to conduct this research, this paper analyzes the influence of traffic accessibility on land use and socioeconomic development by using Internet maps, points of interest (POI), and data about land use and socioeconomic development. The results of this study are as follows: (1) the calculation results of traffic accessibility can reflect the real situation because spatial distribution has an obvious feature of circle-like structure, and the development level of each township has high consistency; (2) major change characteristics in land use are that cultivated and forest lands are decreasing, and construction land is increasing, and it is obvious that the increase of construction land is featured by spatial autocorrelation and clusters of construction areas along the city borders; (3) traffic accessibility has a significant impact on land use status and changes and socioeconomic development, while the number of facilities has weak impact on land use, which is a reflection of advanced infrastructure in the urban agglomeration; and (4) the construction of transport infrastructure promotes the transformation of land use from water to construction land, therefore, more emphasis should be placed on protecting the river system in future infrastructure construction so as to improve the ecological benefits in the river basin.

TI  - A global Budyko model to partition evaporation into interception and transpiration
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaporation is a crucial flux in the hydrological cycle and links the water and energy balance of a catchment. The Budyko framework is often used to provide a first-order estimate of evaporation, as it is a straightforward model with only rainfall and potential evaporation as required input. Many researchers have improved the Budyko framework by including more physics and catchment characteristics in the original equation. However, the parameterization of these improved Budyko models is not so straightforward, is data demanding, and requires local knowledge that is difficult to obtain at the global scale. In this paper we present an improvement of the previously presented Gerrits' model ("Analytical derivation of the Budyko curve based on rainfall characteristics and a simple evaporation model" in Gerrits et al., 2009 WRR), whereby total evaporation is calculated on the basis of simple interception and transpiration thresholds in combination with measurable parameters like rainfall dynamics and storage availability from remotely sensed data sources. While Gerrits' model was previously investigated for 10 catchments with different climate conditions and where some parameters were assumed to be constant, in this study we applied the model at the global scale and fed the model with remotely sensed input data. The output of the model has been compared to two complex land-surface models, S STEAM and GLEAM, as well as the database of Landflux-EVAL. Our results show that total evaporation estimated by Gerrits' model is in good agreement with Landflux-EVAL, STEAM, and GLEAM. The results also show that Gerrits' model underestimates interception in comparison to STEAM and overestimates it in comparison to GLEAM, whereas the opposite is found for transpiration. Errors in interception can partly be explained by differences in the definition of interception that successively introduce errors in the calculation of transpiration. Relating to the Budyko framework, the model shows a reasonable performance for the estimation of total evaporation. The results also found a unimodal distribution of the transpiration to precipitation fraction (E-t/P), indicating that both increasing and decreasing aridity will result in a decline in the fraction of transpired rainfall by plants for growth and metabolism.

TI  - Bleaching and post-bleaching mortality of <i>Acropora</i> corals on a heat-susceptible reef in 2016
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, global temperatures were the highest on record, and mass coral bleaching occurred world-wide. However, around Sesoko Island, Okinawa, southwestern Japan, the heat stress assessed by degree heating week (DHW) based on local temperature measurements was moderate in 2016; in 1998, DHW was three times higher than in 2016 (10.6 vs. 3.3 in September in respective years). On a reef flat of Sesoko Island where the effect of severe coral bleaching on coral assemblage was monitored in 1998, significant coral bleaching occurred in 2016. Bleaching of the heat stress sensitive Acropora corals began in July 2016 on the reef flat as seawater temperature rose. We observed the bleaching and post-bleaching mortality status of individual colonies of Acropora spp. in 2016 in fixed plots on the reef flat. In total, 123 Acropora colonies were followed for six months after seawater temperature became normal by multiple surveys. At the beginning of September 2016, 99.2% of colonies, were either completely (92.7%) or partially (6.5%) bleached. Of those, the dominant species or species groups were A. gemmifera (Ag), A. digitifera (Ad), and tabular Acropora (tA). For all Acropora colonies, the overall whole and partial mortality was 41.5% and 11.4%, respectively. Whole mortality rate differed significantly among species; 72.5%, 17.9%, and 27.8% in Ag, Ad, and tA, respectively. Mortality rates at the end of the surveys were similar in smaller (<= 10 cm in diameter) and larger Ag, but the former suffered mortality earlier than the latter. Higher survival of smaller colonies was observed only in tA (100%), which may be associated with large morphological differences between smaller and larger colonies. Some of the dominant Acropora colonies had survived without partial mortality including 15.0% survival of the most vulnerable Ag at the end of the surveys. These results suggest that moderate heat stress may have a potential for selecting heat-tolerant genotypes. A longer period of mortality lasting for six months, was observed in Ag in addition to immediate whole mortality after bleaching, due to the continuous loss of living tissue by partial mortality. This highlights the need for multiple surveys at least during several months to accurately assess the impact of thermal stress event to corals. In contrast to DHW based on local measurements, DHW obtained from satellite data were similar between 1998 and 2016. Although satellite-based measurement of sea surface temperature is very useful to reveal variations in heat stress at a large spatial scale, temperature should be measured on site when variations at smaller spatial scales are of interest.

TI  - Relationship between land surface temperature and fraction of anthropized area in the Atlantic forest region, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing evidence that modification of tropical forests to pasture or other anthropic uses (anthropization) leads to land surface warming at local and regional scales; however, the degree of this effect is unknown given the dependence on physiographic and atmospheric conditions. We investigated the dependence of satellite land surface temperature (LST) on the fraction of anthropized area index, defined as the fraction of non-forested percentual area within 120m square boxes, sampled over a large tropical forest dominated ecosystem spatial domain in the Atlantic Forest biome, southeastern Brazil. The LST estimated at a 30 m resolution, showed a significant dependence on elevation and topographic aspect, which controlled the average thermal regime by 2 similar to 4 degrees C and 1 similar to 2 degrees C, respectively. The correction of LST by these topographic factors allowed to detect a dependence of LST on the fraction of non-forested area. Accordingly, the relationship between LST and the fraction of non-forested area showed a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.63), whereby each 25% increase of non-forest area resulted in increased 1 degrees C. As such, increase of the maximum temperature (similar to 4 degrees C) would occur in the case of 100% increase of non-forested area. We conclude that our study area, composed to Atlantic forest, appears to show regulatory characteristics of temperature attenuation as a local climatic ecosystem service, which may have mitigation effects on the accelerated global warming.

TI  - Coefficients optimization of the GLASS broadband emissivity based on FTIR and MODIS data over the Taklimakan Desert
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the Taklimakan Desert land surface emissivity measured by portable Fourier Transform thermal InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to re-estimate Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) BroadBand Emissivity (BBE) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BBE optimal coefficients equations. In addition, the revised BBE equations of both GLASS and MODIS with the optimized coefficients were obtained. Comparing the FTIR and MODIS BBE data with the values retrieved before and after the revised GLASS BBE equation, it was found that the revised GLASS BBE equation is more accurate than the original one. First, according to the error analysis with FTIR data, the value of R-2 is increased from 0.4 to 0.9, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias are reduced by 1 and 3 magnitude orders, respectively. Second, with MODIS BBE data, the value of R-2 is increased from 0.6 to 0.9, the RMSE and Bias are reduced by 1 and 2 magnitude orders, respectively. Finally, the Taklimakan Desert BBE was calculated using the revised GLASS BBE equation. The results showed that the BBE values are between 0.890 and 0.920 in the desert center, between 0.920 and 0.950 in the sparse vegetation areas, and between 0.950 and 0.980 in the oasis edges.

TI  - Multiplex ligation reaction based on probe melting curve analysis: a pragmatic approach for the identification of 30 common <i>Salmonella</i> serovars
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: While Salmonella serotyping is of paramount importance for the disease intervention of salmonellosis, a fast and easy-to-operate molecular serotyping solution remains elusive. We have developed a multiplex ligation reaction based on probe melting curve analysis (MLMA) for the identification of 30 common Salmonella serovars.Methods: Serovar-specific primers and probes were designed based on a comparison of gene targets (wzx and wzy encoding for somatic antigen biosynthesis; fliC and fljB for flagellar antigens) from 5868 Salmonella genomes. The ssaR gene, a type III secretion system component, was included for the confirmation of Salmonella.Results: All gene targets were detected and gave expected Tm values during assay evaluation. Cross reactions were not demonstrated between the 30 serovars (n = 211), or with an additional 120 serovars (n = 120) and other Enterobacteriaceae (n = 3). The limit of identification for all targets ranged from using 1.2 ng/mu L to 1.56 ng/mu L of DNA. The intra- and inter-assay standard deviations and the coefficients of variation were no more than 0.5 degrees C and less than 1% respectively, indicating high reproducibility. From consecutive outpatient stool samples (n = 3590) collected over a 10-month period at 11 sentinel hospitals in Shenzhen, China, we conducted a multicenter study using the traditional Salmonella identification workflow and the MLMA assay workflow in parallel. From Salmonella isolates (n = 496, 13.8%) derived by both workflows, total agreement (kappa = 1.0) between the MLMA assay and conventional serotyping was demonstrated.Conclusions: With an assay time of 2.5 h, this simple assay has shown promising potential to provide rapid and high-throughput identification of Salmonella serovars for clinical and public health laboratories to facilitate timely surveillance of salmonellosis.

TI  - Shortcomings of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration in the axillary management of women with breast cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ultrasound, along with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, is currently used for the axillary evaluation of breast cancer patients in order to identify candidates for axillary lymph node dissection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of this tool in correctly identifying patients who may or may not benefit from axillary clearance in light of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial recommendations.Methods: One hundred one patients (65 with positive US-FNA with corresponding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 36 with negative US-FNA with corresponding ALND/sentinel lymph node biopsy) were studied for the number of involved axillary lymph nodes, tumor clinicopathologic features, and axillary radiologic findings.Results: From the positive US-FNA group, 43% of patients had two or fewer positive lymph nodes upon ALND pathologic examination. In the US-FNA negative group, the negative predictive value for detecting axillary disease was 72.7%. With both groups combined, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of US-FNA for selecting patients based on axillary disease burden were 86%, 51.7%, 57%, and 83.3%, respectively.Conclusion: Based on Z0011 guidelines, US-FNA is not a reliable tool in triaging patients in need for ALND and leads to overtreatment of 43% patients when positive, while depriving a small but significant percentage of patients from necessary therapy, when negative.

TI  - Where are the avalanches? Rapid SPOT6 satellite data acquisition to map an extreme avalanche period over the Swiss Alps
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on avalanche occurrence is key for avalanche warning, crisis management and avalanche documentation. Today such information is mainly available at isolated locations provided by observers in the field. The achieved reliability, considering accuracy, completeness and reliability of the reported avalanche events, is limited. In this study we present the spatially continuous mapping of a large avalanche period in January 2018 covering the majority of the Swiss Alps (12 500 km(2)).We tested different satellite sensors available for rapid mapping during the first avalanche period. Based on these experiences, we tasked SPOT6 and SPOT7 for data acquisition to cover the second, much larger avalanche period. We manually mapped the outlines of 18 737 individual avalanche events, applying image enhancement techniques to analyze regions in the shade as well as in brightly illuminated ones. The resulting dataset of mapped avalanche outlines, having unique completeness and reliability, is evaluated to produce maps of avalanche occurrence and avalanche size. We validated the mapping of the avalanche outlines using photographs acquired from helicopters just after the avalanche period.This study demonstrates the applicability of optical, very high spatial resolution satellite data to map an exceptional avalanche period with very high completeness, accuracy and reliability over a large region. The generated avalanche data are of great value in validating avalanche bulletins, in completing existing avalanche databases and for research applications by enabling meaningful statistics on important avalanche parameters.

TI  - Spatial pattern analysis of post-fire damages in the Menderes District of Turkey
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires, whether caused naturally or by human activity can have disastrous effects on the environment. Turkey, located in the Mediterranean climate zone, experiences hundreds of forest fires every year. Over the past two decades, these fires have destroyed approximately 308000 ha of forest area, threatening the sustainability of its ecosystem. This study analyzes the forest fire that occurred in the Menderes region of Izmir on July 1, 2017, by using pre- and post-fire Sentinel 2 (10 m and 20 m) and Landsat 8 (30 m) satellite images, MODIS and VIIRS fire radiative power (FRP) data (1000 m and 375 m, respectively), and reference data obtained from a field study. Hence, image processing techniques integrated with the Geographic Information System (GIS) database were applied to a satellite image data set to monitor, analyze, and map the effects of the forest fire. The results show that the land surface temperature (LST) of the burned forest area increased from 1 to 11 degrees C. A high correlation (R = 0.81) between LST and burn severity was also determined. The burned areas were calculated using two different classification methods, and their accuracy was compared with the reference data. According to the accuracy assessment, the Sentinel (10 m) image classification gave the best result (96.43% for Maximum Likelihood, and 99.56% for Support Vector Machine). The relationship between topographical/forest parameters, burn severity and disturbance index was evaluated for spatial pattern distribution. According to the results, the areas having canopy closure between 71%-100% and slope above 35% had the highest burn incidence. As a final step, a spatial correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of MODIS and VIIRS FRP data in the post-fire analysis. A high correlation was found between FRP-slope, and FRP-burn severity (0.96 and 0.88, respectively).

TI  - Prediction of axillary response by monitoring with ultrasound and MRI during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate whether monitoring with ultrasound and MR imaging before, during and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can predict axillary response in breast cancer patients. Materials and methods A total of 131 breast cancer patients with clinically positive axillary lymph node (LN) who underwent NAC and subsequent surgery were enrolled. They had ultrasound and 3.0 T-MR examinations before, during and after NAC. After reviewing ultrasound and MR images, axillary LN features and tumour size (T size) were noted. According to LN status after surgery, imaging features and their diagnostic performances were analysed. Results Of the 131 patients, 60 (45.8%) had positive LNs after surgery. Pre-NAC T size at ultrasound and MR was different in positive LN status after surgery (p < 0.01). There were significant differences in mid- and post-NAC number, cortical thickness (CxT), T size and T size reduction at ultrasound and mid- and post-NAC CxT, hilum, T size and T size reduction, and post-NAC ratio of diameter at MR (p < 0.03). On multivariate analysis, pre-NAC MR T size (OR, 1.03), mid-NAC ultrasound T size (OR, 1.05) and CxT (OR, 1.53), and post-NAC MR T size (OR, 1.06) and CxT (OR, 1.64) were independently associated with positive LN (p < 0.004). Combined mid-NAC ultrasound T size and CxT showed the best diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.760. Conclusion Monitoring ultrasound and MR axillary LNs and T size can be useful to predict axillary response to NAC in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Analysis of vulnerable urban properties within river Ala floodplain in Akure, Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is a serious problem affecting the urban environment and threatens the lives and properties of the urban settlers, including Akure, Ondo State in Southwestern Nigeria where it has become recurrent. The study assessed the impact of flooding on some elements at risk along Ala River in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The land use/land cover change detection of Ala River catchments was carried out using 1984, 2000 and 2015 Landsat images. Each of the classes and the positional accuracy of the river were validated using GPS (Garmin78SC). Buffers were generated around the river channels using high resolution Google Images as input data. The result of LULC showed that there was positive increase in built up land use from 17.65% in 1984 to 24.96% in 2000 and 65.67% in 2015. The results of buffering analysis showed that 105, 214 and 554 buildings with the estimated population of 2520, 5136 and 13,296, fall within 10 m, 20 m and 30 m distance to the river. The study concluded that the incessant occurrence of flood in the study area was as a result of some driving forces such as climate, rapid urbanization, terrain configuration and violation of building regulations that rendered most properties along the flood plain very risky.

TI  - An integrated methodology for surface soil moisture estimating using remote sensing data approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to propose an operational approach for estimating surface soil moisture from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by considering diverse environmental variables such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (Ts), evapotranspiration, topographic parameters (elevation and aspect) and soil texture (clay, loam and silt). A soil moisture index (SMI) derived from NDVI-Ts space is combined to all other variables, based on stepwise multiple regression, to develop a new SSMC model. Performance of this model was assessed using field-measured data of SSM. Accuracy was performed by the k-fold cross validation method, it showed a R-2 (coefficients of determination) of 0.70, RMSE of 1.58% and unRMSE of 0.5%. In addition, the results of the developed model were compared with another soil moisture model SMM proposed in the irrigated perimeter of Tadla (Morocco), and revealed that the established model provided effectiveness results in the study areas.

TI  - A Full Satellite-Driven Method for the Retrieval of Clear-Sky Evapotranspiration
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system for its considerable effect in surface energy balance and water cycle. The determination of ET based on full satellite data has been a challenge. In the present study, a full satellite-driven method is proposed based on a newly developed pixel-to-pixel scheme of the land surface temperature-vegetation index trapezoidal feature space in the presence of clear-sky conditions. For the implementation of this approach, the three main meteorological parameters of net surface radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity were obtained solely based on satellite observations. With the exception of the three main satellite-derived meteorological parameters, different wind speed data-including actual measurements, the assimilated product, and an averaged value of meteorological observations-were used to investigate their effects on the retrieval of ET. Specifically, two pixel-to-pixel trapezoidal feature space schemes, namely an original and a two-stage scheme, were implemented to estimate ET over an arid region of the study area located in the northwest part of China. Comparison of the estimated ET with the values acquired from the eddy covariance systems yielded a reliable accuracy response with root-mean-squared errors of similar to 80 W/m(2) and similar to 70 W/m(2) for the original and two-stage trapezoidal methods with satellite-derived inputs, respectively, and constant wind speed data over the growing 2012 season from May to September. These results indicate that the full satellite-driven method is capable of estimating ET over the arid region of the study area.

TI  - Excretable Lanthanide Nanoparticle for Biomedical Imaging and Surgical Navigation in the Second Near-Infrared Window
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, various second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) fluorophores have been synthesized for in vivo imaging with nonradiation, high resolution, and low autofluorescence. However, most of the NIR-II fluorophores, especially inorganic nanoprobes, are mainly retained in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as the liver and spleen, leading to long-term safety concerns. Herein, a type of lanthanide-based excretable NIR-II nanoparticle, RENPs@Lips, which can be quickly cleared out of body after intravenous administration with half-lives of 23.0 h for the liver and 14.9 h for the spleen, is reported. Interestingly, over 90% of RENPs@Lips can be excreted through a hepatobiliary system within 72 h postinjection. The moderate blood half-time (T-1/2 = 17.96 min) allows for multifunctional applications in delineating the hemodynamics of vascular disorders (artery thrombosis, ischemia, and tumor angiogenesis) and monitoring blood perfusion in response to acute ischemia. In addition, RENPs@Lips exhibit high performance in identifying orthotopic tumor vessels intraoperatively and embolization surgery under NIR-II imaging navigation. Moreover, excellent signal-to-background ratio (SBR) is successfully achieved to facilitate sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) with tumor-bearing mice. The high biocompatibility, favorable excretability, and outstanding optical properties warrant RENPs@Lips as novel promising NIR-II nanoparticles for future applications and translation into an interdisciplinary amalgamation of research in diverse fields.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Current Status and Recent Progress
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard procedure used to evaluate the status of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) that are clinically tumor-free in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Recent research on SLNB has led to continual improvements in the scope of application, accuracy in information provided, and relevance of the results for subsequent treatment. This review is based on selective searches of the Springer Publishing Company and PubMed databases for articles about progress and developments of SLNB in patients with breast cancer. The main purposes are to summarize the current status and established indications for SLNB, identify specific topics that are still under debate, and suggest specific areas where further studies are most needed.

TI  - Sea ice export through the Fram Strait derived from a combined model and satellite data set
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice volume export through the Fram Strait plays an important role in the Arctic freshwater and energy redistribution. The combined model and satellite sea ice thickness (CMST) data set assimilates CryoSat-2 and soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) thickness products together with satellite sea ice concentration. The CMST data set closes the gap of stand-alone satellite-derived sea ice thickness in summer and therefore allows us to estimate sea ice volume export during the melt season. In this study, we first validate the CMST data set using field observations, and then we estimate the continuous seasonal and interannual variations in Arctic sea ice volume flux through the Fram Strait from September 2010 to December 2016. The results show that seasonal and interannual sea ice volume export vary from about -240(+/- 40) to -970(+/- 60) km(3) and -1970(+/- 290) to -2490(+/- 280) km(3), respectively. The sea ice volume export reaches its maximum in spring and about one-third of the yearly total volume export occurs in the melt season. The minimum monthly sea ice export is -11 km(3) in August 2015, and the maximum (-442 km(3)) appears in March 2011. The seasonal relative frequencies of sea ice thickness and drift suggest that the Fram Strait outlet in summer is dominated by sea ice that is thicker than 2 m with relatively slow seasonal mean drift of about 3 km d(-1).

TI  - Measurement of Cyanobacterial Bloom Magnitude using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a serious environmental, water quality and public health issue worldwide because of their ability to form dense biomass and produce toxins. Models and algorithms have been developed to detect and quantify cyanoHABs biomass using remotely sensed data but not for quantifying bloom magnitude, information that would guide water quality management decisions. We propose a method to quantify seasonal and annual cyanoHAB magnitude in lakes and reservoirs. The magnitude is the spatiotemporal mean of weekly or biweekly maximum cyanobacteria biomass for the season or year. CyanoHAB biomass is quantified using a standard reflectance spectral shape-based algorithm that uses data from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). We demonstrate the method to quantify annual and seasonal cyanoHAB magnitude in Florida and Ohio (USA) respectively during 2003-2011 and rank the lakes based on median magnitude over the study period. The new method can be applied to Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI) data for assessment of cyanoHABs and the change over time, even with issues such as variable data acquisition frequency or sensor calibration uncertainties between satellites. CyanoHAB magnitude can support monitoring and management decision-making for recreational and drinking water sources.

TI  - Estimating topsoil texture fractions by digital soil mapping-a response to the long outdated soil map in the Philippines
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil mapping for soil texture is mostly an understanding of how soil texture fractions vary in space as influenced by environmental variables mainly derived from the digital elevation model (DEM). In this study, topsoil texture models were generated and evaluated by multiple linear regression (MLR), ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging (SK) and universal kriging (UK) using free and open-source R, System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses, and QGIS software. Comparing these models is the main objective of the study. The study site covers an area of 124 km(2) of the Municipality of Barili, Cebu. A total of 177 soil samples were gathered and analyzed from irregular sample points. DEM derivatives and remote sensing data (Landsat 8) were used as environmental variables. Exploratory analyses revealed no outlier in the data. Skewness and kurtosis values of the untransformed data vary greatly between -3.85 to 7.20 and 1.8 to 70.7, respectively; an indication that variables are highly skewed with heavy tails. Thus, Tukey's ladder of powers transformation was applied that resulted to normal or nearly normal distribution having skewness values close to zero and kurtosis values have lighter tails. All data analysis from MLR modeling, variography, kriging, and cross-validations of models were implemented using the transformed data. Forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise selection methods were adapted for predictors selection in MLR. The MLR, OK, SK, and UK were applied and cross validated for topsoil texture prediction. Likewise, exponential, Gaussian, and spherical models were fitted for the experimental variograms. Backward elimination method for clay, sand, and silt have the lowest MAE and highest R-2 in MLR. The UK fitted with exponential variogram model has the highest R-2 of 0.878, 0.821, and 0.893 for clay, sand, and silt, respectively. These models can be adapted as a decision support for agricultural land use planning and crop suitability development in the area.

TI  - Mean European Carbon Sink Over 2010-2015 Estimated by Simultaneous Assimilation of Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, Soil Moisture, and Vegetation Optical Depth
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern land biosphere is believed to be the main global sink of CO2, but the contribution of Europe is uncertain. While bottom-up estimates and inverse atmospheric transport studies based on atmospheric CO2 observed in situ or from space by OCO-2 point to a moderate rate of uptake, some other inversions based on remotely sensed atmospheric CO2 from GOSAT/SCIAMACHY and biomass estimates from passive microwave satellite data point to a large sink of around 1 Gt C/yr. We present results from combining both approaches in a data assimilation framework, inverting a biosphere model against in situ atmospheric CO2 and passive microwave measurements. When assimilating all observations, we estimate a European carbon sink of 0.303 +/- 0.083 Gt C/yr for 2010-2015. The result agrees with other bottom-up studies and atmospheric inversions using in situ CO2 or OCO-2 observations pointing to potential data problems when using observations from GOSAT or SCIAMACHY to estimate the European CO2 sink.

A preliminary risk assessment revealed serious risks for both students and patients and had to be addressed by appropriate measures such as mandatory systematic safety training for each student.Methods: A short-term educational intervention named "Survival-Day" was designed to minimize risks related to nursing internships of students. This intervention consists of six 45-min-units with theoretical input (2 units) and hands-on training (4 units) imparting basic knowledge and skills in CPR, hand hygiene and handling of masks and protective gowns, prevention of needle stick injuries, fire protection and firefighting. Performance of CPR was assessed using computerized manikins. Acceptance, necessity and usability were assessed anonymously by standardized written questionnaires after completion of nursing internships.Results: 462 students have completed the Survival-Day until January 2019. CPR performance showed acceptable adherence rates to guideline recommendations (mean 78.8%, SD +/- 22.6%). The majority of students performed aseptic health care activities (66%), treated patients with multi-resistant pathogens (62%) and disposed sharp instruments such as blood-contaminated needles (76%). According to students' self-reports about these hazardous activities, less than 50% of these students received adequate safety training at nursing facilities. However, no sentinel events such as needle stick injuries or students becoming second victim have been reported.Conclusion: Our study reveals severe discrepancies between legal obligation of nursing facilities to ensure safety instructions for nursing interns and initial training as perceived by this group. Mandatory initial training before conduction of hazardous tasks was mainly covered by our short-term educational intervention (Survival-Day). Regarding responsibility for their students a preliminary safety instruction program like the Survival-Day should be considered for all educational institutions sending students to nursing internships unless mandatory and sufficient safety trainings for nursing interns can be guaranteed by nursing facilities.

TI  - A Robust Pan-Sharpening Scheme for Improving Resolution of Satellite Images in the Domain of the Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform
T2  - SENSING AND IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is a substantial post-processing task for captured multispectral remotely sensed satellite imagery. Its main purpose is to fuse the high spectral characteristics of the multispectral (MS) images with the high spatial information of the panchromatic (Pan) image to output a sharper MS image (pan-sharpened) that encompasses higher spectral and spatial resolutions. In this paper, we investigate a conception of a new pan-sharpening scheme using the pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) in the nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain. This can be done based on two main steps. In the first step, the input MS and Pan images are individually decomposed into multi-scaled and multi-directional coefficients by NSST. Second, the PCNN is applied to the low-frequency coefficients, which are merged by a weighted firing energy fusion rule utilizing the PCNN firing times. The detail coefficients with higher matching value are chosen to be the fused detail coefficients. Lastly, the pan-sharpened image is generated by the inverse NSST. WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and QuickBird satellite datasets are employed in the experiments which demonstrate that the investigated scheme gained the ability in preserving both the high spatial details and high spectral characteristics simultaneously without involving abundant computation time. In addition, various image quality metrics such as CC, RMSE, RASE, ERGAS, SAM, Q4, QNR, and SCC are adopted to assess the spectral and spatial qualities of the pan-sharpened image. The experimental results and performance analysis illustrated that our scheme improved performance efficiency and achieved superiority over other conventional techniques.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth Over North China From Polarized Satellite Observations Using Re-derived Surface Properties
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - North China has one of the world's largest densities of atmospheric aerosol particles. The surface and aerosol properties in this area are complex. We evaluated the spectral relationship between surface polarized reflectances and introduced specific types of aerosol to improve the remote sensing of aerosols in this area. First, we searched for low-aerosol-loading areas (clean areas) based on Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements between 2009 and 2011. Then, we recalculated the spectral relationships of surface polarized reflectance from corrected Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) measurements. Finally, the re-derived relationships and aerosol clustering modes for East Asia were applied using the adaptive land-atmospheric decoupling (ALAD) algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD). We collected 914 PARASOL measured samples matched the site data of the aerosol robotic network (AERONET), within a wide AOD range between 2005 and 2013. The AOD trends from AERONET and PARASOL were similar. The slope of the regression line was 0.836, with a low intercept (0.032) and high correlation coefficient (0.854), and 53.6% of the retrieved AODs were within the range of the expected error. Compared with the MODIS daily AOD, we found that the variation in PARASOL results displayed a smooth tendency with the increase of AODs. The 914 sampling points were classified according to location and season to identify any discrepancies in the retrieved results. It was found that vegetation surfaces were responsible for most of the uncertainty due to their seasonal characteristics.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of aerosol and potential long-range transport impact over the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term temporal-spatial variations in the aerosol optical properties over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the potential long-range transport from surrounding areas to the TP were analyzed in this work, by using multiple years of sun photometer measurements (CE318) at five stations in the TP, satellite aerosol products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud=Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), back-trajectory analysis from the Hybrid Single Particle La-grangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) and model simulations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)Chem chemistry transport model. The results from the ground-based observations showed that the annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 440 nm at most TP sites increased in recent decades with trends of 0.001 +/- 0.003 yr(-1) at Lhasa, 0.013 +/- 0.003 yr(-1) at Mt_WLG, 0.002 +/- 0.002 yr(-1) at NAM_CO and 0.000 +/- 0.002 yr(-1) at QOMS_CAS. The increasing trend was also found for the aerosol extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE) at most sites with the exception of the Mt_WLG site. Spatially, the AOD at 550 nm observed from MODIS showed negative trends at the northwest edge close to the Taklimakan Desert and to the east of the Qaidam Basin and slightly positive trends in most of the other areas of the TP. Different aerosol types and sources contributed to a polluted day (with CE318 AOD at 440 nm > 0.4) at the five sites on the TP: dust was the dominant aerosol type in Lhasa, Mt_WLG and Muztagh with sources in the Taklimakan Desert, but fine-aerosol pollution was dominant at NAM_CO and QOMS_CAS with transport from South Asia. A case of aerosol pollution at Lhasa, NAM_CO and QOMS_CAS during 28 April-3 May 2016 revealed that the smoke aerosols from South Asia were lifted up to 10 km and transported to the TP, while the dust from the Taklimakan Desert could climb the north slope of the TP and then be transported to the central TP. The long-range transport of aerosol thereby seriously impacted the aerosol loading over the TP.

TI  - What should the idealist critique of naturalism be? Hegel, Smithson, and liberal naturalism
T2  - INQUIRY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this journal, Robert Smithson argues that considerations stemming from Kantian and post-Kantian idealism undermine naturalistic arguments that seek to debunk elements of the 'manifest image' in favour of the 'scientific image'. The idealist tradition, on this view, holds that philosophy's task is to uncover and clarify the principles and norms which underlie different forms of inquiry, and is thus well placed to dispel the apparent 'placement' problems that stem from the collision of our ordinary worldview with contemporary philosophical naturalism. Smithson also argues that this idealist critique of naturalism is preferable to the Liberal Naturalist critique of naturalism. In this response, I argue that Smithson's view contains a gap which the naturalist can exploit to evade idealist critique, but that a Hegelian idealism contains no such gap, making it the better idealist choice. Further, I argue that that Hegelian idealism is itself plausibly a version of liberal naturalism.

TI  - MODIS-observed variations of lake ice phenology in Xinjiang, China
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes sensitively respond to global and regional climate change, especially in arid areas. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow products, the lake ice phenology of 23 lakes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China from 2001 to 2018 was extracted based on thresholds of ice/water pixel numbers, and their change trends over 18 years were calculated. The results of MODIS-derived lake ice phenology showed consistent variations with existing ice phenology data sets derived from passive microwave data. Generally, lakes in Xinjiang begin to freeze from October to December every year, and their ice cover periods end from March to June. The average ice cover duration for the 23 lakes is 167 days, of which 16 lakes have an average shortening rate of - 1.08 days/year and seven lakes have an average extending rate of 1.18 days/year. The majority of lakes experienced later freeze-up (17 lakes) and earlier break-up (18 lakes) from 2001 to 2018. Lake ice phenology is affected by both climatic factors and lake physicochemical characteristics, in which freeze-up dates are more easily affected by lake-specific factors such as lake area (r = 0.535), while climatic factors especially water surface temperature have greater impacts on lake break-up dates (r = - 0.874). Compared to air temperature, water surface temperature changes have a more direct influence on the variations in lake ice phenology, 1 degrees increase in water surface temperature may cause the ice cover duration to decrease by 12 days, while precipitation changes have almost no effect on the lakes in Xinjiang. In some cases, lake changes such as changes to the area and mineralization may also have dominant impacts on lake ice phenology.

TI  - Constraining global aerosol emissions using POLDER/PARASOL satellite remote sensing observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We invert global black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and desert dust (DD) aerosol emissions from POLDER/PARASOL spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) using the GEOS-Chem inverse modeling framework. Our inverse modeling framework uses standard a priori emissions to provide a posteriori emissions that are constrained by POLDER/PARASOL AODs and AAODs. The following global emission values were retrieved for the three aerosol components: 18.4 Tg yr(-1) for BC, 109.9 Tg yr(-1) for OC and 731.6 Tg yr(-1) for DD for the year 2010. These values show a difference of +166.7 %, +184.0% and -42.4 %, respectively, with respect to the a priori values of emission inventories used in "standard" GEOS-Chem runs. The model simulations using a posteriori emissions (i.e., retrieved emissions) provide values of 0.119 for global mean AOD and 0.0071 for AAOD at 550 nm, which are +13.3% and +82.1 %, respectively, higher than the AOD and AAOD obtained using the a priori values of emissions. Additionally, the a posteriori model simulation of AOD, AAOD, single scattering albedo, Angstrom exponent and absorption Angstrom exponent show better agreement with independent AERONET, MODIS and OMI measurements than the a priori simulation. Thus, this study suggests that using satellite-constrained global aerosol emissions in aerosol transport models can improve the accuracy of simulated global aerosol properties.

TI  - Improving the LPJmL4-SPITFIRE vegetation-fire model for South America using satellite data
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation fires influence global vegetation distribution, ecosystem functioning, and global carbon cycling. Specifically in South America, changes in fire occurrence together with land-use change accelerate ecosystem fragmentation and increase the vulnerability of tropical forests and savannas to climate change. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are valuable tools to estimate the effects of fire on ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling under future climate changes. However, most fire-enabled DGVMs have problems in capturing the magnitude, spatial patterns, and temporal dynamics of burned area as observed by satellites. As fire is controlled by the interplay of weather conditions, vegetation properties, and human activities, fire modules in DGVMs can be improved in various aspects. In this study we focus on improving the controls of climate and hence fuel moisture content on fire danger in the LPJmL4-SPITFIRE DGVM in South America, especially for the Brazilian fire-prone biomes of Caatinga and Cerrado. We therefore test two alternative model formulations (standard Nesterov Index and a newly implemented water vapor pressure deficit) for climate effects on fire danger within a formal model-data integration setup where we estimate model parameters against satellite datasets of burned area (GFED4) and aboveground biomass of trees. Our results show that the optimized model improves the representation of spatial patterns and the sea-sonal to interannual dynamics of burned area especially in the Cerrado and Caatinga regions. In addition, the model improves the simulation of aboveground biomass and the spatial distribution of plant functional types (PFTs). We obtained the best results by using the water vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for the calculation of fire danger. The VPD includes, in comparison to the Nesterov Index, a representation of the air humidity and the vegetation density. This work shows the successful application of a systematic model-data integration setup, as well as the integration of a new fire danger formulation, in order to optimize a process-based fire-enabled DGVM. It further highlights the potential of this approach to achieve a new level of accuracy in comprehensive global fire modeling and prediction.

TI  - Service ecosystem well-being: conceptualization and implications for theory and practice
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to conceptualize and characterize service ecosystems, addressing calls for research on this important and under-researched topic. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on four meta-theoretical foundations of S-D logic - resource integration, resource density, practices and institutions - providing a new integrated conceptual framework of ecosystem well-being. They then apply this conceptualization in the context of a complex healthcare setting, exploring the characteristics of ecosystem well-being at the meso level. Findings This study provides an integrated conceptual framework to explicate the nature and structure of well-being in a complex service ecosystem; identifies six key characteristics of ecosystem well-being; illustrates service ecosystem well-being in a specific healthcare context, zooming in on the meso level of the ecosystem and noting the importance of embedding a shared worldview; provides practical guidance for managers and policy makers about how to manage complex service ecosystems in their quest for improving service outcomes; and offers an insightful research agenda. Research limitations/implications - This research focuses on service ecosystems with an illustration in one healthcare context, suggesting additional studies that explore other industry contexts. Practical implications - Practically, the study indicates the imperative for managing across mutually adapting levels of the ecosystem, identifying specific new practices that can improve service outcomes. Social implications - Examining well-being in the context of a complex service ecosystem is critical for policymakers charged with difficult decisions about balancing the demands of different levels and actors in a systemic world. Originality/value The study is the first to conceptualize and characterize well-being in a service ecosystem, providing unique insights and identifying six specific characteristics of well-being.

TI  - Predator and scavenger movements among and within endangered seabird colonies: Opportunities for pathogen spread
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial structure of host communities is expected to constrain pathogen spread. However, predators and/or scavengers may connect distant host (sub)populations when foraging. Determining whether some individuals or populations play a prominent role in the spread of pathogens is critical to inform management measures. We explored movements and epidemiological status of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus, the only avian terrestrial consumer native of Amsterdam Island (Indian Ocean), to assess whether and how they could be involved in the spread of the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, which recurrently causes avian cholera outbreaks in endangered albatross and penguin species breeding on the island. High proportions of seropositive and DNA-positive individuals for P. multocida indicated that skuas are highly exposed to the pathogen and may be able to transmit it. Movement tracking revealed that the foraging ranges of breeding skuas largely overlap among individuals and expand all along the coasts where albatrosses and penguins nest, but not on the inland plateau hosting the endemic Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis. Considering the epidemiological and movement data, skua movements may provide opportunity for pathogen spread among and within seabird colonies. Synthesis and applications. This work highlights the importance of considering the behaviour and epidemiological status of predators and scavengers in disease dynamics because the foraging movements of individuals of such species can potentially limit the efficiency of local management measures in spatially structured host communities. Such species could thus represent priority vaccination targets to implement efficient management measures aiming at limiting pathogen spread and also be used as sentinels to monitor pathogen circulation and evaluate the effectiveness of management measures.

TI  - Google Earth as a data source for investigating river forms and processes: Discriminating river types using form-based process indicators
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth provides potential for exploiting an enormous reservoir of freely-available remotely sensed data to support river science and management. In this paper, we consider how the platform can support investigation of river physical forms and processes by developing an empirically-based reach-scale classification of semi-natural European single thread to transitional rivers. Using strict reach and image selection criteria, we identified 194 reaches of 68 rivers for analysis. Measurements of channel dimensions and counts of in-channel and floodplain features, standardised for reach length and channel width where necessary, were used to derive a series of geomorphologically-relevant process indicators. A suite of multivariate analyses were then applied to this data set, resulting in the discrimination of five river types: laterally stable, laterally active sinuous-meandering; transitional (near-braided); bedrock; and cascade/step dominated. The results of the classification were tested by examining the characteristics and distribution of the river classes in relation to known independent controls of river form including reach-scale energy and valley confinement conditions. Our results show that if methods of data extraction are carefully developed, physically meaningful river reach discrimination can be achieved using Google Earth. Although there are limits to the types of information that can be extracted such that field investigations cannot always be avoided, there is enormous potential to mine Google Earth across different space and time scales, supporting the assembly of large, reliable data sets relevant to river forms and processes in a very cost-effective way.

TI  - Ultra-Sensitive Detection and Inhibition of the Metastasis of Breast Cancer Cells to Adjacent Lymph Nodes and Distant Organs by Using Long-Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The metastasis of breast cancer mainly occurs through the axillary lymph node and blood circulation systems. It is extremely difficult to know when the cancer cells start to metastasize; however, early detection of breast cancer metastasis is crucial and challenging to enable surgical removal of the primary tumor and perform a systematic lymphadenectomy to eliminate invasion of the tumor. Herein, we report real-time tracking of the metastasis of orthotopic breast cancer with background-free near-infrared long-persistent luminescence (NIR-PL) imaging, and its guidance for the surgical removal of lymph nodes. The NIR-PL imaging is based on Cr3+/Nd3+ codoped ZnGa2O4 (A-ZGCN) nanoparticles with a superlong afterglow time of more than 15 days. We show that the detection sensitivity of metastasis of cancer cells with the NIR-PL imaging is higher than the classic bioluminescence imaging. We find that the metastasis of breast cancer cells to lymph nodes occurred as early as on the third day after orthotopic inoculation of breast cancer cells and followed an order of the proper axillary lymph node (PALN, day 3) > accessory axillary lymph node (AALN, day 6) > accessory mandibular lymph node (AMLN, day 9) > mandibular lymph node (MLN, day 25). In addition, we show that the NIR-PL nanoprobes (i.e., A-ZGCN NPs) displayed 17% radioenhancement, which was used for radiotherapy of orthotopic breast cancer to further prevent and reduce its metastasis to other organs. The radiotherapy treatment is superior to surgery for removal of the tumor accompanied by a NIR-PL imaging-guided lymphadenectomy. Our work demonstrates the great potential of NIR-PL imaging and the corresponding nanoprobes for tracking metastasis of cancer cells and for radiotherapy.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we derive the dispersion relation for waves within ice-covered waters from the Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath mode by using an innovative new implementation of the method proposed by Johnsen and Collard (2009). We apply this method to the spatial burst overlap area that is present due to the terrain observations with progressive scans (TOPS) technique. The advantage of this implementation is the use of a larger time separation between subsequent images that results in a less noisy and higher-quality imaginary spectrum, which allows us to obtain spatiotemporal information of the dispersion relation. We studied seven wave events in the Barents Sea, where we have accompanying in situ data of sea currents and sea ice draft, available from the Barents Sea Metocean and Ice Network measurement program. Having simultaneous data on the currents is a significant improvement over previous studies and allows us to quantify these data's influence on the dispersion relation. The derived dispersion relation from Sentinel-1 is derived for long waves propagating through icy waters (peak wavelengths 100-350 m), and it does not deviate from the theoretical open-water dispersion relation. At present, however, the spatial resolution of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is too coarse and does not enable the study of the dispersion relation for short waves within sea ice.

TI  - The 2017 Eruption of Erta 'Ale Volcano, Ethiopia: Insights Into the Shallow Axial Plumbing System of an Incipient Mid-Ocean Ridge
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The final stage of continental breakup is often accompanied by abundant magmatism. Erta 'Ale volcano lies on the Nubia-Arabia extensional boundary in Afar, Ethiopia, an incipient mid-ocean ridge. A fissure on the south flank of Erta 'Ale began erupting on 21 January 2017 and has remained active until at least July 2019. We use Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar acquisitions to create a time series of ground displacement measurements at Erta 'Ale from October 2014 to June 2019, covering the eruption and its buildup. In the preeruption period, we observe gradual extension centered on the lava lake, consistent with the opening of an axis-aligned dike. Using synthetic aperture radar intensity shadows, we show that the long-lived Erta 'Ale lava lake was stable in this period, indicative of a steady pressure state in the shallow plumbing system. During the initial eruption, we observe surface displacements consistent with a shallow dike intrusion below the eruption site and conduit contraction below the lava lake. The pressure change associated with the cointrusive drop in the lava lake level is sufficient to reproduce the deformation pattern suggesting that the lava lake is well connected to the shallow plumbing system. Subsidence and contraction during the long-lived eruption indicates the presence of an off-rift vertically extensive source. We suggest that this may represent a system of stacked sources throughout the upper crust, with melt being more distributed. We also propose that high magma flux on the slow-spreading Erta 'Ale segment may be facilitating the presence of shallow axial magma bodies.

TI  - Simulation of land use dynamics and impact on land surface temperature using satellite data
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing of global average surface temperature naturally leading to major problems as global warming, which has typically attracted the interest of multinational organizations, civil society groups and scientists in the world. The main aim of this research is to properly investigate the impact of urban development via land-use dynamics on the future micro-climate of Beijing by predicting land surface temperature (LST) distribution and simulating land-use dynamics. Land use/land cover (LULC) and LST were traditionally produced using multispectral and thermal bands. Land use dynamics were calculated using a statistical model. LST of each LULC was mapped to assess temporal changes of LST responding to LULC changes in the study area for 20 years over three periods (1997-2005, 2005-2017 and 1997-2017). Prediction of LST was employed using single and multiple linear regression models until 2027. The results show that the average LST increased from 22.06 to 35.85 degrees C, from 20.98 to 37.04 degrees C, and from 17.00 to 38.29 degrees C in 1997, 2005 and 2017, respectively. This can be explained by the population growth and change in LULC. In addition, the comprehensive index of land use degree showed significant changes in land use of the area caused by several human activities. The annual rate of the urban area showed a remarkable increase as a direct result of urban sprawl. Urbanization may impact negatively on vegetation, causing it to decrease progressively to 2017. Furthermore, the results of the prediction models show that the Urban Index and Modification of Normalized Difference Water Index are highly influential to the forecasting of LST. The study has also demonstrated that remote sensing and GIS techniques are useful tools for assessing spatial and temporal changes in LULC dynamic and its impacts on LST.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the recent emergence of several subtypes of influenza viruses with pandemic potentials, there has been growing interest on the control of this infection worldwide. This study aimed to describe the 10 years of influenza activity in Cameroon between January 2009 and December 2018. Respiratory samples were collected from sentinel sites responsible for influenza surveillance in Cameroon and analyzed for the presence of influenza. Globally, 9 of the 10 administrative regions of the country were represented with at least 1 year of data. A total of 11816 respiratory samples were collected and influenza virus detection rate was 24.0%. The most represented age group was the 0-1 years representing more than 40% of the collected samples and possessing the lowest proportion of influenza cases (16.2%). Meanwhile higher proportions of influenza positive cases was found in the 2-4, 5-14 and 15-49 years age group at.29%. Among outpatients, the frequency of influenza virus was 24.8% while in hospitalized patients, 18.7% of samples were positive for influenza virus. We noted year-round circulation of influenza virus in Cameroon with 2 peaks in activity: a major peak in the months of September to December and a minor peak in the months of March to July. Antigenic characterization of influenza isolates showed 37.5% (6/16) vaccine match between the predominant Cameroon strains and the Northern hemisphere vaccine strains with majority of vaccine match observed in influenza B/Victoria subtype (4/6; 66.7%). Data collected from this surveillance system is essential to add to global information on the spread of influenza.

TI  - Local Excision of a Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Anal Margin (Extramammary Paget's Disease) and Reconstruction with a Bilateral V-Y Flap
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The case of a 75-year-old female with invasive extramammary Paget's disease of the anal margin, without involvement of the anal canal, is reported. The patient underwent wide local excision of the lesion with reconstruction with a double V-Y flap, a biopsy of the inguinal sentinel node, and a laparoscopic temporary colostomy. No guidelines exist on the treatment of this rare disease, and both wide local excision and abdominoperineal resection have been proposed. In the present case, the absence of invasion of the anal canal, also confirmed by intraoperative biopsies on the resection margins, and of local lymph node metastasis, as confirmed by the sentinel lymph node biopsy, allowed a sphincter-sparing operation with good functional and oncological results.

TI  - Linking Earth Observations for Assessing the Food Security Situation in Vietnam: A Landscape Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change and its impact on food security is a topic that has major implications for development in population-dense Southeast Asia. The main drivers of forest loss include the expansion of agriculture and plantation estates, growth of urban centers, extraction of natural resources, and water infrastructure development. The design and implementation of appropriate land use policies requires accurate and timely information on land cover dynamics to account for potential political, economical, and agricultural consequences. Therefore, SERVIR-Mekong led the collaborative development of a Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS) with key regional stakeholders across the greater Mekong region. Through this effort, a modular system was used to create yearly land cover maps for the period 1988-2017. In this study, we compared this 30-year land cover time-series with Vietnam national forest resources and agricultural productivity statistics. We used remote sensing-derived land cover products to quantify landscape changes and linked those with food availability, one of food security dimension, from a landscape approach perspective. We found that agricultural production has soared while the coverage of agricultural areas has remained relatively stable. Land cover change dynamics coincide with important legislation regarding environmental management and sustainable development strategies in Vietnam. Our findings indicate that Vietnam has made major steps toward improving its' food security. We demonstrate that RLCMS is a valuable tool for evaluating the relationship between policies and their impacts on food security, ecosystem services and natural capital.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the feasibility of sentinel node biopsy in early-stage endometrial cancer and to analyse the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) using preoperative cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid. Thirty-five patients with preoperative histological diagnosis of endometrial cancer without any extrauterine involvement on imaging were included in the study. Sentinel node mapping was done by cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid on the evening before surgery. Scintigraphic images were taken using gamma camera. Intraoperatively, nodes showing radioactivity were detected using hand-held gamma probe, dissected out separately and labelled as sentinel lymph nodes. Detection rate was calculated and analysed with respect to various parameters. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is feasible in endometrial cancer using cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid. SLN detection was done in 33 (94.3%) out of 35 patients. Bilateral detection was feasible in 19 patients (54.3%) with detection in left and right hemipelvis being 74.3%. Detection rate of SLN was 93.7% in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Sentinel node was detected in all the patients with non-endometrioid histology. The SLNB using cervical injection of Tc99m nanocolloid is feasible in endometrial cancer. It is a safe and easily reproducible technique with good detection rate and high sensitivity. Stage of the tumour, grade and myometrial invasion do not seem to have an influence on sentinel node detection. Cervical involvement, enlarged lymph nodes and obstructed lymphatics can affect sentinel node mapping adversely.

TI  - Nearby Nature Buffers the Pain Catastrophizing-Pain Intensity Relation Among Urban Residents With Chronic Pain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pain catastrophizing is among the strongest predictors of pain intensity. This study examined the role of the nearby natural environment in the experience of pain among community-dwelling adults with chronic pain (n = 81) living in New York City and explored the notion that attention may underlie nature's effect. Nearby nature was objectively measured using satellite data. Daily diary data across 14 days was employed to operationalize pain catastrophizing (and subscales: rumination, helplessness, and magnification) and pain intensity. Results indicated that nearby nature buffered the relation between catastrophizing and pain intensity. Moreover, nearby nature moderated the association between pain-related rumination (the most attentionbased subscale of pain catastrophizing) and pain intensity, but did not moderate the helplessness-pain intensity or themagnification-pain intensity associations. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying nearby nature's moderating influence involves attention. Practitioners in search of strategies to reduce pain intensity experienced by community-dwelling chronic pain sufferers might look to a community resource: nearby nature.

TI  - The Assessment of Twitter's Potential for Outbreak Detection: Avian Influenza Case Study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media services such as Twitter are valuable sources of information for surveillance systems. A digital syndromic surveillance system has several advantages including its ability to overcome the problem of time delay in traditional surveillance systems. Despite the progress made with using digital syndromic surveillance systems, the possibility of tracking avian influenza (AI) using online sources has not been fully explored. In this study, a Twitter-based data analysis framework was developed to automatically monitor avian influenza outbreaks in a real-time manner. The framework was implemented to find worrisome posts and alerting news on Twitter, filter irrelevant ones, and detect the onset of outbreaks in several countries. The system collected and analyzed over 209,000 posts discussing avian influenza on Twitter from July 2017 to November 2018. We examined the potential of Twitter data to represent the date, severity and virus type of official reports. Furthermore, we investigated whether filtering irrelevant tweets can positively impact the performance of the system. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated using a real-world outbreak-reporting source. We found that 75% of real-world outbreak notifications of AI were identifiable from Twitter. This shows the capability of the system to serve as a complementary approach to official AI reporting methods. Moreover, we observed that one-third of outbreak notifications were reported on Twitter earlier than official reports. This feature could augment traditional surveillance systems and provide a possibility of early detection of outbreaks. This study could potentially provide a first stepping stone for building digital disease outbreak warning systems to assist epidemiologists and animal health professionals in making relevant decisions.

TI  - Isolation Forests to Evaluate Class Separability and the Representativeness of Training and Validation Areas in Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised land cover classification from remote sensing imagery is based on gathering a set of training areas to characterise each of the classes and to train a predictive model that is then used to predict land cover in the rest of the image. This procedure relies mainly on the assumptions of statistical separability of the classes and the representativeness of the training areas. This paper uses isolation forests, a type of random tree ensembles, to analyse both assumptions and to easily correct lack of representativeness by digitising new training areas where needed to improve the classification of a Landsat-8 set of images with Random Forest. The results show that the improved set of training areas after the isolation forest analysis is more representative of the whole image and increases classification accuracy. Besides, the distribution of isolation values can be useful to estimate class separability. A class separability parameter that summarises such distributions is proposed. This parameter is more correlated to omission and commission errors than other separability measures such as the Jeffries-Matusita distance.

TI  - Sub-Pixel Waterline Extraction: Characterising Accuracy and Sensitivity to Indices and Spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping the boundary between land and water (the 'waterline') is critical for tracking change in vulnerable coastal zones, and managing increasingly threatened water resources. Previous studies have largely relied on mapping waterlines at the pixel scale, or employed computationally intensive sub-pixel waterline extraction methods that are impractical to implement at scale. There is a pressing need for operational methods for extracting information from freely available medium resolution satellite imagery at spatial scales relevant to coastal and environmental management. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of a promising method for mapping waterlines at sub-pixel accuracy from satellite remote sensing data. By combining a synthetic landscape approach with high resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery, it was possible to rapidly assess the performance of the method across multiple coastal environments with contrasting spectral characteristics (sandy beaches, artificial shorelines, rocky shorelines, wetland vegetation and tidal mudflats), and under a range of water indices (Normalised Difference Water Index, Modified Normalised Difference Water Index, and the Automated Water Extraction Index) and thresholding approaches (optimal, zero and automated Otsu's method). The sub-pixel extraction method shows a strong ability to reproduce both absolute waterline positions and relative shape at a resolution that far exceeds that of traditional whole-pixel methods, particularly in environments without extreme contrast between the water and land (e.g., accuracies of up to 1.50-3.28 m at 30 m Landsat resolution using optimal water index thresholds). We discuss key challenges and limitations associated with selecting appropriate water indices and thresholds for sub-pixel waterline extraction, and suggest future directions for improving the accuracy and reliability of extracted waterlines. The sub-pixel waterline extraction method has a low computational overhead and is made available as an open-source tool, making it suitable for operational continental-scale or full time-depth analyses aimed at accurately mapping and monitoring dynamic waterlines through time and space.

TI  - Assessment of the Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral infrared atmospheric sounder (HIRAS), the first Chinese hyperspectral infrared instrument, was launched in 2017 on board the fourth polar orbiter of the Feng Yun 3 series, FY-3D. The instrument is a Fourier transform spectrometer with 2275 channels covering three spectral bands (650-1136, 1210-1750, and 2155-2550 cm(-1)) with 0.625 cm(-1) spectral resolution. The first data quality assessment of HIRAS observations at full and normal spectral resolutions is presented. Comparisons with short-range forecasts from the Met Office numerical weather prediction (NWP) global system have revealed biases (standard deviation) generally less than 2.6 K (2 K) in the spectral regions mostly unaffected by trace gases where the confidence in the NWP model is largest. Of particular concern, HIRAS detector 3 seems to suffer from sunlight contamination of its calibration towards the end of the descending node. This, together with an obstruction of the detector field of view by an element of the platform, results in accentuated bias and noise in the observations from this detector. At normal spectral resolution, a background departure double difference analysis has been conducted between HIRAS and the NOAA-20 crosstrack infrared sounder (CrIS). The results show that HIRAS and CrIS are in good agreement with a mean difference across the three bands of -0.05 K (+/- 0.26 K at 1 sigma) and 75.2% of the channels within CrIS radiometric uncertainty, noting though that HIRAS is noisier than CrIS with, on average, a standard deviation 0.34 K larger.

TI  - A Multiscale Productivity Assessment of High Andean Peatlands across the Chilean Altiplano Using 31 Years of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high Andean peatlands, locally known as "bofedales", are a unique type of wetland distributed across the high-elevation South American Altiplano plateau. This extensive peatland network stores significant amounts of carbon, regulates local and regional hydrological cycles, supports habitats for a variety of plant and animal species, and has provided critical water and forage resources for the livestock of the indigenous Aymara communities for thousands of years. Nevertheless, little is known about the productivity dynamics of the high Andean peatlands, particularly in the drier western Altiplano region bordering the Atacama desert. Here, we provide the first digital peatland inventory and multiscale productivity assessment for the entire western Altiplano (63,705 km(2)) using 31 years of Landsat data (about 9000 scenes) and a non-parametric approach for estimating phenological metrics. We identified 5665 peatland units, covering an area of 510 km(2), and evaluated the spatiotemporal productivity patterns at the regional, peatland polygon, and individual pixel scales. The regional assessment shows that the peatland areas and peatlands with higher productivity are concentrated towards the northern part of our study region, which is consistent with the Altiplano north-south aridity gradient. Regional patterns further reveal that the last seven years (2011-2017) have been the most productive period over the past three decades. While individual pixels show contrasting patterns of reductions and gains in local productivity during the most recent time period, most of the study area has experienced increases in annual productivity, supporting the regional results. Our novel database can be used not only to explore future research questions related to the social, biological, and hydrological influences on peatland productivity patterns, but also to provide technical support for the sustainable development of livestock practices and conservation and water management policy in the Altiplano region.

TI  - Mapping Spatial Variations of Structure and Function Parameters for Forest Condition Assessment of the Changbai Mountain National Nature Reserve
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest condition is the baseline information for ecological evaluation and management. The National Forest Inventory of China contains structural parameters, such as canopy closure, stand density and forest age, and functional parameters, such as stand volume and soil fertility. Conventionally forest conditions are assessed through parameters collected from field observations, which could be costly and spatially limited. It is crucial to develop modeling approaches in mapping forest assessment parameters from satellite remote sensing. This study mapped structure and function parameters for forest condition assessment in the Changbai Mountain National Nature Reserve (CMNNR). The mapping algorithms, including statistical regression, random forests, and random forest kriging, were employed with predictors from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 satellite sensors, digital surface model of ALOS, and 1803 field sampled forest plots. Combined predicted parameters and weights from principal component analysis, forest conditions were assessed. The models explained spatial dynamics and characteristics of forest parameters based on an independent validation with all r values above 0.75. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of canopy closure, stand density, stand volume, forest age and soil fertility were 4.6%, 33.8%, 29.4%, 20.5%, and 14.3%, respectively. The mean assessment score suggested that forest conditions in the CMNNR are mainly resulted from spatial variations of function parameters such as stand volume and soil fertility. This study provides a methodology on forest condition assessment at regional scales, as well as the up-to-date information for the forest ecosystem in the CMNNR.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Built-Up Areas from Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using Patch-Level Spatial Features and Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Grouping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of built-up areas from very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images has received increasing attention in recent years. However, due to the complexity of spectral and spatial characteristics of built-up areas, it is still a challenging task to obtain their precise location and extent. In this study, a patch-based framework was proposed for unsupervised extraction of built-up areas from VHR imagery. First, a group of corner-constrained overlapping patches were defined to locate the candidate built-up areas. Second, for each patch, its salient textures and structural characteristics were represented as a feature vector using integrated high-frequency wavelet coefficients. Then, inspired by visual perception, a patch-level saliency model of built-up areas was constructed by incorporating Gestalt laws of proximity and similarity, which can effectively describe the spatial relationships between patches. Finally, built-up areas were extracted through thresholding and their boundaries were refined by morphological operations. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on two VHR image datasets. The resulting average F-measure values were 0.8613 for the Google Earth dataset and 0.88 for the WorldView-2 dataset, respectively. Compared with existing models, the proposed method obtains better extraction results, which show more precise boundaries and preserve better shape integrity.

TI  - NO<sub>2</sub> Retrieval from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI): Preliminary Results and Intercomparison with OMI and TROPOMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Onboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF5) satellite, the Environmental trace gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is a nadir-viewing wide-field spectrometer that was launched on May 9, 2018. EMI measures the back-scattered earthshine solar radiance in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range. By using the differential optical absorption spectrometry (DOAS) method and the EMI measurements in the VIS1 band (405-465 nm), we performed retrievals of NO2. Some first retrieval results of NO2 from EMI and a comparison with OMI and TROPOMI products are presented in this paper. The monthly mean total vertical column densities (VCD) of NO2 show similar spatial distributions to OMI and TROPOMI (r > 0.88) and their difference is less than 27%. A comparison of the daily total VCD shows that EMI could detect the NO2 patterns in good agreement with OMI (r = 0.93) and TROPOMI (r = 0.95). However, the slant column density (SCD) uncertainty (0.79 x 10(15) molec cm(-2)) of the current EMI algorithm is relatively larger than OMI. The daily variation pattern of NO2 from EMI in Beijing in January 2019 is consistent with TROPOMI (r = 0.96). The spatial distribution correlation of the tropospheric NO2 VCD of EMI with OMI and TROPOMI is 0.88 and 0.89, respectively, but shows an overestimate compared to OMI (15%) and TROPOMI (23%), respectively. This study demonstrates the capability of using EMI for global NO2 monitoring.

TI  - Mapping and Tracking Forest Burnt Areas in the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve Using Sentinel-3 SLSTR and VIIRS-DNB Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are considered one of the most major hazards and environmental issues worldwide. Recently, Earth observation satellite (EOS) sensors have proven to be effective for wildfire detection, although the quality and usefulness of the data are often hindered by cloud presence. One practical workaround is to combine datasets from multiple sensors. This research presents a methodology that utilizes data of the recently-launched Sentinel-3 sea and land surface temperature radiometer (S3-SLSTR) to reflect its applicability for detecting wildfires. In addition, visible infrared imaging radiometer suite day night band (VIIRS-DNB) imagery was introduced to assure day-night tracking capabilities. The wildfire event in the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, Nicaragua, during 3-13 April 2018, was the study case. Six S3-SLSTR images were processed to compute spectral indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the normalized burn ratio (NBR), to perform image segmentation for estimating the burnt area. The results indicate that 5870.7 ha of forest was affected during the wildfire, close to the 5945 ha reported by local authorities. In this study, the fire expansion was delineated and tracked in the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve using a modified fast marching method on nighttime-sensed temporal VIIRS-DNB. This study shows the importance of S3-SLSRT for wildfire monitoring and how it can be complemented with VIIRS-DNB to track burning biomass at daytime and nighttime.

T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological structures precondition hillslope stability as well as the processes and landslide mechanisms which develop in response to deglaciation. In areas experiencing glacier retreat and debuttressing, identifying landslide preconditions is fundamental for anticipating landslide development. Herein, the 150 M m(3) Mueller Rockslide in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand, is described; and we document how preconditions have controlled its morphology and development in response to thinning of the adjacent Mueller Glacier. A combination of geomorphological and geotechnical mapping-based on field, geophysical and remote sensing data-was used to characterise the rock mass and morphology of the rockslide and surrounding hillslope. Mueller Rockslide is identified as a rock compound slide, undergoing dominantly translational failure on a dip slope. The crown of the rockslide is bounded by several discontinuous, stepped scarps whose orientation is controlled by joint sets; these scarps form a zone of toppling that is delivering rock debris to the main rockslide body. Surface and subsurface discontinuity mapping above the crown identified numerous joints, fractures and several scarps that may facilitate continued retrogressive enlargement of the ro kslide. The presence of lateral release structures, debuttressing of the rockslide toe and steeply dipping bedding suggest that the rockslide may be capable of evolving to a rapid failure.

TI  - A Probability-Based Spectral Unmixing Analysis for Mapping Percentage Vegetation Cover of Arid and Semi-Arid Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has been facing serious land degradation and desertification in its north and northwest arid and semi-arid areas. Monitoring the dynamics of percentage vegetation cover (PVC) using remote sensing imagery in these areas has become critical. However, because these areas are large, remote, and sparsely populated, and also because of the existence of mixed pixels, there have been no accurate and cost-effective methods available for this purpose. Spectral unmixing methods are a good alternative as they do not need field data and are low cost. However, traditional linear spectral unmixing (LSU) methods lack the ability to capture the characteristics of spectral reflectance and scattering from endmembers and their interactions within mixed pixels. Moreover, existing nonlinear spectral unmixing methods, such as random forest (RF) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), are often costly because they require field measurements of PVC from a large number of training samples. In this study, a cost-effective approach to mapping PVC in arid and semi-arid areas was proposed. A method for selection and purification of endmembers mainly based on Landsat imagery was first presented. A probability-based spectral unmixing analysis (PBSUA) and a probability-based optimized k nearest-neighbors (PBOkNN) approach were then developed to improve the mapping of PVC in Duolun County in Inner Mongolia, China, using Landsat 8 images and field data from 920 sample plots. The proposed PBSUA and PBOkNN methods were further validated in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness by comparison with two LSU methods, with and without purification of endmembers, and two nonlinear approaches, RF and RBFNN. The cost-effectiveness was defined as the reciprocal of cost timing relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The results showed that (1) Probability-based spectral unmixing analysis (PBSUA) was most cost-effective and increased the cost-effectiveness by 29.3% 29.3%, 33.5%, 50.8%, and 53.0% compared with two LSU methods, PBOkNN, RF, and RBFNN, respectively; (2) PBSUA, RF, and RBFNN gave RRMSE values of 22.9%, 21.8%, and 22.8%, respectively, which were not significantly different from each other at the significance level of 0.05. Compatibly, PBOkNN and LSU methods with and without purification of endmembers resulted in significantly greater RRMSE values of 27.5%, 32.4%, and 43.3%, respectively; (3) the average estimates of the sample plots and predicted maps from PBSUA, PBOkNN, RF, and RBFNN fell in the confidence interval of the test plot data, but those from two LSU methods did not, although the LSU with purification of endmembers improved the PVC estimation accuracy by 25.2% compared with the LSU without purification of endmembers. Thus, this study indicated that the proposed PBSUA had great potential for cost-effectively mapping PVC in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Ship Identification and Characterization in Sentinel-1 SAR Images with Multi-Task Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and surveillance of maritime activities are critical issues in both military and civilian fields, including among others fisheries' monitoring, maritime traffic surveillance, coastal and at-sea safety operations, and tactical situations. In operational contexts, ship detection and identification is traditionally performed by a human observer who identifies all kinds of ships from a visual analysis of remotely sensed images. Such a task is very time consuming and cannot be conducted at a very large scale, while Sentinel-1 SAR data now provide a regular and worldwide coverage. Meanwhile, with the emergence of GPUs, deep learning methods are now established as state-of-the-art solutions for computer vision, replacing human intervention in many contexts. They have been shown to be adapted for ship detection, most often with very high resolution SAR or optical imagery. In this paper, we go one step further and investigate a deep neural network for the joint classification and characterization of ships from SAR Sentinel-1 data. We benefit from the synergies between AIS (Automatic Identification System) and Sentinel-1 data to build significant training datasets. We design a multi-task neural network architecture composed of one joint convolutional network connected to three task specific networks, namely for ship detection, classification, and length estimation. The experimental assessment shows that our network provides promising results, with accurate classification and length performance (classification overall accuracy: 97.25%, mean length error: 4.65 m +/- 8.55 m).

TI  - Polarimetric SAR Time-Series for Identification of Winter Land Use
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have provided information that contributed significantly to cropland monitoring. However, the specific configurations of SAR sensors (e.g., band frequency, polarization mode) used to identify land-use types remains underexplored. This study investigates the contribution of C/L-Band frequency, dual/quad polarization and the density of image time-series to winter land-use identification in an agricultural area of approximately 130 km(2) located in northwestern France. First, SAR parameters were derived from RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) time-series, and one quad-pol and six dual-pol datasets with different spatial resolutions and densities were calculated. Then, land use was classified using the Random Forest algorithm with each of these seven SAR datasets to determine the most suitable SAR configuration for identifying winter land-use. Results highlighted that (i) the C-Band (F1-score 0.70) outperformed the L-Band (F1-score 0.57), (ii) quad polarization (F1-score 0.69) outperformed dual polarization (F1-score 0.59) and (iii) a dense Sentinel-1 time-series (F1-score 0.70) outperformed RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-2 time-series (F1-score 0.69 and 0.29, respectively). In addition, Shannon Entropy and SPAN were the SAR parameters most important for discriminating winter land-use. Thus, the results of this study emphasize the interest of using Sentinel-1 time-series data for identifying winter land-use.

TI  - Estimating Grassland Carbon Stocks in Hulunber China, Using Landsat8 Oli Imagery and Regression Kriging
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating grassland carbon stocks is important in assessing grassland productivity and the global carbon balance. This study used the regression kriging (RK) method to estimate grassland carbon stocks in Northeast China based on Landsat8 operational land imager (OLI) images and five remote sensing variables. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the chlorophyll index (CI), Band6 and Band7 were used to build the RK models separately and to explore their capabilities for modeling spatial distributions of grassland carbon stocks. To explore the different model performances for typical grassland and meadow grassland, the models were validated separately using the typical steppe, meadow steppe or all-steppe ground measurements based on leave-one-out crossvalidation (LOOCV). When the results were validated against typical steppe samples, the Band6 model showed the best performance (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.46, mean average error (MAE) = 8.47%, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 10.34 gC/m(2)) via the linear regression (LR) method, while for the RK method, the NDVI model showed the best performance (R-2 = 0.63, MAE = 7.04 gC/m(2), and RMSE = 8.51 gC/m(2)), which were much higher than the values of the best LR model. When the results were validated against the meadow steppe samples, the CI model achieved the best estimation accuracy, and the accuracy of the RK method (R-2 = 0.72, MAE = 8.09 gC/m(2), and RMSE = 9.89 gC/m(2)) was higher than that of the LR method (R-2 = 0.70, MAE = 8.99 gC/m(2), and RMSE = 10.69 gC/m(2)). Upon combining the results of the most accurate models of the typical steppe and meadow steppe, the RK method reaches the highest model accuracy of R-2 = 0.69, MAE = 7.40 gC/m(2), and RMSE = 9.01 gC/m(2), while the LR method reaches the highest model accuracy of R-2 = 0.53, MAE = 9.20 gC/m(2), and RMSE = 11.10 gC/m(2). The results showed an improved performance of the RK method compared to the LR method, and the improvement in the accuracy of the model is mainly attributed to the enhancement of the estimation accuracy of the typical steppe. In the study region, the carbon stocks showed an increasing trend from west to east, the total amount of grassland carbon stock was 79.77 x 10(4) Mg C, and the mean carbon stock density was 47.44 gC/m(2). The density decreased in the order of temperate meadow steppe, lowland meadow steppe, temperate typical steppe, and sandy steppe. The methodology proposed in this study is particularly beneficial for carbon stock estimates at the regional scale, especially for countries such as China with many grassland types.

TI  - Monitoring Mining Disturbance and Restoration over RBM Site in South Africa Using LandTrendr Algorithm and Landsat Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the negative impact of mining on ecosystems in mining areas, the South African government legislated the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (No. 28 of 2002), to compel mining companies to restore the land affected by mining. Several studies have used remotely sensed data to observe the status and dynamics of surface mines. Advances in remote sensing along the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) now promise an enhanced observation strategy for improved monitoring of mine environments. Despite these advances, land rehabilitation at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) is mainly restricted to field-based approaches which are unable to reveal seamless patterns of disturbance and restoration. Here, we illustrate the value of the trajectory-based LandTrendr algorithm in conjunction with GEE for mine rehabilitation studies. Our automated method produced disturbance and recovery patterns (1984-2018) over the RBM site. The study revealed that RBM has progressively been mining different portions of the mineral-rich coastal area after which restoration was undertaken. The duration of mining over each site ranged from 2 to 6 years. The LandTrendr outputs correspond with independent reference datasets that were classified with an overall accuracy of 99%; it captures mine-induced disturbance efficiently and offers a practical tool for mine restoration management.

TI  - Quantifying Drought Sensitivity of Mediterranean Climate Vegetation to Recent Warming: A Case Study in Southern California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of drought and high temperatures ("global-change-type drought") is projected to become increasingly common in Mediterranean climate regions. Recently, Southern California has experienced record-breaking high temperatures coupled with significant precipitation deficits, which provides opportunities to investigate the impacts of high temperatures on the drought sensitivity of Mediterranean climate vegetation. Responses of different vegetation types to drought are quantified using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the period 2000-2017. The contrasting responses of the vegetation types to drought are captured by the correlation and regression coefficients between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomalies and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). A novel bootstrapping regression approach is used to decompose the relationships between the vegetation sensitivity (NDVI-PDSI regression slopes) and the principle climate factors (temperature and precipitation) associated with the drought. Significantly increased sensitivity to drought in warmer locations indicates the important role of temperature in exacerbating vulnerability; however, spatial precipitation variations do not demonstrate significant effects in modulating drought sensitivity. Based on annual NDVI response, chaparral is the most vulnerable community to warming, which will probably be severely affected by hotter droughts in the future. Drought sensitivity of coastal sage scrub (CSS) is also shown to be very responsive to warming in fall and winter. Grassland and developed land will likely be less affected by this warming. The sensitivity of the overall vegetation to temperature increases is particularly concerning, as it is the variable that has had the strongest secular trend in recent decades, which is expected to continue or strengthen in the future. Increased temperatures will probably alter vegetation distribution, as well as possibly increase annual grassland cover, and decrease the extent and ecological services provided by perennial woody Mediterranean climate ecosystems as well.

TI  - Discovering Potential Settlement Areas around Archaeological Tells Using the Integration between Historic Topographic Maps, Optical, and Radar Data in the Northern Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this study is to leverage the integration of surface mapping data derived from optical, radar, and historic topographical studies with archaeological sampling to identify ancient settlement areas in the Northern Nile Delta, Egypt. This study employed the following methods: digitization of topographic maps, band indices techniques on optical data, the creation of a 3D model from SRTM data, and Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath (IW) analysis. This type of study is particularly relevant to the search for evidence of otherwise hidden ancient settlements. Due to its geographical situation and the fertility of the Nile, Egypt witnessed the autochthonous development of predynastic and dynastic civilizations, as well as an extensive history of external influences due to Greek, Roman, Coptic, Islamic, and Colonial-era interventions. Excavation work at Buto (Tell el-Fara'in) in 2017-18, carried out by the Kafrelsheikh University (KFS) in cooperation with the Ministry of Antiquities, demonstrated that remote sensing data offers considerable promise as a tool for developing regional settlement studies and excavation strategies. This study integrates the mission work in Buto with the satellite imagery in and around the area of the excavation. The results of the initial Buto area research serve as a methodological model to expand the study area to the North Delta with the goal of detecting the extent of the ancient kingdoms of Buto and Sakha. The results of this research include the creation of a composite historical database using ancient references and early topographical maps (1722, 1941, 1950, and 1997), Optical Corona (1965), Landsat MSS (Multispectral Scanner System) (1973, 1978, and 1988), TM (Thematic Mapper) (2005) data, and Radar SRTM (2014) and Sentinel1 (2018 and 2019) data. The data in this study have been analyzed using the ArcMap, Envi, and SNAP software. The results from the current investigation highlight the rapid changes in the land use/land cover in the last century in which many ancient sites were lost due to agriculture and urban development. Three potential settlement areas have been identified with the Sentinel1 Radar data, and have been integrated with the early maps. These discoveries will help develop excavation strategies aimed at elucidating the ancient settlement dynamics and history of the region during the next phase of research.

TI  - Sensitivity of Bistatic TanDEM-X Data to Stand Structural Parameters in Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data provide a valuable means for the large-scale and long-term monitoring of structural components of forest stands. The potential of TanDEM-X interferometric SAR (InSAR) for the assessment of forest structural properties has been widely verified. However, present studies are mostly restricted to homogeneous forests and do not account for stratification in assessing model performance. A systematic sensitivity analysis of the TanDEM-X SAR signal to forest structural parameters was carried out with emphasis on different strata of forest stands (location of the study site, forest type, and development stage). Forest structure was parameterized by forest height metrics and stem volume. Results show that X-band volume coherence is highly sensitive to the forest canopy. Volume scattering within the canopy is dependent on the vertical heterogeneity of the forest stand. In general, TanDEM-X coherence is more sensitive to forest vertical structure compared to backscatter. The relations between TanDEM-X volume coherence and forest structural properties were significant at the level of a single test site as well as across sites in temperate forests in Germany. Forest type does not affect the overall relationship between the SAR signal and the forests' vertical structure. The prediction of forest structural parameters based on the outcome of the sensitivity analysis yielded model accuracies between 15% (relative root mean square error) for Lorey's height and 32% for stem volume. The global database of single-polarized bistatic TanDEM-X data provides an important source for mapping structural parameters in temperate forests at large scale, irrespective of forest type.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variability in Libya-4 with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data for Optimized Ground Target Location
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) have been widely used by the remote sensing community in recent decades for post-launch absolute calibration, cross-calibration, and the monitoring of radiometric stability. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has established several official PICS for these purposes. Of these, Libya-4 is the most commonly used, due to its high uniformity and stability. The site was chosen as a large-area site for medium resolution sensors, and with high-resolution sensors now common, smaller sites are being identified. This work has identified an improved area of interest (AOI) within Libya-4 by using combined Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data. The Optimized Ground Target (OGT) was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation along with the use of a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm combined with the Basin-Hopping global optimization technique to constrain a search area small enough to perform a final brute-force refinement. The Coefficient of Variation CV of the proposed OGT is significantly lower than that in the original CEOS area, with differences between the CV of both zones in the order of 1% in the visible near-infrared (VNIR) bands. This new AOI has the potential to improve the cross-calibration between high-resolution sensors using the PICS methodology through an OGT with more homogeneous and stable characteristics.

TI  - Analysis of the Drought Mitigated Mechanism in Terraced Paddy Fields Using CWSI and TVDI Indices and Hydrological Monitoring
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security is often threatened by droughts during rice production. Although most of the rice is produced in lowland or irrigated "wet" rice fields, terraced paddy fields are important in the rice production system in island or mountainous countries. With the intensifying frequency of El Nino periods in recent decades, there has been a risk of droughts in terraced paddy areas. To mitigate drought, remote sensing data analysis could be an efficient and reliable tool for obtaining scarce ground monitoring data. In this study, crop water stress index (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) were applied to evaluate the drought intensity, and hydrological monitoring data was provided as a support for the evaluation. The results indicated that droughts normally occurred during the dry season, and intensified during El Nino periods. CWSI and TVDI were visible to predict drought occurrences in the watershed area. TVDI overestimated the drought inside Keduang watershed compared to CWSI because of the complex condition of the terraced paddy area, including the hydrology in this area. The complex topography, high groundwater table, and continuous plot-to-plot irrigation helped to maintain the water availability and mitigated the drought impact for rice production in the studied terraced paddy field.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Heat Fluxes Based on Landsat 7 ETM+ Data and Field Measurements over the Northern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface heat fluxes consist of the net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. The estimation of these fluxes is essential to the study of energy transfer in land-atmosphere systems. In this paper, Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-on data were applied to estimate the land surface heat fluxes on the northern Tibetan Plateau using the SEBS (surface energy balance system) model, in combination with the calculation of field measurements at CAMP/Tibet (Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Asia-Australia Monsoon Project on the Tibetan Plateau) automatic weather stations based on the combinatory method (CM) for comparison. The root mean square errors between the satellite estimations and the CM calculations for the net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux were 49.2 W/m(2), 46.3 W/m(2), 68.2 W/m(2), and 54.9 W/m(2), respectively. The results reveal that land surface heat fluxes all present significant seasonal variability. Apart from the sensible heat flux, the satellite-estimated net radiation flux, soil heat flux, and latent heat flux exhibited a trend of summer > spring > autumn > winter. In summer, spring, autumn, and winter, respectively, the median values of the net radiation flux (631.8 W/m(2), 583.0 W/m(2), 404.4 W/m(2), 314.3 W/m(2)), soil heat flux (40.9 W/m(2), 37.9 W/m(2), 26.1 W/m(2), 20.5 W/m(2)), sensible heat flux (252.7 W/m(2), 219.5 W/m(2), 221.4 W/m(2), 204.8 W/m(2)), and latent heat flux (320.1 W/m(2), 298.3 W/m(2), 142.3 W/m(2), 75.5 W/m(2)) exhibited distinct seasonal diversity. From November to April, the in situ sensible heat flux is higher than the latent heat flux; the opposite is true between June and September, leaving May and October as transitional months. For water bodies, alpine meadows and other main underlying surface types, sensible and latent heat flux generally present contrasting and complementary spatial distributions. Due to the 15-60 m resolution of the Landsat 7 ETM+ data, the distribution of land surface heat fluxes can be used as an indicator of complex underlying surface types over the northern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Can We Use the QA4ECV Black-sky Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) using AVHRR Surface Reflectance to Assess Terrestrial Global Change?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NOAA platforms provide the longest period of terrestrial observation since the 1980s. The progress in calibration, atmospheric corrections and physically based land retrieval offers the opportunity to reprocess these data for extending terrestrial product time series. Within the Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project, the black-sky Joint Research Centre (JRC)-fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) algorithm was developed for the AVHRR sensors on-board NOAA-07 to -16 using the Land Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The retrieval algorithm was based on the radiative transfer theory, and uncertainties were included in the products. We proposed a time and spatial composite for providing both 10-day and monthly products at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. Quality control and validation were achieved through benchmarking against third-party products, including Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) datasets produced with the same retrieval algorithm. Past ground-based measurements, providing a proxy of FAPAR, showed good agreement of seasonality values over short homogeneous canopies and mixed vegetation. The average difference between SeaWiFS and QA4ECV monthly products over 2002-2005 is about 0.075 with a standard deviation of 0.091. We proposed a monthly linear bias correction that reduced these statistics to 0.02 and 0.001. The complete harmonized long-term time series was then used to address its fitness for the purpose of analysis of global terrestrial change.

TI  - Snow Depth Retrieval in Farmland Based on a Statistical Lookup Table from Passive Microwave Data in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, passive microwave remote sensing is the most efficient method to estimate snow depth (SD) at global and regional scales. Farmland covers 46% of Northeast China and accurate SD retrieval throughout the whole snow season has great significance for the agriculture management field. Based on the results of the statistical analysis of snow properties in Northeast China from December 2017 to January 2018, conducted by the China snow investigation project, snow characteristics such as snow grain size (SGS), snow density, snow thickness, and temperature of the layered snowpack were measured and analyzed in detail. These characteristics were input to the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) to simulate the brightness temperature (TB) time series of snow-covered farmland in the periods of snow accumulation, stabilization, and ablation. Considering the larger SGS of the thick depth hoar layer that resulted in a rapid decrease of simulated TBs, effective SGS was proposed to minimize the simulation errors and ensure that the MEMLS can be correctly applied to satellite data simulation. Statistical lookup tables (LUTs) for MWRI and AMSR2 data were generated to represent the relationship between SD and the brightness temperature difference (TBD) at 18 and 36 GHz. The SD retrieval results based on the LUT were compared with the actual SD and the SD retrieved by Chang's algorithm, Foster's algorithm, the standard MWRI algorithm, and the standard AMSR2 algorithm. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm based on the statistical LUT achieved better accuracy than the other algorithms due to its incorporation of the variation in snow characteristics with the age of snow cover. The average root mean squared error of the SD for the whole snow season was approximately 3.97 and 4.22 cm for MWRI and AMSR2, respectively. The research results are beneficial for monitoring SD in the farmland of Northeast China.

TI  - An Object-Based Strategy for Improving the Accuracy of Spatiotemporal Satellite Imagery Fusion for Vegetation-Mapping Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion is a key technique for generating unified time-series images from various satellite platforms to support the mapping and monitoring of vegetation. However, the high similarity in the reflectance spectrum of different vegetation types brings an enormous challenge in the similar pixel selection procedure of spatiotemporal data fusion, which may lead to considerable uncertainties in the fusion. Here, we propose an object-based spatiotemporal data-fusion framework to replace the original similar pixel selection procedure with an object-restricted method to address this issue. The proposed framework can be applied to any spatiotemporal data-fusion algorithm based on similar pixels. In this study, we modified the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data-fusion model (FSDAF) using the proposed framework, and evaluated their performances in fusing Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, Landsat 8 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, and Sentinel 2 and MODIS images in a study site covered by grasslands, croplands, coniferous forests, and broadleaf forests. The results show that the proposed object-based framework can improve all three data-fusion algorithms significantly by delineating vegetation boundaries more clearly, and the improvements on FSDAF is the greatest among all three algorithms, which has an average decrease of 2.8% in relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) in all sensor combinations. Moreover, the improvement on fusing Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images is more significant (an average decrease of 2.5% in rRMSE). By using the fused images generated from the proposed object-based framework, we can improve the vegetation mapping result by significantly reducing the "pepper-salt" effect. We believe that the proposed object-based framework has great potential to be used in generating time-series high-resolution remote-sensing data for vegetation mapping applications.

TI  - Multi-Temporal and Multi-Frequency SAR Analysis for Forest Land Cover Mapping of the Mai-Ndombe District (Democratic Republic of Congo)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's (ESA) "SAR for REDD" project aims to support complementing optical remote sensing capacities in Africa with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). The aim of this study is to assess and compare Sentinel-1 C-band, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and combined C/L-band SAR-based land cover mapping over a large tropical area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The overall approach is to benefit from multi-temporal observations acquired from 2015 to 2017 to extract statistical parameters and seasonality of backscatters to improve forest land cover (FLC) classification. We investigate whether and to what extent the denser time series of C- band SAR can compensate for the L-band's deeper vegetation penetration depth and known better FLC mapping performance. The supervised classification differentiates into forest, inundated forest, woody savannah, dry and wet grassland, and river swamps. Several feature combinations of statistical parameters from both, single and multi-frequency observations in a multivariate maximum-likelihood classification are compared. The FLC maps are reclassified into forest, savannah, and grassland (FSG) and validated with a systematic sampling grid of manual interpretations of very-high-resolution optical satellite data. Using the temporal variability of the dual-polarized backscatters, in the form of either wet/dry seasonal averages or using the statistical variance, in addition to the average backscatter, increased the classification accuracies by 4-5 percent points and 1-2 percent points for C- and L-band, respectively. For the FSG validation overall accuracies of 84.4%, 89.1%, and 90.0% were achieved for single frequency C- and L-band, and C/L-band combined, respectively. The resulting forest/non-forest (FNF) maps with accuracies of 90.3%, 92.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, are then compared to the Landsat-based Global Forest Change program's and JAXA's ALOS-1/2 based global FNF maps.

TI  - Verification of two machine learning approaches for cloud masking based on reflectance of channel IR3.9 using Meteosat Second Generation over Middle East maritime
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most cold channels of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites can distinguish between the sea and ice cloud tops, except for the IR3.9 channel because of the close reflectance and radiance values of the IR3.9 channel for maritime, low-level cloud and ice cloud tops. In this article, we introduce and evaluate two machine learning methods for cloud masking of Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) images in the day and night that use the reflectance value of the IR3.9 channel. We reached a good correlation by comparing the results of the modelled cloud masking of Meteosat satellite images with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CLM (Cloud Mask product of EUMETSAT) images in a way that the coefficient of determination (R-2) value was 92.34%, 89.91% and 83.69%, 78.23% in the cold season and 90.17%, 87.09% and 80.37%, 76.48% in the warm season, respectively, using the CHAID (chi-squared automatic interaction detection) decision tree and RBF (radial basis function) neural network approaches.

TI  - Quantifying Degradation Classifications on Alpine Grassland in the Lhasa River Basin, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has the world's largest alpine grassland ecosystem. The QTP ecosystem is extremely fragile and suffers continuous degradation. An accurate determination of the status of alpine grassland is the first crucial step in monitoring its degradation. A novel method combining field survey with remote sensing information based on ecological indicators is proposed. The degradation classification of alpine grassland was identified by multivariate hierarchical analysis based on 270 field plots. The spatial pattern of alpine grassland degradation was mapped by determining remote sensing variables that corresponded to field indicators of the degradation classification system. The results showed that clustering analysis divided the degradation classification of alpine grassland into five classes: Non-Degraded (ND), Slightly Degraded (SLD), Moderately Degraded (MD), Severely Degraded (SD), and Extremely Degraded (ED). The most significant factors for alpine grassland degradation included the dominance of Cyperaceae plants, soil total nitrogen content, soil organic carbon content, soil total carbon content, soil bulk density, soil pH, dominance of miscellaneous plants, and elevation among all 17 variables. The assessment and mapping of alpine grassland degradation provide an important basis for alpine grassland protection and management, particularly at a large scale.

TI  - A Weighted SVM-Based Approach to Tree Species Classification at Individual Tree Crown Level Using LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species classification at individual tree crowns (ITCs) level, using remote-sensing data, requires the availability of a sufficient number of reliable reference samples (i.e., training samples) to be used in the learning phase of the classifier. The classification performance of the tree species is mainly affected by two main issues: (i) an imbalanced distribution of the tree species classes, and (ii) the presence of unreliable samples due to field collection errors, coordinate misalignments, and ITCs delineation errors. To address these problems, in this paper, we present a weighted Support Vector Machine (wSVM)-based approach for the detection of tree species at ITC level. The proposed approach initially extracts (i) different weights associated to different classes of tree species, to mitigate the effect of the imbalanced distribution of the classes; and (ii) different weights associated to different training samples according to their importance for the classification problem, to reduce the effect of unreliable samples. Then, in order to exploit different weights in the learning phase of the classifier a wSVM algorithm is used. The features to characterize the tree species at ITC level are extracted from both the elevation and intensity of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Experimental results obtained on two study areas located in the Italian Alps show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Analysis of Grassland Degradation in Zona da Mata, MG, Brazil, Based on NDVI Time Series Data with the Integration of Phenological Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently a lot of interest in determining the state of Brazilian grasslands. Governmental actions and programs have recently been implemented for grassland recovery in Brazilian states, with the aim of improving production systems and socioeconomic indicators. The aim of this study is to evaluate the vegetative growth, temporal vigor, and long-term scenarios for the grasslands in Zona da Mata, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, by integrating phenological metrics. We used metrics derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, which were analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS), using multicriteria analysis, the analytical hierarchy process, and a simplified expert system (ESS). These temporal metrics, i.e., the growth index (GI) for 16-day periods during the growing season; the slope; and the maximum, minimum, and mean for the time series, were integrated to investigate the grassland vegetation conditions and degradation level. The temporal vegetative vigor was successfully described using the rescaled range (R/S statistic) and the Hurst exponent, which, together with the metrics estimated for the full time series, imagery, and field observations, indicated areas undergoing degradation or areas that were inadequately managed (approximately 61.5%). Time series analysis revealed that most grasslands showed low or moderate vegetative vigor over time with long-term persistence due to farming practices associated with burning and overgrazing. A small part of the grasslands showed high and sustainable plant densities (approximately 8.5%). A map legend for grassland management guidelines was developed using the proposed method with remote sensing data, which were applied using GIS software and a field campaign.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Ecosystem Service Value Determined by Land-Use Changes in the Urbanization of Anhui Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization-induced land-use change will lead to variations in the demand and supply of ecosystem services, thus significantly affecting regional ecosystem services. The continuous degradation of ecosystem functions has become a serious problem for humanity to solve. Therefore, quantitative analysis of the corresponding impact of land-use change on ecosystem service value (ESV) is important to socio-economic development and ecological protection. The Anhui province in China has experienced rapid urbanization in recent years, and ecological environmental remediation and protection have become important goals for regional development. In this paper, the province of Anhui has been selected as a case of study, we analyzed the land-use change using Landsat images from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We then adjusted the equivalent factor of ESV per unit area and estimated the ESV of Anhui province from 2000 to 2015 to analyze the impact of land-use change on ESV. Our results show that (1) paddy field is the main land-use type in Anhui province, the built-up land area has continuously increased, and the water area has continuously decreased; (2) the total ESV of Anhui province decreased from 30,015.58 x 10(7) CNY in 2000 to 29,683.74 x 10(7) CNY in 2015 (the rate of change was -1.11%), and regulating services make the greatest contribution to ESV; and (3) land-use change has led to severe ESV variations, especially for the expansion of water area and built-up land. Our study results provide useful insights for the development of land-use management and environmental protection policies in Anhui province.

TI  - The Possible Responses of Polar Ozone to Solar Proton Events in March 2012 by FengYun-3 Satellite Observations
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we use observations by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Sounder and Space Environment Monitor on FengYun-3 to analyze the polar ozone depletion during the solar proton events (SPEs), which occurred in early March 2012. The ozone distributions changed evidently with the increasing energetic proton flux (the particle energy is over 100 MeV) at the approximate altitude of 30 km. From the ozone profile relative changes, the short-term impacts of SPEs can be distinguished from the long-term effects of ozone season variations after the SPEs take place and cause about 4-17% of the short-term polar ozone decreases at the different levels in the upper stratosphere of both hemispheres. In the upper stratosphere, the SPE-related polar ozone depletion is more significant and continuous in the Northern Hemisphere but shows the short-term effects in the Southern Hemisphere during the March SPEs. The ozone depletion responses to the first SPE on 7 March are more pronounced in this altitude region than the second one on 13 March in both hemispheres due to the "harder" particle energy spectrum.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The six largest Arctic rivers (Yenisey, Lena, Ob', Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie) drain the organic-rich Arctic watersheds and serve as important pools in the global carbon cycle. Satellite remote sensing data are considered to be a necessary supplement to the ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter circulation, especially for the ice-free periods in high-latitudes. In this study, we propose a remote sensing retrieval algorithm to obtain the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) levels of the six largest Arctic rivers using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2018. These CDOM results are converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations using the strong relationship (R-2 = 0.89) between the field measurements of these two water constituents. The temporal-spatial distributions of the DOC in the six largest Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions are depicted. The performance of the retrieval algorithm verifies the capacity of using Sentinel-2 data to monitor riverine DOC variations due to its improved spatial resolution, better band placement, and increased observation frequency. River discharge, watershed slopes, human activities, and land use/land cover change drove much of the variation in the satellite-derived DOC. The seasonality, geography, and scale would affect the correlation between DOC concentration and these influence factors. Our results could improve the ability to monitor DOC fluxes in Arctic rivers and advance our understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle.

TI  - Mapping Grassland Frequency Using Decadal MODIS 250 m Time-Series: Towards a National Inventory of Semi-Natural Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are perennial ecosystems and an important part of agricultural landscapes that are threatened by urbanization and agricultural intensification. However, implementing national grassland conservation policies remains challenging because their inventory, based on short-term observation, rarely discriminate semi-natural permanent from temporary grasslands. This study aims to map grassland frequency at a national scale over a long period using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m satellite time-series. A three-step method was applied to the entire area of metropolitan France (543,940 km(2)). First, land-use and land-cover maps-including grasslands-were produced for each year from 2006-2017 using the random forest classification of MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products, which were calibrated and validated using field observations. Second, grassland frequency from 2006-2017 was calculated by combining the 12 annual maps. Third, sub-pixel analysis was performed using a reference layer with 20 m spatial resolution to quantify percentages of land-use and land-cover classes within MODIS pixels classified as grassland. Results indicate that grasslands were accurately modeled from 2006-2017 (F1-score 0.89-0.93). Nonetheless, modeling accuracy varied among biogeographical regions, with F1-score values that were very high for Continental (0.94 +/- 0.01) and Atlantic (0.90 +/- 0.02) regions, high for Alpine regions (0.86 +/- 0.04) but moderate for Mediterranean regions (0.62 +/- 0.10). The grassland frequency map for 2006-2017 at 250 m spatial resolution provides an unprecedented view of stable grassland patterns in agricultural areas compared to existing national and European GIS layers. Sub-pixel analysis showed that areas modeled as grasslands corresponded to grassland-dominant areas (60%-94%). This unique long-term and national monitoring of grasslands generates new opportunities for semi-natural grassland inventorying and agro-ecological management.

TI  - Mapping oak decline through long-term analysis of time series of satellite images in the forests of Malekshahi, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zagros Mountains forests extend across 11 provinces in Iran and constitute approximately 40.0% of the country's woodlands. These forests have important soil conservation and water regulation functions. Over the last decade, these forests have been declining in oak populations in many places, triggered by factors such as drought, pathogens like the fungus Biscogniauxia mediterranea, and pests such as borer beetles. Mapping the regions that show such a decline is the first step to addressing and managing the risks posed by this environmental calamity. In this research, we focus on the forests surrounding Malekshahi city in the Ilam province of Iran. Using Landsat data from the years 2000 to 2016, we determined the spatial distribution of oak decline in the region. After applying a forest/non-forest classification, appropriate spectral indices including Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were selected. Together with ground truth data, two regression methods (linear regression and support vector regression (SVR)) were used to model the decline score of each pixel based on the slope of variation of selected spectral indices during the observed 17 years. The oak forests were then classified into four categories: healthy forests, low-severity-declined forests, mid-severity declined forests, and high-severity declined forests, based on the respective estimated decline scores. SVR mapped different severities of oak decline with an overall accuracy of 51%, which appears to be due to the dependency of the method on the time of decline during the 17-year timeframe. However, in a binary classification mode - meaning classifying decline score to be either 'Healthy' or 'decline' - both regression methods were able to detect declined pixels with a producer's accuracy of 100%.

TI  - Geodetic Model of the 2017 Mw 6.5 Mainling Earthquake Inferred from GPS and InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 17 November 2017, a Mw 6.5 earthquake occurred in Mainling County, Nyingchi City, China. The epicenter was located in the Namche Barwa region of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Here, we have derived coseismic deformation from Global Positioning System (GPS) data and ascending Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Based on a joint inversion of the two datasets, we obtained the coseismic slip distribution along a curved, northeast trending, and high-angle (dip angle of 75 degrees) thrust fault. Our results show that the seismic moment release was 7.49 x 10(18) N.m, corresponding to a moment magnitude of Mw 6.55. The maximum slip was 1.03 m and the main rupture zone extended to a 12 km depth. The earthquake may have been related to the release of strain accumulated during the subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian continent. We identified a high strain rate and low b-values around the epicentral area before the earthquake, indicating that the earthquake was nucleated under a high strain/stress state. The data indicate two regions, southwest and southeast to the epicenter (the eastern Main Himalaya Thrust and northern end of the Sagaing fault), which remain under high stress/strain conditions and pose a significant seismic hazard.

TI  - A deep learning approach to conflating heterogeneous geospatial data for corn yield estimation: A case study of the US Corn Belt at the county level
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding large-scale crop growth and its responses to climate change are critical for yield estimation and prediction, especially under the increased frequency of extreme climate and weather events. County-level corn phenology varies spatially and interannually across the Corn Belt in the United States, where precipitation and heat stress presents a temporal pattern among growth phases (GPs) and vary interannually. In this study, we developed a long short-term memory (LSTM) model that integrates heterogeneous crop phenology, meteorology, and remote sensing data to estimate county-level corn yields. By conflating heterogeneous phenology-based remote sensing and meteorological indices, the LSTM model accounted for 76% of yield variations across the Corn Belt, improved from 39% of yield variations explained by phenology-based meteorological indices alone. The LSTM model outperformed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and random forest (RF) approaches for end-of-the-season yield estimation, as a result of its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate cumulative and nonlinear relationships between corn yield and environmental factors. The results showed that the period from silking to dough was most critical for crop yield estimation. The LSTM model presented a robust yield estimation under extreme weather events in 2012, which reduced the root-mean-square error to 1.47 Mg/ha from 1.93 Mg/ha for LASSO and 2.43 Mg/ha for RF. The LSTM model has the capability to learn general patterns from high-dimensional (spectral, spatial, and temporal) input features to achieve a robust county-level crop yield estimation. This deep learning approach holds great promise for better understanding the global condition of crop growth based on publicly available remote sensing and meteorological data.

TI  - Overall Methodology Design for the United States National Land Cover Database 2016 Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2016 provides a suite of data products, including land cover and land cover change of the conterminous United States from 2001 to 2016, at two- to three-year intervals. The development of this product is part of an effort to meet the growing demand for longer temporal duration and more frequent, accurate, and consistent land cover and change information. To accomplish this, we designed a new land cover strategy and developed comprehensive methods, models, and procedures for NLCD 2016 implementation. Major steps in the new procedures consist of data preparation, land cover change detection and classification, theme-based postprocessing, and final integration. Data preparation includes Landsat imagery selection, cloud detection, and cloud filling, as well as compilation and creation of more than 30 national-scale ancillary datasets. Land cover change detection includes single-date water and snow/ice detection algorithms and models, two-date multi-index integrated change detection models, and long-term multi-date change algorithms and models. The land cover classification includes seven-date training data creation and 14-run classifications. Pools of training data for change and no-change areas were created before classification based on integrated information from ancillary data, change-detection results, Landsat spectral and temporal information, and knowledge-based trajectory analysis. In postprocessing, comprehensive models for each land cover theme were developed in a hierarchical order to ensure the spatial and temporal coherence of land cover and land cover changes over 15 years. An initial accuracy assessment on four selected Landsat path/rows classified with this method indicates an overall accuracy of 82.0% at an Anderson Level II classification and 86.6% at the Anderson Level I classification after combining the primary and alternate reference labels. This methodology was used for the operational production of NLCD 2016 for the Conterminous United States, with final produced products available for free download.

TI  - Sea Surface-Visible Aquaculture Spatial-Temporal Distribution Remote Sensing: A Case Study in Liaoning Province, China from 2000 to 2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture plays an important role in providing food and reducing poverty but it affects environmental change and coastal ecosystems. Remote sensing is a technology that is helpful in the spatial-temporal dynamic monitoring of aquaculture, coastal management, and environmental monitoring. Most research focuses on inland and coastal areas, and little attention is paid to the extensive distribution of marine aquaculture. As an example, we use the freely available Landsat data of the developed marine aquaculture Liaoning Province of China and use the object-oriented automatic extraction method to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution information of marine aquaculture from 2000 to 2018. The accuracy evaluation from the randomly distributed sample points in high-resolution remote sensing images shows that the extraction accuracy for all of the five individual years of aquaculture area was higher than 82%. The results showed that (1) in the past 19 years, the area of marine aquaculture in Liaoning Province showed an increasing trend, which increased from 35.41 km(2) in 2000 to 201.83 km(2) in 2018, approximately 5.7 times increase in total area, but the growth rate decreased slightly due to government policy and the environmental quality of the sea area. (2) The centroid of offshore aquaculture in Liaoning Province shows a migration pattern to the northeast, in general, extending from the Dalian Bay sea area to the eastern sea area of the Dalian Chengshantou National Nature Reserve of Coastal Landform in the northeastern direction, and the migration distance reached 48.78 km. Moreover, the migration distance between 2005 and 2010 was the largest of all of the periods, reaching 35.43 km. The new marine aquaculture areas are mainly concentrated in the eastern direction of Xiaoyao Bay, the Changshan Islands, and Guanglu Island in Changhai County. (3) The landscape pattern of marine aquaculture in Liaoning Province is split, large-scale aquaculture and small-scale aquaculture are symbiotic, and landscape ecological activities are active. For local managers, this study can provide valuable supporting data for the assessment of marine aquaculture yield in this region, comprehensive control and management of the marine environment, and stability of the marine ecosystem. For other countries or regions, this work provides a great reference value for monitoring the dynamic spatial distribution of marine aquaculture.

TI  - High-Resolution Intertidal Topography from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imagery: Synergy between Remote Sensing and Numerical Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertidal zones are well recognized for their dynamic nature and role in near-shore hydrodynamics. The intertidal topography is poorly mapped worldwide due to the high cost of associated field campaigns. Here we present a combination of remote-sensing and hydrodynamic modeling to overcome the lack of in situ measurements. We derive a digital elevation model (DEM) by linking the corresponding water level to a sample of shorelines at various stages of the tide. Our shoreline detection method is fully automatic and capable of processing high-resolution imagery from state-of-the-art satellite missions, e.g., Sentinel-2. We demonstrate the use of a tidal model to infer the corresponding water level in each shoreline pixel at the sampled timestamp. As a test case, this methodology is applied to the vast coastal region of the Bengal delta and an intertidal DEM at 10 m resolution covering an area of 1134 km(2) is developed from Sentinel-2 imagery. We assessed the quality of the DEM with two independent in situ datasets and conclude that the accuracy of our DEM amounts to about 1.5 m, which is commensurate with the typical error bar of the validation datasets. This DEM can be useful for high-resolution hydrodynamic and wave modeling of the near-shore area. Additionally, being automatic and numerically effective, our methodology is compliant with near-real-time monitoring constraints.

TI  - Monitoring Post-Fire Recovery of Chaparral and Conifer Species Using Field Surveys and Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recovery trajectories derived from remote sensing data are widely used to monitor ecosystem recovery after disturbance events, but these trajectories are often retrieved without a precise understanding of the land cover within a scene. As a result, the sources of variability in post-disturbance recovery trajectories are poorly understood. In this study, we monitored the recovery of chaparral and conifer species following the 2007 Zaca Fire, which burned 97,270 ha in Santa Barbara County, California. We combined field survey data with two time series remote sensing products: the relative delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) and green vegetation (GV) fractions derived from spectral mixture analysis. Recovery trajectories were retrieved for stands dominated by six different chaparral species. We also retrieved recovery trajectories for stands of mixed conifer forest. We found that the two remote sensing products were equally effective at mapping vegetation cover across the burn scar. The GV fractions (r(78) = 0.552, p < 0.001) and normalized burn ratio (r(78) = 0.555, p < 0.001) had nearly identical correlations with ground reference data of green vegetation cover. Recovery of the chaparral species was substantially affected by the 2011-2017 California drought. GV fractions for the chaparral species generally declined between 2011 and 2016. Physiological responses to fire and drought were important sources of variability between the species. The conifer stands did not exhibit a drought signal that was directly correlated with annual precipitation, but the drought likely delayed the return to pre-fire conditions. As of 2018, 545 of the 756 conifer stands had not recovered to their pre-fire GV fractions. Spatial and temporal variation in species composition were important sources of spectral variability in the chaparral and conifer stands. The chaparral stands in particular had highly heterogeneous species composition. Dominant species accounted for between 30% and 53% of the land cover in the surveyed chaparral patches, so non-dominant land cover types strongly influenced remote sensing signals. Our study reveals that prolonged drought can delay or alter the post-fire recovery of Mediterranean ecosystems. It is also the first study to critically examine how fine-scale variability in land cover affects time series remote sensing analyses.

TI  - The Effects of Land Use Zoning and Densification on Changes in Land Surface Temperature in Seoul
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated how changes in land surface temperature (LST) during 2004 and 2014 were attributable to zoning-based land use type in Seoul in association with the building coverage ratio (BCR), floor area ratio (FAR), and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We retrieved LSTs and NDVI data from satellite images, Landsat TM 5 for 2004 and Landsat 8 TIRS for 2014 and combined them with parcel-based land use information, which contained data on BCR, FAR, and zoning-based land use type. The descriptive analysis results showed a rise in LST for the low- and medium-density residential land, whereas significant LST decreases were found in high-density residential, semi-residential, and commercial areas over the time period. Statistical results further supported these findings, yielding statistically significant negative coefficient values for all interaction variables between higher-density land use types and a year-based dummy variable. The findings appear to be related to residential densification involving the provision of more high-rise apartment complexes and government efforts to secure more parks and green spaces through urban redevelopment and renewal projects.

TI  - Is it Necessary to Perform Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Thin Melanoma? A Retrospective Single Center Analysis
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard procedure for regional lymph node staging and still has the most important prognostic value for the outcome of patients with thin melanoma. In addition to ulceration, SLNB had to be considered even for a single mitotic figure in thin (<1 mm) melanoma according to AJCC7th guideline, therefore, a retrospective review was conducted involving 403 pT1 melanoma patients. Among them, 152 patients suffered from pT1b ulcerated or mitotic rate >= 1/ mm(2) melanomas according to the AJCC7th staging system. SLNB was performed in 78 cases, of which nine (11.5%) showed SLN positivity. From them, interestingly, we found a relatively high positive sentinel rate (6/78-8%) in the case of thin primary melanomas <0.8 mm. Moreover, the presence of regression increased the probability of sentinel positivity by 5.796 fold. After reassessing pT stage based on the new AJCC8(th), 37 pT1b cases were reordered into pT1a category. There was no significant relation between other characteristics examined (age, gender, Breslow, Clark level, and mitosis index) and sentinel node positivity. Based on our data, we suggest that mitotic rate alone is not a sufficiently powerful predictor of SLN status in thin melanomas. If strict histopathological definition criteria are applied, regression might be an additional adverse feature that aids in identifying T1 patients most likely to be SLN-positive. After reassessing of pT1b cases according to AJCC8(th) regression proved to be independent prognostic factor on sentinel lymph node positivity. Our results propose that sentinel lymph node biopsy might also be considered at patients with regressive thin (<0.8 mm) melanomas.

TI  - Mapping of Snow Depth by Blending Satellite and In-Situ Data Using Two-Dimensional Optimal Interpolation-Application to AMSR2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of a snow depth product over North America is investigated by applying two-dimensional optimal interpolation to passive microwave satellite-derived and in-situ measured snow depth. At each snow-covered satellite footprint, the technique computes a snow depth increment as the weighted average of data increments, and updates the satellite-derived snow depth accordingly. Data increments are computed as the difference between the in-situ-measured and satellite snow depth at station locations surrounding the satellite footprint. Calculation of optimal weights is based on spatial lag autocorrelation of snow depth increments, modelled as functions of horizontal distance and elevation difference between pairs of observations. The technique is applied to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) snow depth and in-situ snow depth obtained from the Global Historical Climatology Network. The results over North America during January-February 2017 indicate that the technique greatly enhances the performance of the satellite estimates, especially over mountain terrain, albeit with an accuracy inferior to that over low elevation areas. Moreover, the technique generates more accurate output compared to that from NOAA's Global Forecast System, with implications for improving the utilization of satellite data in snow assessments and numerical weather prediction.

In this study, geospatial technologies coupled with a LUR (Land Use Regression) approach were applied to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of fine particulate (PM2.5). In-situ observations of air pollutants from ground monitoring stations from 2016-2018 were used as dependent variables, while the land-use/land cover, a NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from a MODIS sensors, and meteorology data allocations surrounding the monitoring stations from 0.25-5 km buffer ranges were collected as spatial predictors from GIS and remote sensing databases. A linear regression method was developed for the LUR model and 10-fold cross-validation was used to assess the model robustness. The R-2 model obtained was 56% for DKI Jakarta, Indonesia, and 83% for Taipei Metropolis, Taiwan. According to the results of the PM2.5 model, the essential predictors for DKI Jakarta were influenced by temperature, NDVI, humidity, and residential area, while those for the Taipei Metropolis region were influenced by PM10, NO2, SO2, UV, rainfall, spring, main road, railroad, airport, proximity to airports, mining areas, and NDVI. The validation of the results of the estimated PM2.5 distribution use 10-cross validation with indicated R-2 values of 0.62 for DKI Jakarta and 0.84 for Taipei Metropolis. The results of cross-validation show the strength of the model.

TI  - First Provisional Land Surface Reflectance Product from Geostationary Satellite Himawari-8 AHI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A provisional surface reflectance (SR) product from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on-board the new generation geostationary satellite (Himawari-8) covering the period between July 2015 and December 2018 is made available to the scientific community. The Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm is used in conjunction with time series Himawari-8 AHI observations to generate 1-km gridded and tiled land SR every 10 minutes during day time. This Himawari-8 AHI SR product includes retrieved atmospheric properties (e.g., aerosol optical depth at 0.47 mu m and 0.51 mu m), spectral surface reflectance (AHI bands 1-6), parameters of the RTLS BRDF model, and quality assurance flags. Product evaluation shows that Himawari-8 AHI data on average yielded 35% more cloud-free, valid pixels in a single day when compared to available data from the low earth orbit (LEO) satellites Terra/Aqua with MODIS sensor. Comparisons of Himawari-8 AHI SR against corresponding MODIS SR products (MCD19A1) over a variety of land cover types with the similar viewing geometry show high consistency between them, with correlation coefficients (r) being 0.94 and 0.99 for red and NIR bands, respectively. The high-frequency geostationary data are expected to facilitate studies of ecosystems on daily to diurnal time scales, complementing observations from networks such as the FLUXNET.

TI  - Use of spatial autocorrelation and time series Landsat images for long-term monitoring of surface water shrinkage and expansion in Guanting Reservoir, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs are closely related to anthropic activities, and quantifying the long-term dynamics of surface water in reservoirs could be useful for decision-makers to improve the actual strategies of reservoir management. This study used the global Moran's I index, modi?ed Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and a total of 596 Landsat images during 1985-2018 for tracking the annual dynamics of water extent in the process of water shrinkage and expansion in Guanting Reservoir, China. Landscape metrics related to the area, elongation, fragmentation, and edge complexity of surface water in reservoir landscape were computed for tracking the annual dynamics of surface water patterns. Statistical comparison between the results of global Moran's I index and landscape metrics indicates that except for the complexity of water and non-water edge, global Moran's I index can successfully estimate the dynamics of the area, elongation and fragmentation of surface water in the reservoir. This study proposed a continuous approach of long-term monitoring of surface water patterns using spatial autocorrelation that might be used in the areas where the surface water extraction is difficult and water dynamics are complex.

TI  - Changes in Lake Area in Response to Climatic Forcing in the Endorheic Hongjian Lake Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Endorheic lakes are key components of the water cycle and the ecological system in endorheic basins. The endorheic Hongjian Lake wetland is China's national nature reserve for protecting the vulnerable species of Relict Gull. The Hongjian Lake, once China's largest desert freshwater lake, has been suffering from severe shrinkage in the last two decades, yet the variations in the lake area and its responses to climate change are poorly understood due to a lack of in situ observations. In this study, using Landsat remote sensing images, the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, and nonparametric tests, we obtained the Hongjian Lake area changes on the annual, seasonal, and quasi-monthly scales during 1988-2014, analyzed the corresponding variations of the six climatic factors in the Hongjian Lake Basin (HJLB) using satellite-based products, and investigated the multi-scale response characteristics of lake area to climatic forcing using correlation analysis. The results showed that the lake area decreased during 1988-2014, and this process can be divided into two sub-stages, namely the first slight increasing sub-phase in 1988-1999 and the second significant declining sub-phase in 2000-2014. The shifts in patterns of the seasonal cycle had three types: as the natural rhythm of the lake changes has been broken by intensive human activities since the late 1990s, the natural bimodal type I has obviously changed into non-natural bimodal type II and unimodal type III, featured by a declining peak in July-September. The climatic wet/dry regime on multi-scales during 1988-2014 in the HJLB was generally warming and drying, mainly reflected by the increase in temperature (T), arid index (AI) and evaporation (ET0, ETa), and the decrease in the precipitation (Pre) and actual water difference (AWD). There were large differences in the climatic factors at different time scales, especially in the wet and dry seasons. When the lagged effect, the cumulative effect, and the lagged and cumulative combined effect were gradually considered, the correlation coefficient significantly increased, and the direction of the correlation coefficient became coincident with common sense. The correlation analysis identified a lag period of approximately 1-3 years on an annual scale, and a lag period of approximately 1-3 months on a monthly scale. This study could provide a certain scientific reference for climate change detection, water resource management, and species habitat protection in the HJLB and similar endorheic basins or inland arid regions.

TI  - Thermohaline Structures and Heat/Freshwater Transports of Mesoscale Eddies in the Bay of Bengal Observed by Argo and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of mesoscale eddies in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) is key for further understanding the climate variability in this region and beyond, but little is known about the vertical structure of these eddies. In this study, the three-dimensional structure and transport characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the BOB were comprehensively investigated by the combined use of Argo profiles and satellite data. The composite analysis showed that eddy-induced ocean anomalies are mainly confined to the upper 300 m of the water. The spatial structure of eddy-induced thermohaline perturbations is characterized by a dominant dipole structure in the near surface layer, arising from horizontal advection of the background thermohaline gradient by eddy rotation, and a monopole structure in the subsurface layer, caused by eddy-induced vertical displacements of the isopycnal surfaces. In the eddy core, the maximum temperature anomalies induced by a cyclonic eddy (CE) and an anticyclonic eddy (AE) are about -1.2 degrees C and +1.2 degrees C, respectively. The anomalies are located at approximately 100 m. The corresponding salinity anomalies are located at approximately 50 m with a value of -0.1 psu (0.1 psu) for CE (AE). The eddy thermohaline structure has a seasonal character. A deeper temperature and salinity core occurs in both CE and AE in spring compared to that in other seasons, which is primarily caused by the relatively deep thermocline and halocline during that season. In addition, unique warming anomalies induced by CE are present in the mixed layer during winter due to the vertical advection of the BL (Barrier Layer) warmer water by eddies. The total meridional heat transport induced by the composite eddy is poleward (equatorward) south (north) to 10 degrees N with a value of 0.01 PW (-0.013 PW), whereas the total meridional freshwater transport is equatorward with a value of 0.046 Sv over a one-year period. The volume of freshwater export out of the bay is approximately 35% of the annual net freshwater input from local precipitation and river discharge.

TI  - A New Remote Sensing Approach to Enrich Hydropower Dams' Information and Assess Their Impact Distances: A Case Study in the Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydropower dam information such as construction and completion timings is often incomplete and missing in existing dam databases, and the hydropower dam's adjacency impact distance, which is important to the surrounding environment, is also lacking for many dams. In this study, we developed a new remote sensing approach to specifically determine the timings and to assess the influencing distance on land use and land cover at the above and below dam areas. We established the new remote sensing method by identifying levels shifts in trajectories of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indicators and by identifying the change point in entropy coefficient of variation (CV) variations to allow an auto-acquisition of the information above at the water basin level. We used three geospatial datasets including 1) a 30-year Landsat time series, 2) an annual Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composite, and 3) digital elevation model (DEM) data. We applied the proposed method to the Mekong River Basin (MRB) in Southeast Asia, where hydropower dam constructions have increased significantly since the 1990s. Results suggested that we were able to obtain the desired information for 67 Mekong hydropower dams successfully. Pearson correlation tests were used to validate timing results against official records, and the correlation coefficients were found to be 0.96 and 0.90, respectively, for construction and completion timing determination. We discovered that the buffer radius of a Mekong dam's adjacency impact on land use and land cover was usually 4.0-km and 2.5-km in the above and below dam area. The data determined from this study may fill important information gaps in existing dam databases, and the approach developed in this case may be generalized to the other watersheds of the world, where hydropower dams exist. However, essential dam information is either incomplete or unavailable.

TI  - A Small Ship Target Detection Method Based on Polarimetric SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of small fishing ships is very important for maritime fishery supervision. However, it is difficult to detect small ships using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), due to the weak target scattering and very small number of pixels. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has been widely used in maritime ship detection due to its abundant target scattering information. In the present paper, a new ship detector, named Lambda(M), is developed based on the analysis of polarization scattering differences between ship and sea, then combined with the two-parameter constant false alarm rate method (TP-CFAR) algorithm to conduct ship detection. The goals of the detector construction are to fully consider the ship's depolarization effect, and further amplify it through sliding window processing. First, the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) enhancement performance of Lambda(M) for ships with different lengths ranging from 8 to 230 m under 90 different combinations of windows are analyzed in detail using three set of RADARSAT-2 quad-polarization data, then the appropriate window size is determined. In addition, the SCR enlargement between Lambda(M) and some typical polarization features is compared. Among these, for ships of length greater than 35 m, the average contrast of Lambda(M) is 33.7 dB, which is 20 dB greater than that of the HV channel. For small vessels of length less than 16 m, the average contrast of Lambda(M) is 16 dB higher than that of HV channel on average. Finally, the RADARSAT-2 data including nonmetallic small vessels are used to perform ship detection tests, and the detection ability for conventional and small ships of some classic algorithms are compared and analyzed. For large vessels of length greater than 35 m, the method proposed in this paper is able to obtain a superior detection result, maintain the ship contour well, and suppress false alarms caused by the cross side lobe in the SAR image. For small vessels of length less than 16 m, the method proposed in this paper can reduce the number of missed targets, while also obtaining superior detection results, especially for small nonmetallic vessels.

TI  - Remote Sensing Retrieval of Turbidity in Alpine Rivers based on high Spatial Resolution Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity, relating to underwater light attenuation, is an important optical parameter for water quality evaluation. Satellite estimation of turbidity in alpine rivers is challenging for common ocean color retrieval models due to the differences in optical properties of the water bodies. In this study, we present a simple two-band semi-analytical turbidity (2BSAT) retrieval model for estimating turbidity in five alpine rivers with varying turbidity from 1.01 to 284 NTU. The model was calibrated and validated, respectively, while using one calibration dataset that was obtained from the Three Parallel Rivers basin and two independent validation datasets that were obtained from the Kaidu River basin and the Yarlung Zangbo River basin. The results show that the model has excellent performance in deriving turbidity in alpine rivers. We verified the consistency of the simulated reflectance and satellite-based reflectance and calibrated the 2BSAT model for the specified bands of high spatial resolution satellites in order to achieve the goal of remote sensing monitoring. It is concluded that the model can be used for the quantitative monitoring of turbidity in alpine rivers using satellite images. Based on the model, we used the Sentinel-2 images from one year to identify the seasonal patterns of turbidity of five alpine rivers and the Landsat series images from 1989 to 2018 to analyze the turbidity variation trends of these rivers. The results indicate that the turbidity of these alpine rivers usually presents the highest level in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest in winter. Meanwhile, the variation trends of turbidity over the past 30 years present distinctly different characteristics in the five rivers.

TI  - Mining-Induced Time-Series Deformation Investigation Based on SBAS-InSAR Technique: A Case Study of Drilling Water Solution Rock Salt Mine
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to traditional coal mines, the mining-induced dynamic deformation of drilling solution mining activities may result in even more serious damage to surface buildings and infrastructures due to the different exploitation mode. Therefore, long-term dynamic monitoring and analysis of rock salt mines is extremely important for preventing potential geological damages. In this work, the small baseline subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1A imagery is utilized to monitor the ground surface deformation of a rock salt mining area. The time-series analysis is carried out to obtain the spatial-temporal characteristics of land subsidence caused by drilling solution mining activities. A typical rock salt mine in Changde, China is selected as the test site. Twenty-four scenes of Sentinel-1A image data acquired from June 2015 to January 2017 are used to obtain the time-series subsidence of the test mine. The temporal-spatial evolution of the derived settlement funnels is revealed. The time-series deformation on typical feature points has been analyzed. Experimental results show that the obtained drilling solution mining-induced subsidence has a spatial characteristic of multiplied peaks along the transversal direction. Temporally, the large-scale surface settlement for the rock salt mine area begins to appear in September 2016, with a time lag of 8 months, and shows an obvious seasonal fluctuation. The maximum cumulative subsidence is detected up to 199 mm. These subsiding characteristics are consistent with the connected groove mining method used in drilling water solution mines. To evaluate the reliability of the results, the SBAS-derived results are compared with the field-leveling measurements. The estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of +/- 11 mm indicates a high consistency.

TI  - Features of the Cloud Base Height and Determining the Threshold of Relative Humidity over Southeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a critical role in adjusting the global radiation budget and hydrological cycle; however, obtaining accurate information on the cloud base height (CBH) is still challenging. In this study, based on Lidar and aircraft soundings, we investigated the features of the CBH and determined the thresholds of the environmental relative humidity (RH) corresponding to the observed CBHs over Southeast China from October 2017 to September 2018. During the observational period, the CBHs detected by Lidar/aircraft were commonly higher in cold months and lower in warm months; in the latter, 75.91% of the CBHs were below 2000 m. Overall, the RHs at the cloud base were mainly distributed between 70 and 90% for the clouds lower than 1000 m, in which the most concentrated RH was approximately 80%. In addition, for the clouds with a cloud base higher than 1000 m, the RH thresholds decreased dramatically with increasing CBH, where the RH thresholds at cloud bases higher than 2000 m could be lower than 60%. On average, the RH thresholds for determining the CBHs were the highest (72.39%) and lowest (63.56%) in the summer and winter, respectively, over Southeast China. Therefore, to determine the CBH, a specific threshold of RH is needed. Although the time period covered by the collected CBH data from Lidar/aircraft is short, the above analyses can provide some verification and evidence for using the RH threshold to determine the CBH.

TI  - Combining Measurements of Built-up Area, Nighttime Light, and Travel Time Distance for Detecting Changes in Urban Boundaries: Introducing the BUNTUS Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a new algorithm (BUNTUS-Built-up, Nighttime Light, and Travel time for Urban Size) using remote sensing techniques to delineate urban boundaries. The paper is part of a larger study of the role of urbanisation in changing fossil fuel emissions. The method combines estimates of land cover, nighttime lights, and travel times to classify contiguous urban areas. The method is automatic, global and uses data sets with enough duration to establish trends. Validation using ground truth from Landsat-8 OLI images revealed an overall accuracy ranging from 60% to 95%. Thus, this approach is capable of describing spatial distributions and giving detailed information of urban extents. We demonstrate the method with examples from Brisbane, Australia, Melbourne, Australia, and Beijing, China. The new method meets the criteria for studying overall trends in urban emissions.

TI  - Implementation of a Satellite Based Inland Water Algal Bloom Alerting System Using Analysis Ready Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water managers need tools to assist in the management of ever increasing algal bloom problems over wide spatial areas to complement sparse and declining in situ monitoring networks. Optical methods employing satellite data offer rapid and widespread coverage for early detection of bloom events. The advent of the Analysis Ready Data (ARD) and Open Data Cube concepts offer the means to lower the technical challenges confronting managers, allowing them to adopt satellite tools. Exploiting Landsat ARD integrated into the Digital Earth Australia data cube, we developed a prototype algal bloom alerting tool for the state of New South Wales, Australia. A visualization portal allows managers to gain insights into bloom status across the state as a whole and to further investigate spatial patterns in bloom alerts at an individual water body basis. To complement this we also proposed an algal alert system for trial based on chlorophyll and TSM levels which requires further testing. The system was able to retrieve the status of 444 water bodies across the state and outputs from the visualization system are presented. Time series of image acquisitions during an intense bloom in one lake are used to demonstrate the potential of the system. We discuss the implications for further development and operationalisation including the potential for augmentation with alternative algorithms and incorporation of other sensor ARD data to improve both temporal and spectral resolutions.

TI  - Theological perspectives on accounting: worldviews don't change overnight
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the 2004 AAAJ special issue (SI): "Accounting and theology, an introduction: Initiating a dialogue between immediacy and eternity," the relative immediate impact of the call for papers and the relevance of the theme to address issues in accounting today and in the future.Design/methodology/approach The paper is a reflection and is framed around three different modes of engagement with new perspectives as identified by Orlikowski (2015). These are religion as phenomenon, as perspective and as a worldview. The authors draw on Burrell and Morgan's (1979) framework in order to explore the ontological and epistemological blinkers that have limited the attempts to explore accounting from a theological perspective.Findings The paper argues that historical and current structures can limit the manner in which accounting research uses theological perspectives. Indeed, the concerns of the initial SI remain - that the contemporary economic and knowledge system is in crisis and alternative ways of questioning are required to understand and respond to this system.Research limitations/implications As a reflection, this paper is subject to limitations of author bias relating to our beliefs, ethnicities and culture. The authors have sought to reduce these by drawing on a wide range of sources, critical analysis and the input of feedback from other scholars. Nevertheless, the narrative of impact remains a continuing story.Originality/value In drawing on both an original SI guest editor and a scholar for whom the 2004 SI has become a touchstone and springboard, this paper provides multiple viewpoints on the issue of accounting and theology.

TI  - Evaluating Combinations of Sentinel-2 Data and Machine-Learning Algorithms for Mangrove Mapping in West Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Creating a national baseline for natural resources, such as mangrove forests, and monitoring them regularly often requires a consistent and robust methodology. With freely available satellite data archives and cloud computing resources, it is now more accessible to conduct such large-scale monitoring and assessment. Yet, few studies examine the reproducibility of such mangrove monitoring frameworks, especially in terms of generating consistent spatial extent. Our objective was to evaluate a combination of image processing approaches to classify mangrove forests along the coast of Senegal and The Gambia. We used freely available global satellite data (Sentinel-2), and cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine) to run two machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), and classification and regression trees (CART). We calibrated and validated the algorithms using 800 reference points collected using high-resolution images. We further re-ran 10 iterations for each algorithm, utilizing unique subsets of the initial training data. While all iterations resulted in thematic mangrove maps with over 90% accuracy, the mangrove extent ranges between 827-2807 km(2) for Senegal and 245-1271 km(2) for The Gambia with one outlier for each country. We further report "Places of Agreement" (PoA) to identify areas where all iterations for both methods agree (506.6 km(2) and 129.6 km(2) for Senegal and The Gambia, respectively), thus have a high confidence in predicting mangrove extent. While we acknowledge the time- and cost-effectiveness of such methods for the landscape managers, we recommend utilizing them with utmost caution, as well as post-classification on-the-ground checks, especially for decision making.

TI  - Tempo-Spatial Behavior of Surface Urban Heat Island of Isfahan Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The population of Isfahan City has been increased by ten times during the last six decades. This increase has had extensive environmental consequences. In this period, drying up of Zayandehrood River, increase in temperature and variability of precipitation has exacerbated the environmental conditions. Formation of the heat island is only one of the consequences of environmental changes in the last decades. The heat island also has many consequences in terms of health and water and energy consumptions. In this research, the land surface temperature (LST) data corresponding to daytime and nighttime using MODIS Aqua/LST from 2000 to 2016 are utilized. Using these data, the background climate of Isfahan metropolis was detected by the distance-azimuth diagram method. Then, the representative pixel within the city and the representative pixel of the background climate were identified. Based on time series of LST over these two pixels, SUHI index of Isfahan metropolis was calculated. Investigations showed that Isfahan metropolis area is colder than suburbs during the day but at night is about 2 K warmer than its surroundings. The intensity of the SUHI is maximal in January and turns weaker in summer. Regarding the temporal and spatial behavior of Isfahan metropolis SUHI, it seems that changes created by the urban concerning the moisture, albedo and composition of the atmosphere have a great role in the formation of the SUHI. Zayandehrood River has a major role in mitigation of temperature at the land surface, and its drying up has environmental consequences.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-3A Wave Height Observations Near the Coast of Southwest England
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the smaller ground footprint and higher spatial resolution of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, altimeter observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites are expected to be overall more accurate in coastal areas than conventional nadir altimetry. The performance of Sentinel-3A in the coastal region of southwest England was assessed by comparing SAR mode observations of significant wave height against those of Pseudo Low Resolution Mode (PLRM). Sentinel-3A observations were evaluated against in-situ observations from a network of 17 coastal wave buoys, which provided continuous time-series of hourly values of significant wave height, period and direction. As the buoys are evenly distributed along the coast of southwest England, they are representative of a broad range of morphological configurations and swell conditions against which to assess Sentinel-3 SAR observations. The analysis indicates that SAR observations outperform PLRM within 15 km from the coast. Within that region, regression slopes between SAR and buoy observations are close to the 1:1 relation, and the average root mean square error between the two is 0.46 +/- 0.14 m. On the other hand, regression slopes for PLRM observations rapidly deviate from the 1:1 relation, while the average root mean square error increases to 0.84 +/- 0.45 m. The analysis did not identify any dependence of the bias between SAR and in-situ observation on the swell period or direction. The validation is based on a synergistic approach which combines satellite and in-situ observations with innovative use of numerical wave model output to help inform the choice of comparison regions. Such an approach could be successfully applied in future studies to assess the performance of SAR observations over other combinations of coastal regions and altimeters.

TI  - Preliminary Evaluation of the Consistency of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Products in An Urban Area-An Example in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urbanization is occurring rapidly, and numerous moderate resolution remote sensing data are being used to monitor this process. Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data are combined in many applications but few studies haves focused on either urban change or consistency between these two data in time series. To evaluate the varying correlation between the two sensors in a time series, the correlation coefficient (R) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of seven band pairs and three indices (NDVI, NDBI, and MNDWI) were calculated in this study and the results of the built-up area identified by IBI derived from the above three indices were compared. It was found that the correlation between the two sensors (R > 0.8534, p < 0.0001) was good in most bands but not as good for indices (in half of the results, R < 0.9). Meanwhile, the correlation of the two sensors of both bands and indices fluctuated between seasons and the comparative results of built-up area identification between the two data are relative to this variation. Therefore, when the OLI and MSI data are used in future collaboration applications, the data and threshold selection should consider the consistency and the fluctuation between the two data, especially in both time series studies and urban detection.

TI  - High-Resolution and Accurate Topography Reconstruction of Mount Etna from Pleiades Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The areas characterized by dynamic and rapid morphological changes need accurate topography information with frequent updates, especially if these are populated and involve infrastructures. This is particularly true in active volcanic areas such as Mount (Mt.) Etna, located in the northeastern portion of Sicily, Italy. The Mt. Etna volcano is periodically characterized by explosive and effusive eruptions and represents a potential hazard for several thousands of local people and hundreds of tourists present on the volcano itself. In this work, a high-resolution, high vertical accuracy digital surface model (DSM) of Mt. Etna was derived from Pleiades satellite data using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) tool set. We believe that this is the first time that the ASP using Pleiades imagery has been applied to Mt. Etna with sub-meter vertical root mean square error (RMSE) results. The model covers an area of about 400 km(2) with a spatial resolution of 2 m and centers on the summit portion of the volcano. The model was validated by using a set of reference ground control points (GCP) obtaining a vertical RMSE of 0.78 m. The described procedure provides an avenue to obtain DSMs at high spatial resolution and elevation accuracy in a relatively short amount of processing time, making the procedure itself suitable to reproduce topographies often indispensable during the emergency management case of volcanic eruptions.

TI  - Assessment of Green Infrastructure in Riparian Zones Using Copernicus Programme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an approach to identify Green Infrastructure (GI), its benefits and condition. This information enables environmental agencies to prioritise conservation, management and restoration strategies accordingly. The study focuses on riparian areas due to their potential to supply Ecosystem Services (ES), such as water quality, biodiversity, soil protection and flood or drought risk reduction. Natural Water Retention Measures (NWRM) related to agriculture and forestry are the type of GI considered specifically within these riparian areas. The approach is based on ES condition indicators, defined by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to support the policy targets of the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. Indicators that can be assessed through remote sensing techniques are used, namely: capacity to provide ecosystem services, proximity to protected areas, greening response and water stress. Specifically, the approach uses and evaluates the potential of freely available products from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) to monitor GI. Moreover, vegetation and water indices are calculated using data from the Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A scenes and integrated in the analysis. The approach has been tested in the Italian Po river basin in 2018. Firstly, agriculture and forest NWRM were identified in the riparian areas of the river network. Secondly, the Riparian Zones products from the CLMS local component and the satellite-based indices were linked to the aforementioned ES condition indicators. This led to the development of a pixel-based model that evaluates the identified GI according to: (i) its disposition to provide riparian regulative ES and (ii) its condition in the analysed year. Finally, the model was used to prioritise GI for conservation or restoration initiatives, based on its potential to deliver ES and current condition.

TI  - Comparison of Aqua/Terra MODIS and Himawari-8 Satellite Data on Cloud Mask and Cloud Type Classification Using Split Window Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud classification is not only important for weather forecasts, but also for radiation budget studies. Although cloud mask and classification procedures have been proposed for Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), their applicability is still limited to daytime imagery. The split window algorithm (SWA), which is a mature algorithm that has long been exploited in the cloud analysis of satellite images, is based on the scatter diagram between the brightness temperature (BT) and BT difference (BTD). The purpose of this research is to examine the usefulness of the SWA for the cloud classification of both daytime and nighttime images from AHI. We apply SWA also to the image data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra to highlight the capability of AHI. We implement the cloud analysis around Japan by employing band 3 (0.469 mu m) of MODIS and band 1 (0.47 mu m) of AHI for extracting the cloud-covered regions in daytime. In the nighttime case, the bands that are centered at 3.9, 11, 12, and 13 mu m are utilized for both MODIS and Himawari-8, with somewhat different combinations for land and sea areas. Thus, different thresholds are used for analyzing summer and winter images. Optimum values for BT and BTD thresholds are determined for the band pairs of band 31 (11.03 mu m) and 32 (12.02 mu m) of MODIS (SWA31-32) and band 13 (10.4 mu m) and 15 (12.4 mu m) of AHI (SWA13-15) in the implementation of SWA. The resulting cloud mask and classification are verified while using MODIS standard product (MYD35) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data. It is found that MODIS and AHI results both capture the essential characteristics of clouds reasonably well in spite of the relatively simple scheme of SWA based on four threshold values, although a broader spread of BTD obtained with Himawari-8 AHI (SWA13-15) could possibly lead to more consistent results for cloud-type classification than SWA31-32 based on the MODIS sensors.

TI  - Noncontrast computed tomography markers of outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage patients
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The characterization of markers capable of predicting clinically significant hematoma growth (HG) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) may be useful for the selection of patients for clinical trials. The use of several noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers has been suggested to stratify the risk of HG. The aim of this study was to analyze HG prediction using different NCCT markers in patients with spontaneous ICH. Methods: Single-hospital retrospective study of patients with spontaneous ICH, who underwent initial NCCT <24?hours after symptom onset. Clinical characteristics were collected and two independent observers analyzed hemorrhage characteristics, volumes and 8 NCCT markers. HG was defined as a growth of ?33% or ?6mL in follow-up CT and 30-day survival was collected. Results: 328 patients were included. The most frequent NCCT marker was ?any hypodensity? (68.0%) and the less frequent was the blend sign (11.6%). HG occurred in 22.1% of patients and the only independent predictors for HG were ?any hypodensity? (OR=3.32, 95%CI=1.18?9.34, p=0.023) and the swirl sign (OR=3.98, 95%CI=1.41?11.21, p=0.009). Although all NCCT markers were more frequent in patients who died within 30?days, the only independent predictors were ?irregular margins? (OR=4.54, 95%CI=1.63?12.66, p=0.004) and the satellite sign (OR=2.49, 95%CI=1.07?5.75, p=0.034). NCCT markers with greater sensitivity for HG were ?any hypodensity? and the swirl sign, although with poor positive predictive values and poor areas under the curve. Conclusion: Even though some NCCT markers are independent predictors of HG and 30-day survival, they have suboptimal diagnostic test performances for such outcomes.

TI  - Deep learning optimized single-pixel LiDAR
T2  - APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in autonomous transport has led to a demand for 3D imaging technologies capable of resolving fine details at long range. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems have become a key technology in this area, with depth information typically gained through time-of-flight photon-counting measurements of a scanned laser spot. Single-pixel imaging methods offer an alternative approach to spot-scanning, which allows a choice of sampling basis. In this work, we present a prototype LiDAR system, which compressively samples the scene using a deep learning optimized sampling basis and reconstruction algorithms. We demonstrate that this approach improves scene reconstruction quality compared to an orthogonal sampling method, with reflectivity and depth accuracy improvements of 57% and 16%, respectively, for one frame per second acquisition rates. This method may pave the way for improved scan-free LiDAR systems for driverless cars and for fully optimized sampling to decision-making pipelines. (C) 2019 Author(s).

TI  - Validating a Landsat Time-Series of Fractional Component Cover Across Western US Rangelands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western U.S. rangelands have been quantified as six fractional cover (0%-100%) components over the Landsat archive (1985-2018) at a 30 m resolution, termed the "Back-in-Time" (BIT) dataset. Robust validation through space and time is needed to quantify product accuracy. Here, we used field data collected concurrently with high-resolution satellite (HRS) images over multiple locations (n = 42) and years. Field observations were used to train regression tree models, predicting the component cover across each HRS image. Our objectives were to evaluate the spatial and temporal relationships between HRS and BIT component cover and compare spatio-temporal climate responses. First, for each HRS site-year (n = 77) we averaged both the HRS and BIT predictions within each site separately and regressed the averages to quantify the temporal accuracy. Next, we regressed individual pixel values of corresponding HRS and BIT predictions to quantify the spatio-temporal accuracy. Results showed strong temporal correlations with an average R-2 of 0.63 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.47% as well as strong spatio-temporal correlations with an average R-2 of 0.52 and RMSE of 7.89% across components. Our approach increased the validation sample size relative to direct comparison of field observations. Validation results showed robust spatio-temporal relationships between HRS and BIT data, providing increased user confidence in the data.

TI  - GNSS-R with Low-Cost Receivers for Retrieval of Antenna Height from Snow Surfaces Using Single-Frequency Observations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowpack is an important fresh water storage; the retrieval of snow water equivalents from satellite data permits to estimate potentially available water amounts which is an essential parameter in water management plans running in several application fields (e.g., basic needs, hydroelectric, agriculture, hazard and risk monitoring, climate change studies). The possibility to assess snowpack height from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) observations by means of the GNSS reflectometry technique (GNSS-R) has been shown by several studies. However, in general, studies are being conducted using observations collected by continuously operating reference stations (CORS) built for geodetic purposes and equipped with geodetic-grade instruments. Moreover, CORS are located on sites selected according to criteria different from those more suitable for snowpack studies. In this work, beside an overview of key elements of GNSS reflectometry, single-frequency GNSS observations collected by u-blox M8T GNSS receivers and patch antennas from u-blox and Tallysman have been considered for the determination of antenna height from the snowpack surface on a selected test site. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GNSS-R even with non-geodetic-grade instruments, opening the way towards diffuse GNSS-R targeted applications.

TI  - Sentinel 2 Analysis of Turbidity Patterns in a Coastal Lagoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons are transitional ecosystems with complex spatial and temporal variability. Remote sensing tools are essential for monitoring and unveiling their variability. Turbidity is a water quality parameter used for studying eutrophication and sediment transport. The objective of this research is to analyze the monthly turbidity pattern in a shallow coastal lagoon along two years with different precipitation regimes. The selected study area is the Albufera de Valencia lagoon (Spain). For this purpose, we used Sentinel 2 images and in situ data from the monitoring program of the Environment General Subdivision of the regional government. We obtained Sentinel 2A and 2B images for years 2017 and 2018 and processed them with SNAP software. The results of the correlation analysis between satellite and in situ data, corroborate that the reflectance of band 5 (705 nm) is suitable for the analysis of turbidity patterns in shallow lagoons (average depth 1 m), such as the Albufera lagoon, even in eutrophic conditions. Turbidity patterns in the Albufera lagoon show a similar trend in wet and dry years, which is mainly linked to the irrigation practice of rice paddies. High turbidity periods are linked to higher water residence time and closed floodgates. However, precipitation and wind also play an important role in the spatial distribution of turbidity. During storm events, phytoplankton and sediments are discharged to the sea, if the floodgates remain open. Fortunately, the rice harvesting season, when the floodgates are open, coincides with the beginning of the rainy period. Nevertheless, this is a lucky coincidence. It is important to develop conscious management of floodgates, because having them closed during rain events can have several negative effects both for the lagoon and for the receiving coastal waters and ecosystem. Non-discharged solids may accumulate in the lagoon worsening the clogging problems, and the beaches next to the receiving coastal waters will not receive an important load of solids to nourish them.

TI  - Remote Sensing Big Data Classification with High Performance Distributed Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-Performance Computing (HPC) has recently been attracting more attention in remote sensing applications due to the challenges posed by the increased amount of open data that are produced daily by Earth Observation (EO) programs. The unique parallel computing environments and programming techniques that are integrated in HPC systems are able to solve large-scale problems such as the training of classification algorithms with large amounts of Remote Sensing (RS) data. This paper shows that the training of state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be efficiently performed in distributed fashion using parallel implementation techniques on HPC machines containing a large number of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The experimental results confirm that distributed training can drastically reduce the amount of time needed to perform full training, resulting in near linear scaling without loss of test accuracy.

TI  - Quantifying the Congruence between Air and Land Surface Temperatures for Various Climatic and Elevation Zones of Western Himalaya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface and near-surface air temperature observations are primary data for glacio-hydro-climatological studies. The in situ air temperature (T-a) observations require intense logistic and financial investments, making it sparse and fragmented particularly in remote and extreme environments. The temperatures in Himalaya are controlled by a complex system driven by topography, seasons, and cryosphere which further makes it difficult to record or predict its spatial heterogeneity. In this regard, finding a way to fill the observational spatiotemporal gaps in data becomes more crucial. Here, we show the comparison of T-a recorded at 11 high altitude stations in Western Himalaya with their respective land surface temperatures (T-s) recorded by Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites in cloud-free conditions. We found remarkable seasonal and spatial trends in the T-a vs. T-s relationship: (i) T-s are strongly correlated with T-a (R-2 = 0.77, root mean square difference (RMSD) = 5.9 degrees C, n = 11,101 at daily scale and R-2 = 0.80, RMSD = 5.7 degrees C, n = 3552 at 8-day scale); (ii) in general, the RMSD is lower for the winter months in comparison to summer months for all the stations, (iii) the RMSD is directly proportional to the elevations; (iv) the RMSD is inversely proportional to the annual precipitation. Our results demonstrate the statistically strong and previously unreported T-a vs. T-s relationship and spatial and seasonal variations in its intensity at daily resolution for the Western Himalaya. We anticipate that our results will provide the scientists in Himalaya or similar data-deficient extreme environments with an option to use freely available remotely observed T-s products in their models to fill-up the spatiotemporal data gaps related to in situ monitoring at daily resolution. Substituting T-a by T-s as input in various geophysical models can even improve the model accuracy as using spatially continuous satellite derived T-s in place of discrete in situ T-a extrapolated to different elevations using a constant lapse rate can provide more realistic estimates.

TI  - Detecting and Mapping Slag Heaps at Ancient Copper Production Sites in Oman
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new approach for detection and mapping of ancient slag heaps using 16-band multispectral satellite imagery. Understanding the distribution of slag (a byproduct of metal production) is of great importance for understanding how metallurgy shaped long-term economic and political change across the ancient Near East. This study presents results of slag mapping in Oman using WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery. A semi-automated target detection routine using a mixed tuned matched filtering (MTMF) algorithm with scene-derived spectral signatures was applied to 16-band WV3 imagery. Associated field mapping at two copper production sites indicates that WorldView-3 satellite data can differentiate slag and background materials with a relatively high (>90%) overall accuracy. Although this method shows promise for future initiatives to discover and map slag deposits, difficulties in dark object spectral differentiation and underestimation of total slag coverage substantially limit its use. Resulting lower estimations of combined user's (61%) and producer's (45%) accuracies contextualize these limitations for slag specific classification. Accordingly, we describe potential approaches to address these challenges in future studies. As sites of ancient metallurgy in Oman are often located in areas of modern exploration and mining, detection and mapping of ancient slag heaps via satellite imagery can be helpful for discovery and monitoring of vulnerable cultural heritage sites.

TI  - Reactions of Novice Interviewers Conducting Trauma Research With Marginalized Communities: A Qualitative Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trauma-focused research highlights the reactions of seasoned professionals when engaging with vulnerable clients; however, less is known about the common reactions of novices engaged in trauma research, who may lack the skills to cope and interact with traumatized participants. The purpose of this study is to (a) describe common reactions experienced by novice trauma interviewers; (b) examine whether the issues they face are similar to those of seasoned helping professionals; and (c) discuss ways in which training and supervision can increase the well-being of interviewers in trauma research. A semi-structured assessment was administered to novice interviewers who had previously conducted psychosocial and trauma assessments with diverse community participants. Participation was voluntary. The assessment elicited responses concerning secondary traumatic stress, vicarious trauma, posttraumatic growth, and self-help and resources. Audio files were transcribed; responses were compiled to explore themes and identify illustrative quotes. Eight interviewers (two males, six females) participated. Six reported no prior experience working with populations with histories of trauma. Novice interviewers described experiences of secondary traumatic stress, vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, posttraumatic growth, and resilience. Novice interviewers described symptoms consistent with those reported by seasoned helping professionals; positive and negative symptoms often coexisted. Interviewers who completed more assessments described reactions of sadness, anger, insomnia, and changes in worldview. Interviewers who shared similar traumatic histories or environments reported more examples of countertransference. All reported similar feelings of posttraumatic growth, such as hope and optimism, for their participants and an increased appreciation of their resilience. Implications for training and supervision are discussed.

TI  - Landscape metrics of post-restoration vegetation dynamics in wetland ecosystems
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context To monitor wetlands at regional scales, it is pivotal to identify metrics that show rapid and predictable responses to restoration interventions. Remote sensing can monitor such metrics at high frequency and low cost but remains underutilized in practice. Objectives This study sought to find a set of landscape metrics most responsive to restoration and vegetation dynamics across 11 years and 20 restored wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA. Methods Breakpoint analysis was used to detect phases in the development of vegetated pixels as estimated from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Landsat (2004-2017). Landscape metrics were then generated from land cover classifications based on high resolution aerial images from the National Agricultural Inventory Program (NAIP). Using hierarchical clustering, we grouped phases showing similar temporal characteristics. We selected a subset of landscape metrics that best described the spatial structure of vegetation and its dynamics in each phase type. Results We identified four phases in vegetation development: (1A) rapid increase; (1B) decrease; (2A) low change; (2B) low change with fluctuations. Landscape metrics showed a significant response to vegetation dynamics in our sample, suggesting their potential to expand current monitoring practices at low cost. Young sites and sites experiencing a rapid increase in greenness were characterized by a lower density of small patches, while older sites, reference sites, and low variability sites were characterized by large, clustered patches. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that open source remote sensing can detect patterns in wetland response to restoration and help identify factors promoting their recovery.

TI  - An Enhanced Deep Convolutional Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data with high spatiotemporal resolution are critical for dynamic monitoring and prediction in geoscience applications, however, due to some technique and budget limitations, it is not easy to acquire satellite images with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. Spatiotemporal image fusion techniques provide a feasible and economical solution for generating dense-time data with high spatial resolution, pushing the limits of current satellite observation systems. Among existing various fusion algorithms, deeplearningbased models reveal a promising prospect with higher accuracy and robustness. This paper refined and improved the existing deep convolutional spatiotemporal fusion network (DCSTFN) to further boost model prediction accuracy and enhance image quality. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the fusion result is improved considerably with brand-new network architecture and a novel compound loss function. Experiments conducted in two different areas demonstrate these improvements by comparing them with existing algorithms. The enhanced DCSTFN model shows superior performance with higher accuracy, vision quality, and robustness. Second, the advantages and disadvantages of existing deeplearningbased spatiotemporal fusion models are comparatively discussed and a network design guide for spatiotemporal fusion is provided as a reference for future research. Those comparisons and guidelines are summarized based on numbers of actual experiments and have promising potentials to be applied for other image sources with customized spatiotemporal fusion networks.

TI  - Decadal dynamics and challenges for seagrass beds management in Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area, Central Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass beds in central Vietnam plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystem. The area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area (MPA), central Vietnam, has been reported to be declining in recent years. However, there has not been any study on assessing the changes in the area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham MPA, especially by the application of remote sensing technology for evaluating temporal and spatial changes. The aim of this study is to establish the current status and document historical changes using maps of seagrass area in Cu Lao Cham MPA, central Vietnam, during the period of 2003-2017. This is the first study on assessing the temporal and spatial changes in the area of seagrass beds in central Vietnam using remote sensing technology. The study integrated field surveys, satellite remote sensing and GIS methods to analyse ALOS AVNIR-2 and Landsat satellite image data during the period of 2003-2017. The Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies of the years 2003, 2010 and 2017 were generally higher than 89% and 0.83, respectively, in all cases. Seagrass beds have mainly distributed near small islands such as Hon La, Hon Tai and Hon Dai. In particular, seagrass beds have almost disappeared at Bai Ong and Bai Huong in April 2017. In the period of 2003-2017, the area of the seagrass bed experienced significant changes. The seagrass area loss was 40.17 ha, and it gained 58.6 ha in the period of 2003-2010. In the period of 2010-2017, the loss of seagrass area was 68.76 ha, and the new addition was 7.27 ha. The study has identified a number of impacts of declining seagrass areas including marine pollution, changes in natural conditions and some other direct impacts from human activities and tourism. The results of this study could contribute to conservation of seagrass resources and sustainable livelihood development for the local community.

TI  - Assessing Spatiotemporal Variations of Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence at Different Time Scales over the Atacama Desert (Chile) between 2015 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series of the Sentinel-1 mission acquired over the Atacama Desert, Chile, between March 2015 and December 2018. The contribution analyzes temporal and spatial variations of Sentinel-1 interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and exemplarily illustrates factors that are responsible for observed signal differences. The analyses are based on long temporal baselines (365-1090 days) and temporally dense time series constructed with short temporal baselines (12-24 days). Results are compared to multispectral data of Sentinel-2, morphometric features of the digital elevation model (DEM) TanDEM-X WorldDEM (TM), and to a detailed governmental geographic information system (GIS) dataset of the local hydrography. Sentinel-1 datasets are suited for generating extensive, nearly seamless InSAR coherence mosaics covering the entire Atacama Desert (>450 x 1100 km) at a spatial resolution of 20 x 20 meter per pixel. Temporal baselines over several years lead only to very minor decorrelation, indicating a very high signal stability of C-Band in this region, especially in the hyperarid uplands between the Coastal Cordillera and the Central Depression. Signal decorrelation was associated with certain types of surface cover (e.g., water or aeolian deposits) or with actual surface dynamics (e.g., anthropogenic disturbance (mining) or fluvial activity and overland flow). Strong rainfall events and fluvial activity in the periods 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to 2018 caused spatial patterns with significant signal decorrelation; observed linear coherence anomalies matched the reference channel network and indicated actual episodic and sporadic discharge events. In the period 2015-2016, area-wide loss of coherence appeared as strip-like patterns of more than 80 km length that matched the prevailing wind direction. These anomalies, and others observed in that period and in the period 2017-2018, were interpreted to be caused by overland flow of high magnitude, as their spatial location matched well with documented heavy rainfall events that showed cumulative precipitation amounts of more than 20 mm.

TI  - Foliar Moisture Content from the Spectral Signature for Wildfire Risk Assessments in Valparaiso-Chile
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) proved to be one of the most relevant parameters for controlling fire behavior and risk, particularly at the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Data relating FMC to spectral indexes for different species are an important requirement identified by the wildfire safety community. In Valparaiso, the WUI is mainly composed of Eucalyptus Globulus and Pinus Radiata-commonly found in Mediterranean WUI areas-which represent the 97.51% of the forests plantation inventory. In this work we study the spectral signature of these species under different levels of FMC. In particular, we analyze the behavior of the spectral reflectance per each species at five dehydration stages, obtaining eighteen spectral indexes related to water content and, for Eucalyptus Globulus, the area of each leave-associated with the water content-is also computed. As the main outcome of this research, we provide a validated linear regression model associated with each spectral index and the fuel moisture content and moisture loss, per each species studied.

TI  - A safety analysis of elevated highways in Shanghai linked to dynamic load using long-term time-series of InSAR stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic loads of vehicles have a considerable impact on the safety of elevated highways, but few studies have addressed the influence of dynamic loads on the safety of such linear infrastructure using Time-series SAR Interferometry (TS-InSAR). To fill this gap, we explored the displacement of elevated highways and the possible factors causing the deformation, using a long-term time-series of high resolution TerraSAR-X satellite dataset and Attribution Analysis Model (AAM) associated with dynamic loads for Shanghai, China. The results show that most deformed sections of elevated highways are located on the periphery of the network with a deformation velocity of about -5 mm year(-1), as validated by ground-levelling data. Results by the proposed AAM illustrate the displacements of elevated highways correspond to the regional subsiding, dynamic loading, and construction time, as only 5% points are not identified to these factors. This study highlights TS-InSAR can be successfully applied to the safety analysis of operational linear infrastructures.

TI  - Improvement of Air Pollution in China Inferred from Changes between Satellite-Based and Measured Surface Solar Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The air pollution crisis in China has become a global concern due to its profound effects on the global environment and human health. To significantly improve the air quality, mandatory reductions were imposed on pollution emissions and energy consumption within the framework of the 11(th) and 12(th) Five Year Plans of China. This study takes the first step to quantify the implications of recent pollution control efforts for surface solar radiation (SSR), the primary energy source for our planet. The observed bias between satellite-retrieved and surface-observed SSR time series is proposed as a useful indicator for the radiative effects of aerosol changes. This is due to the fact that the effects of temporal variations of aerosols are neglected in satellite retrievals but well captured in surface observations of SSR. The implemented pollution control measures and actions have successfully brought back SSR by an average magnitude of 3.5 W m(-2) decade(-1) for the whole of China from 2008 onwards. Regionally, effective pollution regulations are indicated in the East Coast regions of South and North China, including the capital Beijing, with the SSR brightening induced by aerosol reduction of 7.5 W m(-2) decade(-1), 5.2 W m(-2) decade(-1), and 5.9 W m(-2) decade(-1), respectively. Seasonally, the SSR recovery in China mainly occurs in the warm seasons of spring and summer, with the magnitudes induced by the aerosol radiative effects of 5.9 W m(-2) decade(-1) and 4.7 W m(-2) decade(-1), respectively.

TI  - Interactions among the Phenological Events of Winter Wheat in the North China Plain-Based on Field Data and Improved MODIS Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of complete drivers for phenology changes is crucial for developing prediction models of plant phenology. In addition to climatic factors, the interaction among phenological events has recently been reported as an important driver for the phenology changes of forests, savannas, and grasslands. However, open questions remain as to whether the phenological interaction exists in agricultural ecosystems, among which winter wheat plays a vital role in feeding human beings. In this study, we investigated the interaction among the phenological events of winter wheat in the North China Plain (NCP) using both field and satellite data. Considering the large discrepancies between the existing satellite estimation and field measurements of winter wheat phenology, we first improved the MODIS-based estimation of green-up date (GUD), heading date (HD), and maturity date (MD) through a re-calibrated relative threshold method (RTM) in the NCP. The GUD, HD, and MD were accurately estimated with the mean absolute errors (MAE) and root mean squared errors (RMSE) lower than 7.5 days, compared with the RMSEs ranging from 12.0 to 36.1 days in previous studies. Then, the relationships among the GUD, HD, and MD were analyzed using the field data collected at agricultural meteorological stations. The GUD (HD) showed a significantly positive correlation with the HD (MD). Quantitatively, a one-day earlier GUD (HD) would result in an earlier HD (MD) of 0.57 days (0.60 days). Furthermore, we applied the partial correlation analysis to the improved MODIS estimation of GUD, HD, and MD to investigate their interactions by considering the simultaneous influences from climatic factors. The results showed that the HD (MD) with 85.2% (94.5%) of all winter wheat pixels presented a significantly positive correlation with the GUD (HD). Meanwhile, the GUD (HD) with 84.2% (33.3%) of the entire winter wheat area presented a significantly negative correlation with pre-season temperature. These results suggest that both the climatic factors and phenological interactions should be included in the future development of winter wheat phenology models to improve the prediction accuracies.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of Particulate Organic Carbon Sinking Flux in Global Ocean from 2003 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at the bottom of the euphotic layer in global ocean using remote sensing satellite data plays an important role in clarifying and evaluating the ocean carbon cycle. Based on the in situ POC flux data, this paper evaluated various estimation models. The global ocean POC flux from 2003 to 2018 was calculated using the optimal model, and its temporal and spatial variation characteristics were analyzed. In general, the annual average of global ocean POC flux is about 8.5-14.3 Gt C yr(-1) for period of 2003-2018. In the spatial dimension, the POC flux in the mid-latitude ocean (30-60 degrees) is higher than that in the low-latitude (0-30 degrees). The POC flux in Continental Margins with water depth less than 2000 m accounted for 30% of global ocean, which should receive more attention in global carbon cycle research. In the time dimension, the global POC flux decreases year by year generally, but the POC flux abnormally decreases during El Nino and increases during La Nina. In addition, due to global warming, sea ice melting, and bipolar sea area expansion, POC flux in high-latitude oceans (60-90 degrees) is increasing year by year.

TI  - Automatic Land-Cover Mapping using Landsat Time-Series Data based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Google Earth Engine (GEE) has emerged as an essential cloud-based platform for land-cover classification as it provides massive amounts of multi-source satellite data and high-performance computation service. This paper proposed an automatic land-cover classification method using time-series Landsat data on the GEE cloud-based platform. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-cover products (MCD12Q1.006) with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classification scheme were used to provide accurate training samples using the rules of pixel filtering and spectral filtering, which resulted in an overall accuracy (OA) of 99.2%. Two types of spectral-temporal features (percentile composited features and median composited monthly features) generated from all available Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from the year 2010 +/- 1 were used as input features to a Random Forest (RF) classifier for land-cover classification. The results showed that the monthly features outperformed the percentile features, giving an average OA of 80% against 77%. In addition, the monthly features composited using the median outperformed those composited using the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with an average OA of 80% against 78%. Therefore, the proposed method is able to generate accurate land-cover mapping automatically based on the GEE cloud-based platform, which is promising for regional and global land-cover mapping.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluations and Error Source Analysis of Fengyun-2-Based and GPM-Based Precipitation Products over Mainland China in Summer, 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) with a fine quality are of great importance to global water cycle and matter and energy exchange research. In this study, we firstly apply various statistical indicators to evaluate and compare the main current satellite-based precipitation products from Chinese Fengyun (FY)-2 and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), respectively, over mainland China in summer, 2018. We find that (1) FY-2G QPE and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) perform significantly better than FY-2E QPE, using rain gauge data, with correlation coefficients (CC) varying from 0.65 to 0.90, 0.80 to 0.90, and 0.40 to 0.53, respectively; (2) IMERG agrees well with rain gauge data at monthly scale, while it performs worse than FY-2G QPE at hourly and daily scales, which may be caused by its algorithms; (3) FY-2G QPE underestimates the precipitation in summer, while FY-2E QPE and IMERG generally overestimate the precipitation; (4) there is an interesting error phenomenon in that both FY-based and GPM-based precipitation products perform more poorly during the period from 06:00 to 10:00 UTC than other periods at diurnal scale; and (5) FY-2G QPE agrees well with IMERG in terms of spatial patterns and consistency (CC of 0.81). These findings can provide valuable preliminary references for improving next generation satellite-based QPE retrieval algorithms and instructions for applying these data in various practical fields.

TI  - Evolution of Surge-Type Glaciers in the Yangtze River Headwater Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A surge-type glacier is a special and dangerous type of glacier, which can advance quickly in a short-time with cycles. Glaciers in the Yangtze River headwater are generally acknowledged to be in a stable state. However, not all of those glaciers are stable. In this paper, five glaciers from the Yangtze River headwater glacier were selected as the experimental subjects, and multi-source remote sensing images were used to study and analyze the surge behavior over the past 30 years. Based on the Landsat series data, ERS-2, and ENVISAT radar data, this paper extracts the glacier centerline information, glacial area information, and glacial flow velocity during different time periods from 1988 to 2018, which are used to monitor the active periods of glacier surges. We found three surge-type glaciers in the study area. The glacial characteristics of the three glaciers showed some drastic changes, they can advance quickly nearly 800 m in active periods, their area change can reach 2.0 x 10(6) m(2), and their flow velocity can suddenly increase by dozens of times. Surging periods and the initiated time of the three glaciers are different, which are locked in 1997, 2003, and 1997-1998. All those surges ended within one to two years. We suggest that the surges in this paper are dominated by hydrological conditions.

TI  - Extracting Taklimakan Dust Parameters from AIRS with Artificial Neural Network Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two back-propagation artificial neural network retrieval models have been developed for obtaining the dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust-top height (DTH), respectively, from Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) brightness temperature (BT) measurements over Taklimakan Desert area. China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) measurements at Tazhong station were used for dust AOD validation. Results show that the correlation coefficient of dust AODs between AIRS and CARSNET reaches 0.88 with a deviation of -0.21, which is the same correlation coefficient as the AIRS dust AOD and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product. In the AIRS DTH retrieval model, there is an option to include the collocated MODIS deep blue (DB) AOD as additional input for daytime retrieval; the independent dust heights from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) are used for AIRS DTH validation, and results show that the DTHs derived from the combined AIRS BT measurements and MODIS DB AOD product have better accuracy than those from AIRS BT measurements alone. The correlation coefficient of DTHs between AIRS and independent CALIOP dust heights is 0.79 with a standard deviation of 0.41 km when MODIS DB AOD product is included in the retrieval model. A series of case studies from different seasons were examined to demonstrate the feasibility of retrieving dust parameters from AIRS and potential applications. The method and approaches can be applied to process measurements from advanced infrared (IR) sounder and high-resolution imager onboard the same platform.

TI  - Building Extraction from Very High Resolution Aerial Imagery Using Joint Attention Deep Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated methods to extract buildings from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing data have many applications in a wide range of fields. Many convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been proposed and have achieved significant advances in the building extraction task. In order to refine predictions, a lot of recent approaches fuse features from earlier layers of CNNs to introduce abundant spatial information, which is known as skip connection. However, this strategy of reusing earlier features directly without processing could reduce the performance of the network. To address this problem, we propose a novel fully convolutional network (FCN) that adopts attention based re-weighting to extract buildings from aerial imagery. Specifically, we consider the semantic gap between features from different stages and leverage the attention mechanism to bridge the gap prior to the fusion of features. The inferred attention weights along spatial and channel-wise dimensions make the low level feature maps adaptive to high level feature maps in a target-oriented manner. Experimental results on three publicly available aerial imagery datasets show that the proposed model (RFA-UNet) achieves comparable and improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art models for building extraction.

TI  - Wildfire Detection Probability of MODIS Fire Products under the Constraint of Environmental Factors: A Study Based on Confirmed Ground Wildfire Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been widely used for wildfire occurrence and distribution detecting and fire risk assessments. Compared with its commission error, the omission error of MODIS wildfire detection has been revealed as a much more challenging, unsolved issue, and ground-level environmental factors influencing the detection capacity are also variable. This study compared the multiple MODIS fire products and the records of ground wildfire investigations during December 2002-November 2015 in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, in an attempt to reveal the difference in the spatiotemporal patterns of regional wildfire detected by the two approaches, to estimate the omission error of MODIS fire products based on confirmed ground wildfire records, and to explore how instantaneous and local environmental factors influenced the wildfire detection probability of MODIS. The results indicated that across the province, the total number of wildfire events recorded by MODIS was at least twice as many as that in the ground records, while the wildfire distribution patterns revealed by the two approaches were inconsistent. For the 5145 confirmed ground records, however, only 11.10% of them could be detected using multiple MODIS fire products (i.e., MOD14A1, MYD14A1, and MCD64A1). Opposing trends during the studied period were found between the yearly occurrence of ground-based wildfire records and the corresponding proportion detected by MODIS. Moreover, the wildfire detection proportion by MODIS was 11.36% in forest, 9.58% in shrubs, and 5.56% in grassland, respectively. Random forest modeling suggested that fire size was a primary limiting factor for MODIS fire detecting capacity, where a small fire size could likely result in MODIS omission errors at a threshold of 1 ha, while MODIS had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire whose size was at least 18 ha. Aside from fire size, the wildfire detection probability of MODIS was also markedly influenced by weather factors, especially the daily relative humidity and the daily wind speed, and the altitude of wildfire occurrence. Considering the environmental factors' contribution to the omission error in MODIS wildfire detection, we emphasized the importance of attention to the local conditions as well as ground inspection in practical wildfire monitoring and management and global wildfire simulations.

TI  - Filtering the NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light Data for Improved Detection of Settlements in Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing and understanding changes in Africa is a hotspot in global ecological environmental research since the early 1970s. As possible causes of environmental degradation, frequent droughts and human activities attracted wide attention. Remote sensing of nighttime light provides an effective way to map human activities and assess their intensity. To identify settlements more effectively, this study focused on nighttime light in the northern Equatorial Africa and Sahel settlements to propose a new method, namely, the patches filtering method (PFM) to identify nighttime lights related to settlements from the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) monthly nighttime light data by separating signal components induced by biomass burning, thereby generating a new annual image in 2016. The results show that PFM is useful for improving the quality of NPP-VIIRS monthly nighttime light data. Settlement lights were effectively separated from biomass burning lights, in addition to capturing the seasonality of biomass burning. We show that the new 2016 nighttime light image can very effectively identify even small settlements, notwithstanding their fragmentation and unstable power supply. We compared the image with earlier NPP-VIIRS annual nighttime light data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) for 2016 and the Sentinel-2 prototype Land Cover 20 m 2016 map of Africa released by the European Space Agency (ESA-S2-AFRICA-LC20). We found that the new annual nighttime light data performed best among the three datasets in capturing settlements, with a high recognition rate of 61.8%, and absolute superiority for settlements of 2.5 square kilometers or less. This shows that the method separates biomass burning signals very effectively, while retaining the relatively stable, although dim, lights of small settlements. The new 2016 annual image demonstrates good performance in identifying human settlements in sparsely populated areas toward a better understanding of human activities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Precipitation in the Sparsely Gauged Zambezi River Basin Using Remote Sensing and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation plays an important role in the food production of Southern Africa. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation is helpful for improving agricultural management and flood and drought risk assessment. However, a comprehensive precipitation pattern analysis is challenging in sparsely gauged and underdeveloped regions. To solve this problem, Version 7 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation products and Google Earth Engine (GEE) were adopted in this study for the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation in the Zambezi River Basin. The Kendall's correlation and sen's Slop reducers in GEE were used to examine precipitation trends and magnitude, respectively, at annual, seasonal and monthly scales from 1998 to 2017. The results reveal that 10% of the Zambezi River basin showed a significant decreasing trend of annual precipitation, while only 1% showed a significant increasing trend. The rainy-season precipitation appeared to have a dominant impact on the annual precipitation pattern. The rainy-season precipitation was found to have larger spatial, temporal and magnitude variation than the dry-season precipitation. In terms of monthly precipitation, June to September during the dry season were dominated by a significant decreasing trend. However, areas presenting a significant decreasing trend were rare (<12% of study area) and scattered during the rainy-season months (November to April of the subsequent year). Spatially, the highest and lowest rainfall regions were shifted by year, with extreme precipitation events (highest and lowest rainfall) occurring preferentially over the northwest side rather than the northeast area of the Zambezi River Basin. A "dry gets dryer, wet gets wetter" (DGDWGW) pattern was also observed over the study area, and a suggestion on agriculture management according to precipitation patterns is provided in this study for the region. This is the first study to use long-term remote sensing data and GEE for precipitation analysis at various temporal scales in the Zambezi River Basin. The methodology proposed in this study is helpful for the spatiotemporal analysis of precipitation in developing countries with scarce gauge stations, limited analytic skills and insufficient computation resources. The approaches of this study can also be operationally applied to the analysis of other climate variables, such as temperature and solar radiation.

TI  - Evaluation of Five Satellite Top-of-Atmosphere Albedo Products over Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Five satellite top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo products over land were evaluated in this study including global products from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (TAL-AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (TAL-MODIS), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES); one regional product from the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF); and one harmonized product termed Diagnosing Earth's Energy Pathways in the Climate system (DEEP-C). Results showed that overall, there is good consistency among these five products, particularly after the year 2000. The differences among these products in the high-latitude regions were relatively larger. The percentage differences among TAL-AVHRR, TAL-MODIS, and CERES were generally less than 20%, while the differences between TAL-AVHRR and DEEP-C before 2000 were much larger. Except for the obvious decrease in the differences after 2000, the differences did not show significant changes over time, but varied among different regions. The differences between TAL-AVHRR and the other products were relatively large in the high-latitude regions of North America, Asia, and the Maritime Continent, while the differences between DEEP-C and CM SAF in Europe and Africa were smaller. Interannual variability was consistent between products after 2000, before which the differences among the three products were much larger.

TI  - Surface Temperature Simulation of Lunar Dayside and Its Geological Applications: A Case in Sinus Iridum
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar surface temperature is one of the fundamental thermophysical parameters of the lunar regolith, which is of great significance to the interpretation of remote-sensing thermal data. In this study, a daytime surface temperature model is established focusing on the lunar superficial layer with high spatial-temporal resolution. The physical parameters at the time of interest are adopted, including effective solar irradiance, lunar libration, large-scale topographic shading, and surrounding diffuse reflection. Thereafter, the 1/64 degrees temperature distributions at five local times are quantitatively generated and analyzed in Sinus Iridum. Also, combined with Chang'E-2 microwave radiometer (CELMS) data and Diviner thermal infrared (TIR) data, the spectral emissivity distributions are estimated as a potential geological application of the simulated surface temperature. The results are as follows: (1) daytime surface temperature in Sinus Iridum is significantly affected by the local topography and observation time, and the influence of diffuse reflection energy is obvious; (2) the emissivity distributions provide a new way to understand the thermophysical properties difference of lunar regolith at different depths; (3) the influence of lunar orbiting revolution and precession on surface temperature should be analyzed carefully, which shows the importance of using the parameters at the time of interest.

TI  - Cloud Detection from FY-4A's Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FengYun-4A (FY-4A)'s Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is the first hyperspectral infrared sounder on board a geostationary satellite, enabling the collection of infrared detection data with high temporal and spectral resolution. As clouds have complex spectral characteristics, and the retrieval of atmospheric profiles incorporating clouds is a significant problem, it is often necessary to undertake cloud detection before further processing procedures for cloud pixels when infrared hyperspectral data is entered into assimilation system. In this study, we proposed machine-learning-based cloud detection models using two kinds of GIIRS channel observation sets (689 channels and 38 channels) as features. Due to differences in surface cover and meteorological elements between land and sea, we chose logistic regression (lr) model for the land and extremely randomized tree (et) model for the sea respectively. Six hundred and eighty-nine channels models produced slightly higher performance (Heidke skill score (HSS) of 0.780 and false alarm rate (FAR) of 16.6% on land, HSS of 0.945 and FAR of 4.7% at sea) than 38 channels models (HSSof 0.741 and FAR of 17.7% on land, HSS of 0.912 and FAR of 7.1% at sea). By comparing visualized cloud detection results with the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) cloud images, the proposed method has a good ability to identify clouds under circumstances such as typhoons, snow covered land, and bright broken clouds. In addition, compared with the collocated Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI)-GIIRS cloud detection method, the machine learning cloud detection method has a significant advantage in time cost. This method is not effective for the detection of partially cloudy GIIRS's field of views, and there are limitations in the scope of spatial application.

TI  - Improvement of Split-Window Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Sentinel-3A SLSTR Data Over Barren Surfaces Using ASTER GED Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable influencing the energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this work, a split-window algorithm was used to calculate LST from Sentinel-3A Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) thermal infrared data. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis atmospheric profiles combined with the radiation transport model MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission version 5.2 (MODTRAN 5.2) were utilized to obtain atmospheric water vapor content (WVC). The ASTER Global Emissivity Database Version 3 (ASTER GED v3) product was utilized to estimate surface emissivity in order to improve the accuracy of LST estimation over barren surfaces. Using a simulation database, the coefficients of the algorithm were fitted and the performance of the algorithm was evaluated. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of the differences between the estimated LST and the actual LST of the MODTRAN radiative transfer simulation at each WVC subrange of 0-6.5 g/cm(2) were less than 1.0 K. To validate the retrieval accuracy, ground-based LST measurements were collected at two relatively homogeneous desert study sites in Dalad Banner and Wuhai, Inner Mongolia, China. The bias between the retrieved LST and the in situ LST was about 0.2 K and the RMSE was about 1.3 K at the Dalad Banner site, whereas they were approximately -0.4 and 1.0 K at the Wuhai site. As a reference, the retrieved LST was compared with the operational SLSTR LST product in this study. The bias between the SLSTR LST product and the in situ LST was approximately 1 K and the RMSE was approximately 2 K at the Dalad Banner site, whereas they were approximately 1.1 and 1.4 K at the Wuhai site. The results demonstrate that the split-window algorithm combined with improved emissivity estimation based on the ASTER GED product can distinctly obtain better accuracy of LST over barren surfaces.

TI  - Finer Classification of Crops by Fusing UAV Images and Sentinel-2A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop distribution maps provide important information for crop censuses, yield monitoring and agricultural insurance assessments. Most existing studies apply low spatial resolution satellite images for crop distribution mapping, even in areas with a fragmented landscape. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provides an alternative imagery source for crop mapping, yet its spectral resolution is usually lower than satellite images. In order to produce more accurate maps without losing any spatial heterogeneity (e.g., the physical boundary of land parcel), this study fuses Sentinel-2A and UAV images to map crop distribution at a finer spatial scale (i.e., land parcel scale) in an experimental site with various cropping patterns in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China. Using a random forest algorithm, the original, as well as the fused images, are classified into 10 categories: rice, corn, soybean, buckwheat, other vegetations, greenhouses, bare land, water, roads and houses. In addition, we test the effect of UAV image choice by fusing Sentinel-2A with different UAV images at multiples spatial resolutions: 0.03 m, 0.10 m, 0.50 m, 1.00 m and 3.00 m. Overall, the fused images achieved higher classification accuracies, ranging between 10.58% and 16.39%, than the original images. However, the fused image based on the finest UAV image (i.e., 0.03 m) does not result in the highest accuracy. Instead, the 0.10 m spatial resolution UAV image produced the most accurate map. When the spatial resolution is less than 0.10 m, accuracy decreases gradually as spatial resolution decreases. The results of this paper not only indicate the possibility of combining satellite images and UAV images for land parcel level crop mapping for fragmented landscapes, but it also implies a potential scheme to exploit optimal choice of spatial resolution in fusing UAV images and Sentinel-2A, with little to no adverse side-effects.

TI  - A Specific Study on the Impacts of PM2.5 on Urban Heat Islands with Detailed In Situ Data and Satellite Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization often results in serious urban heat islands (UHI) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration. Previous studies found it was hard to evaluate the haze contribution to the UHI quantitatively, because of the complex properties of the atmosphere aloft and the irregular alteration of PM2.5 loads. Taking Beijing as the study site, where detailed in situ PM2.5 concentration data, canopy thermal data and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products were all available in 2015, this study investigated the impacts of PM2.5 on both surface UHI intensity (SUHII) and canopy UHI intensity (CUHII) at daytime and night. The results reveal that the CUHII are almost unchanged throughout the year, while SUHII varies greatly in both temporal axis and spatial distribution. PM2.5 concentration has significant negative impacts on mean SUHII (r = -0.6115) and daytime SUHII (r = -0.6164), and less significant negative impact on CUHII (r = -0.51999). However, the contribution of PM2.5 concentration to nighttime SUHI is not significant. This specific study checked and improved previous works on this topic, with detailed in situ data and satellite images. The results of this work can enhance our understanding of the dynamics and driving mechanism of urban thermal environment.

TI  - Mapping of Soil Total Nitrogen Content in the Middle Reaches of the Heihe River Basin in China Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing-Derived Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil total nitrogen (STN) is an important indicator of soil quality and plays a key role in global nitrogen cycling. Accurate prediction of STN content is essential for the sustainable use of soil resources. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a promising source of data for soil monitoring because of its all-weather, all-day monitoring, but it has rarely been used for STN mapping. In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN by evaluating and comparing the performance of boosted regression trees (BRTs), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models in STN mapping in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. Fifteen predictor variables were used to construct models, including land use/land cover, multi-source remote sensing-derived variables, and topographic and climatic variables. We evaluated the prediction accuracy of the models based on a cross-validation procedure. Results showed that tree-based models (RF and BRT) outperformed SVM. Compared to the model that only used optical data, the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data using the BRT method improved the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.2% and 17.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all predictor variables using the BRT model had the best predictive performance, explaining 57% of the variation in STN, with the highest R-2 (0.57) value and the lowest RMSE (0.24) and MAE (0.18) values. Remote sensing variables were the most important environmental variables for STN mapping, with 59% and 50% relative importance in the RF and BRT models, respectively. Our results show the potential of using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN, broadening the data source for future digital soil mapping. In addition, we propose that the SVM, RF, and BRT models should be calibrated and evaluated to obtain the best results for STN content mapping in similar landscapes.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Data: Prediction Ability of Data with Different Spatial and Spectral Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The image spectral data, particularly hyperspectral data, has been proven as an efficient data source for mapping of the spatial variability of soil organic carbon (SOC). Multispectral satellite data are readily available and cost-effective sources of spectral data compared to costly and technically demanding processing of hyperspectral data. Moreover, their continuous acquisition allows to develop a composite from time-series, increasing the spatial coverage of SOC maps. In this study, an evaluation of the prediction ability of models assessing SOC using real multispectral remote sensing data from different platforms was performed. The study was conducted on a study plot (1.45 km(2)) in the Chernozem region of South Moravia (Czechia). The adopted methods included field sampling and predictive modeling using satellite multispectral Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope data, and multispectral UAS Parrot Sequoia data. Furthermore, the performance of a soil reflectance composite image from Sentinel-2 data was analyzed. Aerial hyperspectral CASI 1500 and SASI 600 data was used as a reference. Random forest, support vector machine, and the cubist regression technique were applied in the predictive modeling. The prediction accuracy of models using multispectral data, including Sentinel-2 composite, was lower (RPD range from 1.16 to 1.65; RPIQ range from 1.53 to 2.17) compared to the reference model using hyperspectral data (RPD = 2.26; RPIQ = 3.34). The obtained results show very similar prediction accuracy for all spaceborne sensors (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope). However, the spatial correlation between the reference mapping results obtained from the hyperspectral data and other maps using multispectral data was moderately strong. UAS sensors and freely available satellite multispectral data can represent an alternative cost-effective data source for remote SOC mapping on the local scale.

TI  - Temporal detection and prediction of agricultural land consumption by urbanization using remote sensing
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The most fertile land in Egypt is under continuous loss by urbanization. In some countries, this could be considered normal, but in Egypt, it is a severe violation of the country's limited agricultural land. The main objectives of this research are to quantify the agricultural land consumption by urbanization and predict the future pattern of this process in some parts of Alexandria and El-Behiera governorates using the Landsat satellite images of 1987, 2001, 2015, and 2019. Image classification was performed using the Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique. Five land use/cover (LULC) types have been identified, which are agriculture, urban, gardens, the international road, and water. Classification results were further enhanced by employing post-classification and filtering processes which increased classification accuracy and minimized urban land use overestimation. Four LULC maps have been developed for 1987, 2001, 2015 and 2019. A post-classification comparison method was applied to detect the LULC changes among the independently classified images and quantify the loss of agricultural land by urbanization. Prediction of urban encroachment to agricultural land was performed by Land Change Modeler basing on both the past change trend of urbanization and the influencing distance-to-urban factor. The future LULC prediction maps for 2019, 2050, and 2100 have been generated. Prediction validity was applied using actual vs predicted LULC 2019 maps. The results indicated that the agricultural and urban categories are the prevailing LULC types in the investigated area. Over the last three decades significant loss in the agricultural land was observed together with remarkable growth in the urban area. The agricultural land was decreased by 11.03%, while the urban area was increased by 11.84%. The rate of agricultural land consumption by urbanization after 2001 was more remarkable than the rate before 2001. The results also indicated that the agricultural and urban land use categories have the highest possible probability of change. It is predicted that agricultural land will decrease by 11.5% and 24.5% in 2050 and 2100, respectively. Conversely, urban areas will increase by 12% and 25% in 2050 and 2100, respectively. This process will become the main feature of LULC change in the future, which means that the agricultural land could completely vanish within the next two hundred years at the current degree of agricultural land consumption by urbanization. The outcomes of this research could help policy makers to adopt appropriate strategies towards better management of LULC and increase the sustainability of the highly productive agricultural land through preventing violation on such valuable land.

TI  - Assessment of land degradation using comprehensive geostatistical approach and remote sensing data in GIS-model builder
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to assess Land Degradation (LD) status under different land use. Geostatistical technique used to interpolate spatially distribution of soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Salinity indices were applied on Hyperspectral and Multispectral Data to predict the salt affected areas. Arc GIS model-builder implemented to integrate the available LD methodologies and produce the overall degradation map of the study area in Chamrajanagar district (CDK), Karnataka, India. Remote sensing data was found to be useful tools to map land resources, especially in the areas where accessibility is limited like mountains. This study determined spatial distribution by calculating different soil properties for soils profiles. For LD calculations, eighteen soil profiles were dug and 79 samples were analyzed. This along with the parameters taken into consideration i.e., soil, slope, rainfall, DEM, land use, and land characteristics maps. It was found by adopting the logical criteria that LD of CDK categorized as very high, high, moderate, low and very low. The result of this research work could be potentially used as a useful tool to guide policy decision makers for sustainable land resource management in CKD. Based on the imagery interpretation and soil map unit description, hotspots were identified for representing different types of degraded soils. From the physical and chemical characteristics of pedons studied, it has been found that soils of CDK are exposed to degradation in the surface and sub surface horizons.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many archeological sites and cultural heritage in Iraq have suffered from disappearance as a result of climate factors and human interventions. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to interpret the dual-polarimetric ALOS image for the purpose of identifying the archeological remnants in the site of Tulul al-Ukhaidir. The results led to the identification of 21 potential sites, four of them in the right shoulder of Wadi Al-Abyadh (white valley), and 17 in the left shoulder. Nine sites were appeared as not covered and clearly visible after comparing them with the recent high-resolution image and the field observations, which were in the form of hills containing scattered stone remains, brick walls, and the remains of ancient archeological structures, whereas 12 sites nominated as potential archeological remains, which were completely covered with loose sand. 3D ground penetrating radar (GPR) investigation was performed in site P5 using a 250 MHz shielded antenna covering an area of 9 x 42.5 m, in order to verify the results of ALOS imagery and to characterize and depict the potential subsurface of the buried objects. The results of the GPR survey revealed a number of anomalies interpreted as demolished walls appeared on shallow depths begin approximately 0.15 to 0.3 m below surface, continue down to various depths, and have a width ranging from 0.5-5 m. One of the important anomalies that has been distinguished is the fence (sur) at a depth of about 0.2 m and it has a width reach of 7 m.

TI  - Highly sensitive detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer by digital PCR for RASSF1A methylation
T2  - ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) targeting cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA expression and pathological examination are widely used for the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel node (SN) metastasis. The aim of the present study was to develop a novel assay for detecting SN metastasis by targeting Ras association domain-containing protein 1 (RASSF1A) methylation in tumor cells, and to compare its performance with OSNA. Using digital PCR with methylation-specific restriction enzymes (RE-dMSP), our assay was able to detect >= 3 copies of methylated DNA per well, and was >= 10 times more sensitive than real-time PCR with bisulfite modification. OSNA lysates were examined using RE-dMSP and digital PCR for PIK3CA mutation, in the event that primary tumors were PIK3CA mutation-positive. RE-dMSP revealed a high concordance of 95.0% (153/161) with OSNA, and 100% (59/59) with PIK3CA mutation for detecting SN metastasis. In 11 breast cancer cell lines, the variation in methylated RASSF1A copy number was significantly lower than that of CK19 mRNA (2.8 vs. 10.5-fold; P<0.01). RE-dMSP has the potential to more accurately detect SN metastasis, and to more precisely estimate total tumor loads in SN, compared with OSNA.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Using Evidence Belief Function and Frequency Ratio Models in Taounate city (North of Morocco)
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of a suitable cartography of a well-identified geographical territory inevitably passes by reliefs drawn by the movements of ground. The most frequent of these movements are landslides such as the case of the Taounate city in the mountainous area of northern Morocco. The aim of the work is to develop a landslide susceptibility map of Taounate city based on the evidence belief function (EBF) and the frequency ratio (FR) Models. The landslide inventory map was prepared using interpretation of aerial photographs, satellite images and field visits. Twelve predisposition and release factors (slope, lithology, aspect, annual precipitation, elevation, curvature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, distance from rivers, and distance from roads, topographic wetness index (TWI), and surface roughness) are taken into account in this study to develop susceptibility maps. The validation of the resulting susceptibility maps was obtained by analyzing the area under the curve. The results of the validation showed that the combination of the predictive factors: terrain slope, terrain aspect, lithology, TWI and NDVI proved to be the best combination for both FR and EBF models and give values for the area under the curve equal to 98% (0.9779) and 87% (0.8712) respectively. These coefficients reflect the good degree of reliability of the models used.

T2  - ISRAEL STUDIES REVIEW

AB  - This article explores the opposition expressed by fans of the Beitar Jerusalem football club to the presence of Arab players on their team. I suggest that instead of suspecting that fans' behavior originates in false consciousness, we suspend suspicion and reconstruct the meanings they bring to their actions. Narrative analysis of fan interviews reveals the communitarian logic underlying their points of view. By appropriating sacred spheres in Judaism that demarcate the boundaries of the Jewish community, and identifying them with Beitar as opposed to signifying Arab players as defiling Beitar, fans delineate boundaries between Jews and Arabs. Through the sanctification of Beitar, the fans define Jewish collective boundaries and thereby preserve their worldview and identity while maintaining a hierarchy that grants Jews advantages in Israel.

TI  - Model Ensembles of Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression for Improved Accuracy in the Prediction of Vegetation Conditions and Droughts in Four Northern Kenya Counties
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - For improved drought planning and response, there is an increasing need for highly predictive and stable drought prediction models. This paper presents the performance of both homogeneous and heterogeneous model ensembles in the satellite-based prediction of drought severity using artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). For each of the homogeneous and heterogeneous model ensembles, the study investigates the performance of three model ensembling approaches: (1) non-weighted linear averaging, (2) ranked weighted averaging, and (3) model stacking using artificial neural networks. Using the approach of "over-produce then select", the study used 17 years of satellite data on 16 selected variables for predictive drought monitoring to build 244 individual ANN and SVR models from which 111 models were automatically selected for the building of the model ensembles. Model stacking is shown to realize models that are superior in performance in the prediction of future drought conditions as compared to the linear averaging and weighted averaging approaches. The best performance from the heterogeneous stacked model ensembles recorded an R-2 of 0.94 in the prediction of future (1 month ahead) vegetation conditions on unseen test data (2016-2017) as compared to an R-2 of 0.83 and R-2 of 0.78 for ANN and SVR, respectively, in the traditional approach of selection of the best (champion) model. We conclude that despite the computational resource intensiveness of the model ensembling approach, the returns in terms of model performance for drought prediction are worth the investment, especially in the context of the continued exponential increase in computational power and the potential benefits of improved forecasting for vulnerable populations.

TI  - Nonlinear Distribution Regression for Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many remote sensing applications, one wants to estimate variables or parameters of interest from observations. When the target variable is available at a resolution that matches the remote sensing observations, standard algorithms, such as neural networks, random forests, or the Gaussian processes, are readily available to relate the two. However, we often encounter situations where the target variable is only available at the group level, i.e., collectively associated with a number of remotely sensed observations. This problem setting is known in statistics and machine learning as multiple instance learning (MIL) or distribution regression (DR). This article introduces a nonlinear (kernel-based) method for DR that solves the previous problems without making any assumption on the statistics of the grouped data. The presented formulation considers distribution embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and performs standard least squares regression with the empirical means therein. A flexible version to deal with multisource data of different dimensionality and sample sizes is also presented and evaluated. It allows working with the native spatial resolution of each sensor, avoiding the need for matchup procedures. Noting the large computational cost of the approach, we introduce an efficient version via random Fourier features to cope with millions of points and groups. Real experiments involve the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) vegetation optical depth (VOD) data for the estimation of crop production in the U.S. Corn Belt and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) reflectances for the estimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD). An exhaustive empirical evaluation of the method is done against naive (linear and nonlinear) approaches based on input-space means as well as previously presented methods for MIL. We provide source code of our methods in http://isp.uv.es/code/dr.html.

TI  - Flood inundation mapping and monitoring using SAR data and its impact on Ramganga River in Ganga basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based flood inundation mapping and monitoring is very crucial input before, during, and after floods. Ganga-Ramganga doab is one of the prolonged flood-affected area in middle Ganga plain due to seasonal monsoon which leads to rise in water levels of Ganga and Ramganga rivers. The focus of the present study is to map severe flood condition captured through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data during August-September 2018, and to explain the impact on Ramganga river morphology. SAR data is preferred for flood mapping and real-time monitoring in all weather conditions. In this study, dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 SAR images coupled with hydrological data (river water level) were used to produce flood inundation maps. Thresholding technique has been applied to determine the flood mapping through Sentinel-1 data. VH and VV polarisation methods have been applied for a comparison of their respective accuracies in delineating surface water. Results have been validated against a Sentinel-2 optical image, and both polarisations produced a total accuracy of more than 93%. VV polarisation has high accuracies than VH polarisation as similar results are observed in previous studies as well. The finding reveals that severe bank erosion took place in the Ramganga channel which significantly affected the channel morphology, mainly the massive mobilisation of channel sediments. The results show that the average channel width increased from 46 to 336 m. The proposed approach demonstrates that the microwave remote sensing data along with GIS can be used efficiently for flood inundation mapping, monitoring, and analysing its effect on channel morphology. Therefore, the results of this study will help to take the initiative to reduce the flood hazard impact in the doab area and increase the flexibility in the process of flood management.

TI  - TREE DISTRIBUTION PATTERN, GROWING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS AND CARBON MITIGATION POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT FORESTS ECOSYSTEMS IN KUMRAT, HINDUKUSH REGION OF NORTHERN PAKISTAN
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using ground inventory and remotely sensed data, this study explored the tree distribution pattern, growing stock characteristics and carbon mitigation potential of different forests of the Hindukush region in Kumrat valley, of northern Pakistan. The results showed that forestland covered an area of 51.13% of the valley. Stem density varied between 243 +/- 55 to 585 +/- 221 ha(-1). Tree height was found in the range of 3 m and 49.85 m among the different forests. The regression analysis between stem density and diameter showed a week correlation in Cedrus deodara (CD) and Abies pindrow forest (AP), but showed positive correlation in Pinus wallichiana (PW), mixed coniferous (MC), and open forest (OF). Tree basal area and stem volume ranged from 343.45 +/- 210.68 to 159.64 +/- 58.41 m(2) ha(-1) and 343.45 +/- 210.68 to 2160.4 +/- 974.91 m(3) ha(-1) respectively. The range of calculated tree biomass was between 244.06 +/- 153.25 and 1499.5 +/- 627.74 Mg C ha(-1).The carbon values varied between 122.03 +/- 76.62 and 749.69 +/- 313.85 Mg C ha(-1). The results showed that among the different forests, CD had the highest carbon mitigation potential and OF had the lowest carbon mitigation potential. Furthermore, our results showed that the values of stem volume, total tree biomass and carbon in each forest were highly correlated with the basal area. Additionally, our fmdings provide evidence that basal area is the best predictor of biomass carbon estimation in each forest that suggests the use of the basal area for biomass carbon estimation. This approach could considerably reduce both, financial and physical efforts in carbon inventory regarding the field data collection particularly over the extensive tract of underrepresented carbon forests in Pakistan.

TI  - Environmental Study of Water Reservoirs for the Watershed Management in Pakistan
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water reservoirs in most parts of the world face the problem of sedimentation. Environmental impacts and land-use changes/landslide have enormous potential to generate more sediment load in water reservoirs. Hence, the capacity of water reservoirs in Pakistan has been constantly reducing due to sedimentation. In this study, we have computed the environmental impacts on sedimentation load in Tarbela and Mangla water reservoirs using multi-satellite and ground-based data. The total drainage area of watershed is calculated using Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission data. Satellite data from NOAA-AVHRR are used to monitor urban development and changes in vegetation area, while MODIS data are used to estimate the snow area in the watershed region. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is used to estimate the temporal changes in vegetation cover, whilst principle component analysis is applied to monitor urban changes in watershed region. Similarly, snow cover area in the study region is estimated using Normalized Difference Snow Index algorithm. Rainfall data obtained from Pakistan Meteorological Department are used to evaluate the relationship between sedimentation deposited in water reservoirs and annual rainfall amount. Results of the current study reveal that increase in urban development and high amount of precipitation has direct relationship with the load of sedimentation, while amount of vegetation has inverse relationship with the load of sedimentation in water reservoirs of the country.

TI  - Usefulness of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging with a dedicated axillary sequence for the detection of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with early ductal breast cancer
T2  - RADIOLOGIA MEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Axillary staging of primary breast cancer is important; however, axillary staging using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques is very difficult to use. Therefore, we want to evaluate the diagnostic performance of preoperative MRI with a dedicated axillary sequence for axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in patients with early ductal breast cancer and determine potential predictors of axillary nodal positivity. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed the MRI findings for 74 consecutive patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. The diagnostic performances of axial images alone and axial + reconstructed coronal images for the detection of ALN metastasis were evaluated. The clinicopathological and MRI features of the primary breast cancer lesions were determined. Results The sensitivity (52.9% vs. 47.1%), specificity (89.5% vs. 71.9%), positive predictive value (60% vs. 33.3%), and negative predictive value (86.4% vs. 82%) for the preoperative detection of ALN metastasis were higher for axial + coronal images than for axial images. In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value was higher for axial + coronal images than for axial images (0.595 vs. 0.712, p = 0.043). Peritumoral high signal intensity on T2-weighted images (p = 0.015) of the primary tumor was significantly associated with ALN metastasis. Conclusion Our findings suggest that preoperative axial + reconstructed coronal MR images exhibit good diagnostic performance for ALN metastasis in patients with early ductal breast cancer. In addition, peritumoral high signal intensity on T2-weighted images of the primary tumor can be used as a predictor of ALN metastasis in these patients.

TI  - Multi-Scale Rotation-Invariant Haar-Like Feature Integrated CNN-Based Ship Detection Algorithm of Multiple-Target Environment in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a multi-scale rotation-invariant haar-like (MSRI-HL) feature integrated convolutional neural network (MSRIHL-CNN)-based ship detection algorithm of the multiple-target environment in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Usually, ship detection includes preprocessing, prescreening, discrimination, and classification. Among them, prescreening and discrimination are the most two important stages so that they catch great intention. Based on our previous work, we propose a truncated-clutter-statistics-based joint, constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector (TCS-JCFAR) for ship target prescreening in the multiple-target environment. TCS-JCFAR greatly enhances the prescreening rate in the multiple-target environment while achieving a low observed FAR. In the discrimination stage, conventional CNN extracts the deep features (high-level features); however, it will lose the local texture and edge information (low-level features) which are of great significance for target discrimination. Hence, the MSRI-HL features are used to represent the multi-scale, rotation-invariant texture, and edge information that conventional CNN fails to capture. The extracted low-level MSRI-HL features and the high-level deep features are optimally fused to a multi-layered feature vector. Finally, the multi-layered feature vector is fed into a typical support vector machine (SVM) classifier for ship target discrimination. The proposed MSRIHL-CNN combines the low-level texture and edge features and the high-level deep features; moreover, they are optimally fused to fully represent the ship targets. Undoubtedly, MSRIHL-CNN has better discrimination performance. The superiority of the proposed TCS-JCFAR-based prescreener and MSRIHL-CNN-based discriminator is validated on the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagery.

TI  - Modelling fire hazard in the southern Mediterranean fire rim (Bejaia region, northern Algeria)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern rim of the Mediterranean Basin (MB) has a long fire history but fire hazard is poorly investigated in comparison to the northern rim. We built a fire database using MODIS data (2001-2015) for an area typical of the northern coastal Algeria (Bejaia region) in order to decipher the role of environmental and anthropic controls on the fire frequency and the area burnt. We found a high role of bioclimate, which controls the fuel dryness, ignitability, and biomass. Maximal fire frequency and burnt areas were recorded in northern sub-humid areas with high amounts of forests and shrublands, and fire was limited in the southern sub-arid area. Humans set most fires, and preferentially burn forests, shrublands, pastures, groves, and agricultural lands. The maximal fire frequency and burnt area occurs in wildland urban interfaces characterized by forest-shrublands mosaics with disseminated habitats. Fire activity is low to medium in rural-urban interfaces characterized by agropastoral areas with high habitat density and large habitat patches. Small to large crown fires occur in forests and shrublands, while small surface fires predominate in agropastoral areas and groves. Large fires (> 100 ha) are rare (10%) but contribute for ca. 50% to the total area burnt. These fire features are typical of many rural countries of the southern rim of the MB, and contrast with those on the northern rim. Based on this, we propose to improve the prevention, the detection, and the management of forest fires in the long term and to protect forests that host high biodiversity in Algeria.

TI  - Land cover change effects on land surface temperature trends in an African urbanizing dryland region
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) association with land surface temperature (LST) is well known. Knowledge about land change effects on LST in urbanizing African drylands is very limited. We examined LST and vegetation variations in semi-arid Gaborone (Botswana's capital) using MODIS daytime and night-time LST (DNLST), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2018. Significant land transitions were identified in the land cover change map using Change Vector Analysis of Landsat-based biophysical indices of vegetation, water and bare soil. Artificial surface and tree-covered areas were net gaining categories, whereas cropland and grassland were net losing categories. Detailed profiling of DNLST trends and breakpoints was conducted in five relatively homogenous sites representing land cover/transitions. Increasing NDVI and DNLST trends found were significant. Per class, LST change at daytime and night-time are as follows: built-up areas (1.8 K, 2.2 K), Gaborone dam (5.7 K, 0.2 K), settlement expansion areas (4.6 K, 2.2 K), and rural settlement (2.0 K, 1.5 K). The cooling effect of irrigation on daytime LST was higher than night-time LST as daytime LST trend as low as -0.4 K was found in areas of irrigated croplands. Validation with synoptic station temperature data and dam water levels provides empirical evidence that MODIS gave credible DNLST estimates in this urbanizing dryland area. Our results also suggest the role of climate variability in urbanizing drylands alongside land cover change in controlling the LST. Regardless, coupling DNLST and land cover changes can provide useful information for spatial planning of drylands to create smart cities that are resilient to climate change.

TI  - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators reduce the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis among adult patients with pancreas sufficient cystic fibrosis
T2  - PANCREATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Approximately 1 in 5 patients with pancreas sufficient cystic fibrosis (PS-CF) will develop acute pancreatitis (AP). It is not known whether ivacaftor alone or in combination with other CFTR (cystic transmembrane regulator) modulators (tezacaftor or lumacaftor) can reduce the risk of AP in patients with PS-CF and AP history.Methods: We retrospectively queried the CF registry at our institution for adult patients with PS-CF, a documented history of AP and initiation of CFTR modulators for pulmonary indications. Patient characteristics including demographics, CFTR genotype, pancreatitis risk factors, pancreatic exocrine function and other relevant laboratory, imaging parameters were obtained from the time of the sentinel AP episode through the follow-up period.Results: A total of 15 adult CF patients were identified with mean age of 44.1 years (SD +/- 13.8). In the 24 months preceding CFTR modulator initiation, six of these patients had at least 1 episode of AP with median of 2 episodes [1.75, 2.5]. None of the patients had evidence of pancreatic calcifications or exocrine pancreas insufficiency at the time of CFTR modulator initiation. The mean duration of follow-up after CFTR modulator initiation was 36.7 months (SD +/- 21.5). None of the patients who remained on CFTR modulators developed an episode of AP or required hospitalization for AP related abdominal pain during follow-up.Conclusions: CFTR modulators, alone or in combination, substantially reduce the risk of recurrent AP over a mean follow-up period of 3 years in adult patients with PS-CF and a history of prior AP. These data suggest that any augmentation of CFTR function can reduce the risk of pancreatitis. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IAP and EPC.

TI  - Off-Road Vehicle Tracks and Grazing Points in Relation to Soil Compaction and Land Degradation
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land degradation in Kuwait presents into two main forms, namely, soil compaction and loss to native plants. These two forms of land degradation are highly related to off-road vehicle tracks and grazing points. Therefore, the off-road vehicle tracks and grazing points were delineated for the first time within all Kuwait using Worldview and Rapid Eye images 2017 and ArcGIS. There is 871,811 grazing livestock (sheep, goats, and camels) spread into 2473 grazing points was detected in Kuwait open desert in 2017. There are around 354 as average livestock in each grazing point. The total length for off-road vehicle tracks is 14,774.7 km spread over Kuwait which is equivalent to 1.16 times more than the length of the planet earth mean diameter. The off-road vehicle tracks and grazing points are a leading cause for land degradation and soil compaction in Kuwait. Aeolian activities were monitored for 1 year at downwind of an off-road vehicle track at 10 m, 50 m, and 200 m. The results show more quantities of mobile sand, and dust was trapped at 10 and 50 m compared with the 200 m distance from off-road vehicle track. Consequently, the total area affected by soil compaction due to off-road vehicle tracks and grazing points in Kuwait is 1390.23 km(2) representing 7.8% of the total area of Kuwait. It is concluded that grazing points and off-road vehicle tracks are highly related to each other, and both are jumped to higher densities around the urban area and watering points. As a result, it is strongly recommended to develop a national action plan to control off-road vehicle tracks and grazing points by putting into practice a proper rangeland management plan in Kuwait. Steps of the action plan were outlined for this study.

TI  - Vineyard zoning of <i>cv</i> Bonarda argentine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), from Sentinel satellite images and three vegetation indexes
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the results and conclusions obtained from vineyard zoning in Mendoza by using three vegetation indexes (NDVI, EVI and SAVI). Such indexes were calculated from spectral signals received by the Sentinel-2A satellite in the days close to the 2017 harvest. With this information, maps from the plot of land with the zoning given by each index were obtained. Based on the NDVI zoning, a stratified sampling was carried out. On each stratum, 14 plants were marked and the production variables total weight of grape per plant, number of grape bunchs per plant and the weight of 50 berries were measured. The results showed that NDVI and SAVI led to similar classifications in terms of vineyard zones (strata), while EVI captures high vigor levels with less sensitivity. There was a correspondence between the production variables and the strata of high, medium and low vigor. The three indexes clearly showed two different vineyard areas in terms of production. Consequently, these indexes may contribute to rationalize viticulture practices, adjusting the intensity of such practices to the characteristics and needs of each of these vineyard areas.

TI  - RUSINIAN WORLDVIEW IN VASTLY PETROVAJ'S LITERARY DISCOURSE
T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the linguocultural interpretation of the Rusinian picture of the world Vasily Petrovaj's Rusins (1994). The authors attempt to identify the life-meaning dominant of the people's spiritual life in the picture of the Rusinian world created by the writer. The heroes of the novel demonstrate a religious perception of the world; however, their religiosity is not limited to just going to church, but permeates all their ethnocultural consciousness. The concept "Faith" is represented in their lexicon by numerous lexical and paremiic representatives. The linguoculturological analysis of the novel allows: a) interpreting the originality of Rusinian collegiality; b) decoding the main "mythoritual" traditions of Rusins; c) analyzing folk poetry semiotics, ritual motifs,and other elements of Rusinian world poetisation to identify and comprehend a distinctive ethnocultural code that is found, although sometimes implicitly, in popular superstitions and pesant family structure.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Internal Waves on Satellite Images and Estimates of the Mixed Layer Density
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents an automatic algorithm for detecting internal waves (IWs) using the visible channel images of the MODIS radiometer. The algorithm is based on the local Hough transform. The sources of detection errors and the possibility of excluding false detections are considered. If a train of IWs is detected, it is possible to estimate the wavenumber. The wavelength in the images used in our experiments is within the range 1300-2200 m. The speed of IWs is estimated using two adjacent passes of the Aqua and Terra satellites. The speed and wavenumber are used for estimating the density characteristics of the mixed layer in a two-layer model with constant density. The estimated density difference between the layers based on satellite data is in a good agreement with the in situ data.

TI  - Suspended-Matter Distribution Near the Western Coast of Crimea under the Impact of Strong Winds of Various Directions
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we study the mechanisms of the formation and distribution of suspended matter (SM) near the western coast of Crimea under the impact of strong winds of various directions using medium- and high-resolution satellite data. The SM concentration was noted to reach its maximal values at southern winds, reaching values of 200 mg/L. The zone of high SM concentration is located in the region of the western shelf of Crimea and is limited to an isobath of 50 m. The wave action during the south wind contributes to the resuspension of bottom sediments and the destruction of clay cliffs on the western coast of Crimea. After the storm, a northern coastal current arises that transfers the SM to the north. In northeastern winds, the highest SM concentrations are observed not on the coast, but in the sea part of the shelf between isobaths of 30 and 50 m. Such winds are likely to resuspend sediments in shallow water, which are then driven away from the coast by the action of wind driving. They are replaced by clean, cold waters from the deeper layers that are observed near the coast. The feature of northern and northwestern storms impact is the formation of a coastal jet current along the west coast. The current occurs in the frontal upwelling zone and carries the SM south to the deep sea. The SM concentration in this case is also significantly lower than during southern winds, although it can reach 3 mg/L.

TI  - Cyanobacteria Bloom in the Azov Sea According to Landsat Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we studied the spatial and temporal characteristics of cyanobacteria bloom in the Azov Sea based on data from Landsat satellites sensors for 1999-2016. The strongest blooms were observed in 1999 and 2006-2009, when cyanobacteria occupied the entire central part of the Azov Sea. The maximal blooming in these years was in August-September. In 2006, cyanobacteria penetrated from the Azov Sea into the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait. The longest and most extensive cyanobacteria blooming is recorded in the Taganrog Bay, which is associated with its shallow water and the nutrient supply from the Don River. Here, blooms are observed from February to November. Local maximums of cyanobacteria accumulation are observed along the eastern coast of the Azov Sea, near the mouth of the Kuban and Protoka rivers, in the Akhtarsky estuary and in the Temryuk Bay. They are most rarely found near the northwest coast. The data from the Landsat series satellites sensors show that cyanobacteria spread from the Taganrog Bay to the south or west in summer. From the mouth of the Kuban River, cyanobacteria move north. An analysis of numerical calculations using the Nemo model showed that this distribution is associated with northern currents that occur in the southern part of the sea in summer due to the impact of river discharge. Maps of the probability distribution of the cyanobacteria observation were obtained and estimates of the seasonal variation of the area covered by cyanobacteria blooming were given according to the data from the Landsat series satellites sensors. In the Azov Sea, maximal blooming is observed in July-August and minimal blooming is observed in winter, from November to February.

TI  - Assessing Riyadh's Urban Change Utilizing High-Resolution Imagery
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The implications of change on local processes have attracted significant research interest in recent times. In urban settings, green spaces and forests have attracted much attention. Here, we present an assessment of change within the predominantly desert Middle Eastern city of Riyadh, an understudied setting. We utilized high-resolution SPOT 5 data and two classification techniques-maximum likelihood classification and object-oriented classification-to study the changes in Riyadh between 2004 and 2014. Imagery classification was completed with training data obtained from the SPOT 5 dataset, and an accuracy assessment was completed through a combination of field surveys and an application developed in ESRI Survey 123 tool. The Survey 123 tool allowed residents of Riyadh to present their views on land cover for the 2004 and 2014 imagery. Our analysis showed that soil or 'desert' areas were converted to roads and buildings to accommodate for Riyadh's rapidly growing population. The object-oriented classifier provided higher overall accuracy than the maximum likelihood classifier (74.71% and 73.79% vs. 92.36% and 90.77% for 2004 and 2014). Our work provides insights into the changes within a desert environment and establishes a foundation for understanding change in this understudied setting.

TI  - Analysis of AOD from MODIS-Merged DT-DB Products Over the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based aerosol estimation has attracted immense scientific attention in a multiplicity of applications related to global warming, climate change, and air pollution research globally. Numerous aerosols from widespread deserts across the Arabian Peninsula have a significant function in the regional climate and air quality. The aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of aerosols over the Arabian Peninsula for the period 2003-2017. For this, the study uses the Terra and Aqua Satellite on-board Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Merged Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) collection of six aerosol products (550 nm). The study also uses the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived AOD to evaluate MODIS-Merged DT-DB AOD across the peninsula. A linear regression technique, root mean square error, mean absolute error, relative mean bias (RMB), and EE envelope (expected error) methods are used to calculate the uncertainty in the MODIS-merged DT-DB AOD products. The results of the spatial distribution show that Terra demonstrates the highest AOD over the southern Red Sea and the west coast of the Arabian Gulf that extends up to central Saudi Arabia. However, the Aqua displays the highest AOD mostly over the southern Red Sea. AOD is increasing annually at Kuwait University, Dhabi, and Hamim stations while decreasing at KAUST and Masdar-Institute. The Solar Village (for Aqua) shows a slightly increasing trend), Dhadnah, and Mezaira showing an almost a stable condition. Aqua has the better retrievals of AOD, which fall within EE envelope (similar to 6087%) for seven stations, whereas the Terra shows better AOD retrieval only for Dhabi (EE=similar to 81%). However, RMB reveals the correct information that the merged AOD product overestimates at all stations for both satellites, while the Aqua underestimates for the Solar Village, Kuwait University, and Dhadnah. This under- and overestimation is due to the defective surface reflectance computation and inaccurate use of aerosol model schemes in the Look-Up Table. Further qualitative research is recommended to enhance the aerosol retrieval efficiency of the DB and DT algorithms over the bright-reflecting surface.

TI  - Deriving the Reservoir Conditions for Better Water Resource Management Using Satellite-Based Earth Observations in the Lower Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong River basin supported a large population and ecosystem with abundant water and nutrient supply. However, the impoundments in the river can substantially alter the flow downstream and its timing. Using limited observations, this study demonstrated an approach to derive dam characteristics, including storage and flow rate, from remote-sensing-based data. Global Reservoir and Lake Monitor (GRLM), River-Lake Hydrology (RLH), and ICESat-GLAS, which generated altimetry from Jason series and inundation areas from Landsat 8, were used to estimate the reservoir surface area and change in storage over time. The inflow simulated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model from 2008 to 2016 and the reservoir storage change were used in the mass balance equation to calculate outflows for three dams in the basin. Estimated reservoir total storage closely resembled the observed data, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination more than 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. An average decrease of 55% in outflows was estimated during the wet season and an increase of up to 94% in the dry season for the Lam Pao. The estimated decrease in outflows during the wet season was 70% and 60% for Sirindhorn and Ubol Ratana, respectively, along with a 36% increase in the dry season for Sirindhorn. Basin-wide demand for evapotranspiration, about 935 mm, implicitly matched with the annual water diversion from 1000 to 2300 million m(3). From the storage-discharge rating curves, minimum storage was also evident in the monsoon season (June-July), and it reached the highest in November. This study demonstrated the utility of remote sensing products to assess the impacts of dams on flows in the Mekong River basin.

TI  - Automatic Shoreline Detection from Eight-Band VHR Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion, which is naturally present in many areas of the world, can be significantly increased by factors such as the reduced transport of sediments as a result of hydraulic works carried out to minimize flooding. Erosion has a significant impact on both marine ecosystems and human activities; for this reason, several international projects have been developed to study monitoring techniques and propose operational methodologies. The increasing number of available high-resolution satellite platforms (i.e., Copernicus Sentinel) and algorithms to treat them allows the study of original approaches for the monitoring of the land in general and for the study of the coastline in particular. The present project aims to define a methodology for identifying the instantaneous shoreline, through images acquired from the WorldView 2 satellite, on eight spectral bands, with a geometric resolution of 0.5 m for the panchromatic image and 1.8 m for the multispectral one. A pixel-based classification methodology is used to identify the various types of land cover and to make combinations between the eight available bands. The experiments were carried out on a coastal area with contrasting morphologies. The eight bands in which the images are taken produce good results both in the classification process and in the combination of the bands, through the algorithms of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and matched filtering (MF), with regard to the identification of the various soil coverings and, in particular, the separation line between dry and wet sand. In addition, the real applicability of an algorithm that extracts bathymetry in shallow water using the "coastal blue" band was tested. These data refer to the instantaneous shoreline and could be corrected in the future with morphological and tidal data of the coastal areas under study.

TI  - Understanding Implementation of a Digital Self-Monitoring Intervention for Relapse Prevention in Psychosis: Protocol for a Mixed Method Process Evaluation
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Relapse is common in people who experience psychosis and is associated with many negative consequences, both societal and personal. People who relapse often exhibit changes (early warning signs [EWS]) in the period before relapse. Successful identification of EWS offers an opportunity for relapse prevention. However, several known barriers impede the use of EWS monitoring approaches. Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) is a complex digital intervention that uses a mobile app to enhance the detection and management of self-reported changes in well-being. This is currently being tested in a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial. As digital interventions have not been widely used in relapse prevention, little is known about their implementation. Process evaluation studies run in parallel to clinical trials can provide valuable data on intervention feasibility.Objective: This study aims to transparently describe the protocol for the process evaluation element of the EMPOWER trial. We will focus on the development of a process evaluation framework sensitive to the worldview of service users, mental health staff, and carers; the aims of the process evaluation itself; the proposed studies to address these aims; and a plan for integration of results from separate process evaluation studies into one overall report.Methods: The overall process evaluation will utilize mixed methods across 6 substudies. Among them, 4 will use qualitative methodologies, 1 will use a mixed methods approach, and 1 will use quantitative methodologies.Results: The results of all studies will be triangulated into an overall analysis and interpretation of key implementation lessons. EMPOWER was funded in 2016, recruitment finished in January 2018. Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in December 2019.Conclusions: The findings from this study will help identify implementation facilitators and barriers to EMPOWER. These insights will inform both upscaling decisions and optimization of a definitive trial.

TI  - Improving cover and management factor (C-factor) estimation using remote sensing approaches for tropical regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE)'s cover and management factor (C-factor) is one of the most difficult factors to obtain, mainly because long-term monitoring soil erosion plots under natural rainfall are needed. Therefore, remote sensing approaches have been used as an alternative for obtaining this factor. However, there is a lack of studies comparing values of this factor computed from remote sensing approaches with measured data. In this study, we compare two widely used remote sensing approaches (C-rA and C-VK) to estimate the C-factor based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with the literature (C-LIT) and field experimental data. We also investigated the influence of C-factor methods on the prediction of soil loss and sediment yield (SY) using measured data in the Guariroba basin, Central-West Brazil. We obtained mean C-factor values of 0.032, 0.023 and 0.137 for C-LIT, C-rA and C-VK, respectively. We found an average annual soil loss of 2.20 t ha(-1) yr(-1), 2.02 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 10.07 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and SY values of 6875 t yr(-1), 6468 t yr(-1) and 33,435 t yr(1), for C-LIT, C-rA and C-VK, respectively. Our results indicated a significant improvement in soil loss and SY estimations by using the C-rA approach developed for tropical regions, with a bias of 13% to the measured SY (5709 t yr(-1)). We conclude that the C-rA method present the most suitable alternative to compute soil loss and SY in tropical regions. Furthermore, this approach allows large-scale evaluation and temporal monitoring, therefore enhancing multi spatial and temporal assessment of soil erosion processes.

TI  - Control Deprivation Decreases, Not Increases, Belief in a Controlling God for People with Independent Self-Construal
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Compensatory Control Model suggests that, when deprived of personal control, people compensate this lack by bolstering their belief in a controlling God. However, this is not the only way of reacting to control deprivation as past literature also depicted that people sometimes become motivated to restore their personal control. We argued that people with highly independent self-construal would not be comfortable with enhancing external control in the absence of a personal one. We conducted an online experiment (N = 246) and the results indicated that control deprivation actually decreased, not increased, belief in a controlling God for people with independent self-construal. Such finding suggested that not everyone compensates for the lack of personal control by enhancing external control. Implications of the findings and potential limitations were discussed.

TI  - Evaluating the use of satellite observations to supplement ground-level air quality data in selected cities in low- and middle-income countries
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using data from ground-level measurements, this work evaluates the performance of one chemical transport model (CTM)-based approach using MERRA2 model output and one statistical approach using a generalized additive model to translate remotely-sensed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements from the MODIS combined Deep Blue and Dark Target algorithm to surface-level PM2.5 concentrations for nine cities in low and middle-income countries that include a range of environmental conditions (e.g., mountainous, dusty, or coastal conditions) and only have between 1 and 10 ground level monitoring sites available. This evaluation shows that the CTM-based and statistical approaches tested here generally had a low correlation with the true daily-average PM(2.5 )values within these nine cities, in contrast to previous studies that had showed stronger correlations over other regions. In addition, the uncertainty in the satellite-based estimates of the daily-average PM2.5 concentration at a given location in a city tended to be very large (21-77% for the statistical methods, and 48-85% for the CTM-based methods). Many cities also had significant limitations in the availability of satellite observations of aerosols throughout the year due to their coastal location, persistent clouds, or persistent seasonal snow cover. The satellite-based methods tested in this work appear to work best for low altitude, inland cities like Hanoi and Delhi, but still have significant errors (43-60%) in predictions of daily-average PM2.5 concentrations at sites within these cities. The CTM-based satellite approach tested here tended to underestimate PM2.5 in high-altitude cities (except for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they overestimate). However, this work suggests that under some conditions, adding satellite data to ground-level monitoring (GLM) network data via co-kriging may reduce the number of GLM sites needed to characterize PM2.5 concentrations within a city, but this needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. This evaluation is then used to make recommendations to countries with sparse GLM networks on how to Incorporate the use of satellite observations in their PM2.5 monitoring and under what conditions satellite approaches are likely to be unsuccessful.

TI  - Application of TRMM Precipitation Data to Evaluate Drought and Its Effects on Water Resources Instability
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research was carried out to study drought and its effects upon water resources using remote sensing data. To this end, the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation, the synoptic stations, and fountain discharge data were employed. For monitoring of drought in the study area, in Kermanshah province, Iran, the monthly precipitation data of the synoptic stations along with TRMM satellite precipitation datasets were collected and processed in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. Statistical indicators were applied to evaluate the accuracy of TRMM precipitation against the meteorological stations' data. Standardized precipitation index, SPI, and normalized fountain discharge were used in the monitoring of drought conditions, and fountains discharge, respectively. The fountains were selected so that in addition to enjoying the most discharge rates, they spread along the study area. The evaluation of precipitation data showed that the TRMM precipitation data were of high accuracy. Studies in temporal scale are indicative of the strike of drought in this region to the effect that for most months of the year, frequency and duration in dry periods are much more than in wet periods. As for seasonal scales, apart from winter, the frequency and duration of drought in spring and autumn have been longer than in wet years. Moreover, the duration of these periods was different. A comparison between the results of changes in fountain discharges and drought index in the region has verified that the drought has caused a remarkable decline in the fountain discharges.

TI  - Rapid urbanization and associated impacts on land surface temperature changes over Bhubaneswar Urban District, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban settlements are the socio-economic drivers of human community. However, rapid urban expansion during recent times has a profound effect on regional as well as global rise in temperatures. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor and quantify the expansion of urban built-up area and assess its effects on regional heating. Landsat-derived Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps have shown a very rapid urbanization in Bhubaneswar, a tier-2 city and the capital of Odisha in the eastern part of India, almost doubling over the last 15 years. Our study on the effects of urbanization reveals that during the period of 2003-2017, the built-up area in the urban district of Bhubaneswar has increased by about 77% at the cost of natural vegetative cover and agricultural/fallow land. This affects the behavior of several climate variables over the urban centers with a clear distinction in these variables observed between the urban and surrounding rural settlements. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from the thermal bands of Landsat satellites at a spatial resolution of 30 m is used for the analysis over the area of interest. The Bhubaneswar airport (urban reference) has shown an increase in mean summer LST by 8% over the study period of 15 years, and 9.84% in LST in the last 5 years from 2013 to 2017 alone. From the present study, it is inferred that it is essential to adopt a sustainable approach for any urban growth to restrain its effect on urban temperature rise.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of desalinated waters from the Amur Estuary in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk during the summer period is analyzed using satellite data on the sea surface height (SSH), sea surface salinity (SSS), temperature, and concentrations of particulate organic carbon. There is a good agreement between the spatial distributions of SSS (data from the SMAP satellite) and SSH (AVISO data) in the study area. Identification of the Amur Estuary waters in terms of surface water temperature and concentration of particulate organic carbon is confined by Sakhalin Bay and the coastal zone of Sakhalin Island. An increase (a decrease) in the Amur River discharge during the spring-summer high-water period leads to an increase (a decrease) in the SSH in the northern part of Sakhalin Bay in July. Strengthening of the northwestern (southeastern) winds in September reduces (increases) the inflow of waters with low salinity and causes an elevated SSH in the water area to the north of Sakhalin Bay.

TI  - Determination of Hydrothermal Prospects in the Geothermal Region of Paipa (Boyaca, Colombia), Using Remote Sensing and Field Data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal resources have been found with the help of conventional geological, geochemical, and geophysical techniques. However, in some cases, difficult access to research areas hinders its application, which in turn increases operating costs and restricts areas of exploration. Remote sensors with thermal infrared are an important tool in the exploration of geothermal resources due to the low cost and high efficiency in the study of large geographic areas. In this research, thermal images of remote satellite sensors arc used and integrated with existing geological-geophysical information for the determination of exploratory prospects of hydrothermal vents in the geothermal region of Paipa. Boyaca. The satellite thermal images used are Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. Radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, surface thermal emissivity calculation. a single-channel. and Split window algorithm were applied to retrieve the land surface temperature. Soil temperature, surface temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and thermal imagery of the geothermal manifestations were also used. The field data contributed to the correction of the thermal bands, and the soil temperature data helped to create a subsurface temperature map at one-meter depth. Once the primary and secondary data was available, in a GIS, an unweighted spatial model was implemented, which used four input indicators (satellite temperature index, soil temperature index, structural lineaments index, and iso-resistivity index), to determine the areas most likely to find geothermal fluids. Six areas of exploratory interest for the extraction of hydrothermal fluids were determined. of which two are already known, and the remaining four are proposed as prospects. The results allowed us to conclude that thermal remote sensors are a useful tool for the mapping of geothermal anomalies in the Paipa region, and by combining these anomalies with geological-geophysical information, it is possible to determine specific areas of exploration.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node identification in colon cancer: a prospective single-center study and systematic review with meta-analysis
T2  - TECHNIQUES IN COLOPROCTOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has the potential to overcome the current drawbacks of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in colon cancer. Our aim was to provide an overview of current SLNM performance and of factors influencing successful sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification using NIR fluorescence imaging in colon cancer.Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify currently used methods and results. Additionally, we performed a single-center study using indocyanine green (ICG) as SLNM dye in colon cancer patients scheduled for a laparoscopic colectomy. SLNs were analyzed with conventional hematoxylin-and-eosin staining and additionally with serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry (extended histopathological assessment). A true-positive procedure was defined as a tumor-positive SLN either by conventional hematoxylin-and-eosin staining or by extended histopathological assessment, independently of regional lymph node status. SLN procedures were determined to be true negatives if SLNs and regional lymph nodes revealed no metastases after conventional and advanced histopathology. SLN procedures yielding tumor-negative SLNs in combination with tumor-positive regional lymph nodes were classified as false negatives. Sensitivity, negative predictive value and detection rate were calculated.Results This systematic review and meta-analysis included 8 studies describing 227 SLN procedures. A pooled sensitivity of 0.63 (95% CI 0.51-0.74), negative predictive value 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.86) and detection rate of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) were found. Upstaging as a result of extended histopathological assessment was 0.15 (95% CI 0.07-0.25). In our single-center study, we included 30 patients. Five false-negative SLNs were identified, resulting in a sensitivity of 44% and negative predictive value of 80%, with a detection rate of 89.7%. Eight patients had lymph node metastases, in three cases detected after extended pathological assessment, resulting in an upstaging of 13% (3 of 23 patients with negative nodes by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining).Conclusions Several anatomical and technical difficulties make SLNM with NIR fluorescence imaging in colon cancer particularly challenging when compared to other types of cancer. As a consequence, reports of SLNM accuracy vary widely. Future studies should try to standardize the SLNM procedure and focus on early-stage colon tumors, validation of tracer composition, injection mode and improvement of real-time optical guidance.

TI  - Using Ecosystem Service Modeler (ESM) for Ecological Quality, rarity and Risk Assessment of the wild goat habitat, in the Haftad-Gholleh protected area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the destruction of habitats has reduced the wild goat population in the Haftad-Gholleh protected area. The wild goat (Capra aegagrus) is known as symbol of biodiversity of Markazi Province. In a field study conducted between 2007 and 2017, the number of wild goats were surveyed and threat to their habitat were determined as the population and the ecological conditions as well as their movements in the Haftad-Gholleh were identified. Landsat image of year 2018 was used to produce digital land use maps for this study. Ecological Quality, Rarity and Risk Assessment was performed with ESM, HQR and HRA models. The images were classified into three classes including; Agriculture-livestock, Rangeland, and Residential regions. The results indicated that 75% of the casualties of the wild goat by Peste des Petits Ruminants disease were from the Chekab Valley and 25% from the Sibak Valley. Almost 80% of deaths among the population of wild goats were observed in the month of July. However, there are two important mountainous and plains habitats in the Haftad-Gholleh Area. Among the biggest threats and more devastating stressors in the region were to villagers, agricultural-livestock and roads development. However, among the stressors, the agriculture-livestock caused more deaths in the mountainous habitat of the wild goats. Thus, there is an urgent need for habitat conservation of the existing population of the wild goat in Haftad-Gholleh area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to predict future land use scenarios from a spatial perspective and quantitatively calculate how hydrological balance in Padang City as part of environmental services. This study uses temporal Landsat images, field surveys, focus group discussions, and analysis of the impacts of land-use change and its solutions. Field surveys were conducted to test the accuracy of field interpretation and data collection such as hydrology and morphology (physiography). The result of this study is the wide difference in land use prediction with the free scenario and the bound scenario is not very significant. The results of the research in the hydrological model show that Padang City has experienced an increase in the surplus of surface water due to changes in land use from natural areas to anthropogenic. Land-use scenarios that represent the use of sustainable environmental services are to revise the existing Padang City spatial pattern through environmental service assessments to obtain sub-catchments or sub-catchments that need to be improved (rezoning) in accordance with the application of zoning patterns.

AB  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) considering physical processes with time series of stages for diatom detection with remote sensing satellite derived physical data (Chlorophylla, Photosynthesis Available Radiance (PAR), Turbidity, Sea Surface Temperature (SST)) and meteorological data is proposed. Diatom is bloomed under the condition of suitable sea water temperature, nutrition rich water (Chlorophyll-a derived from river water flow), photosynthesis available radiance derived from solar irradiance, transparency of the sea water for photosynthesis (turbidity), and sea water convection between bottom sea water and sea surface water. Almost all the conditions can be monitored by remote sensing satellite-based radiometers. The proposed diatom prediction based on convolutional neural network with remote sensing satellite and meteorological data is validated. Through the experiments at Ariake bay area, Kyushu, Japan with gathered time series of remote sensing data of Moderate resolution of Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived turbidity as well as chlorophyll-a data estimated for the winter seasons (from January to March) during from 2010 to 2018 together with measured and acquired meteorological data for the same winter seasons, the proposed method is validated.

TI  - Framing and Foreign Policy-Israel's Response to the Arab Uprisings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The eruption of the 2010 Arab uprisings has generated a great deal of academic scholarship. However, the foreign policy of Israel, a key power in the Middle East, amid the Arab uprisings, has received limited attention. Furthermore, as we demonstrate, the conventional wisdom purported by the current debate, which is that Israel adopted a "defensive, non-idealist" realist foreign policy posture (Magen 2015, 114) in the wake of the Arab uprisings, is wrong. Rather, utilizing an innovative approach linking foreign policy analysis (FPA) and the literature on framing, we demonstrate that Israel adopted a foreign policy stance of entrenchment. This posture is predicated on peace for peace not territory, reinforcing Israel's military capabilities, and granting limited autonomy to the Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Thus, the article demonstrates how framing can usefully be operationalized to uncover how binary discourse does not merely reflect foreign policy but is, in fact, constitutive of it. We demonstrate that diagnostic and prognostic frames helped to create a direct connection between the images held by a leader, his/her worldview, ideas, perceptions and misperceptions, and foreign policy actions. These frames constituted action-oriented sets of beliefs and meaning that inspired and legitimated certain foreign policy options and instruments while restricting others.

TI  - Sugarcane drought detection through spectral indices derived modeling by remote-sensing techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several indices based on satellite images have been explored to monitor agricultural drought. Despite the existence of some drought indices, no drought monitoring system for sugarcane exists. In this sense, drought detection could be useful tool to quantify losses and help with action plans. This study investigates the Landsat image potential for sugarcane drought detection by assessing the relationship between vegetation and agricultural drought indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), global vegetation moisture index (GVMI), and normalized difference infrared index (NDII)). Two new indices combining near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands are proposed for sugarcane drought detection. All indices were individually and collectively compared with soil water deficit and water surplus, simulated by the climatological soil-water balance (CSWB) model. A significant correlation between spectral indices and water balance results, specifically for NDVI and VCI indices (similar to 30%), was observed. The drought detection system identification was developed by cluster analysis classifying the pixels into three distinct groups (drought, intermediate drought, and non-drought) to later be used in the discriminant analysis. This methodology showed to have an accuracy rate of 65%. However, the discriminant analysis approach was better suited for sugarcane drought monitoring when compared with individual spectral indices.

TI  - Arctic greening associated with lengthening growing seasons in Northern Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have reported that the Arctic is greening; however, we lack an understanding of the detailed patterns and processes that are leading to this observed greening. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to quantify greening, which has had largely positive trends over the last few decades using low spatial resolution satellite imagery such as AVHRR or MODIS over the pan-Arctic region. However, substantial fine scale spatial heterogeneity in the Arctic makes this large-scale investigation hard to interpret in terms of vegetation and other environmental changes. Here we focus on one area of the northern Alaskan Arctic using high spatial resolution (4m) multispectral satellite imagery from DigitalGlobe (TM) to analyze the greening trend near Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow) over 14 years from 2002 to 2016. We found that tundra vegetation has been greening (tau = 0.65, p = 0.01, NDVI increase of 0.01 yr(-1)) despite no overall change in vegetation community composition. The greening is most closely correlated to the number of thawing degree days (R-2 = 0.77, F = 21.5, p < 0.001) which increased in a similar linear trend over the 14 year study period (1.79.+/-.0.50 days per year, p < 0.01, tau = -0.56). This suggests that in this Arctic ecosystem, greening is occurring due to a lengthening growing season that appears to stimulate plant productivity without any significant change in vegetation communities. We found that vegetation communities in wetter locations greened about twice as fast as those found in drier conditions supporting the hypothesis that these communities respond more strongly to warming. We suggest that in Arctic environments, vegetation productivity may continue to rise, particularly in wet areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of a search for images of cloudiness of various types from MODIS satellite images based on a comparison with archive data of observations on the network of meteorological stations is presented. Based on an expert estimate, 14 types of cloudiness possessing a unique structure on images recorded with a spatial resolution of 250 m are identified. Images of cloudiness of these types and results of investigations of their texture parameters found based on the statistical gray-level co-occurrences matrix (GLCM) approach are presented. For the indicated cloudiness types, characteristic texture features or their combinations are determined. To classify the cloudiness based on information on the texture parameters, it is proposed to use the neural network based on the three-layer perceptron. The modified method of adaptive tuning of the learning rate of the neural network is described. Results of cloudiness classification and their reliability are discussed.

TI  - Data on time series analysis of land surface temperature variation in response to vegetation indices in twelve Wereda of Ethiopia using mono window, split window algorithm and spectral radiance model
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - In the past, decadal time-series analysis has been done traditionally using meteorological data. In particular, decadal analysis of land surface temperature has been a major issue due to the unavailability of remote sensing techniques. But, nowadays, with the recent advances in remote sensing techniques and modern software Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be calculated through the thermal bands. LST can be estimated through many algorithms such as Split-window, Mono-Window (SW), Single-Channel (SH), among others. LST was estimated using Mono-Window algorithm on Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and split window algorithm on Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS Thermal Infrared (TIR) bands. Vegetation index was obtained by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from red and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands. NDVI has been effectively used in vegetation monitoring and to analyze the vegetation in responses to climate change such as surface temperature variation. The twelve Weredas (third-level administrative divisions) of Ethiopia which are highly prone to drought were selected to investigate decadal land surface temperature variations and its impact on the surrounding environment, especially on vegetation cover. Ten Landsat images of three different sensors from 1999 to 2018 were used as the basic data source. The processed data of surface temperature and vegetation indices showed a strong correlation. The higher LST values indicate the smaller NDVI and vice versa and it is also identified the areas with high temperature being barren regions and areas with low temperature covered with more vegetation.

TI  - InSAR full-resolution analysis of the 2017-2018 M > 6 earthquakes in Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study analyzes the sequence of 4 important earthquakes occurred in Mexico from September 2017 to February 2018, exploiting the large availability of InSAR data and analytical models, with a twofold goal: to privede new solutions for seismogenic sources, completely independent from seismological data, and to discuss methodological aspects related to the non-linear and linear inverse problem. We review and update an earlier study, focused on the concept of resolution, showing the level of detail achievable in the investigation of the slip distribution based on geodetic observations, according to data availability, fault locations and event magnitudes. We further give new insights into the relationship between fault resolution and parameter uncertainty, demonstrating that a realistic assessment is strictly related to a proper fault subdivision. We eventually discourage the use of qualitative approaches, such as the checkerboard test, to evaluate the data resolving power and suggest the adoption of quantitative indicators, like the Dirichlet Spread Function, normalized, easy to calculate and mathematically robust.

TI  - Using Continuous Change Detection and Classification of Landsat Data to Investigate Long-Term Mangrove Dynamics in the Sundarbans Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play a global role in providing ecosystem goods and services in addition to acting as carbon sinks, and are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects such as rising sea levels and increased salinity. For this reason, accurate long-term monitoring of mangrove ecosystems is vital. However, these ecosystems are extremely dynamic and data frequency is often reduced by cloud cover. The Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) method has the potential to overcome this by utilising every available observation on a per-pixel basis to build stable season-trend models of the underlying phenology. These models can then be used for land cover classification and to determine greening and browning trends. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, CCDC was applied to a 30-year time series of Landsat data covering an area of mangrove forest known as the Sundarbans. Spanning the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna river systems, the Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. CCDC achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.5% with a 99% confidence of being between 94.2% and 94.8%. Results showed that while mangrove extent in the Sundarbans has remained stable, around 25% of the area experienced an overall negative trend, probably due to the effect of die-back on Heritiera fomes. In addition, dates and magnitudes of change derived from CCDC were used to investigate damage and recovery from a major cyclone; 11% of the Sundarbans was found to have been affected by Cyclone Sidr in 2007, 47.6% of which had not recovered by mid-2018. The results indicate that while the Sundarbans forest is resilient to cyclone events, the long-term degrading effects of climate change could reduce this resilience to critical levels. The proposed methodology, while computationally expensive, also offers means by which the full Landsat archive can be analyzed and interpreted and should be considered for global application to mangrove monitoring.

TI  - An Evaluation and Comparison of Four Dense Time Series Change Detection Methods Using Simulated Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Access to temporally dense time series such as data from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 missions has lead to an increase in methods which aim to monitor land cover change on a per-acquisition rather than a yearly basis. Evaluating the accuracy and limitations of these methods can be difficult because validation data are limited and often rely on human interpretation. Simulated time series offer an objective method for evaluating and comparing between change detection algorithms. A set of simulated time series was used to evaluate four change detection methods: (1) Breaks for Additive and Seasonal Trend (BFAST); (2) BFAST Monitor; (3) Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC); and (4) Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Change Detection (EWMACD). In total, 151,200 simulations were generated to represent a range of abrupt, gradual, and seasonal changes. EWMACD was found to give the best performance overall, correctly identifying the true date of change in 76.6% of cases. CCDC performed worst (51.8%). BFAST performed well overall but correctly identified less than 10% of seasonal changes (changes in amplitude, length of season, or number of seasons). All methods showed some decrease in performance with increased noise and missing data, apart from BFAST Monitor which improved when data were removed. The following recommendations are made as a starting point for future studies: EWMACD should be used for detection of lower magnitude changes and changes in seasonality; CCDC should be used for robust detection of complete land cover class changes; EWMACD and BFAST are suitable for noisy datasets, depending on the application; and CCDC should be used where there are high quantities of missing data. The simulated datasets have been made freely available online as a foundation for future work.

TI  - Detection Range of Acoustic Receivers in a Large Hydropower Reservoir
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic telemetry manufacturers report estimated detection ranges under idealized conditions, but environmental conditions such as water depth, substrate type, and turbulence can affect the range of reliable detection. Range testing of low (Vemco V7 136 dB re 1 mu Pa@1m) and high power (V13 147 dB re 1 mu Pa@1m) acoustic transmitters (tags) was performed near a hydropower generating station and its associated reservoir using both active (mobile; VR100) and passive (stationary; VR2W/VR2Tx) receivers. Low power tags are typically used to track small fish such as juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), whereas high power tags are typically used to track larger fish such as adult salmon. The results found herein were applied to concurrent salmon telemetry studies. Detection ranges of the low power tags were within 246-351 +/- 20-70 m (mean +/- SE), and the high power tags were within 537-1106 +/- 53-272 m. Observed detection ranges were comparable or higher to manufacturer estimates for both tag types being detected by passive receivers, and were lower than expected for both tag types being detected by active receivers. Passive receivers were further tested by mooring a fixed sentinel tag (low power) on a receiver line at the hydropower site for 50 days. The sentinel tag detection range of 212 m was less than the expected range of 280-292 m, and was not found to be significantly impacted by wind speed. There was evidence of a hydropower e ffect on detection probability (up to 95% reduction) of both tag types for the active receiver, and detection ranges were significantly lower at the hydropower site than the reservoir site for the high power tag. The results of this study give insight to the initial design of acoustic telemetry studies beyond what can be gathered from manufacturer's estimates, but rather near hydropower facilities and within large reservoirs; however, detection ranges reported herein do not replace the importance of range testing in site-specific conditions.

AB  - In the Western legal tradition, land and natural resources have always been considered as goods, the primary object of the right of property. Instead, for the Andean indigenous cosmovision, the relationship between Nature and Mankind has always been different: not of dominion, but of respect, harmony and co-living. This ancestral worldview has recently influenced the national legal systems of some Latin American countries, producing interesting consequences: lands, rivers, hills, plants. are not considered objects anymore, but subjects of rights, that could stand for their rights in courts. The article explores this recent legal pattern and its potentiality to circulate outside the chthonic legal tradition, for instance in Europe, where other formants could play a role in reconsidering the legal basis of the Western legal family.

TI  - An Approach for Downscaling SMAP Soil Moisture by Combining Sentinel-1 SAR and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method is proposed for the production of downscaled soil moisture active passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM) data by combining optical/infrared data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data based on the random forest (RF) model. The method leverages the sensitivity of active microwaves to surface SM and the triangle/trapezium feature space among vegetation indexes (VIs), land surface temperature (LST), and SM. First, five RF architectures (RF1-RF5) were trained and tested at 9 km. Second, a comparison was performed for RF1-RF5, and were evaluated against in situ SM measurements. Third, two SMAP-Sentinel active-passive SM products were compared at 3 km and 1 km using in situ SM measurements. Fourth, the RF5 model simulations were compared with the SMAP L2_SM_SP product based on the optional algorithm at 3 km and 1 km resolutions. The results showed that the downscaled SM based on the synergistic use of optical/infrared data and the backscatter at vertical-vertical (VV) polarization was feasible in semi-arid areas with relatively low vegetation cover. The RF5 model with backscatter and more parameters from optical/infrared data performed best among the five RF models and was satisfactory at both 3 km and 1 km. Compared with L2_SM_SP, RF5 was more superior at 1 km. The input variables in decreasing order of importance were backscatter, LST, VIs, and topographic factors over the entire study area. The low vegetation cover conditions probably amplified the importance of the backscatter and LST. A sufficient number of VIs can enhance the adaptability of RF models to different vegetation conditions.

AB  - Among nearly all gynecologic cancers, knowing whether the cancer has metastasized to lymph nodes impacts the ultimate management of the cancer. Lymph node status assists in cancer staging, prognostication, guidance of surgical intervention and adjuvant therapy, and removal of positive lymph nodes may be therapeutic in some cancers. Surgical staging through lymph node removal and pathologist assessment is standard of care for most gynecologic cancers. This section reviews the anatomic lymphatic drainage patterns of each gynecologic organ and the evolution and current practice of surgical lymph node assessment along the spectrum of gynecologic cancers.

TI  - Non-fiction prose as one of the trends in the literary process of the North Caucasus
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The non-fiction literature phenomenon is one of the most interesting, unique for the North Caucasus and the least studied phenomena of intellectual, spiritual, artistic culture located at the intersection of literature, journalism, and humanitarian knowledge, which determines the relevance and feasibility of studying this problem. The aim of the article is to consider the leading trends in the development of non-fiction literature of the North Caucasus, taking into account the uniqueness of the historical and literary, ethnocultural, multi-confessional state of the region, as well as the variety of national and predetermined Russian and world literature folklore traditions and relations. The article has developed the question of the basic prerequisites for the emergence and development of non-fiction literature in the works of enlightenment writers at its most important stages.The leading approach to the study of the problem is the analysis of the interaction of the worldview and the method of non-fiction authors in the North Caucasus and the correlation of documentary and artistic typification in their works. The close relationship of national documentary prose with journalism is revealed, the interaction in them of the theory and practice of intercultural communication in the unity of its form (genres) and analytical content is justified, the productivity of this type of creativity for the modern sociocultural situation in a particular region is proved. The significance of the article both theoretically and practically is due to the fact that its results can be used as elements of a methodological base for further research on the issues identified.

TI  - The rural-urban gap: differences in injury characteristics
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION IN CANADA-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Injuries are among the top 10 leading causes of death in Canada. However, the types and rates of injuries vary between rural versus urban settings. Injury rates increase with rurality, particularly those related to motor vehicle collisions. Factors such as type of work, hazardous environments and longer driving distances contribute to the difference in rural and urban injury rates. Further examination of injuries comparing rural and urban settings with increased granularity in the nature of injuries and severity is needed.Methods: The study population consisted of records from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) from between 2011 and July 2017. Rural and urban status was determined based on postal codes as defined by Canada Post. Proportionate injury ratios (P1Rs) were calculated to compare rural and urban injury rates by nature and severity of injury and sex, among other factors.Results: Rural injuries were more likely to involve multiple injuries (PIR = 1.66 for 3 injuries) and crush injuries (PIR = 1.72). More modestly elevated PIRs for rural settings were found for animal bites (1.14), burns (1.22), eye injuries (1.32), fractures (1.20) and muscle or soft tissue injuries (1.11). Injuries in rural areas were more severe, with a higher likelihood of cases being admitted to hospital (1.97), and they were more likely to be due to a motor vehicle collision (2.12).Conclusion: The nature of injuries in rural settings differ from those in urban settings. This suggests a need to evaluate current injury prevention efforts in rural settings with the aim to close the gap between rural and urban injury rates.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics and ecosystem service values changes at national and provincial scales in Nepal from 2000 to 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of vegetation changes and economic valuation of natural resources are important to strengthen national economy and sustainable environment development. This study identified the changes in vegetation and ecosystem service values at the national and provincial scales in Nepal from 2000 to 2017. Mann Kendall test statistics and Sen's slope were computed for temporal and spatial normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values in each pixel having a spatial resolution of 250 m and at 16-days interval. Land cover types were defined based on the NDVI values and applied ecosystem service values (ESV) coefficient. Results show that NDVI has significantly increased in Nepal with an average trend of 0.0018 yr(-1) during 2000-2017. Except for Province 6, the NDVI has increased significantly in all the provinces. Results additionally suggested a 27.88% greening in Nepal. At the provincial scale, the highest (56.41%) and lowest (12.52%) greening were observed in Provinces 2 and 6, respectively. In 2017, the total ESV in Nepal was 21.88 billion USD which showed a 1.15 billion USD higher than in year 2000. The ESV has increased in forests but decreased in the croplands, grasslands and barren lands between 2000 and 2017. The ESV of national forest are estimated at 19.17 billion USD in 2017. The highest value of 4.17 billion USD and the lowest of 1.09 billion USD were found in Provinces 1 and 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the available ESV per capita was relatively higher in Province 6 and lower in the Province 2. As the ESV is important lifeline for the society, this study provides crucial information about how this important environmental parameter has changed over time in Nepal.

TI  - Infections following Immediate Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction: A Case-Control Study over 11 Years
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Surgical-site infection after implant-based breast reconstruction adversely affects surgical outcomes and increases health care costs. This 11-year case-control study examines risk factors specific for surgical-site infection after immediate tissue expander/implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods: The authors performed a retrospective review to identify all consecutive patients with breast implant infections between 2006 and 2016. Patients who developed surgical-site infection after immediate tissue expander/implant-based breast reconstruction were included. Surgical-site infection was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria; specifically, infections requiring hospital admission, intravenous antibiotics, or surgical intervention were included. The authors matched a control patient to each infection case by patient age and date of surgery. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and perioperative surgical variables were examined. Univariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Results: A total of 270 breasts in 252 patients were evaluated. On multivariate analysis, patients with a higher body mass index (OR, 1.1 per 1 body mass index point increase; 95 percent CI, 1.0 to 1.2; p = 0.02), hypertension (OR, 6.5; 95 percent CI, 1.9 to 22.3; p = 0.002), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR, 2.6; 95 percent CI, 1.0 to 6.3; p = 0.04), axillary lymph node dissection (OR, 7.1; 95 percent CI, 1.7 to 29.2; p = 0.006), seroma formation (OR, 15.34; 95 percent CI, 3.7 to 62.5; p = 0.0001), and wound healing complications (OR, 23.91; 95 percent CI, 6.1 to 93.4; p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with surgical-site infection. Conclusions: Women with obesity, women with hypertension, and those treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at increased risk of surgical-site infection. Further risks are also associated with postoperative seroma and wound complications. This may help patient selection and counseling, adjusted based on risk factors regarding complications of immediate implant-based breast reconstruction.

TI  - Biomass Estimation for Semiarid Vegetation and Mine Rehabilitation Using Worldview-3 and Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface mining activities in grassland and rangeland zones directly affect the livestock production, forage quality, and regional grassland resources. Mine rehabilitation is necessary for accelerating the recovery of the grassland ecosystem. In this work, we investigate the integration of data obtained via a synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1 SAR) with data obtained by optical remote sensing (Worldview-3, WV-3) in order to monitor the conditions of a vegetation area rehabilitated after coal mining in North China. The above-ground biomass (AGB) is used as an indicator of the rehabilitated vegetation conditions and the success of mine rehabilitation. The wavelet principal component analysis is used for the fusion of the WV-3 and Sentinel-1 SAR images. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression model is applied based on the relationship between the remote sensing features and the AGB field measurements. Our results show that WV-3 enhanced vegetation indices (EVI), mean texture from band8 (near infrared band2, NIR2), the SAR vertical and horizon (VH) polarization, and band 8 (NIR2) from the fused image have higher correlation coefficient value with the field-measured AGB. The proposed AGB estimation model combining WV-3 and Sentinel 1A SAR imagery yields higher model accuracy (R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 22.82 g/m(2)) compared to that obtained with any of the two datasets only. Besides improving AGB estimation, the proposed model can also reduce the uncertainty range by 7 g m(-2) on average. These results demonstrate the potential of new multispectral high-resolution datasets, such as Sentinel-1 SAR and Worldview-3, in providing timely and accurate AGB estimation for mine rehabilitation planning and management.

TI  - Topographic Base Maps from Remote Sensing Data for Engineering Geomorphological Modelling: An Application on Coastal Mediterranean Landscape
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landscapes are one of the most changeable areas of the earth's surface. Given this spatial complexity and temporal variability, the construction of reference maps useful for geo-engineering is a challenge. In order to improve the performance of geomorphic models, reliable multiscale and multi-temporal base maps and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are needed. The work presented in this paper addresses this issue using an inter-geo-disciplinary approach to optimize the processing of multisource and multi-temporal data and DEMs by using field surveys, conceptual model, and analytical computation on a test area. The data acquired with two surveying techniques were analyzed and compared: Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) and photogrammetry from stereo pairs of High-Resolution Satellite Images (HRSI). To assess the reliability of the DEMs produced from point clouds, the residuals between the point cloud and the interpolated filtered surface were identified and analyzed statistically. In addition to the contour maps, some feature maps such as slope, planar, and profile curvature maps were produced and analyzed. The frequency distribution of the slope and curvature values were compared with the diffusion, advection, and stream power model, revealing a good agreement with the past and present geomorphic processes acting on the different parts of the study area. Moreover, the integrated geomatics-geomorphic analysis of the outliers' map showed a good correspondence (more than 75%) between the identified outliers and some specific geomorphological features, such as micro-landforms, which are significant for erosive and gravity-driven mechanisms. The different distribution of the above singularities by different data sources allowed us to attribute their spatial model to the temporal variation of the topography and, consequently, to the geomorphic changes, rather than to the different accuracy. For monitoring purposes and risk mitigation activities, the methodology adopted seems to meet the requirements to make a digital mapping of the coast analyzed, characterized by a rapid evolution of the surface, and can be extended to other stretches of coast with similar characteristics.

TI  - Statistical Assessment of Long-term Shoreline Changes along the Odisha Coast
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Odisha, a coastal state on eastern seaboard of India possesses a similar to 450 km long coastline vulnerable to a multitude of natural and anthropogenic threats. The present study reports a systematic assessment of rates of shoreline change over a period of 25 years from 1990-2015, using Landsat 5 and 8 series of (Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager) satellite images. An analysis of rate of shoreline change was carried out along select regions of Odisha coast using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Linear Regression Method (LRR) was used to estimate net shoreline change at sub decade time scale and End Point Rate (EPR) to estimate net shoreline change rate in between two consecutive years. The highest erosion with a coastline length of 63 km was observed between Rajnagar (around Satabhaya beach) and Mahakalapara (near to Hukitola beach) block of Kendrapara district and between Ersama (around Paradeep port) and Balikuda blocks (northern parts of Devi River mouth) of Jagatsinghpur coastal district. The result suggest that both EPR and LRR techniques were used to estimate shoreline change rate and the similar result of erosion by both EPR and LRR technique indicated weaker cyclic trend in erosion.

TI  - Mathematical modeling and use of orbital products in the environmental degradation of the Araripe Forest in the Brazilian Northeast
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is indispensable in the process of inhibiting environmental degradation. In the Northeast of Brazil, especially in the Araripe Nacional Forest (FLONA), this problem is related to the removal of vegetation for industrial and domestic use, in addition to the expansion of livestock. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the environmental degradation in the area of FLONA from orbital products via remote sensing with the aid of mathematical modeling. For this, two orbital images of the orbit 65, point 217 were used for processing and obtaining the variables: (1st) July 7, 2003 from TM/Landsat-5 and (2nd) July 15, 2018 from OLI/Landsat-8. In mathematical modeling, the multiple linear regression (MRL) model was applied to the orbital products: land surface temperature (LST), normalized burn ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Moisture Index, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to estimate the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and hence to predict the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). All the processing to obtain the results was carried out in the software R version 3.4-1. O NDVI pointed out a significant increase of 72.05% in dense vegetation, from 158.33 to 272.40 km(2). However, vegetation is more likely to suffer from stress due to the increase in LST at 5 degrees C, which increased from 17.5 to 25.0 degrees C, reaching its highest value of 42 degrees C in July 2011. The MRL results indicated that the models have an excellent predictive capacity in the estimation of degradation, with R-2 value greater than 92% of the explained variance. In addition, the MAE and root mean square error were less than 0.03 for both models. The models pointed out that SAVI, NBR and NDWI are responsible for the variability of NDVI in environmental degradation of FLONA. Highlight for the theoretical-conceptual model that can be applied to any semi-arid and highly-sensitive region to changes in the rainfall pattern.

TI  - Impact of meteorological conditions on the onset of the growing season over broadleaved forests in northeastern Poland
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper aims at assessing the impact of meteorological conditions on the start of the growing season (SOS) over forests in north-eastern Poland. The main objective was to study which, and if so to what extent, the meteorological parameters can describe the changes of the onset of vegetation in broadleaved forests. Study area encompasses forest complexes located in north-eastern Poland, which are under the influence of maritime and continental climate characterized by a shorter vegetation period and large temperature fluctuations. In this study forest mask containing only pixels with >= 50% cover of broadleaved forests defined by CLC2012 was applied. The time-series of satellite images derived from VEGETATION mission were applied for determining the start of the growing season. 10-day composites of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1999 to 2016, derived at 1 km pixel resolution were filtered with double logistic function in order to determine the SOS. The meteorological parameters such as maximum air temperature, total precipitation and surface solar radiation derived from field measurements one month before the start of the growing season were taken into account. The Pearson correlation results proved that only maximum air temperature was related to the onset of the growing season. The strength of the relations depended on the dominant trees recognized within the forest area. There were no statistically significant relations with the precipitation and solar surface radiation which could be explained by frequent clouds during the month before the SOS and not observed unfavorable conditions that could have impacted on the changes of the growing season in forests.

TI  - MEANDER "ZEG" IN THE DECOR OF FELT AS A REFLECTION OF THE WORLD VIEW OF KALMYKS AND OIRATS OF MONGOLIA
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Felt-making of Mongolian nomads has ancient origins dating back to the history of Central Asian culture. The technique of making felt and its decor of Kalmyks of Russia and Oirats of Mongolia are conditioned by the tradition. They are linked by the common heritage of ornamental culture, the archaic layer of which is represented by a geometric meander. The design of the felt pattern is further developed in the polychromy of Kalmyk folk embroidery "zeg". The artistic phenomenon is due to the historical circumstances of the formation of the folk and their culture. In general, the descriptive nature of domestic and foreign studies of cultural heritage indicates the need for a structural-functional analysis of the works of applied art of nomads. The study material is presented by museum collections of felt items (Russian Museum of Ethnography (St. Petersburg), the National Museum named after N. Palmov and the Museum of Traditional Culture named after Zaya-Pandita (Republic of Kalmykia).A multi-layered ornamental composition of felt carpets is decoratively expressive. The universe, unfolding on the plane, concentrates a particular view of the world of the nomad. He opens it in a long-line building space, perceived in motion. The tradition embraces the compositional reception of a plastic-changeable image plane. The cyclical development of movement carries a rhythm that organizes the beginning of being, realized in the linear contour of the meander. The pattern, repeated in the system of the ornamental row, forms a decorative composition of felt. In the aesthetic expressiveness of the ancient geometric motifs of the image, the mobile way of life is transmitted. Such is the Kalmyk ornament "zeg" as an expression of the "path" in the figurative thinking of nomads.In the quilted felt pattern, the archetypical essence of the decor is preserved, combining the shapes of a semicircle, a square, a triangle or a polygon in the rhythmic dynamics of the linear composition. The imaginative graphics of the semi-circular meander "zyungara zeg" in a stylized image of a yurt, the sun or a star, was born in the prism of the nomad's worldview in the "road" - a constant movement from one nomadic camp to another. The ornament as a self-valuable sign of the adaptation and self-regulation of culture in the aesthetic field of folk art is a marker of the space,"cultivated" by the ethnos. The vector of the Kalmyk tradition of the decor, established in the isolation from the original cultural center, is the movement from the massive plastic form of Mongolian decoration to the capacious convention of polychromic embroidery "zeg"."The artistic style is formed in the tonal development of the color scale of the embroidered pattern of clothes and the wave-like rhythm of the quilted meander "zeg" on the felt. Perception of the world as a philosophical understanding of being is expressed in its space-time constants. It is projected during the creation of the decor: the composition and the rhythmic-color dynamics of the pattern on the felt plane. The analysis of the "felt" ornament in the historical and cultural prism explains the mechanism of the formation of the artistic form. It is naturally considered to be the genetic code of the traditional culture with the nomadic soft household environment as a part of it. The stitch and color cord layout contrast with the background of the felt base, forming the center of the linear composition in the border of characteristic ornamental rows.Ensuring the preservation of the tradition, the ornament of felt mats has aesthetic expression of the decor. In this process the initial "proto-form" is a geometric pattern of felt as an ancient layer of nomadic ornamentation. The graphics of the contour ornament initiates the appearance of Kalmyk embroidery, representing the top of the symbolic language of the artistic tradition. In the ethno-integrating function of folk art, relevant far from the cultural ancestral homeland, an ancient meander appears. The linear expressiveness of the quilted pattern on the felt is inspired by the figurative worldview, born in the rhythm of nomadic life. In the sphere of the universal "cosmo-anthropic existence" of a society formed in relations with the natural environment, the characteristic dominants of the traditional culture of Kalmyks and Oirats of Mongolia are revealed.

TI  - Identifying Areas Sensitive to Wind Erosion-A Case Study of the AP Vojvodina (Serbia)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is one of the most significant forms of land degradation which occurs in arid and semi-arid regions. Agricultural land is significantly affected by wind erosion, which leads to soil quality reduction, and consequently to economic losses. This research was conducted in the autonomous province (AP) of Vojvodina (a region dominated by agriculture), which represents one of the most important economic regions in the Republic of Serbia. The aim of this research was to identify areas sensitive to wind erosion (in the month of March) in the AP Vojvodina by using fuzzy logic, remote sensing data, and geographical information systems (GIS). The data of prior research on erosion sediment were used for results validation. The results show that the hazardous sensitivity category covers approximately 60.41% of the research area, while the medium sensitive category accounts for 36% of the area. These findings are primarily a result of the lack of vegetation in almost the entire area, particularly in wind-exposed agricultural areas with no vegetation, which are being prepared for sowing. Another factor putting such a large area at risk is the unfavorable climate (especially in southeastern parts of the area), and slightly less favorable soil properties in the north. The results of this research could be used in decision-making at the regional level, along with the development and implementation of programs aimed at mitigating the effects of wind erosion.

TI  - Improved Mapping of Mountain Shrublands Using the Sentinel-2 Red-Edge Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub encroachment into grassland and rocky habitats is a noticeable land cover change currently underway in temperate mountains and is a matter of concern for the sustainable management of mountain biodiversity. Current land cover products tend to underestimate the extent of mountain shrublands dominated by Ericaceae (Vaccinium spp. (species) and Rhododendron ferrugineum). In addition, mountain shrubs are often confounded with grasslands. Here, we examined the potential of anthocyanin-responsive vegetation indices to provide more accurate maps of mountain shrublands in a mountain range located in the French Alps. We relied on the multi-spectral instrument onboard the Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites and the availability of red-edge bands to calculate a Normalized Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (NARI). We used this index to quantify the autumn accumulation of anthocyanin in canopies dominated by Vaccinium spp. and Rhododendron ferrugineum and compared the effectiveness of NARI to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a basis for shrubland mapping. Photointerpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery, intensive field campaigns, and floristic surveys provided complementary data to calibrate and evaluate model performance. The proposed NARI-based model performed better than the NDVI-based model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 against 0.58. Validation of shrub cover maps based on NARI resulted in a Kappa coefficient of 0.67, which outperformed existing land cover products and resulted in a ten-fold increase in estimated area occupied by Ericaceae-dominated shrublands. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 red-edge band provides novel opportunities to detect seasonal anthocyanin accumulation in plant canopies and discuss the potential of our method to quantify long-term dynamics of shrublands in alpine and arctic contexts.

M3  - Article
AB  - The land, oceans, and atmosphere are tightly linked and form the most dynamic component of the climate system. Studies on terrestrial and ocean science enhance the understanding on the impacts of climate change. Across India and the world over, human-driven land use and climate changes are altering the structure, function, and extent of natural terrestrial ecosystems and in turn regional biogeochemical feedbacks. In this special issue, we present 29 manuscripts; those discuss wide-ranging aspects of terrestrial and oceanic characterization and dynamics. These contributions are based on selected presentations made at the 2nd International Workshop on Biodiversity and Climate Change (BDCC- 2018) held on 24-27 February 2018 at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. The manuscripts are arranged in five sections such as Ecological Assessment, Plant Invasion, Carbon Dynamics, Ecosystem Characterization, and Ocean Dynamics. We realized that the utility of satellite remote sensing data has been emerging as a dominant trend in environmental monitoring and assessment studies in India.

TI  - High risk endometrial cancer: Clues towards a revision of the therapeutic paradigm
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a major cause of mortality worldwide with nearly 200 000 cases diagnosed annually. The recent ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO guidelines include a new classification defining a heterogeneous high-risk group of recurrence (HR) comprising: (i) endometrioid (type 1) FIGO stage IB grade 3 tumors (type 1/G3ECs), (ii) non-endometrioid tumors (type 2) and (iii) advanced stages whatever the histological type (Colombo et al., 2016).Areas covered: The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence for therapeutic approaches in HR-EC according to the updated ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO classification by discussing the following issues: i) HR-EC heterogeneity, (ii) prognostic factors and current classification, and (iii) optimal staging strategies (site and extent) and the role of adjuvant treatment.Expert commentary: HR-EC treatment is based on surgery, radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy, either alone or sequentially, in combination with other treatments depending on disease stage, histological grade and risk group. Specific trials are needed to establish the role of systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, adjuvant therapies and targeted drugs. Although molecular characterization has been reported to customize therapeutic strategies and thereby improve therapeutic outcomes in EC, none of the targeted agents investigated (antiangiogenic and mTOR/PI3K pathway inhibitor agents) have resulted in a change in clinical practice in HR-EC.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass in conserved areas of <i>Stipa tenacissima </i>L. stands in the high steppes of western Algeria by mean of the Landsat 8 imagery-based vegetation indices
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of this paper was to evaluate the use of OLI spectral data as a tool to assess the steppe vegetation in a conservation context. The field sampling was conducted for two specific areas of treatment (a) an exclosure area and (b) a free grazing area. After testing several vegetation indices (VIs), the optimal results were obtained for the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-based aboveground biomass model with r(2) = 0.61 and r(2) = 0.72 for total and perennial biomass, respectively. No difference between observed and predicted total and perennial biomass was found (p = 0.700 and p = 0.306, respectively). The comparison between the two treatments using the field sampling revealed a significant difference on total plant cover (p = 0.016) and total biomass (p = 0.005), with a plant cover of 50.6% and a biomass of 325.771 kg dry matter per hectare (kg DM ha(-1)) on average in grazed area and 66.9%, 1,407.869 kg DM ha(-1) in exclosure. Finally, a concordance is noted between the results obtained by the NDVI-based biomass model and the field sampling-based biomass.

TI  - NATURAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS OF SMALL RIVERSBEDS FORMATION OF THE TUNKA DEPRESSION (REPUBLIC OF BURYATIA)
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on the formation of small riverbed using the example of the Tunka River Basin located within the Tunka depression in the western part of the Baikal rift (51 degrees 45'27.1 '' N; 102 degrees 30'05.6 '' E). At present, the factors of small riverbeds formation haven't been practically studied in mountain depression conditions. Analysis of field, hydrological, cartographic, geomorphological data, as well as remote sensing data showed that, among the main factors of natural origin, the greatest influence on riverbeds are geological structure of the territory, relief and climatic conditions. The tectonic conditions of the territory, namely, sections presence of lowering the blocks of the earth's crust in the central part of the basin, are the cause of development of tortuosity and multi-channel riversbed (Fig. 3). Relief and climatic conditions affect the incision of rivers in mountainous part of the study area, while the maximum precipitation that falls in July-August causes summer floods (Fig. 2). Short-term floods contribute to development of dangerous geomorphological processes, for example, mudflows. Mudflows lead to blockage of valleys by mudflow deposits and restructuring of the river network, and also intensify the processes of riverbed incision (Fig. 4). The shift of small riverbed on the slopes of Tunkinsky Goltsy to the west, as well as the presence of mudflow valleys, pose a great danger to Arshan, which was already exposed to negative consequences of the mudflow in 2014. The morphostructural plan of the territory determined variety of morphodynamic riverbed types: a wide-floodplain meandering multi-channel type within lowering of the blocks of the earth's crust, relatively rectilinear and incised types when crossing faults. The map-scheme of the river Tunka (Fig. 3) was created as a result of field data analysis, cartographic material and remote sensing data. The map shows the main morphodynamic types of small riverbed. The most common type is incised relatively straight riverbed l which indicate the rise of individual blocks of the earth's crust in the basin. Of all the types of economic activity, the most significant factor of direct impact on the morphodynamics of small riverbeds is land reclamation by draining. Land reclamation led to straightening of riverbeds sections of wide-floodplain type of small rivers (Fig. 5), thereby reducing the intensity of the processes leading to meandering of the riverbeds.

TI  - Analysis of Parabolic Dune Morphometry and Its Migration in Thar Desert Area, India, using High-Resolution Satellite Data and Temporal DEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thar Desert region is mainly comprised of sand dunes and sand sheets which are distributed in more than 80 per cent geographical area of western Rajasthan. Among the different types of sand dunes, nearly 50 per cent area of western Rajasthan is covered by parabolic dunes. However, morphodynamics of parabolic dunes in the Thar Desert is not fully understood. For this purpose, high-resolution satellite data of IRS RS2 LISS-IV (5.8 m resolution) and Cartosat-1 DEM (10 m resolution) have been used for delineation of parabolic dunes with the derivation of morphometric parameters (dune length, dune area, volume of sand accumulation and dune height) in western Rajasthan. Scatter plots of these morphometric parameters show a linear relationship with correlation coefficient (0.59-0.80). Interpolated maps show an increased rate of wind speed during 1980-2014. Although several measures have been taken for sand dune stabilisation, differential sand migration has been estimated for selected parabolic dunes using temporal DEMs (SRTM DEM of 2000 and Carto DEM of 2009). The analysis shows average dune shifting of 7.11 m/year in Barmer, 5.15 m/year in Jaisalmer and 3.51 m/year in Bikaner districts of western Rajasthan in the Thar Desert area.

TI  - ER-associated degradation in health and disease - from substrate to organism
T2  - JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The recent literature has revolutionized our view on the vital importance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) in health and disease. Suppressor/enhancer of Lin-12-like (Sel1L)-HMG-coA reductase degradation protein 1 (Hrd1)-mediated ERAD has emerged as a crucial determinant of normal physiology and as a sentinel against disease pathogenesis in the body, in a largely substrate- and cell type-specific manner. In this Review, we highlight three features of ERAD, constitutive versus inducible ERAD, quality versus quantity control of ERAD and ERAD-mediated regulation of nuclear gene transcription, through which ERAD exerts a profound impact on a number of physiological processes.

TI  - Application Potential Analysis of Enhanced Oil Recovery by Biopolymer-Producing Bacteria and Biosurfactant-Producing Bacteria Compound Flooding
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application: Biopolymer-producing strain FY-07 is capable of producing bacterial cellulose (BC) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, while the biosurfactant-producing strain WJ-1 produces a rhamnolipid, which is a biosurfactant widely used in the oil extraction. The present research envisages the evaluation of the potential of combined flooding of the biopolymer-producing bacteria FY-07 and biosurfactant-producing bacteria WJ-1 for enhancing the oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs.To study the feasibility of polymer-producing bacteria Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) FY-07 and surfactant-producing bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa WJ-1 combined profile control and flooding, the compatibility of FY-07 and WJ-1 was evaluated using laboratory experiments. The results showed that the growth and metabolism of WJ-1 was not significantly affected by the FY-07 in the degradation medium, and the surface tension of fermentation broth was reduced from 70 mN/m to 30 mN/m. FY-07 enhanced the degradation of WJ-1, increasing the ratio of C14- to C15+ from 0.37 to 0.67. The core -flooding experiments indicated the oil recovery of 17.4% when both FY-07 and WJ-1 were injected into the system, as against to 10.4% and 7.9% for FY-07 and WJ-1, respectively, when injected alone. The results demonstrate a good compatibility between the FY-07 and WJ-1 strains and highlight the application potential of stain FY-07 and strain WJ-1 compound flooding for enhancing the oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs.

TI  - Theoretical Evaluation of Anisotropic Reflectance Correction Approaches for Addressing Multi-Scale Topographic Effects on the Radiation-Transfer Cascade in Mountain Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research involving anisotropic-reflectance correction (ARC) of multispectral imagery to account for topographic effects has been ongoing for approximately 40 years. A large body of research has focused on evaluating empirical ARC methods, resulting in inconsistent results. Consequently, our research objective was to evaluate commonly used ARC methods using first-order radiation-transfer modeling to simulate ASTER multispectral imagery over Nanga Parbat, Himalaya. Specifically, we accounted for orbital dynamics, atmospheric absorption and scattering, direct- and diffuse-skylight irradiance, land cover structure, and surface biophysical variations to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing multi-scale topographic effects. Our results clearly reveal that the empirical methods we evaluated could not reasonably account for multi-scale topographic effects at Nanga Parbat. The magnitude of reflectance and the correlation structure of biophysical properties were not preserved in the topographically-corrected multispectral imagery. The CCOR and SCS+C methods were able to remove topographic effects, given the Lambertian assumption, although atmospheric correction was required, and we did not account for other primary and secondary topographic effects that are thought to significantly influence spectral variation in imagery acquired over mountains. Evaluation of structural-similarity index images revealed spatially variable results that are wavelength dependent. Collectively, our simulation and evaluation procedures strongly suggest that empirical ARC methods have significant limitations for addressing anisotropic reflectance caused by multi-scale topographic effects. Results indicate that atmospheric correction is essential, and most methods failed to adequately produce the appropriate magnitude and spatial variation of surface reflectance in corrected imagery. Results were also wavelength dependent, as topographic effects influence radiation-transfer components differently in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our results explain inconsistencies described in the literature, and indicate that numerical modeling efforts are required to better account for multi-scale topographic effects in various radiation-transfer components.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREST HEALTH THROUGH REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES IN VALEA ROSIE NATURA 2000 SITE, BIHOR COUNTY, ROMANIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with the estimation of the evolution tendency of the environmental stage of a protected habitat with predominant forest vegetation, during a short period of time, using techniques specific to remote sensing. Therefore, two important spectral indexes were tested while assessing the health of the forest ecosystems: i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI). The period of time taken into consideration for the study was, 2013 - 2019, having used medium resolution satellite photos, Landsat 8 OLI, having initially undergone standard pre-processing operations (resize data, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction). The satellite images modified according to the Top of Atmosphere Reflectance and corrected topographically resulted into getting values for the two before mentioned indexes. The quantity-spatial results obtained, correlated to the monthly values of the precipitations processed in order to obtain the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), mostly reveal, in what SIPI and also NDVI are concerned, a slight decrease in the quality of the forest on the analysed area in the sense that the vegetation stress is increased under meteorological factors, expressed differently depending on the morphometric and pedological parameters of the habitat.

M3  - Article
AB  - The results of studies to assess the texture of L- and C-band radar polarimetric images from SIR-C and ALOS PALSAR-1 satellites for analyzing forest-vegetation characteristics using different signatures are summarized. A fractal polarization signature is proposed for the study; this signature makes it possible to estimate the spatial anisotropy of forest-vegetation heterogeneities at different azimuthal angles of radar sensing. In addition, the signature of lacunarity is suggested as a tool for the qualitative assessment of the angular distribution of tree branches. The heterogeneities of forest vegetation at the test site near Lake Baikal are estimated based on the results of an analysis of the fractal dimension and lacunarity at different states of the polarization ellipse.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of an analysis of the long-term series of remote sensing data from Terra/Aqua satellites (Burned Area MCD64A1 monthly product, the 6th collection) and Landsat satellites are presented to estimate the dynamics of of the vegetation cover condition caused by wildfires throughout the Russian Federation and in its individual regions. An approach to the use of remote sensing and geoinformatics methods for monitoring the impact of wildfires on the state of various types of vegetation cover without involving ground truth data is proposed. Potential for using a normalized burn ratio index to estimate the degree of vegetation damage and recovery process using low-resolution satellite data is demonstrated. It was established that the total area of burned vegatation over the country ranged from 68.40 to 234.46 thousand km(2) per year for the period from 2002 till 2017. Seasonal peaks of fire activity, patterns of the spatial distribution of fire sources, and the main types of burned vegetation were identified for each of the eight federal districts of Russia. The accuracy of burned areas detection was estimated as 75-81% depending on the information product used according to the low (500 m) and average (30 m) spatial resolution data.

TI  - Evaluation of evapotranspiration variations according to soil type using multivariate statistical analysis
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that the soil type and its characteristics are very important to the agriculture and to maintain the health of a forest. Thus, the objective of this work was to verify, through multivariate statistical analysis techniques, the variations of evapotranspiration values as a function of the soil type in three different vegetation cover areas: sugarcane, planted forest and native forest. For this, an area of 2231.926 km(2) was chosen, using monthly Landsat 8 satellite imagery with Orbit/Path 220 and Point/Row 75, between latitudes 20 degrees 43'55.2 '' S and 22 degrees 36'28.8 '' S and longitudes 46 degrees 37'48,0 '' W and 48 degrees 50'16,8 '' W, in the region of Corumbatai, northeast of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, collected over 24 months between April 2013 and March 2015. The evapotranspiration evaluation was obtained by satellite imagery using a hybrid model of the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB), with a proposed adjustment methodology to convert hourly ET to monthly and annually data. The multivariate statistical analysis of monthly ET patterns across soil type classified three evapotranspiration groups in the three studied land cover areas. In the areas with sugarcane, evapotranspiration separated statistical groups in the areas of the Cerrado biome with Ferralsol (LVA) and Lithic Leptosol (RL), another group in the areas with Ferralsol (LV) and Ferralic Arenosol (RQ), and a third group of Acrisol (PVA) in an Atlantic Forest biome area. In the areas with planted forest and native forest, evapotranspiration separated a first group with soils LVA, RQ, PVA, Dystric Gleysol (GX) and RL in areas of Cerrado, a second group with LV in Atlantic Forest area and a third group just with Fibric Histosol (OY).

TI  - Canopy Height Estimation from Single Multispectral 2D Airborne Imagery Using Texture Analysis and Machine Learning in Structurally Rich Temperate Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height is a fundamental biophysical and structural parameter, crucial for biodiversity monitoring, forest inventory and management, and a number of ecological and environmental studies and applications. It is a determinant for linking the classification of land cover to habitat categories towards building one-to-one relationships. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or 3D Stereoscopy are the commonly used and most accurate remote sensing approaches to measure canopy height. However, both require significant time and budget resources. This study proposes a cost-effective methodology for canopy height approximation using texture analysis on a single 2D image. An object-oriented approach is followed using land cover (LC) map as segmentation vector layer to delineate landscape objects. Global texture feature descriptors are calculated for each land cover object and used as variables in a number of classifiers, including single and ensemble trees, and support vector machines. The aim of the analysis is the discrimination among classes in a wide range of height values used for habitat mapping (from less than 5 cm to 40 m). For that task, different spatial resolutions are tested, representing a range from airborne to spaceborne quality ones, as well as their combinations, forming a multiresolution training set. Multiple dataset alternatives are formed based on the missing data handling, outlier removal, and data normalization techniques. The approach was applied using orthomosaics from DMC II airborne images, and evaluated against a reference LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM). Results reached overall object-based accuracies of 67% with the percentage of total area correctly classified exceeding 88%. Sentinel-2 simulation and multiresolution analysis (MRA) experiments achieved even higher accuracies of up to 85% and 91%, respectively, at reduced computational cost, showing potential in terms of transferability of the framework to large spatial scales.

TI  - On Evaluating the Depth of Soil Freezing Based on SMOS Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of a comparative analysis of the brightness temperatures obtained by the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite and the soil-freezing depths corresponding to them, which were measured at weather stations located on test sites of the Kulunda plain, are presented. Based on daily satellite measurements of brightness temperatures, the influence of soil-freezing processes on the microwave radiation of the underlying surface has been studied. Using a model of microwave radiation of a plane-layered inhomogeneous nonisothermal medium, a theoretical calculation of the dependence of the brightness temperature of the soil on the depth of freezing has been performed. Real soil parameters of the Kulunda plain and climatic characteristics of the studied areas obtained at weather stations during the same period were used as input parameters of the model. According to the analysis of satellite and field data, as well as model calculations, it follows that, to estimate the depth of freezing of the soil from daily satellite microwave radiometry data, it is necessary to know the date on which the freezing of the soil cover begins, as well as the dielectric characteristics of frozen and unfrozen soil in those areas where the SMOS product is issued by brightness temperature. Based on satellite data and a model of microwave radiation of the soil with the upper frozen layer, a method for determining the depth of freezing of the soil cover is proposed.

TI  - The image of a Horse in Yakut and Khakass Heroic Epic: Based on Yakut Olonkho and Khakass Alyptyh Nymah
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to a comparative analysis of the image of the epic horse in the texts of two related Turkic epics. The material for the research in a comparative aspect was the texts of the Yakut epic "The Girl-Warrior of Dzhyrybyna Dzhyrylyatta with a milk-white horse" by P. P. Yadrikhinsky - Bedjeele and "Son of the Horse Dyyray Warrior" by I. I. Burnasheva - Tong Suorun; Khakass epic "Altyn-Aryg" by S. P. Kadyshev and "Ai-Khuuchin" by P. V. Kurbizhekov. The choice of these texts is due to the fact that their academic publications are equipped with a good reference apparatus, as well as the presence of facing Russian translation and relatively equal volume of texts. The relevance of the study is determined by the increasing interest in the comparative study of Turkic epics. The subject of this study is the image of an epic horse from the texts of the Yakut olonkho and Khakass alyptyh nymah. The purpose of this article is to identify the commonality and differences in the images of the epic horse in the epics of related Turkic peoples. In order to achieve this objective,.ontrastive-.omparative and comparative-historical methods were used to identify the general and specific in the Turkic epics and a descriptive method that allows us to more deeply characterize the image of the epic horse taking into account the worldview and mentality of these peoples. The analysis showed that the horse is present in all the main events of the life of the epic bogatyr accompanying him in all significant events. A commonplace in the image of a horse for the Yakut and Khakass heroic epics is a beautiful description of a horse, loyalty and power of a horse, as well as its ability to speak in human language. A wide variety of horse's colors in epics indicates good knowledge of Turkic peoples in horse breeding. The image of the horse, which had a major impact, refers to the archetypal symbols of the culture of the Turkic people.

TI  - For the longest Way: Layers in Space Layers produced by Electroplating and Sputtering meet extreme Requirements
T2  - VAKUUM IN FORSCHUNG UND PRAXIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin films for space application have to operate under extreme conditions, reworks or replacement of components in general is not possible. The main challenges are extreme temperatures, bombardment by energetic particles (ionizing radiation) and sometimes mechanical stress. The toolbox" of deposition processes ranges from Atomic Layer Deposition to low pressure plasma processes to electroplating. Due to its low specific weight carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) is an often used construction material for space applications. The uniform deposition of copper on CFRP waveguides for the RADAR antennas of the Sentinel satellites has been an impressive demonstration for the generation of functional surfaces on complex shaped 3D substrates by electrochemical processes. Sometimes optimal solutions require hybrid processes. A heat reflector on components for the BepiColombo mission investigating the Hermean environment has been realized by a combination of sputtering and electroplating. Systems in space often have to observe with high precision and therefore need eagle eyes". The continuous development of magnetron sputter technology during the past 10 years has enabled the deposition of optical interference systems with hundreds of individual layers and thickness precision in the +/- 0,15 % range. As examples a beam splitter and a band pass filter for space missions are presented.

TI  - Seasonality of Surface Urban Heat Island in Delhi City Region Measured by Local Climate Zones and Conventional Indicators
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization can change the local climate of an area, one manifestation of which is a rise in the local temperature of built-up areas, a phenomenon known as an urban heat island. The thermal response of built-up areas in comparison to natural areas is quantified in terms of surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity. The work presented here evaluates the seasonal SUHI intensities in Delhi using local climate zones (LCZs) and conventional SUHI indicators in parallel. Statistical analyses are carried out to determine the relationship between them and to delineate heat stressed zones in the Delhi city region. The present study is the first one that utilizes LCZs for seasonal SUHI analysis in Delhi. The land surface temperature (LST) is assessed using a hundred and five night-time images from MODIS. Unambiguous night-time SUHI effect is seen for all seasons. The maximum night-time SUHI intensity is 3.5 degrees C, between "compact low-rise" (LCZ 3) and "low plants" (LCZ D) in summer and winter. The conventional indicator "Inside urban-Inside rural" gives the highest night-time SUHI intensity of 3.3 degrees C, in autumn. Statistical analyses show that "compact low-rise" (LCZ3) and "large low-rise" (LCZ8) are the most heat-stressed LCZs. The largest number of distinct thermal zones is created in the monsoon, followed by summer and winter. The results suggest that in order to minimize the UHI effect, further urban expansion in the Delhi region should be restricted to LCZ 5 (open mid-rise) and LCZ 6 (open low-rise).

TI  - Matching of TerraSAR-X derived ground control points to optical image patches using deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites like TerraSAR-X are capable of acquiring images exhibiting an absolute geolocation accuracy within a few centimeters, mainly because of the availability of precise orbit information and by compensating range delay errors due to atmospheric conditions. In contrast, satellite images from optical missions generally exhibit comparably low geolocation accuracies because of the propagation of errors in angular measurements over large distances. However, a variety of remote sensing applications, such as change detection, surface movement monitoring or ice flow measurements, require precisely geo-referenced and co-registered satellite images. By using Ground Control Points (GCPs) derived from TerraSAR-X, the absolute geolocation accuracy of optical satellite images can be improved. For this purpose, the corresponding matching points in the optical images need to be localized. In this paper, a deep learning based approach is investigated for an automated matching of SAR-derived GCPs to optical image elements. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is pretrained with medium resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and fine-tuned on precisely co-registered TerraSAR-X and Pleiades training image pairs to learn a common descriptor representation. By using these descriptors, the similarity of SAR and optical image patches can be calculated. This similarity metric is then used in a sliding window approach to identify the matching points in the optical reference image. Subsequently, the derived points can be utilized for co-registration of the underlying images. The network is evaluated over nine study areas showing airports and their rural surroundings from several different countries around the world. The results show that based on TerraSAR-X-derived GCPs, corresponding points in the optical image can automatically and reliably be identified with a pixel-level localization accuracy.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellites Provide Near-Real Time Evaluation of Catastrophic Floods in the West Mediterranean
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is among the most common natural disasters in our planet and one of the main causes of economic and human life loss worldwide. Evidence suggests the increase of floods at European scale with the Mediterranean coast being critically vulnerable to this risk. The devastating event in the West Mediterranean during the second week of September 2019 is a clear case of this risk crystallization, when a record-breaking flood (locally called the "Cold Drop" (Gota Fria)) has swollen into a catastrophe to the southeast of Spain surpassing previous all-time records. By using a straightforward approach with the Sentinel-2 twin satellites from the Copernicus Programme and the ACOLITE atmospheric correction processor, an initial approximation of the delineated flooded zones, including agriculture and urban areas, was accomplished in quasi-real time. The robust and flexible approach requires no ancillary data for rapid implementation. A composite of pre- and post-flood images was obtained to identify change detection and mask water pixels. Sentinel-2 identifies not only impacts on land but also on water ecosystem and its services, providing information on water quality deterioration and concentration of suspended matter in highly sensitive environments. Subsequent water quality deterioration occurred in large portions of Mar Menor, the largest coastal lagoon in the Mediterranean. The present study demonstrates the potentials brought by the free and open-data policy of Sentinel-2, a valuable source of rapid synoptic spatio-temporal information at the local or regional scale to support scientists, managers, stakeholders, and society in general during and after the emergency.

TI  - Modelling Stand Variables of Beech Coppice Forest Using Spectral Sentinel-2A Data and the Machine Learning Approach
T2  - SEEFOR-SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: Coppice forests have a particular socio-economic and ecological role in forestry and environmental management. Their production sustainability and spatial stability become imperative for forestry sector as well as for local and global communities. Recently, integrated forest inventory and remotely sensed data analysed with non-parametrical statistical methods have enabled more detailed insight into forest structural characteristics. The aim of this research was to estimate forest attributes of beech coppice forest stands in the Sarajevo Canton through the integration of inventory and Sentinel S2A satellite data using machine learning methods.Materials and Methods: Basal area, mean stand diameter, growing stock and total volume data were determined from the forest inventory designed for represented stands of coppice forests. Spectral data were collected from bands of Sentinel S2A satellite image, vegetation indices (difference, normalized difference and ratio vegetation index) and biophysical variables (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, leaf area index, fraction of vegetation cover, chlorophyll content in the leaf and canopy water content). Machine learning rule-based M5 model tree (M5P) and random forest (RF) methods were used for forest attribute estimation. Predictor subset selection was based on wrapping assuming M5P and RF learning schemes. Models were developed on training data subsets (402 sample plots) and evaluations were performed on validation data subsets (207 sample plots). Performance of the models was evaluated by the percentage of the root mean squared error over the mean value (rRMSE) and the square of the correlation coefficient between the observed and estimated stand variables.Results and Conclusions: Predictor subset selection resulted in a varied number of predictors for forest attributes and methods with their larger contribution in RI (between 8 and 11). Spectral biophysical variables dominated in subsets. The RI resulted in smaller errors for training sets for all attributes than M5P, while both methods delivered very high errors for validation sets (rRMSE above 50%). The lowest rRMSE of 50% was obtained for stand basal area. The observed variability explained by the M5P and RF models in training subsets was about 30% and 95% respectively, but those values were lower in test subsets (below 12%) but still significant. Differences of the sample and modelled forest attribute means were not significant, while modelled variability for all forest attributes was significantly lower (p<0.01). It seems that additional information is needed to increase prediction accuracy, so stand information (management classes, site class, soil type, canopy closure and others), new sampling strategy and new spectral products could be integrated and examined in further more complex modelling of forest attributes.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice by the object-based random forest method using time series Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the world's major staple foods, especially in China. In this study, we proposed an object-based random forest (RF) method for paddy rice mapping using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) was used to blend MODIS and Sentinel-2 data for achieving multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Subsequently, the Savitzky-Golay filter (S-G) was applied to smooth the time series Sentinel-2 NDVI data. And the phenological parameters were derived from the filtered time series NDVI using the threshold method. Then, the optimum feature combination for paddy mapping was formed on the basis of Sentinel-2 MSI images, time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, phenology data and time series Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering images by using the J(Bh) distance. Finally, an object-based Random Forest classifier was used to extract paddy rice with the optimum feature combination. The result showed that fused Sentinel-2 NDVI time series using RASTFM has a high correlation with the original Sentinel-2 image. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the classification results are higher than 95% and 0.93, respectively, when use the optimum feature combination and object-based RF method. The proposed method can provide technology support for rice mapping in areas with a lot of cloudy and rainy weathers. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting In-Season Crop Nitrogen Stress of Corn for Field Trials Using UAV- and CubeSat-Based Multispectral Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer management is one of the main concerns for precision agriculture under corn production, which aims to not only maximize the profits, but also ensure environmental sustainability. Effective N fertilizer management can either avoid N stress or provide timely and accurate detection of in-season N stress for remedies. Traditional N trial experiments to evaluate different N management practices have to wait until harvest, and do not allow tracking of when and how N stress develops. Meanwhile, rapidly developed remote sensing technology offers new opportunities for in-season evaluation of N status and detection of N stress for crops, including both the unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV)-based and satellite-based multispectral sensing. In this study, we collected weekly multispectral images of UAV and Planet Lab's CubeSat, as well as various other ground measurements for an experimental cornfield that included 28 N management treatments in Central Illinois, 2017. We found that both the UAV- and CubeSat-based multispectral sensors were able to detect N stress at vegetative stages before tasseling, and could detect changes in the level of N stress through derived chlorophyll index green (CIg) for different N management practices. The CubeSat-based CIg showed high consistency with the UAV-based CIg (correlation above 0.9), which indicated the potential of CubeSat-based CIg to be applied for N stress detection at a larger spatial scale. This study demonstrates that the UAV- and CubeSat-based multispectral sensing has the promising potential to monitor N stress of corn throughout the growing season, which may assist decision making of N management.

TI  - Effect of Satellite Temporal Resolution on Long-Term Suspended Particulate Matter in Inland Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal resolution of satellite determines how well remote sensing products represent changes in the lake environments and influences the practical applications by end-users. Here, a resampling method was used to reproduce the suspended particulate matter (SPM) dataset in 43 large lakes (>50 km(2)) on the eastern China plain during 2003-2017 at different temporal resolutions using MODIS Aqua (MODISA) based on Google Earth Engine platform, then to address the impact of temporal resolution on the long-term SPM dataset. Differences between the MODISA-derived and reproduced SPM dataset at longer temporal resolution were higher in the areas with large water dynamics. The spatial and temporal distributions of the differences were driven by unfavorable observation environments during satellite overpasses such as high cloud cover, and rapid changes in water quality, such as water inundation, algae blooms, and macrophytes. Furthermore, the annual mean difference in SPM ranged from 5-10% when the temporal difference was less than 10 d, and the differences in summer and autumn were higher than that of other seasons and surpassed 20% when the temporal resolution was more than 16 d. To assure that difference were less than 10% for long-term satellite-derived SPM datasets, the minimal requirement of temporal resolution should be within 5 d for most of the inland lakes and 3 d for lakes with large changes in water quality. This research can be used to not only evaluate the reliability of historically remote sensing products but also provide a reference for planning field campaigns and applying of high spatial resolution satellite missions to monitor aquatic systems in the future.

TI  - Common snook juveniles, <i>Centropomus undecimalis</i>, as biomonitor organisms to evaluate cytogenotoxicity effects of surface estuarine water from Southern Brazil
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Centropomus undecimalis fish inhabit the highly contaminated Santos-Sao Vicente Estuarine System (SESS) and could be a good biomonitor of contaminants. This study aimed to investigate the cytogenotoxic potential of superficial water from SESS using C. undecimalis as a biomonitoring model and to validate the use of farmed fish as controls. Using biochemical (DNA damage and Lipid Peroxidation - LPO), cellular (erythrocyte nuclear abnormality - ENA) and tissue (8-OHdG immunoexpression) biomarkers, our results showed fish from SEES had higher LPO concentration in gills and higher frequency of reniform, lobed and total ENA in erythrocytes when compared with control farmed fish. Thus, SESS surface water are cytogenotoxic for blood and gills cells of fishes. C. undecimalis has shown to be a good biomonitor model and farmed fish can be used as control only if livers were not the target organs of study since the dietary food from fanned fish causes steatosis.

TI  - Cassin's Auklet (<i>Ptychoramphus aleuticus</i>) Population Size, Reproduction, and Habitat Management on a Recently Colonized Island in California, USA
T2  - WATERBIRDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Responses to climate change by seabirds in the North Pacific may include range restrictions and require colonizing new habitats. To inform conservation actions supporting climate adaptations, we examined the colonization of Ano Nuevo Island, a nearshore island in central California, by Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). We quantified population growth, reproduction, band returns, mortality, and habitat metrics from 1995-2017 and described habitat management that facilitated colony persistence. Cassin's Auklet breeding population grew to 136 birds by 2014, despite population declines during 2005-2007 and 2016-2017 concurrent with reproductive failures and die-offs that affected Cassin's Auklets regionally. Annual productivity of this small colony was similar to larger populations in the region at 0.72 +/- 0.23 SD chicks fledged per pair from 1999-2017 (n = 15 years). Band returns indicated population connectivity with the Farallon Islands, California. Annual rates of burrow damage were 14 +/- 8%, with up to 30% damaged a year. Habitat management to prevent erosion damage to nesting burrows included sea lion exclusion, erosion control, and ceramic artificial burrows. Describing conditions that facilitated the colonization and growth of this Cassin's Auklet breeding site can inform actions that support other locations and multiple burrowing seabird species.

TI  - Evaporation process study through in situ and remote sensing data at Tres Quebradas Salt flat
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The calculation of evaporation (Ev) is a fundamental process on the planning of investment for nonmetallic mining in salt flats. Dispose to reliable estimates of evaporation allows to reduce one of the main uncertainties of the flow models in this type of basin. This paper focuses on the calculation of Ev in the Tres Quebradas saltflat, Catamarca (Argentina), applying Priestley-Taylor model whit satellite data. Study area comprises the Tres Quebradas and Verde lagoons, and a central evaporite zone. Satellite data (CERES and OLI-Landsat 8), meteorological information, brine density measurements, evaporation measurements, and spectral signatures to calculations were used. The lagoons evaporation was estimated and by means of a Class A evaporation pan validated. The evaporation control in evaporite zones also was studied using a phreatic level function. Ev values of 1302 mm year(-1) and 1249 mm year(-1) for the Tres Quebradas and Verde lagoons were obtained, respectively, similar to Class A evaporation pan values measured. In the case of evaporite zones, an average annual value of 152 mm year(-1) was estimated, regulated by the phreatic level. In summary, an average annual of system water loss by evaporation of 1.31 +/- 0.32 m(3)s(-1) was obtained, where more than 80% corresponds to the Tres Quebradas and Verde lagoons, and the rest to the central evaporite zone. The results achieved are consistent and will be used as input data in the numerical flow modeling to the estimation of the lithium brine reserve of the salt flats.

TI  - Flood Monitoring Based on the Study of Sentinel-1 SAR Images: The Ebro River Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is the most widespread hydrological hazard worldwide that affects water management, nature protection, economic activities, hydromorphological alterations on ecosystem services, and human health. The mitigation of the risks associated with flooding requires a certain management of flood zones, sustained by data and information about the events with the help of flood maps with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution. This paper presents the potential use of the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images as a powerful tool for flood mapping applied in the event of extraordinary floods that occurred during the month of April 2018 in the Ebro (Spain). More specifically, in this study, we describe accurate and robust processing that allows real-time flood extension maps to be obtained, which is essential for risk mitigation. Evaluating the different Sentinel-1 parameters, our analysis shows that the best results on the final flood mapping for this study area were obtained using VH (Vertical-Horizontal) polarization configuration and Lee filtering 7 x 7 window sizes. Two methods were applied to flood maps from Sentinel-1 SAR images: (1) RGB (Red, Green, Blue color model) composition based on the differences between the pre- and post-event images; and (2) the calibration threshold technique or binarization based on histogram backscatter values. When comparing our flood maps with the flood areas digitalized from vertical aerial photographs, done by the Hydrological Planning Office of the Ebro Hydrographic Confederation, the results were coincident. The result of the flooding map obtained with the RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) image were compared with the layers with different return periods (10, 50, 100, and 500 years) for a selected zone of the study area of SNCZI (National Flood Zone Mapping System in Spain). It was found that the images are consistent and correspond to a flood between 10 and 50 years of return. In view of the results obtained, the usefulness of Sentinel-1 images as baseline data for the improvement of the methodological guide is appreciated, and should be used as a new source of input, calibration, and validation for hydrological models to improve the accuracy of flood risk maps.

TI  - Hydrological Impacts of Large Fires and Future Climate: Modeling Approach Supported by Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires have significant impacts on soil erosion and water supply that may be exacerbated by future climate. The aims of this study were: To simulate the effects of a large fire event in the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model previously calibrated to a medium-sized watershed in Portugal; and to predict the hydrological impacts of large fires and future climate on water supply and soil erosion. For this, post-fire recovery was parametrized in SWAT based on satellite information, namely, the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The impact of future climate was based on four regional climate models under the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and high emission (RCP 8.5) scenarios, focusing on mid-century projections (2020-2049) compared to a historical period (1970-1999). Future large fire events (>3000 ha) were predicted from a multiple linear regression model, which uses the daily severity rating (DSR) fire weather index, precipitation anomaly, and burnt area in the previous three years; and subsequently simulated in SWAT under each climate model/scenario. Results suggest that time series of satellite indices are useful to inform SWAT about vegetation growth and post-fire recovery processes. Different land cover types require different time periods for returning to the pre-fire fraction of vegetation cover, ranging from 3 years for pines, eucalypts, and shrubs, to 6 years for sparsely vegetated low scrub. Future climate conditions are expected to include an increase in temperatures and a decrease in precipitation with marked uneven seasonal distribution, and this will likely trigger the growth of burnt area and an increased frequency of large fires, even considering differences across climate models. The future seasonal pattern of precipitation will have a strong influence on river discharge, with less water in the river during spring, summer, and autumn, but more discharge in winter, the latter being exacerbated under the large fire scenario. Overall, the decrease in water supply is more influenced by climate change, whereas soil erosion increase is more dependent on fire, although with a slight increase under climate change. These results emphasize the need for adaptation measures that target the combined hydrological consequences of future climate, fires, and post-fire vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Sentinel-lymph-node mapping with indocyanine green in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for early endometrial cancer: a retrospective analysis
T2  - FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The therapeutic value of lymphadenectomy in early stage endometrial cancer (EC) is still debated. Sentinel-h mph-node identified with indocyanine green (ICG) can replace lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer minimizing the potential morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to analyze our initial experience using indocyanine green for sentinel-lymph-node mapping in a minimally robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach with Da Vinci XI near-infrared (MR) fluorescence imaging system.Methods: A total of 23 patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery with the Da Vinci Xi Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunny ale, CA, USA) with NM imaging and ICG fluorescence detection for early stage EC were retrospectively analyzed.Results: Sentinel-lymph-node mapping was achieved in 18 patients for a detection rate of 78.26%, bilateral pelvic detection was possible in 14 patients (60.9%) and no sentinel-lymph-node mapping was noted in 4 patients (17.4%). We compared 11 patients (Group 1) at intermediate and high- risk of recurrence who underwent sentinel-lymphnode mapping and pelvic lymphadenectomy and 12 patients (Group 2) at low risk of recurrence who underwent only sentinel-lymph-node mapping. A statistically significant difference was found for the average operation time and for the hospital stays.Conclusion: The high detection rate, absence of intraoperative or postoperative complications, the short time required for mapping and removal of the sentinel-lymph-nodes and the short duration of the hospital stay, support performing sentinel-lymph-node in all women with early endometrial cancer.

TI  - Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Tumour Size is Associated with Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in a Cohort of 69 Patients
T2  - ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten to fifty percent of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma may potentially metastasize. However, the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy remains controversial for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors associated with sentinel lymph node positivity. A bicentric retrospective analysis was conducted between January 2006 and January 2018. All patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were included, based on the criteria of the prognostic classification of the French Society of Dermatology. Seventy-four patients were included. Five (6.8%) procedures failed. Of the 69 patients assessed, the positive sentinel lymph node biopsy rate was 11.6% (n = 8) with a false negative rate of 5.7% (n = 4). The positivity of sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with tumour size (p = 0.0194). Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an effective staging procedure for clinically N0 high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, with an acceptable morbidity. To date, 2 risk factors of sentinel lymph node positivity have been identified with statistical significance: tumour size and poor tumour differentiation.

TI  - An Integrative Framework of Environmental Education for Environmental Crisis Transformation
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Though there are currently many perspectives on environmental education, they generally fail to address large gaps in linking education between natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities. As a result, recently developed environmental education management practices are inconsistent in sociocultural contexts, especially in Thailand where there are many environmental agencies and indigenous groups with their own unique worldviews. To address this issue, this mixed methodology study developed an integrative framework of environmental education based on the integral theory and worldviews of various stakeholders in Thailand. Results showed that the proposed integrative framework thoroughly addressed three holistic measures as well as five components of environmental literacy. The holistic measures consisted of behavioral change, social change, and personal change, whereas, the five components of environmental literacy included competencies (knowledge and skills in scientific and sociocultural aspects), spiritual growth (knowledge and skills in humanities), participation (norms of action), attitudes (proper character traits), and awareness (value awareness). This study not only fills gaps between various perspectives of environmental education, but also provides a shift from the reductionistic approach to a more holistic one when addressing the world's complex environmental crises, especially on personalized and localized contexts.

TI  - Long-term validation of MODIS C6 and C6.1 Dark Target aerosol products over China using CARSNET and AERONET
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 006 (C6) and 061 (C6.1) Dark Target (DT) 10 km aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China during 2002-2014. Considering that sparse Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites are available in China, 18 sites from China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) were also used to conduct this validation. The results showed that C6.1 DT outperform C6 with 59.03% of the retrievals falling within the expected error (EE) compared to C6 (54.94%). Meanwhile, C6.1 DT achieved a reduced RMSE of 0.171, a higher R of 0.901 and a bias closer to 0 relative to C6 (RMSE: 0.185; R: 0.890). When the validation was conducted over different underlying surfaces, C6 DT overestimated AOD by 19.8%, with only 45.01% of the retrievals within the EE over urban sites, whereas C6.1 showed clear improvements, with 11.8% more data falling within the EE. Hardly any improvement was observed in C6.1 over forest, cropland, and grassland sites. The C6.1 DT exhibited more significant improvements over Beijing area and northern China than southern China. The highest retrieval accuracy of 61.05% among the four Beijing sites was achieved at Beijing_CARSNET, but the improvements were lower than other Beijing sites. The extent of the improvements was positively correlated with the percentage of urban pixels over the sites in Beijing and northern China in terms of the retrieval accuracy. Moreover, C6.1 DT had a little effect on improvements over southern China and showed reduced collocation over coastal cities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Molecular phenotyping and image-guided surgical treatment of melanoma using spectrally distinct ultrasmall core-shell silica nanoparticles
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate detection and quantification of metastases in regional lymph nodes remain a vital prognostic predictor for cancer staging and clinical outcomes. As intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major hurdle to effective treatment planning, more reliable image-guided, cancer-targeted optical multiplexing tools are critically needed in the operative suite. For sentinel lymph node mapping indications, accurately interrogating distinct molecular signatures on cancer cells in vivo with differential levels of sensitivity and specificity remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges and demonstrate sensitivity to detecting micrometastases, we developed batches of spectrally distinct 6-nm near-infrared fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, each batch surface-functionalized with different melanoma targeting ligands. Along with PET imaging, particles accurately detected and molecularly phenotyped cancerous nodes in a spontaneous melanoma miniswine model using image-guided multiplexing tools. Information afforded from these tools offers the potential to not only improve the accuracy of targeted disease removal and patient safety, but to transform surgical decision-making for oncological patients.

TI  - Detecting subtle alteration information from ASTER data using a multifractal-based method: A case study from Wuliang Mountain, SW China
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely used to interpret hydrothermal alteration zones and it can support the geological field mapping, which is very useful for mineral exploration in inaccessible regions. However, the alteration information in covered terrains is usually not strong enough to be detected using traditional remote sensing methods, so how to efficiently detect subtle alteration information remains a challenging task. In this study, the multifractal theory-based Spectrum-Area (S-A) method is used for the processing of remote sensing data and the new method of "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + S-A" is proposed as a tool to interpret hydrothermal alteration beneath covered areas. In order to test the efficiency of this method, the "PCA + S-A" method was compared with the traditionally used PCA method based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. The Wuliang Mountain in the Yunnan Province of SW China, a rugged terrain with high altitudes and dense vegetation coverage, was selected as a case study to detect information on chlorite, epidote, biotite, and muscovite alteration, respectively. The following field survey and petrographic studies reveal that: (1) the average detection accuracy of the "PCA + S-A" method is 90.80%, 9.34% higher than that of the PCA method; (2) in the covered areas where the traditional PCA method cannot detect any subtle hydrothermal alteration, the "PCA + S-A" method can be successfully applied; and (3) in those areas where the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is greater than 0.8, the detection of subtle hydrothermal alteration using the proposed method is inefficient, which requires further studies.

TI  - Dynamics of atmospheric carbon dioxide over different land cover types in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an analysis of high-resolution space borne retrievals of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (X-CO2) and the role of vegetation in controlling atmospheric CO2 dynamics over the Indian region. Nadir and glint mode XCO2 retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) spectrometer for the period September 2014-July 2017 are studied with satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainfall over different land cover types. The atmospheric XCO2 variability shows a strong negative correlation with satellite-derived NDVI. Higher rainfall favours the vegetative growth and photosynthetic activity, thus lowers atmospheric XCO2 concentration. The mean monthly XCO2 over terrestrial region of India is observed as 400.18 +/- 3.85 ppm with seasonal variations over different land cover types. The correlation of XCO2 with NDVI over mixed forest and deciduous broadleaf forest types was estimated as - 0.86, - 0.76 (p < 0.01), respectively. The study could also highlight strong seasonal XCO2 variability at higher latitudinal zones of India. It is significant to note that space-based observations indicate that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have surpassed a significant milestone of 400 ppm in recent times. The study provides significant inputs towards improving our understanding of terrestrial biogeochemical carbon cycle over India.

TI  - First-Time Estimation of HCHO Column over Asia using Multiple Regression with OMI and MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A multiple regression method (MRM) is used for the first time with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to estimate formaldehyde (HCHO) column over Asia in two categorized areas: (1) anthropogenic areas in East Asia (east-central China, Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo) and (2) biogenic and pyrogenic areas (Indochina and South Borneo). In order to determine the multiple regression equations (MREs) for each study area, monthly mean and daily values of Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level, land surface temperature (LST), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and fire radiative power (FRP) from 2005 to 2006 were used as independent variable candidates and monthly mean and daily HCHO measured by OMI (HCHOOMI) for the same period was used as the dependent variable. The MREs estimated HCHO (HCHOMRM) with inputs of independent variable data for from 2005 to 2006 whereas they estimated HCHO (HCHOVAL) with inputs of independent variable data in 2007. The agreement between HCHOOMI and HCHOVAL is comparable with that between HCHOOMI and HCHOMRM in both monthly and daily scale. The average correlation coefficient, slope, mean bias, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and percent difference between monthly HCHOOMI and monthly HCHOVAL (between daily HCHOOMI and daily HCHOMRM) are 0.89 (0.58), 0.77 (0.34), -0.82 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) (-0.91 x 10(15) molecules cm-2), 1.28 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) (3.01 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2)), 1.75 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) (4.32 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2)), 10.2% (24.1%). MRM can be a useful tool to provide HCHO in certain area in Asia.

TI  - In situ and remotely sensed temperature comparisons on a Central Pacific atoll
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-induced warming events increasingly threaten coral reefs, heightening the need for accurate quantification of baseline temperatures and thermal stress in these ecosystems. To assess the strengths and weaknesses of NOAA satellite sea surface temperature and in situ measurements, we compared 5 yr of these data on Kiritimati atoll, in the central equatorial Pacific. We find that (1) satellite measurements were similar to in situ measurements (~10 m depth), albeit slightly warmer, with measurements converging once above Kiritimati's maximum monthly mean; (2) in situ loggers detected subsurface cooling events missed by satellites; (3) thermal baselines and anomalies were consistent around the island; and (4) in situ degree heating week (DHW) calculations were most comparable to NOAA DHWs when calculated using NOAA's climatology. These results suggest that NOAA's satellite products accurately reflect conditions on central Pacific reefs, but that in situ measurements can identify localized events, such as subsurface upwelling, that may be ecologically relevant for corals.

TI  - Marine biology of the pacific lamprey <i>Entosphenus tridentatus</i>
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Pacific lamprey Entosphenus tridentatus has an anadromous life cycle that begins with larvae that filter-feed in freshwater, followed by transformation into juveniles that migrate to the ocean where they parasitize hosts, and adults that migrate into freshwater to spawn and die. The marine-phase (i.e., juvenile life stage) is important yet poorly understood, and is associated with growth opportunities to achieve maximum body size and recruitment. The four goals of this paper are to: (1) synthesize the literature to identify patterns in the marine biology of Pacific lamprey; (2) develop hypotheses to explain these patterns; (3) identify limiting factors and threats, and (4) identify research needs. We hypothesize that recruitment of adult lamprey to spawning populations is influenced by oceanographic regimes through impacts on host abundance. Three marine factors that may be limiting lamprey abundance include: (1) predation and fisheries bycatch; (2) host availability; and (3) host contaminant loads. Four potential marine-related threats to lamprey include: (1) pollution; (2) climate change; (3) unfavorable oceanographic regimes; and (4) the effects of interactions between climate and regimes. Pacific lamprey is not philopatric and the extent to which host migrations and other factors influence lamprey entry into rivers is unclear. Research is needed to fill information gaps on how, when, why, and where lamprey move, feed, and grow in the ocean. Their widespread distribution, parasitic life history, diverse hosts, and multiple predators suggest that Pacific lamprey is integrated into diverse marine ecosystems.

TI  - The ethos of competition: polyphonic strategies of legitimation of Rafael Correa in the "Citizen Links"
T2  - CHASQUI-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE COMUNICACION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the government of Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2007-2017), the program Citizen Link functioned as one of the main government communication devices. At the end of this program, Jose Maldonado, a native of Peguche, read a summary of these in Kichwa. During this summary, and in general in the program, Correa and Maldonado exchanged comments and jokes, often focused on a dispute about the competence in the Kichwa language. The objective of this work, which will be based in some categories of discourse analysis and focus on the Links made in the indigenous community of Zumbahua, will be to demonstrate that the Ecuadorian president uses several polyphonic strategies to reinforce an ethos of competition in relation to the Kichwa language and the indigenous worldview.

TI  - Assessing the Feasibility of Using Sentinel-2 Imagery to Quantify the Impact of Heatwaves on Irrigated Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heatwaves are common in many viticultural regions of Australia. We evaluated the potential of satellite-based remote sensing to detect the effects of high temperatures on grapevines in a South Australian vineyard over the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. The study involved: (i) comparing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from medium- and high-resolution satellite images; (ii) determining correlations between environmental conditions and vegetation indices (Vis); and (iii) identifying VIs that best indicate heatwave effects. Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman testing showed a significant agreement between the NDVI of high- and medium-resolution imagery (R = 0.74, estimated difference -0.093). The band and the VI most sensitive to changes in environmental conditions were 705 nm and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), both of which correlated with relative humidity (R = 0.65 and R = 0.62, respectively). Conversely, SWIR (short wave infrared, 1610 nm) exhibited a negative correlation with growing degree days (R = -0.64). The analysis of heat stress showed that green and red edge bands-the chlorophyll absorption ratio index (CARI) and transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio index (TCARI)-were negatively correlated with thermal environmental parameters such as air and soil temperature and growing degree days (GDDs). The red and red edge bands-the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and CARI2-were correlated with relative humidity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of using medium-resolution imagery for the detection of heat stress on grapevines in irrigated vineyards.

TI  - The Place for Religious Content in Clinical Ethics Consultations: A Reply to Janet Malek
T2  - HEC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Janet Malek (HEC Forum 31(2):91-102, 2019) argues that a "clinical ethics consultant's religious worldview has no place in developing ethical recommendations or communicating about them with patients, surrogates, and clinicians." She offers five types of arguments in support of this thesis: arguments from (i) consensus, (ii) clarity, (iii) availability, (iv) consistency, and (v) autonomy. This essay shows that there are serious problems for each of Malek's arguments. None of them is sufficient to motivate her thesis (nor are they jointly sufficient). Thus, if it is true that the religious worldview of clinical ethics consultants (CECs) should play no role whatsoever in their work as consultants, this claim will need to be defended on some other ground.

AB  - BACKGROUND Mohs micrographic surgeons should be adept in identifying and managing perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and single-cell spread (SCS), features denoting high-risk behavior of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC).OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article is to review the literature and guidelines regarding the diagnosis of PNI, LVI, and SCS in BCC, cSCC, and MAC and examine the role of advanced diagnostic studies, adjuvant therapy, and reconstructive techniques of these high-risk tumors.MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a literature search including the following terms: PNI, LVI, SCS, BCC, cSCC, keratinocyte carcinoma, MAC, sentinel lymph node biopsy, radiation, chemotherapy, and staging. Relevant studies, case reports, and review articles were included, as well as National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.RESULTS Pancytokeratin immunohistochemistry may aid in the diagnosis of high-risk features of BCC and cSCC. Reconstruction of the Mohs defect should be carefully considered to allow for thorough inspection. Radiation therapy should be considered as an adjuvant treatment option for high-risk cSCC and BCC. Close surveillance for recurrence is warranted.CONCLUSION The Mohs surgeon should be competent in identification of high-risk tumors and to understand how best to manage, further treat, and follow these tumors.

TI  - Oak decline in the Mediterranean basin: a study case from the southern Apennines (Italy)
T2  - Plant Sociology
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that the decline of oaks forest can be triggered by an increase of climatic anomalies such as heat waves. droughts, and extreme cold. The present study aims to deepen the relationships between climate anomalies and oak decline basing on in-field observations made in the Lucanian Apennine (southern Italy) during summer 2017. Remote sensing was used to identify those areas affected by vegetation decline. A comparison of the climatic conditions recorded in 2015 and 2017 was carried out, these years being the hottest and the driest, respectively, since 1800. Satellite images and remote sensing data [Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Thmperature Condition Index (TCI)], and ground-based collected data [(Decline Severity (DES), Deficit/Surplus (D/S), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)] were processed using GIS techniques to evaluate spatial distribution and time-scale evolution of the damage by oak decline. The results show that despite the heat peaks reached in 2015. it was not possible to highlight any clear sign of oak decline based on satellite images for that year. On the contrary, these signs were found to be evident by observing the satellite images of 2017 and confirmed by the Decline Severity assessment made in the field and further supported by NDWI and DNDWI indexes. Regarding possible factors that may have triggered the 2017' oak decline in the study area, it is not possible to provide a definite answer, at present. In this work it was hypothesized that an important role could have been played by the drastic reduction of rainfalls during the first semester of the year.

TI  - Energy East and Dakota Access: Pipelines, Protest, and the Obstacles of Mutual Unintelligibility
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES
M3  - Article
AB  - This comparative article examines the controversies surrounding the Energy East pipeline in New Brunswick and the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. It analyzes four key texts, one from an Indigenous leader and one from an elected or business leader in each place. It employs a heuristic tool that describes speakers' frames as "scenes of thought" to discover the assumptions underpinning each group's worldview about (1) the actors involved in the controversies and (2) their spatial and temporal relationships to each other. Two pictures emerge. The first is of two groups-Native and non-Native leaders-with in-commensurable perspectives on the continuity (or discontinuity) of time and space. From within their worldviews, the other group's arguments appeared unconvincing or incomprehensible. The second is of two modes of engagement, shaped by Canadian and US approaches to securing consent for resource extraction, that prompted different forms of interaction between Indigenous peoples and the companies that wanted to lay pipeline across their land.

TI  - Untangling multiple species richness hypothesis globally using remote sensing habitat indices
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can estimate terrestrial productivity more consistently and comprehensively across large areas than field observations. However, questions remain how species richness and abundances are related to terrestrial productivity in different biogeographic realms. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of three remote sensing indices each related to a key biodiversity productivity hypothesis (i.e., available energy proxied by the annual cumulative productivity, environmental stress proxied by the minimum productivity throughout the year, and environmental stability proxied by the annual coefficient of variation in productivity). Here, we quantify the relevance of each hypothesis globally and for different biogeographic realms using models of species richness for three taxa (amphibians, birds, and mammals) derived from IUCN species range maps. Using parameterized generalized additive models (GAM's) we found that the available energy hypothesis was the best individual index explain 37-43% of the variation in species richness globally with the best models for amphibians and worst for mammal richness. Examining the residuals of these GAMS indicated that adding the environmental stress hypothesis explained 0-22% additional variance, especially in the Nearctic where large amounts of snow and ice are prevalent and environmental conditions deteriorate during winter. The addition of the environmental stability hypothesis generally explained more variance than the environmental stress hypothesis, especially in the Neartic and Paleartic and for birds however, in certain cases, the environmental stress hypothesis explains more variance at the realm scale.

TI  - Multi-Satellite Data of Land Surface Temperature, Lakes Area, and Water Level for Hydrological Model Calibration and Validation in the Yangtze River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study shows the feasibility of the combined use of multi-satellite data and an energy-water balance model for improving the estimates of water fluxes over time and distributed in space in the Yangtze River basin. In particular, a new methodology is used to constrain an internal model variable of the distributed hydrological model based on the satellite land surface temperature. The hydrological FEST-EWB model (flash flood event-based spatially distributed rainfall-runoff transformation-energy water balance model) with its energy-water balance scheme allows to continuously compute in time and distributed in space soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes thanks to a double link with satellite-derived data as input parameters (e.g., LAI) and as variables for model states' updates as the land surface temperature (LST). This LST was used to calibrate the model soil parameters instead of using only dedicated ground measurements. The effects of the calibration procedure were evaluated at four available river cross-sections along the Yangtze River, considering also the presence of the Three Gorges Dam. Flow duration curves were also considered to understand the volume storages' changes. The Poyang and Dongting Lakes dynamics were simulated from FEST-EWB and compared against satellite water extended from MERIS and ASAR data and water levels from LEGOS altimetry data (Topex/Poseidon). The FEST-EWB model was run at 0.009 degrees spatial resolution and three hours of temporal resolutions for the period between 2003 and 2006. Absolute errors on LST estimates of 3 degrees C were obtained while discharge data were simulated with errors of 10%. Errors on the water area extent of 7% and on the water level of 3% were obtained for the two lakes.

TI  - Community-Onset <i>Clostridioides Difficile</i> Infection in Hospitalized Patients in The Netherlands
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is increasingly reported in the community. The aim of this study was to analyze characteristics of hospitalized patients with community-onset CDI (CO-CDI).Methods. In the Netherlands, 24 hospitals (university-affiliated and general hospitals) participate in the sentinel CDI surveillance program. Clinical characteristics and 30-day outcomes of hospitalized patients >2 years old diagnosed with CDI are registered. Samples of these patients are sent to the national reference laboratory for polymerase chain reaction ribotyping. Data obtained for this surveillance from May 2012 to May 2018 were used to compare CO-CDI with hospital-onset (HO)-CDI episodes.Results. Of 5405 registered cases, 2834 (52.4%) were reported as HO-CDI, 2174 (40.2%) were CO-CDI, and 339 (6.3%) had onset of symptoms in another healthcare facility (eg, nursing home). The proportion of CO-CDI increased over the years and was lower during winter months. Hospitalized patients with CO-CDI were younger (63.8 vs 68.0 years, P < .001) and more often females (53.0% vs 49.6%, P = .02) than patients with HO-CDI. Median time between onset of symptoms and CDI testing was longer in CO-CDI (4 vs 1 day, P < .001). Similar ribotypes were found in CO-CDI and HO-CDI, but ribotype 001 was more frequent among HO-CDI, whereas ribotype 023 was more frequent in CO-CDI. Six of 7 (85.7%) surgeries due to CDI, 27 of 50 (54%) ICU admissions due to CDI, and 48 of 107 (44.9%) of CDI-associated deaths were attributable to CO-CDI.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with CO-CDI contribute substantially to the total number of CDI episodes and CDI-associated complications in hospitals, stressing the need for awareness and early testing for CDI in community and outpatient settings and also in patients admitted from community with diarrhoea. Surveillance programs that also target nonhospitalized CDI patients are needed to understand the true burden and dynamics of CDI.

TI  - Impact of Urbanization on Ecosystem Health: A Case Study in Zhuhai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The past decades have witnessed rapid urbanization around the world. This is particularly evident in Zhuhai City, given its status as one of the earliest special economic zones in China. After experiencing rapid urbanization for decades, the level of ecosystem health (ESH) in Zhuhai City has become a focus of attention. Assessments of urban ESH and spatial correlations between urbanization and ESH not only reveal the states of urban ecosystems and the extent to which urbanization affected these ecosystems, but also provide new insights into sustainable eco-environmental planning and resource management. In this study, we assessed the ESH of Zhuhai City using a selected set of natural, social and economic indicators. The data used include Landsat Thematic Mapper images and socio-economic data of 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013. The results showed that the overall ESH value and ecosystem service function have been on the decline while Zhuhai City has continued to become more urbanized. The total ESH health level trended downward and the area ratio of weak and relatively weak health level increased significantly, while the areas of well and relatively well healthy state decreased since 1999. The spatial correlation analysis shows a distinct negative correlation between urbanization and ESH. The degree of negative correlation shows an upward trend with the processes of urban sprawl. The analysis results reveal the impact of urbanization on urban ESH and provide useful information for planners and environment managers to take measures to improve the health conditions of urban ecosystems.

TI  - Dynamics of Urbanization and its impact on Urban Ecosystem Services (UESs): A study of a medium size town of West Bengal, Eastern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous urban expansion changes the urban ecological landscape pattern and urban ecosystem functions that possess serious challenge before urban environmental and ecological management. In this context, assessing the relationship between rapid urban expansion and ecosystem services play an important role for the urban sustainability and development related to planning and policies. This study mainly focuses on the assessment of the dynamic nature of urbanization and its impact on urban ecosystem services through land use and land cover (LULC) changes of Old Malda Municipal town, Eastern India. The ecosystem service values (ESVt) are analyzed using Remote Sensing data and GIS techniques corresponding with the global Value Coefficient (VC) for four-time periods (1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017) to estimate total ecosystem service values (ESV,) and individual ecosystem service function change. Coefficient of Sensitivity (CS) is also applied to test the reliability of the estimated VC used as proxies for each LULC categories. The result of the study landscape reveals that the ecosystem service values (ESVs) decreased by 25% from US$ 1.33 million to US$ 1.07 million because of losing cropland and vegetation cover by 34% and 35% respectively during 1990-2017. In case of individual ecosystem service functions, regulating services increased by 12% since 1990-2017 with highest contributing services of water regulation (57%), water supply (22%) and waste treatment (8%) respectively while maximum decline is recorded in soil formation (33.33%) followed by climatic regulation (31.82%) and nutrient cycling (31.25%). The decline in total and some individual ESV in the study landscape requires for urgent measures to be taken to enhance the urban ecosystem sustainability through effective planning and policies.

TI  - Studying land use dynamics using decadal satellite images and Dyna-CLUEmodel in the Mahanadi River basin, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth rate indicates the proportional rate of settlement expansion and landscape modification in any river basin. The Mahanadi River basin (MRB), which is a densely populated, cropland and forest-dominated landscape, is selected as a case study area for studying the nature of built-up expansion and the corresponding land cover modifications. Satellite data-derived land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps for the years 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used for identification of landscape changes during the past three decades. One of the major LU/LC changes are observed in terms of increase in the water, which may be attributed to construction of new dams at the cost of the croplands and forest areas. Conversion of forest to cropland and expansion and densification of built-up areas in and around the existing built-up areas are also identified as a major LU/LC change. The geostatistical analysis was performed to identify the relationship between LU/LC classes with drivers, which showed that built-up areas were more in topographically flat terrain with higher soil depth, and expanded more around the existing built-up areas; cropland areas were more at lower elevation and less sloppy terrain, and forest areas were more at higher elevation. The LU/LC scenario of 2025 was projected using a spatially explicit dynamic conversion of land use and its effects (Dyna-CLUE) modeling platform with the LU/LC change trends of past 10 years (2005-2015) and 20 years (1995-2015). The major LU/LC changes observed during 2005-2015 were built-up expansion by 36.53% and deciduous forest and cropland reduction by 0.35% and 0.45%, respectively. Thus, the corresponding predicted change during 2015-2025 estimated built-up expansion by 25.70% and deciduous forest and croplands loss by 0.43% and 0.35%, respectively. On the other hand, during 1995 to 2015, the total built-up expansion and deciduous forest and cropland reduction were observed 50.79%, 0.45%, and 0.73%, respectively. Thus, the predicted changes during 2015-2025 were estimated as 18.48% built-up expansion and 0.22% and 0.21% deciduous forest and cropland loss. However, with the conditions of restricted deforestation and less landscape modification, the LU/LC projections show less built-up area expansion, reducing the cropland, fallow land, plantation, and waste land. The reduced numbers of land cover conversions types during 2005-2015 compared with 1995-2005 indicate more stabilized landscape. The input LU/LC maps and statistical analysis demonstrated the landscape modifications and causes observed in the basin. The model projected LU/LC maps are giving insights to possible changes under multiple pathways, which will help the agriculture, forest, urban, and water resource planners and managers in improved policy-making processes.

TI  - Fuzzy Rules to Help Predict Rains and Temperatures in a Brazilian Capital State Based on Data Collected from Satellites
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationA hybrid model formed by neural network techniques and fuzzy systems that predicts rainfall and temperatures in the capital of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which contains several river sources essential for the Brazilian economy. The purpose of the paper is to construct a model capable of extracting knowledge from satellite data related to temperatures and rainfall forecast of the analyzed state.Abstract The forecast for rainfall and temperatures in underdevelope countries can help in the definition of public and private investment strategies in preventive and corrective nature. Water is an essential element for the economy and living things. This study had a main objective to use an intelligent hybrid model capable of extracting fuzzy rules from a historical series of temperatures and rainfall indices of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, more specifically in the capital. Because this is state has several rivers fundamental to the Brazilian economy, this study intended to find knowledge in the data of the problem to help public managers and private investors to act dynamically in the prediction of future temperatures and how they can interfere in the decisions related to the population of the state. The results confirm that the intelligent hybrid model can act with efficiency in the generation of predictions about the temperatures and average rainfall indices, being an efficient tool to predict the water situation in the future of this critical state for Brazil.

TI  - Interannual variability of seasonal rainfall in Cordoba, Argentina, evaluated from ENSO and ENSO Modoki signals and verified with MODIS NDVI data
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an atmospheric and oceanic signal closely linked with the short-term (interannual) climate variability and, as part of the global atmospheric circulation, influences for several months the weather in different regions of the world. As a proxy of ENSO, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) has shown a moderate ability to predict rainfall behavior on the territory of Cordoba province, Argentina. Several studies last years have postulated for the existence of the El Nino Modoki, "a similar but different" type of El Nino, with an increasing interest in determining the characteristics of its evolution and the impact of associated teleconnections over the weather around the world. Moreover, spectral indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have also been used to monitor the ENSO cycle. The influence in a predictive way of both ENSO and ENSO Modoki over seasonal rainfall indicators: amount (PP), frequency (DPP) and maximum daily precipitation (PPmax), was analyzed during the period from 1960 to 2017 in Cordoba Province, Argentina. Complementarily, the ENSO influence on vegetation behavior was also assessed during the rainfall season by using NDVI data from MODIS-TERRA for the period 2000-2017 to verify the predictive potential of the climate signal. Before the beginning of the rainy season, the August and September SOI average (SOIas) shows negative linear relationships with the rainfall attributes in almost all the territory of Cordoba that, although significant in statistical terms, are relatively weak. El Nino Modoki Index (EMI) used to represent the ENSO Modoki did not improve predictions on the rainfall behavior in Cordoba compared to SOI. Although the ENSO (SOIas) explains a little portion of interannual variability on subsequent seasonal rainfall, just between 14 and 22% for the entire region, when ENSO phases' fluctuations upon NDVI data were analyzed, a very similar scheme was established. It is important to realize these responses show a strong local dependence associated with the environment resources and agricultural scheme own of each place. These results validate the use of the ENSO as a warning signal to anticipate the productive risk of the region, particularly when the Neutral years are discarded.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Synthetic Aperture Radar and Optical Imagery to Monitor Surface Accumulation of Cyanobacteria in the Curonian Lagoon
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton blooms in internal water bodies are an unpleasant sight that often emerges on top like a layer of foam containing high concentrations of toxins (scum event). Monitoring the concentration of algae and the occurrence of scum in lakes and lagoons has become a topic of interest for management and science. Optical remote sensing is a validated tool but unfortunately it is highly hindered by clouds. For regions with frequent cloud cover, such as the Baltic region, this means loss of data, which limits the purpose of sensing to spatially and temporally characterize any scum for a comprehensive ecological analysis. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can compensate for the weaknesses of optical images for cyanobacteria bloom monitoring purposes in the event of cloudy skies. A "ready to use" approach to detect cyanobacteria bloom in the Curonian Lagoon based on the level 2 ocean product of Sentinel-1 images is proposed. This method is empirically validated for the images of summer/autumn 2018 of the Curonian Lagoon.

TI  - Satellites reveal a small positive yield effect from conservation tillage across the US Corn Belt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation tillage is a primary tenet of conservation agriculture aimed at restoring and maintaining soil health for long-term crop productivity. Because soil degradation typically operates on century timescales, farmer adoption is influenced by near-term yield impacts and profitability. Although numerous localized field trials have examined the yield impacts of conservation tillage, their results are mixed and often unrepresentative of real-world conditions. Here, we applied a machine-learning causal inference approach to satellite-derived datasets of tillage practices and crop yields spanning the US Corn Belt from 2005 to 2017 to assess on-the-ground yield impacts at field-level resolution across thousands of fields. We found an average 3.3% and 0.74% yield increase for maize and soybeans, respectively, for fields with long-term conservation tillage. This effect was diminished in fields that only recently converted to conservation tillage. We also found significant variability in these effects, and we identified soil and weather characteristics that mediate the direction and magnitude of yield responses. This work supports soil conservation practices by demonstrating they can be used with minimal and typically positive yield impacts.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Michigan Child Care Related Infections Surveillance Program (MCRISP) is a novel, online illness surveillance system used by a collection of southeast Michigan child care centers. Recently established, MCRISP has not been assessed epidemiologically. We created MCRISP epidemic curves for both respiratory and gastrointestinal disease over three seasons, comparing these to data from an established statewide surveillance system. Results suggest that online child care center-based disease surveillance is timely, functional, and has potential as an early sentinel system for community epidemics.

TI  - Turbidity and Secchi disc depth with Sentinel-2 in different trophic status reservoirs at the Comunidad Valenciana
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transparency or turbidity is one of the main indicators in studies of water quality using remote sensing. Transparency can be measured in situ through the Secchi disc depth (SD), and turbidity using a turbidimeter. In recent decades, different relationships between bands from different remote sensing sensors have been used for the estimation of these variables. In this paper, several indices and spectral bands have been calibrated in order to estimate transparency from Sentinel-2 (S2) images from field data, obtained throughout 2017 and 2018 in Jucar basin reservoirs with a great variety of trophic states. Three atmospheric correction methods developed for waters have been applied to the S2 level L1C images taken at the same day as the field data: Polymer, C2RCC and C2X. From the spectra obtained from S2 and the SD field data, it has been found that the smallest error is obtained with the images atmospherically corrected with Polymer and a potential adjustment of the reflectivities' ratio of the blue and green bands (R-490/R-560), which allow the estimation of SD with a relative error of 13%. Also the C2X method presents good adjustment with the same bands ratio, although with a greater error, while the correction C2RCC shows the worst correlation. The relationship between SD (in m) and turbidity (in NTU) has also been obtained, which provides an operational method for estimating turbidity with S2. The relationship for the different reservoirs between SD and chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended solids and dissolved organic matter, is also shown.

TI  - Investigation of aerosols pollution across the eastern basin of Urmia lake using satellite remote sensing data and HYSPLIT model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Desiccation of the world's second hypersaline lake, Lake Urmia, has drawn attention toward the feasibility of particle emissions from the lakebed to downwind regions. Therefore, this research was conducted to study spatiotemporal variations of aerosols across the eastern basin of the lake during 2001 to 2016. Methods The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), extracted from Terra platform for 999 rural and urban areas and compared over adjacent (Shabestar, Osku, Azarshahr, Ajabshir, Bonab, Malekan), middle (Tabriz and Maragheh) and far (Bostanabad, Heris, and Sarab) counties. Number of dusty days and direction of high wind speeds (>= 11 m/s) were acquired from the East Azerbaijan Meteorological Organization and analyzed. Moreover, performing the backward trajectory model, the origin and distribution of aerosols were determined at altitudes of 500, 1000 and 2000 m. Results The spatiotemporal variations of AOD provided statistically significant correlations (R-2 >= 0.5 and p < 0.05) against the number of dusty days. AOD value was higher between 2009 and 2016 and estimated to be 0.36, 0.33 and 0.31 over adjacent, middle and far areas, respectively. Analysis of wind direction and trajectory plots implied that the particulate matter (PM) of study area was mainly transported from Iraq and Syria, especially in April, May and June months. Conclusions PM has followed an increasing trend, while the adjacent areas have experienced higher pollution compared to far counties. The southwestern winds can play an important role in transportation of aerosols from either lakebed or western countries to the study area.

TI  - Influenza syndromic surveillance and vaccine efficacy in the UK Armed Forces, 2017-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This paper describes the first ever analysis of health data to report influenza vaccine uptake and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing general practice presentations for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the UK Armed Forces (UK AF). This was undertaken during the 2017-2018 influenza season. Methods Clinical Read codes for ILI and influenza vaccinations were used to generate reports for the period from September 2017 to April 2018. Using a methodology adapted from Public Health England's (PHE) in hours syndromic surveillance, the ILI rate for the UK AF was calculated. Subsequent analysis explored vaccination uptake in target groups and compared the relative risk (RR) of ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated Service Personnel (SP). Results 4234 SPs had a record of ILI between September 2017 and April 2018, with a peak rate of 216 cases per 100 000 PAR. The absolute risk reduction for reporting ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated SP was 0.4% (p=0.0031), and the RR was statistically significant at 15% (95% CI 5% to 23 %) lower than in the non-vaccinated PAR. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one presentation of ILI was 241 (95% CI 145 to 714). The 8153 vaccinations recorded for the untrained strength equate to approximately 38% of overall training throughput and 65% of all Army SP recorded as being in phase 1 training at some point during this period. Conclusions The relative risk reduction (RRR) for vaccinated personnel was modest and lower than reported elsewhere, but closely compares with ILI rates included in a 2018 Cochrane review. The small RRR and large NNV do not support widening the population of UK AF eligible to receive influenza vaccine. Regimental Medical Officers (RMOs) seeking advice on whether to vaccinate other groups of SP should be aware that this approach offers questionable clinical benefit. The ILI surveillance methodology used in this work could be adapted for syndromic surveillance of other infectious diseases.

TI  - Ramon Llulls's Worldview and Influence on Teaching Arabic in Medieval Universities
T2  - INSAN & TOPLUM-THE JOURNAL OF HUMANITY & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ramon Llull was an intellectual from an era when the interaction between Islam and Western Christianity was experienced in almost all its aspects. Under the domination of a military doctrine through the crusades and Rcconquista, Ramon had put forward the idea of peace related to missionaries. He tried to develop a system that would explain the Catholic doctrine within the framework of a new language and logic while writing about how to achieve sovereignty in Muslim lands. Ramon related the success of the missionary to knowing the language of the societies being addressed. In this context, the language and literature of Islam must be researched in order to convince Muslim scholars and administrators. For Ramon, who had added a new dimension to the criticism of Islam, another problem that had been threatening Catholicism was the Averroism in universities. Once again, the Arabic language appeared as a source language in the struggle against medieval heresy. Because this versatile intellectual supported learning the language for all fields that encounter Islam, he established a monastery for learning Arabic and attempted to have Arabic taught at Kingdom and papal authorities. Eventually, the Council of Vienne decided to start having Arabic taught at four universitiesThis research examines the sources for studies on Arabic and Islam during the Post-renaissance and colonial periods through Ramon Llull. By studying his works, the intellectual background for teaching Arabic at medieval universities is discussed.

TI  - Axillary web syndrome: Incidence, pathogenesis, and management
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary web syndrome (AWS) refers to the development of fibrotic bands or "cords" in the axilla of patients who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. We review the incidence, pathogenesis, risk factors, and management of AWS. AWS is a common complication in patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection. Even though AWS is self-limited in most cases, it causes significant morbidity. The optimal management of AWS is unclear but physiotherapy appears to be beneficial. The widespread use of less invasive procedures to evaluate the presence of metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (ie, sentinel lymph node biopsy) is expected to reduce the incidence of AWS. The close collaboration of surgeons, oncologists, and physiotherapists is necessary for the prevention and management of this frequent condition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction and analysis of the shoreline and land reclamation patterns are important for studies on topics such as the dynamics of coastal wetland ecological environments, transportation and exchange of material energy in coastal regions, and recruitment of fishery resources. Spatial-temporal variations in the shoreline and land reclamation in the Bohai Sea were analyzed based on 49 Landsat images of 7 periods from 1985 to 2015. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) The extracted shoreline data based on visual interpretation had high precision, and the shoreline extraction errors could be controlled within the theoretical range. (2) Over the past 30 years, the shoreline of the Bohai Sea has exhibited an average rate of change of 188.47 m/a and an average accretion distance of 3.55x10(3) m toward the sea. The fastest rate of shoreline change occurred in Laizhou Bay (134.78 m/a), followed by Bohai Bay (128.20 m/a) and Liaodong Bay (61.69 m/a). (3) The average rate of reclamation was 3.25x10(4) ha/a in the Bohai Sea, where the total area of aquaculture land, unused land, and salt land exceeded 60% of the total reclamation area. (4) The geometric shape of the bay became increasingly complicated from year to year, and the geometric center of gravity of the bay moved rapidly toward the sea. In addition, the area of the bay showed a significant decreasing trend. Therefore, to protect the function and structure of the ecosystem in coastal regions, we must control the scale and rate of land reclamation in the future.

TI  - Improved assessment of pasture availability in semi-arid grassland of South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology has been successfully used to monitor grassland productivity, especially for estimating the green component of biomass using popular indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The non-green component, which includes senescent and dead standing material, has not been widely quantified. Our study aimed at devising a satellite remote sensing-based method that can distinguish between green and non-green herbage, in order to improve the accuracy of total aboveground biomass (TBM) estimations. This in turn can minimise under-estimations of pasture availability in semi-arid grasslands. MODIS satellite data was used to determine the relations of various indices to ground-measured green aboveground biomass (GBM) and non-green aboveground biomass (NBM) in South African semi-arid grasslands. We found a strong correlation of GBM to NDVI. We were then able to detect a correlation of NBM to Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), but a robust relationship was between NDWI and the ratio of NBM to TBM. NDVI and NDWI were used to estimate long-term TBM, which varies inter- and intra-seasonally. During the non-rainy season, NBM is important to maintain livestock grazing and in this regard monitoring of pasture availability in terms of green and non-green herbage is critical for sustainable grassland management.

TI  - Confucian Evaluation: Reframing Contribution Analysis Using a Confucian Lens
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Culturally responsive evaluation contests that Western-derived evaluation methods represent a universal truth and promotes approaches that reflect the local context. Taking this approach, we examine how the method of contribution analysis may be modified to reflect a different worldview. We reframe contribution analysis using a Confucian lens as Confucianism represents a value system that is still integral to the way societies operate in several East and Southeast Asian countries today. First, we unpack the theory behind contribution analysis and how it is applied by Western evaluators then compare this with aspects of Confucianism. We then examine how the application of contribution analysis might be modified to take into account a Confucian worldview. Finally, we discuss how, in a world of globalized, complex societies, this approach could be used by evaluators to adapt evaluation methods to be congruent with the worldviews in the local context where an evaluation is occurring.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a New "Snow Water Index (SWI)" for Accurate Snow Cover Delineation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study started by examining the three most established snow indices, namely the NDSI (normalized difference snow index), S3, and NDSII-1 (normalized difference snow and ice index), based on their capabilities to differentiate snow pixels from cloud, debris, vegetation, and water pixels. Furthermore, considering the limitations of these indices, a new spectral index called the snow water index (SWI) is proposed. SWI uses spectral characteristics of the visible, SWIR (shortwave infrared), and NIR (near infrared) bands to achieve significant contrast between snow/ice pixels and other pixels including water bodies. A three-step accuracy assessment technique established the dominance of SWI over NDSI, S3, and NDSII-1. In the first step, image thresholding using standard value (>0), individual index theory (fixed threshold), histogram, and GCPs (ground control points) derived threshold were used to assess the performance of the selected indices. In the second step, comparisons of the spectral separation of features in the individual band were made from the field spectral observations collected using a spectroradiometer. In the third step, GCPs collected using field surveys were used to derive the user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient for each index. The SWI threshold varied between 0.21 to 0.25 in all of the selected observations from both ablation and accumulation time. Spectral separability plots justify the SWI's capability of extraction and removal of the most critical water pixels in integration with other impure classes from snow/ice pixels. GCP enabled accuracy assessment resulted in a maximum overall accuracy (0.93) and kappa statistics (0.947) value for the SWI. Thus, the results of the accuracy assessment justified the supremacy of the SWI over other indices. The study revealed that SWI demonstrates a considerably higher correlation with actual snow/ice cover and is prominent for spatio-temporal snow cover studies globally.

T2  - Problemy radiatsiinoi medytsyny ta radiobiolohii
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and spectrum of chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes depending on the radiation dose, the stage of the mitotic cycle and the periods of fixation of the cell culture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The test system of blood lymphocytes of donors, the metaphase analysis of chromosome aberrations (a uniform staining of the drugs). The gamma-irradiation was performed on the device with the source 60Co at the dose rate of 0.5 Gy/min, the dose range was 0.25-4.0 Gy. The lymphocyte culture was irradiated after 0, 24, 40 and 48 hours from the beginning of the incubation, which corresponds to G0-, G1-, S-, G2-stages of the mitot- ic cycle. The cells were fixed after 52 hours and 62 hours from the beginning of the incubation.RESULTS: The author's experimental data on the regularities of chromosome aberrations formation during irradiation at the different periods of the mitotic cycle of human lymphocyte culture are presented. The character of the dose dependences of structural damages of chromosomes during the mitotic cycle with an application of the linear, lin- ear-square and parabolic models is analyzed. The greatest yield of exchange-type aberrations is registered at the irradiation in G0- and G1-stages of the mitotic cycle, which submits to the linear-square dependence on an irradia- tion dose. When irradiating cells in the S- and G2-stages, the main contribution to the spectrum of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations is made by deletions, the level of which increases linearly with the dose. This is evidenced by the negative values of the quadratic term in the regression equations for these stages. The analysis of the curves using the parabolic model Y = k · Dn has shown that, at the irradiation of lymphocytes in G0- and G1-stages, the dose dependences approach the quadratic ones, which confirms the reasonableness of the interpretation of the obtained cytogenetic data from the point of view of the classical theory of the radiation-induced chromosome aberrations formation. However, the model of the spline regression is more accurate at the approximation of the dependences of the cytogenetic effects in the region of low doses of irradiation.CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained by the irradiation of human lymphocyte culture at different stages of the mitot- ic cycle indicate that the same radiation dose induces different qualitative and quantitative cytogenetic effects depending on the physiological state of the cell at the time of irradiation. The combination of such factors as a radi- ation dose rate, a mitotic cycle stage, the post-irradiation conditions, and an individual radiosensitivity are reflect- ed in quantitative and qualitative variations of the cellular radiosensitivity.

TI  - Postglacial Uplift: Record in the Gravity Field and in Neogene-Quaternary Structures
T2  - RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of Quaternary glaciation and postglacial uplift in Fennoscandia is considered in relation to the surface topography, gravity, and number of glacial deposits and is compared to the respective processes in North America. The surface topography and the gravity field are correlated over the Fennoscandian region as a whole and for two reference areas of South Norway and the Kola Peninsula. The gravity field is composed as free-air and Bouguer gravity anomalies using modern global models based on satellite data. The impact of glaciation may be responsible for zoned patterns of both topography and gravity. The glaciation centers of Norway are marked by uplifts reaching 2470 and 1500 m and by circular Bouguer gravity lows of <=-200 mGal, which correspond to residual crust thickening. The gravity patterns of the Kola Peninsula and Norway consist of circular and polygonal anomalies caused by both postglacial rebound and rock density variations. The general uplift and related extension of the crust led to the formation of fractures of different sizes, from 100-200 km long and 1-2 km deep fjords in Norway to 1-2 km long and 30-20 m deep local fractures on the Kola Peninsula. The gravity field of central North America is characterized by a generalized map of free-air anomalies within the limits of glaciation and a map of free-air anomalies compiled from the global database. Glaciation and its records in the surface topography and gravity patterns are described in more detail for Wisconsin State (USA), where extension fractures arc similar to those on the Kola Peninsula. The models explaining the correlation between postglacial uplift and gravity variations can be further updated using seismic and tectonic data, as it was shown previously for the case of Finland.

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of ponderosa pine fuel treatments intersected by the Egley Fire Complex, Oregon, USA
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fuel treatments are widely used to alter fuels in forested ecosystems to mitigate wildfire behavior and effects. However, few studies have examined long-term ecological effects of interacting fuel treatments (commercial harvests, pre-commercial thinnings, pile and burning, and prescribed fire) and wildfire. Using annually fitted Landsat satellite-derived Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) curves and paired pre-fire treated and untreated field sites, we tested changes in the differenced NBR (dNBR) and years since treatment as predictors of biophysical attributes one and nine years after the 2007 Egley Fire Complex in Oregon, USA. We also assessed short- and long-term fuel treatment impacts on field-measured attributes one and nine years post fire. Results One-year post-fire burn severity (dNBR) was lower in treated than in untreated sites across the Egley Fire Complex. Annual NBR trends showed that treated sites nearly recovered to pre-fire values four years post fire, while untreated sites had a slower recovery rate. Time since treatment and dNBR significantly predicted tree canopy and understory green vegetation cover in 2008, suggesting that tree canopy and understory vegetation cover increased in areas that were treated recently pre fire. Live tree density was more affected by severity than by pre-fire treatment in either year, as was dead tree density one year post fire. In 2008, neither treatment nor severity affected percent cover of functional groups (shrub, graminoid, forb, invasive, and moss-lichen-fungi); however, by 2016, shrub, graminoid, forb, and invasive cover were higher in high-severity burn sites than in low-severity burn sites. Total fuel loads nine years post fire were higher in untreated, high-severity burn sites than any other sites. Tree canopy cover and density of trees, saplings, and seedlings were lower nine years post fire than one year post fire across treatments and severity, whereas live and dead tree basal area, understory surface cover, and fuel loads increased. Conclusions Pre-fire fuel treatments effectively lowered the occurrence of high-severity wildfire, likely due to successful pre-fire tree and sapling density and surface fuels reduction. This study also quantified the changes in vegetation and fuels from one to nine years post fire. We suggest that low-severity wildfire can meet prescribed fire management objectives of lowering surface fuel accumulations while not increasing overstory tree mortality.

TI  - Using RapidEye imagery to identify within-field variability of crop growth and yield in Ontario, Canada
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been recognized as a cost-effective way to detect the spatial and temporal variability of crop growth and productivity. In this study, multispectral RapidEye images were used to delineate homogeneous zones of soil and crop development in two fields in Ontario, Canada, one planted with canola (Brassica napus L.) and the other with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The two fields received different levels of nitrogen (N) treatments during the pre-planting land preparation phase. Soil textures, mineral nitrogen content and crop yield were used to interpret the results of zone delineation. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests revealed that the high-resolution RapidEye data, particularly the imagery acquired at peak crop growth stages (i.e. when leaf area index (LAI) is high), provided valuable information for delineating within-field variability of crop growth and yield. Further analysis showed that for both crops, the spatial patterns of crop growth condition varied throughout the growth cycle, revealing different impacts of soil properties and N fertilization on the crops. In particular, during peak growth stage, the within-field variability was most strongly affected by the pre-planting N application and had the strongest correlation with crop yield. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite data (e.g., RapidEye) could assist in making decisions on optimal N fertilization for enhanced crop productivity.

TI  - Effects of Distinguishing Vegetation Types on the Estimates of Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) in arid ecosystems are important for sustainable water resource management due to competing water demands between human and ecological environments. Several empirical remotely sensed ET models have been constructed and their potential for regional scale ET estimation in arid ecosystems has been demonstrated. Generally, these models were built using combined measured ET and corresponding remotely sensed and meteorological data from diverse sites. However, there are usually different vegetation types or mixed vegetation types in these sites, and little information is available on the estimation uncertainty of these models induced by combining different vegetation types from diverse sites. In this study, we employed the most popular one of these models and recalibrated it using datasets from two typical vegetation types (shrub Tamarix ramosissima and arbor Populus euphratica) in arid ecosystems of northwestern China. The recalibration was performed in the following two ways: using combined datasets from the two vegetation types, and using a single dataset from specific vegetation type. By comparing the performance of the two methods in ET estimation for Tamarix ramosissima and Populus euphratica, we investigated and compared the accuracy of ET estimation at the site scale and the difference in annual ET estimation at the regional scale. The results showed that the estimation accuracy of daily, monthly, and yearly ET was improved by distinguishing the vegetation types. The method based on the combined vegetation types had a great influence on the estimation accuracy of annual ET, which overestimated annual ET about 9.19% for Tamarix ramosissima and underestimated annual ET about 11.50% for Populus euphratica. Furthermore, substantial difference in annual ET estimation at regional scale was found between the two methods. The higher the vegetation coverage, the greater the difference in annual ET. Our results provide valuable information on evaluating the estimation accuracy of regional scale ET using empirical remotely sensed ET models for arid ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of Climate Factors and Human Activities on the Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency throughout Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate changes have increased the imbalance of water resources, especially in northern China, which comprises typical arid and semiarid regions. Large-scale afforestation has been implemented over the past three decades in northern China. The ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) connects the carbon cycle and water cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems and is defined as the ratio of the gross primary productivity (GPP) to the evapotranspiration. However, there are still an insufficient number of studies on the impact of the afforestation on the WUE. In this study, we applied the random forest (RF) model to explore the impacts of climate and nonclimate factors on the WUE in northern China. The results showed that in areas with high precipitation, the forests had the highest WUE, while in the arid areas, the croplands had the highest WUE. Of the total area, 44.34% showed a significant increase, and 5.89% showed a significant decrease in the WUE from 1982-2015 in northern China. The main driving factors for the changes in the WUE were climate factors, including the precipitation, temperature and solar radiation, which contributed to approximately 84% of the WUE trends, while human activities, such as afforestation, contributed to approximately 16% of the WUE trends. Overall, although the climate had a larger impact on the WUE dynamics than the human activities, our results suggested that the impacts of the afforestation programs on forest carbon and water cycles should be considered in the context of climate change.

TI  - Trend-cycles of vegetation dynamics as a tool for land degradation assessment and monitoring
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained from satellite sensors has become frequent in studies for land degradation assessment and monitoring. Linear trends of NDVI are usually considered as indicators of vegetation dynamics and widely used as proxies for land degradation. Yet, long-term trends of NDVI often exhibit unidirectional (monotonic) but also cyclic (non-monotonic) dynamics, including mid-term oscillations, both of which are poorly captured by linear trends. Trend-cycle is a time series analysis that represents a smoothed version of a seasonally adjusted time series, which provides information on long-term movements while including changes in direction underlying the series. We assessed NDVI trend-cycles in Patagonia (Argentina) as proxies for land dynamics, integrating trend and medium-term cycles (> 4 years). We used MODIS images between years 2000 and mid-2018; trend-cycles were analysed using the Basis Pursuit method. We observed that trend-cycles explained a significant portion of total temporal variability (reaching almost 20%), from which most patterns were explained by non-monotonic behaviour. We identified five major patterns in vegetation dynamics: decreasing (0.1% of area), increasing (0.6%), recovery (48.8%), relapsing (36.8%) and no trend-cycle (13.8%). Contrary to what is generally seen in the literature, monotonic patterns and particularly decreasing trend-cycles were marginally recorded in the last 18 years of NDVI records in Patagonia. Instead, the greater proportion of the area was classified as initial or advanced recovery and initial relapsing patterns, which refer to phases of a cyclic behaviour. We call for the need to revisit the conceptualization of land degradation assessment by means of remote sensing, and to critically review the ability of linear trends to reflect vegetation dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential use of trend-cycle as a tool to monitor land dynamics and progress towards land degradation neutrality.

TI  - Complementing satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles for rangeland assessment in Patagonia
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands assessment in arid and semiarid regions is a key tool both for livestock management planning and environmental diagnoses. Even though there is a consensus on the utility of such tools, rangeland assessment with high detail (grain) while covering large areas or landscapes (extension) is too costly. Then, the compatibility between the resolution and quality of information and the spatial extent required to make decisions in livestock systems is still an operational challenge that has not found an effective solution. Thus, the use of satellite images for rangeland assessments in different environments has been growing steadily in the last two decades. The developments associated with the capture of images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would offer many advantages as a complement to information, since they increase the spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to classify rangeland environments using satellite and UAV images and compare their respective contributions for rangeland assessments in Patagonia. In particular, spatial resolution of an unsupervised classification of rangeland environments using SPOT 7 satellite images and images captured by an optical sensor mounted on an UAV were compared. Rangeland assessment can be potentiated by the use of different sources of information in a more complementary and accessible way for environmental monitoring, and for a pastoral management planning in highly heterogeneous environments from arid and semiarid regions of Patagonia, Argentina.

TI  - Assessment of Remotely Sensed Near-Surface Soil Moisture for Distributed Eco-Hydrological Model Implementation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to implement an eco-hydrological distributed model using only remotely sensed information (soil moisture and leaf area index) during the calibration phase. Four soil moisture-based metrics were assessed, and the best alternative was chosen, which was a metric based on the similarity between the principal components that explained at least 95% of the soil moisture variation and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) index between simulated and observed surface soil moisture. The selected alternative was compared with a streamflow-based calibration approach. The results showed that the streamflow-based calibration approach, even presenting satisfactory results in the calibration period (NSE = 0.91), performed poorly in the validation period (NSE = 0.47) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) and soil moisture were neither sensitive to the spatio-temporal pattern nor to the spatial correlation in both calibration and validation periods. Hence, the selected soil moisture-based approach showed an acceptable performance in terms of discharges, presenting a negligible decrease in the validation period (Delta NSE = 0.1) and greater sensitivity to the spatio-temporal variables' spatial representation.

TI  - Near-Real Time Automatic Snow Avalanche Activity Monitoring System Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data in Norway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatio-temporal occurrence of avalanche activity is critical for avalanche forecasting. We present a near-real time automatic avalanche monitoring system that outputs detected avalanche polygons within roughly 10 min after Sentinel-1 SAR data are download. Our avalanche detection algorithm has an average probability of detection (POD) of 67.2% with a false alarm rate (FAR) averaging 45.9, with a maximum POD of over 85% and a minimum FAR of 24.9% compared to manual detection of avalanches. The high variability in performance stems from the dynamic nature of snow in the Sentinel-1 data. After tuning parameters of the detection algorithm, we processed five years of Sentinel-1 images acquired over a 150 x 100 km large area in Northern Norway, with the best setup. Compared to a dataset of field-observed avalanches, 77.3% were manually detectable. Using these manual detections as benchmark, the avalanche detection algorithm achieved an accuracy of 79% with high POD in cases of medium to large wet snow avalanches. For the first time, we present a dataset of spatio-temporal avalanche activity over several winters from a large region. Currently, the Norwegian Avalanche Warning Service is using our processing system for pre-operational use in three regions in Norway.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This data in brief article describes the data collection and analysis process undertaken to assess the effectiveness of land-use zoning for heritage protection at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Bagan Myanmar [1]. In order to measure the expansion of urban areas within the Archaeological Zone of Bagan from 1987 to 2018, and thus assess whether development controls functioned effectively, imaging data was acquired from the archives of the US Landsat 5, and the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 platforms. Shapefiles were generated in QGIS for each settlement within the zone for each of the eight sample years. The changing area, in square kilometres, of these settlements was then analysed over time, with further reference to two 'control' settlements that exist outside of the Archaeological Zone.

TI  - First Vegetation Optical Depth Mapping from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR Data over Crop Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crop status at plot scale in agricultural areas is essential for crop and irrigation management and yield optimization. The Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) of canopy is directly related to the canopy water content, and thus, it represents an effective tool for crop health monitoring. Currently, VOD is provided at low spatial resolution which makes these estimations useless for vegetation monitoring at plot scale. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide the first approach to estimate VOD at plot scale for non-irrigated plots from C-band Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The proposed approach was tested on a study site of 50 km x 50 km located in Catalonia, Spain. VOD estimates were provided for two crop growth cycles of non-irrigated crop types (barley, fallow, oat, wheat, and rapeseed). The relevance of VOD estimates was investigated for both growth cycles using temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). It is shown that the temporal dynamics of VOD values computed from VV polarization fits that of NDVI with a medium to good coefficient of determination (R-2 ranging from 0.39 to 0.61 for barley, fallow, oat, and wheat respectively). However, during the beginning of the senescence period in both cycles (mainly in May for winter crops), VOD decreases with the decrease in Vegetation Water Content (VWC) while NDVI keeps increasing as photosynthetic activity continues developing. This illustrates the importance of VOD in crop water loss (stress and/or transpiration) monitoring. The potential of VOD to spot water loss in vegetation is also demonstrated as the evening (18h00) VOD values are lower than those of morning (06h00) due to high daytime temperature that reduces water content in vegetation. Finally, it is shown that VOD values computed from VH polarization are not correlated with NDVI.

TI  - Automatic determination of shoreline at maximum retreating
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are the most influenced areas by global sea level rising. One of the important coastal zones in Egypt is the Red Sea. Red Sea coastal area is an attractive touristic area, which still under development. For the high value of such areas, the position of the set-back construction line is required for well planning and development. This position influenced greatly by the position of the shoreline at the maximum retreating. This paper introduces an automatic approach for determining the shoreline at the maximum retreating. This approach depends on three types of information; 1) the location of the current shoreline, 2) the mean higher high-water level (MHHWL), and 3) the topography of the coastal area.A study area North of Hurghada, is selected to apply the introduced approach. The shoreline is extracted out of Landsat-8 images based on a combination of three factors; a modified normal difference water index, the reflectance values of the water bodies in specific bands within the shortwave infra-red spectrum, and the relation of the reflectance values of water bodies in the Green, Red, NIR, and SWIR bands. The higher high-water level is determined from near tidal gauge station that has collected data each 30 min since 2008, and the topography of the coastal area is determined by the Kinematic GPS technique. The extracted shoreline was assessed by comparing it to actual shoreline traced on the ground. The results show that the accuracy of the extracted shoreline is within 15 m of the actual shoreline.

TI  - GIS-Based Evaluation of Groundwater Quality and Suitability in Dakhla Oases, Egypt
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the main source for agricultural and domestic purposes in the Western Desert of Egypt. Groundwater quality is significantly influenced by the surrounding anthropogenic activities. This paper is one of the attempts to spatially assess groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation in Dakhla Oases using Water Quality Index (WQI) and GIS techniques. Calibrated Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were processed to produce Land Use Cover map (LULC) to assess the agricultural and human activities in the study area. Further, eight groundwater quality parameters and WQI were attributed to a GIS layer for 71 investigated wells for mapping purposes using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method in ArcGIS. LULC map showed that 75% of the study area is a bare land and 25% is urban and agricultural areas. Almost all the studied wells recorded total dissolved solids and sulfate coinciding with the Egyptian permissible limits for drinking purposes. Fe and Mn levels exceeded the allowable limits for drinking in the majority of Dakhla wells. Based on the WQI, 38% and 36.6% of the study area fell within the poor water category according to the Egyptian and WHO standards, respectively. Most of the groundwater wells were of the best quality for irrigation with regard to salinity (less than 2000 mg/L) and the excellent quality in terms of sodium absorption ratio (<10). It can be concluded that GIS analyses of groundwater quality and suitability can provide one of the necessary inputs for management and planning of Dakhla Oases and other similar regions.

TI  - Geomatics based approach for assessing Qaroun Lake pollution
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Discharge of polluted water into Qaroun Lake creates a severe pressure on aquatic life and stimulates proliferation of the invading dangerous parasites. Present study aims to assess pollution, its sources, impacts and proposed solutions in Qaroun Lake using field survey, lab analyses and geospatial techniques. A total number of 24 well distributed sites was sampled (water and sediment) during November 2017 and analyzed for quality characteristics, nutrients, organic content (OM) and toxic heavy metals. EPA standards, contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (DC) and ecological risk index (Er) were used for assessing water and sediment pollution. Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery were processed to assess the land uses surrounding the lake. Geospatial analyses in ArcGIS were utilized for mapping purposes. Qaroun Lake is surrounded by variable interrupting land uses (i.e. urban, agricultural and industrial), amounting 32% of the total area. A remarkable fluctuation is observed in most of the studied water and sediment characteristics. Levels of phosphate and nitrate showed a mild (7-8.7 ppm) to a great fluctuation (0.2-46.6 ppm). Ammonia, Pb and Ni levels in water exceeded EPA standards. CF showed that the majority of the Lake is highly contaminated by Cd and Pb. OM was concentrated in the bottom sediments in association with heavy metals. DC and Er showed an increase in pollution and risk in front of El-Bats and El-Wadi drains. Further, metals are impacted and positively correlated with the Lake salinity. It can be concluded that wastewater discharge into Qaroun Lake increased levels of various pollutants to serious grades. To reduce pollution and accelerate Qaroun Lake recovery, two integrated wastewater treatment plants must be established on El-Bats and El-Wadi drains.

TI  - Invasive buffelgrass detection using high-resolution satellite and UAV imagery on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods to detect and monitor the spread of invasive grasses are critical to avoid ecosystem transformations and large economic costs. The rapid spread of non-native buffelgrass(Pennisetum ciliare) has intensified fire risk and is replacing fire intolerant native vegetation in the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern US. Coarse-resolution satellite imagery has had limited success in detecting small patches of buffelgrass, whereas ground-based and aerial survey methods are often cost prohibitive. To improve detection, we trained 2 m resolution DigitalGlobe WorldView-2 satellite imagery with 12 cm resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and classified buffelgrass on Google Earth Engine, a cloud computing platform, using Random Forest (RF) models in Saguaro National Park, Arizona, USA. Our classification models had an average overall accuracy of 93% and producer's accuracies of 94-96% for buffelgrass, although user's accuracies were low. We detected a 2.92 km(2) area of buffelgrass in the eastern Rincon Mountain District (1.07% of the total area) and a 0.46 km(2) area (0.46% of the total area) in the western Tucson Mountain District of Saguaro National Park. Buffelgrass cover was significantly greater in the Sonoran Paloverde-Mixed Cacti Desert Scrub vegetation type, on poorly developed Entisols and Inceptisol soils and on south-facing topographic aspects compared to other areas. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution imagery improve on previous attempts to detect and classify buffelgrass and indicate potential areas where the invasive grass might spread. The methods demonstrated in this study could be employed by land managers as a low-cost strategy to identify priority areas for control efforts and continued monitoring.

TI  - Land cover change and forest management strategies in Ife nature reserve, Nigeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the existing forest management strategies and land cover change in one of nature forest reserves in Nigeria. It analysed freely available Landsat imageries for the assessment of land cover change between 1986 and 2014, and conducted key informant interviews on forest guards and an administrator in relevant ministry, for information on management practiced. Results showed that about 35.2% of the vegetal cover were lost within the study period; 80% of the interviewed forest guards attributed such loss to unrestricted access of the surrounding communities, 60% to logging or chain saw operation, and 40% to farming practices and bush burning in the reserve. Management practiced is that, which ensures passive input with active harvesting, but cannot be fixed within a specific sustainable strategy of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. The study concluded that given the management strategy practiced in the forest reserve, which also allows defaulters of forest reserve regulations to escape punishment because they can 'settle', indicates that corruption, rather than poverty, is the major drive of deforestation in the area.

TI  - A Learning Approach to Evaluate the Quality of 3D City Models
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic generation of three-dimensional (3D) building models from geospatial data is now a standard procedure. An abundance of literature covers the last two decades, and several solutions are now available. However, urban areas are very complex environments. Inevitably, practitioners still have to visually assess, at a city-scale, the correctness of these models and detect frequent reconstruction errors. Such a process relies on experts and is highly time-consuming, with approximately two hours/km(2) per expert. This work proposes an approach for automatically evaluating the quality of 3D building models. Potential errors are compiled in a novel hierarchical and versatile taxonomy. This allows, for the first time, to disentangle fidelity and modeling errors, whatever the level of details of the modeled buildings. The quality of models is predicted using the geometric properties of buildings and, when available, Very High Resolution images and Digital Surface Models. A baseline of handcrafted, yet generic, features is fed into a Random Forest classifier. Both multiclass and multilabel cases are considered: due to the interdependence between classes of errors, it is possible to retrieve all errors at the same time while simply predicting correct and erroneous buildings. The proposed framework was tested on three distinct urban areas in France with more than 3000 buildings. 80%-99% F-score values are attained for the most frequent errors. For scalability purposes, the impact of the urban area composition on the error prediction was also studied, in terms of transferability, generalization, and representativeness of the classifiers. It showed the necessity of multimodal remote sensing data and mixing training samples from various cities to ensure a stability of the detection ratios, even with very limited training set sizes.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is aimed at the study of Russian culture's transformations in terms of the actualization of Orthodox dominants in the period of developing globalization paradigm of the modern world at the turn of the 21st centuries. The author explores topic' s methodological aspect, drawing upon the work of inter-and trans-disciplinary theorists in science, - V. A. Bazhanova, V. G. Budanova, L. P. Kiyaschenko, A. P. Ogurtsova, V. N. Porus, R. V. Scholz et al., and suggesting to perceive culture as a holistic system of being, where archetypes, signs and images are its integral parts. As such a system implies, various humanities do not simply complement each other, but form a single set of tools and methods for solving scientific problems beyond any single scientific discipline' s power. The author focuses on the imperatives of Russian culture, rooted in the Orthodox worldview. Their actualization took place at the turn of the 21st century in the process of establishing foundations of collective identity. Confessional bases of power manifestations as an indicator of civilizational specifics of Russia are analyzed within the context of state-church interaction. The study concludes that Orthodox dominants are the archetypical foundations of Russian culture, which find their expression in corresponding signs and images, both at the institutional and personal level of being.

T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The progressive nature of urbanization plays a prominent role in land-atmosphere processes, which have corresponding impacts on the general environment. This research investigated the changing patterns of the land use land cover over Osogbo and its environs using remote sensing data obtained from Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS sensors. The changes in four land use classes were assessed for the years 1984, 2000 and 2015. The land surface temperature (LST) of the area was estimated from the satellite images covering the study periods, and the surface urban heat island (SUHI) process was also investigated between the city of Osogbo and the surrounding towns. The results showed major urban expansion leading to urban sprawl within the vicinity. Urban area increased by 5106 ha while vegetation decreased by 8653 ha between 1984 and 2015 indicating major variations in the land surface features. This was revealed by the increase in the LST over the locations which ranged between 22.6 degrees C and 30 degrees C (mean, 25.2 degrees C) in 1984 and between 29.3 degrees C and 36.7 degrees C (mean, 31 degrees C) in 2015. The highest SUHI intensity was observed between the major urban area (Osogbo) and least developed towns. The continuous increase in the surface temperature of the environment due to the continuous variations in the land surface properties implies increased risk of heat-related environmental issues such as deterioration of thermal comfort conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of the Tropospheric Latent Heat Advective Fluxes over the Ocean by the Animated Analysis of Satellite Radiothermal Remote Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The next stage of advancing the animated analysis of satellite remote data proposed by the authors is described in detail: the development of a technique for calculating the latent heat advective fluxes by radiothermal measurement data from satellites. In accordance with previously accepted principles, the calculating algorithm is closed under the input satellite data; there are no requirements for additional information, which often significantly limit the applicability of new data processing techniques. The described step of the analysis is naturally associated with the already-existing algorithms and is based on the results of calculations carried out with their help (spatiotemporal interpolation of fields of geophysical parameters of the Earth atmosphere-ocean system) to evaluate the advective fluxes of the derived quantities. When the fields of integrated atmospheric vapor content are used as the input, the results of the calculations are latent heat fluxes in standard units (MW). The approach is demonstrated using the example of processing the arrayed SSM/I data acquired in August 2000 in the context of studying the evolution of tropical cyclone (TC) Alberto.

TI  - Greater Tumor Thickness, Ulceration, and Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Are Associated With Worse Prognosis in Patients With Conjunctival Melanoma Implications for Future AJCC Classifications
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying tumor characteristics that correlate with metastasis and survival in patients with conjunctival melanoma can potentially lead to better outcomes through a better selection of patients for adjuvant treatments including potentially life-saving new melanoma therapy. The objective of this study was to validate the conjunctival melanoma staging criteria in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition) and explore the prognostic importance of tumor thickness, histologic ulceration, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) findings in patients with conjunctival melanoma. This is a case series of 88 consecutive patients with conjunctival melanoma. Clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. Associations between pathologic characteristics and outcomes were studied using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the main outcome measures. The study included 56 women and 32 men; the median age was 62 years. At presentation, 41 patients had T1 disease, 23 had T2 disease, 23 had T3, and 1 had T4 disease. Sixty-six patients had invasive conjunctival melanoma (median thickness, 1.56 mm), 17 had conjunctival melanoma in situ, and in 5 patients, tumor thickness could not be determined. Overall, 22 patients had ulceration. In total, 31 patients underwent SLNB, and 4 had a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). The median follow-up time was 46.6 months. Overall, 12 patients had nodal metastasis at presentation or during follow-up, 19 patients had distant metastasis at last follow-up, and 14 patients died of the disease. Tumor thickness and ulceration were associated with increased risks of nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, and death from the disease. Overall, greater clinical T category at presentation was associated with increased risks of distant metastasis and disease-related death; however, the risks of distant metastasis and disease-related death did not differ between T1 (bulbar) and T2 (nonbulbar) tumors or between T2c,d (caruncular) and T1-T2a,b (noncaruncular) tumors. In patients who underwent SLNB, a positive SLN was associated with worse distant metastasis free survival and DSS. Consideration should be given to adding ulceration and emphasizing tumor thickness as the main determinants of pathologic T category for conjunctival melanoma in future AJCC classifications. The significant association between a positive SLN and worse DSS highlights the importance of SLNB for prognosis in patients with conjunctival melanoma and selecting high-risk patients for adjuvant drug treatment.

TI  - Delineation of hydrothermal alteration zones for porphyry systems utilizing ASTER data in Jebal-Barez area, SE Iran
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Belt (UDMB) is the host of many Iranian Cu porphyry deposits. The southern part of this belt, in the Jebal-Barez area, has been less investigated due to the mountainous and rough topography as well as some security confrontations. Porphyry deposits are associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, which can be mapped using the remote sensing data such as Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The aim of this study was to identify and detect the alteration zones associated with porphyry systems using ASTER data in Jebal-Barez area, SE Iran. For this reason, seven scenes of ASTER level-1B data which cover the Jebal-Barez area, were pre-processed and then processed by band ratio, false color composite and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) methods. The result indicated the presence of extensive phyllic and argillic alteration zones. The argillic alteration is surrounded by border zones of propylitic alteration. Also, a massive granitoid intrusion in NW of the studied area was detected by SAM method and the color composite of 4, 6, and 8 bands of ASTER as a completely altered area (SF area) which strongly needs more detailed exploration and field inspections.

TI  - First-principles magnetization relaxation equation of interacting ferrofluids with applications to magnetoviscous effects
T2  - PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetization relaxation equation (MRE) plays a primary role in numerous phenomena and applications involving ferrofluid dynamics. However, as yet there exist no MREs derived from first principles and applicable to concentrated and strongly interacting ferrofluids. In this paper, we derive a novel MRE based on the projection operator technique. It sufficiently accounts for interparticle correlations beyond the scope of previous models. The MREs by Martsenyuk, Raikher, and Shliomis and by Zubarev and Yushkov (ZY), respectively, for ideal and weakly nonideal (WNI) ferrofluids, are recovered as low-order approximations. We also investigate the magnetoviscous effects. For the first time, we unveil qualitatively the different roles played by short- and long-range interparticle correlations. The long-range correlation effect dominates in a WNI ferrofluid, and both our MRE and the ZY model are in quantitative agreement with simulations on field-dependent rotational viscosity. However, for strongly nonideal ferrofluids, short-range correlations can become substantial and compete with long-range correlations to reduce rotational viscosities. Our MRE is the first dynamic model faithfully capturing both short- and long-range correlations, thereby applicable to ferrofluids characterized by a broad range of concentrations and interacting strengths. It is expected to be a cornerstone for quantitative modeling of the dynamic response of ferrofluids to external fields or flow deformations. Because most commercial ferrofluids are designed to be strongly nonideal to enhance magnetic response, our theory may provide fresh insights for applications of realistic ferrofluids in industry and biomedicine.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Harmful Algal Blooms Variability for Lake Hulun Using Adjusted FM (AFAI) Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a global issue due to their serious threat to environmental ecology and rapid expansion around the world. Northeast China, characterized by a long ice period, has been ignored in the previous studies of HABs. However, Lake Hulun, a great lake located in Northeast China, has been found intense HABs since the 1980s. To evaluate HABs more precisely and efficiently through satellite images in Lake Hulun, an adjusted FAI (AFAI) method with an automatically identified threshold was developed. The method took full advantage of Landsat series sensors and MODIS products, and built a threshold selection range (0.01 similar to 0.02 for Landsat and 0.05 similar to 0.12 for MODIS) rather than a single threshold on all images. With the long-term satellite data from year 1983 to 2016, occurrences of HABs in Lake Hulun were investigated. There were total 169 occurrences of HABs during the periods and the first outbreak was detected in 1984. Though the initial outbreak date of HABs varied in each year, most HABs happened in July and August. The water quality of Lake Hulun have experienced a serious degradation especially in the past nine years as the outbreak frequency of HABs increased a lot since 2009. The reason of the degradation may be attributed to the continuous grazing around the lake, tourism, and anthropogenic activities on lake surface even in freezing period. Surrounding land use and land cover (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and water chemical and physical parameters were also related with the outbreak of HABs to some extent.

TI  - Classification of some strategic crops in Egypt using multi remotely sensing sensors and time series analysis
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural fields in Egypt are commonly distributed with relatively small sizes parcels that usually reduce the reliability of Agricultural statistics in surveying cropland. The use of remote sensing help in an accurate crop inventory under complex landscape conditions based on the spectral characteristics differences of crops. The current study was carried out in Abu El Matamir district, Behira Governorate, located in western Nile delta Egypt. The main objective of the current study is using time series analysis of remote sensing data in crop discrimination. In this study, 160 locations of ground truth points collected during different growth stages of summer season crops. Two different sensors images used in this study represented by single date image of RapidEye and multi-date Landsat 8 OLI satellites. The acquired satellite images from both sensors atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Moreover different vegetation indices calculated such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for cultivated crops in the study area during the whole growing season. Preliminary statistical analysis applied to the collected field data to show the distribution of the cultivated crops types. Moreover, unsupervised Iso-Data applied for multi-date Landsat 8 OLI images and calculated VI's series for overall growth season. Results showed higher overall kappa accuracy with 0.82 and 0.79 respectively. NDVI showed the best representation of the crop phenological changes during the crop growth season and showed higher accuracy in strategic crops discrimination than the single date image with higher spatial resolution.

TI  - "All the Progress to Be Made Will Be Made by Maladjusted Negroes": Mae Mallory, Black Women's Activism, and the Making of the Black Radical Tradition
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mae Mallory (1927-2007) was a radical political activist and a self-proclaimed "maladjusted Negro." She played a foundational role in developing and sustaining the black freedom movement through her school desegregation protests in the 1950s, Black Power advocacy in the 1960s, and Pan-African and prisoner's rights organizing in the 1970s and 1980s. She also espoused a politics defined by her commitment to a black, community-centered, working-class, gender-conscious, and anti-imperialist worldview. Mallory's multifaceted organizing, intellectual production, and women-centered approach to radical politics have made her an outlier in traditional historical frameworks. However, her alternative intellectual and activist path is also generative in that it illuminates different aspects of black women's political activism. This article examines Mallory's organizing and intellectual production through the lens of "maladjustment." It argues that her unconventional identifications, politics, and organizing trajectory not only showcase Mallory's unique influence on the black radical tradition, they also offer an opportunity to rethink existing approaches to the study of black women's activism. The essay offers one of the first overviews of Mallory's life, organizing, and theorizing, in order to foreground her role in shaping multiple facets of black organizing. In doing so, it offers a larger commentary on how "maladjusted" women like Mallory challenge conventional narratives about the periodization, strategies, and legacies of the black freedom movement.

TI  - <i>C</i>-Band Simulations of Melting Icebergs Using GRECOSAR and an EM Model: Varying Wind Conditions at Lower Beam Mode
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an electromagnetic backscatter model of iceberg and compares the modeled scattering behavior with C-band RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. It also explores iceberg SAR signature variability over various ocean parameters. Three-dimensional (3-D) profiles of icebergs were captured in a field study off the coast of Bonavista, NL, Canada, in June 2017 at the time of an SAR satellite overpass. The 3-D profiles were captured from a vessel, using a LiDAR and multibeam sonar. The SAR image and 3-D profiles were captured within hours of one another. Simulated SAR images of the icebergs were generated in a simulator called GRECOSAR with the satellite, target orientation, and ocean parameters that closely mimic the real SAR scene. A new ocean model was introduced to model an ocean backscatter at satellites' lower incidence angle beam mode. Comparison between real and simulated SAR images of the icebergs shows good agreement in terms of SAR signature, total radar cross section, and polarimetric decomposition. Wind direction was varied over 90 degrees extent to observe icebergs' backscatter variability in the simulator. Furthermore, simulated SAR images were generated for low and high wind conditions. Our study finds that the macrostructure of the melt iceberg dominates its polarimetric behavior of its backscatter. Large variability of iceberg SAR signature over varying ocean parameters was also observed. A mathematical model that considers the melting condition of iceberg suggested that significant backscattering can reflect from top surface when the melt water layer could be as little as 0.1 mm.

TI  - Comparison of Hyperspectral Versus Traditional Field Measurements of Fractional Ground Cover in the Australian Arid Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of high-quality field measurements of ground cover is critical for calibration and validation of fractional ground cover maps derived from satellite imagery. Field-based hyperspectral ground cover sampling is a potential alternative to traditional in situ techniques. This study aimed to develop an effective sampling design for spectral ground cover surveys in order to estimate fractional ground cover in the Australian arid zone. To meet this aim, we addressed two key objectives: (1) Determining how spectral surveys and traditional step-point sampling compare when conducted at the same spatial scale and (2) comparing these two methods to current Australian satellite-derived fractional cover products. Across seven arid, sparsely vegetated survey sites, six 500-m transects were established. Ground cover reflectance was recorded taking continuous hyperspectral readings along each transect while step-point surveys were conducted along the same transects. Both measures of ground cover were converted into proportions of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil for each site. Comparisons were made of the proportions of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil derived from both in situ methods as well as MODIS and Landsat fractional cover products. We found strong correlations between fractional cover derived from hyperspectral and step-point sampling conducted at the same spatial scale at our survey sites. Comparison of the in situ measurements and image-derived fractional cover products showed that overall, the Landsat product was strongly related to both in situ methods for non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil whereas the MODIS product was strongly correlated with both in situ methods for photosynthetic vegetation. This study demonstrates the potential of the spectral transect method, both in its ability to produce results comparable to the traditional transect measures, but also in its improved objectivity and relative logistic ease. Future efforts should be made to include spectral ground cover sampling as part of Australia's plan to produce calibration and validation datasets for remotely sensed products.

TI  - Relationships between landform properties and vegetation patterns in the Cerro Zonda Mt., Central Precordillera of San Juan. Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid environments are dynamic systems due, in part, to the action of hydrological processes. However, studies on the relationship between the abiotic factors and the properties of arid vegetation communities of Argentina are scarce. In this paper, the connection between these two parameters is researched using DEM analysis and exhaustive field work in order to model vegetation changes and landform evolution. The aim of this paper is to determine whether geomorphological properties influence vegetation patterns along the Cerro Zonda Mt. This mountain range is located in an arid central sector of Monte Desert, a phytogeographic region of Argentina. The classification of geomorphological units was made by combining interpretation of images provided by Google Earth and the analysis of Alos Palsar DEM using SAGA GIS. The geomorphic units were sorted into categories based on slope, elevation, hillslope aspect, terrain roughness and topographic wetness. In addition, surface characteristics of units were evaluated considering the properties of coverage of rock fragments, fine sediment and mulch. Afterwards, community patterns were explored using PCA analysis and linear correlations. Our results showed five geomorphological units: a) Pediment of mountain upland; b) Active landforms; c) Inactive landforms; d) Inactive landforms raised by neotectonics and e) Lacustrine landforms. The vascular flora is represented by 35 species distributed in 15 families. The landforms' surface property of rock fragments is correlated both directly with species richness and inversely with vegetation coverage. Furthermore, roughness explains the higher vegetation diversity while slope promotes an increase in the vegetation cover, but this does not suggest more species richness. In addition, our results indicate that topographic wetness, as well as hillslope aspect and elevation, are not determining variables of vegetation patterns across the landforms. The vegetation patterns of Cerro Zonda Mt. are associated with topographic properties as slope and roughness. In turn, rock fragment surface coverage also affects these vegetation patterns. The landforms' properties not only expose spatial changes in the development of the plant communities but also show the direct implications of geomorphological changes over such communities. In particular, there is a need to integrate a geomorphological view for the analysis of vegetation in arid zones.

TI  - Geometric and Radiometric Consistency of Parrot Sequoia Multispectral Imagery for Precision Agriculture Applications
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is about the geometric and radiometric consistency of diverse and overlapping datasets acquired with the Parrot Sequoia camera. The multispectral imagery datasets were acquired above agricultural fields in Northern Italy and radiometric calibration images were taken before each flight. Processing was performed with the Pix4Dmapper suite following a single-block approach: images acquired in different flight missions were processed in as many projects, where different block orientation strategies were adopted and compared. Results were assessed in terms of geometric and radiometric consistency in the overlapping areas. The geometric consistency was evaluated in terms of point cloud distance using iterative closest point (ICP), while the radiometric consistency was analyzed by computing the differences between the reflectance maps and vegetation indices produced according to adopted processing strategies. For normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a comparison with Sentinel-2 was also made. This paper will present results obtained for two (out of several) overlapped blocks. The geometric consistency is good (root mean square error (RMSE) in the order of 0.1 m), except for when direct georeferencing is considered. Radiometric consistency instead presents larger problems, especially in some bands and in vegetation indices that have differences above 20%. The comparison with Sentinel-2 products shows a general overestimation of Sequoia data but with similar spatial variations (Pearson's correlation coefficient of about 0.7, p-value < 2.2 x 10(-16)).

TI  - Analysis of Clay-Induced Land Subsidence in Uppsala City Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data and Precise Leveling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence and its subsequent hazardous effects on buildings and urban infrastructure are important issues in many cities around the world. The city of Uppsala in Sweden is undergoing significant subsidence in areas that are located on clay. Underlying clay units in parts of Uppsala act as mechanically weak layers, which for instance, cause sinking of the ground surface and tilting buildings. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has given rise to new methods of measuring movements on earth surface with a precision of a few mm. In this study, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) analysis was performed to map the ongoing ground deformation in Uppsala. The subsidence rate measured with PSI was validated with precise leveling data at different locations. Two ascending and descending data sets were analyzed using SARPROZ software, with Sentinel-1 data from the period March 2015 to April 2019. After the PSI analyses, comparative Permanent Scatterer (PS) points and metal pegs (measured with precise leveling) were identified creating validation pairs. According to the PSI analyses, Uppsala was undergoing significant subsidence in some areas, with an annual rate of about 6 mm/year in the line-of-sight direction. Interestingly, the areas of great deformation were exclusively found on postglacial clay.

TI  - Surface creep rate distribution along the Philippine fault, Leyte Island, and possible repeating of <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> ∼ 6.5 earthquakes on an isolated locked patch
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Active faults commonly repeat cycles of sudden rupture and subsequent silence of hundreds to tens of thousands of years, but some parts of mature faults exhibit continuous creep accompanied by many small earthquakes. Discovery and detailed examination of creeping faults on land have been in a rapid progress with the advent of space-borne synthetic aperture radar interferometry. In this study, we measured the spatial variation of the creep rate along the Philippine fault on Leyte Island using ALOS/PALSAR data acquired between October 2006 and January 2011. Prominent creep of 33 +/- 11 N. We compared the creep rate distribution along the fault with the slip distribution of the 2017 M-w 6.5 Ormoc earthquake which occurred in northern Leyte, estimated from the displacements mapped by ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 interferometric data. The estimated slip of the 2017 earthquake amounted up to 2.5 m and to moment magnitude of 6.49, with the dominant rupture area coinciding with the locked portion identified from the interseismic coupling analysis. Teleseismic waveforms of the 2017 earthquake and another event that occurred in 1947 (M-s 6.9) exhibit close resemblance, indicating two ruptures of rather similar locations and magnitudes with a time interval of 70 years.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsurface hydrocarbon traps are not correctly sealed, and hydrocarbons move vertically from the reservoir as invisible traces in the form of microseepages. Long-term hydrocarbon microseepages cause surface or near-surface alterations such as bleaching of red beds, enrichment of ferrous iron minerals and higher concentrations of clay and carbonate minerals in soils/rocks. Multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data have successfully been used to detect such alterations in many parts of the world. In India, such studies have not been carried out till now. In this study, Landsat 7 ETM+ images have been used to find out hydrocarbon microseepage-bearing areas in part of Assam-Arakan Fold Belt in the northeastern part of India. Based on the spectral characteristics of the hydrocarbon microseepage-induced altered minerals, two spectral enhancement techniques, viz. principal component analysis (PCA) and band ratio analysis, have been carried out on the Landsat 7 ETM+ images. PCA reveals that three principal component images-1457PC3, 1345PC2 and 3457PC4-show relatively better enhancement for the hydrocarbon-bearing alteration areas. Again, band ratio analysis of the images indicates that ratio images-3/1, (2+5)/(3+4) and 7/5-show excellent spectral enhancement for the hydrocarbon-induced mineral alterations. The three PC images have been combined with the three band ratio images to find out probable hydrocarbon microseepage areas. The remote sensing-derived prospect areas have been validated with surface geochemical, seismic/geologic and gravity data available in the area.

TI  - Modeling the impacts of land use-land cover changes on soil erosion and sediment yield in the Andassa watershed, upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impacts of land use-land cover (LULC) changes on soil erosion and sediment yield is necessary for watershed management planning purposes. This study was aimed at examining the impacts of LULC changes on soil erosion and sediment yield in the Andassa watershed during the past three decades and predicts the anticipated changes in the future. The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying time series Landsat images (1985-2015); the Cellular-Automata Markov (CA-Markov) model for prediction of the 2030 and 2045 LULC states; the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model for estimating the soil erosion rate; and the sediment delivery distributed model for sediment yield modeling were employed in the study. The different layers of the spatiotemporal changes on the LULC were used as the basis of analysis and the main factor for analyzing the changes in soil erosion and sediment yield over the period of analyses. The results showed that in the past three decades, cultivated land and built-up areas significantly increased while areas occupied by natural vegetation such as forest land, shrublands and grasslands dwindled at a rapid rate. The predicted results suggest continuation of the trend unless management interventions are made in the future. Consequently, the annual soil erosion rate has increased from 35.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1985 to 55 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2015, and sediment yield from 14.8 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1985 to 22.1 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2015. The model prediction suggests that the process of soil erosion and sediment yield from the watershed will continue to increase if the business as usual scenario of the land use is not changed in the next few decades. Despite the need for a planned use and management of the land resources in the watershed, the findings in this study also indicated a growing risk of sedimentation to power infrastructure in the upper Blue Nile basin.

TI  - Study on the Intensity and Coherence Information of High-Resolution ALOS-2 SAR Images for Rapid Massive Landslide Mapping at a Pixel Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid mapping of landslides following a disaster is important for coordinating emergency response and limiting rescue delays. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide a solution even in harsh weather and at night, due to its independence of weather and light, quick response, no contact and broad coverage. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive exploration on the intensity and coherence information of three Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) SAR images, for rapid massive landslide mapping in a pixel level, in order to provide a reference for future applications. Applied data were two pre-event and one post-event high-resolution ALOS-2 products. Studied area was in the east of Iburi, Hokkaido, Japan, where massive shallow landslides were triggered in the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake. Potential parameters, including intensity difference (d), co-event correlation coefficient (r), correlation coefficient difference (Delta r), co-event coherence (gamma), and coherence difference (Delta gamma), were first selected and calculated based on a radar reflection mechanism, to facilitate rapid detection. Qualitative observation was then performed by overlapping ground truth landslides to calculated parameter images. Based on qualitative observation, an absolute value of d (d(abs1)) was applied to facility analyses, and a new parameter (d(abs2)) was proposed to avoid information loss in the calculation. After that, quantitative analyses of the six parameters (d(abs1), d(abs2), r, Delta r, gamma and Delta gamma) were performed by receiver operating characteristic. d(abs2) and Delta r were found to be favorable parameters, which had the highest AUC values of 0.82 and 0.75, and correctly classified 69.36% and 64.57% landslide and non-landslide pixels by appropriate thresholds. Finally, a discriminant function was developed, combining three relatively favorable parameters (d(abs2), Delta r, and Delta gamma) with one in each type, and achieved an overall accuracy of 74.31% for landslide mapping.

TI  - Deltaic sedimentary environments in the Niger Delta, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on the geomorphology of surface sedimentary environments contained in the fluvial, tidal and wave-dominated areas of the Niger Delta. GIS techniques applied to high-quality Landsat and SPOT images were used to identify and map landforms and processes, as well as quantitatively characterise their metrics and spatial distribution. A detailed analysis shows that the extent of the Niger Delta is 70,000 km(2), contrary to previous publications that reported 75,000 km(2). The delta has also been remapped and classified into mega sedimentary environments: the upper deltaic plain is 69% of the total extent, while the lower deltaic plain and delta front are 25% and 6% respectively. Other subunits were distinguished and mapped within the upper deltaic plain such as fluvial channels, point bars, braid bars, oxbow lakes, and other lakes. Tidal channels, beaches and spits were identified in the lower deltaic plain and delta front. The geometries of these sedimentary bodies (landforms) appear to be relatively scale-invariant, thus meaning that from the measurement of some dimensional parameters (e.g. the length) it is possible to estimate all others (e.g. the width and overall extent). This is an aspect of great relevance in subsurface analyses where it is often difficult to predict the extent of sedimentary bodies. The correlation between channel width and length (r(2) = 0.9), is the strongest relationship found between sedimentary body metrics.

TI  - Developing a Nowcasting Capability for X-Class Solar Flares Using VLF Radiowave Propagation Changes.
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique for analyzing very low frequency (VLF) radiowave signals is investigated in order to achieve rapid, real-time detection of large solar flares, through the monitoring of changes in VLF radio signal propagation conditions. The reliability of the use of VLF phase and amplitude perturbations to determine the X-ray fluxes involved during 10 large solar flare events (>X1) is examined. Linear regression analysis of signals from the NPM transmitter in Hawaii, received at Arrival Heights, Scott Base, Antarctica, over the years 2011-2015 shows that VLF phase perturbations during large solar flares have a 1.5-3 times lower mean square error when modeling the long wavelength X-ray fluxes than the equivalent short wavelength fluxes. The use of VLF amplitude observations to determine long or short wavelength X-ray flux levels have a 4-10 times higher mean square error than when using VLF phase. Normalized linear regression analysis identifies VLF phase as the most important parameter in the regression, followed by solar zenith angle at the midpoint of the propagation path, then the initial solar X-ray flux level (from 5 min before the impact of the solar flare), with F10.7 cm flux from the day beforehand providing the least important contribution. Transmitter phase measurements are more difficult to undertake than amplitude. However, networks of VLF receivers already exist which include the high quality phase capability required for such a nowcasting product. Such narrowband VLF data can be a redundant source of flare monitoring if satellite data is not available.

TI  - A city growth and land-use/land-cover change: a case study of Bhopal, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the rate of urban expansion is quite alarming in developing countries, especially in India. This hasty rate of urban expansion has significantly transformed the natural landscape and creates negative impact on environment. For planned development, we need to understand the urbanization process clearly, and also need to understand the changes in land use/land cover (LULC). Currently, remote-sensing data and GIS technique have been used extensively to understand the urbanization processes and its impact on land use. The aim of the current study is to analyze the expansion of Bhopal city and its impact on land use, using remotely sensed data along with several statistical techniques such as Shannon's entropy and Chi square statistic. The analysis shows that the city has experienced a rapid rate of horizontal expansion; city area increased from 15.8 km(2) in 1991 to 184.5 km(2) in 2016 at an average change of 7 km(2) year(-1) with spatial disparity. LULC classes of the city area were altered by this expansion process. Expansions of built-up area mainly come from the agricultural and forest land. These are the two primary classes which were affected badly by this expansion process. The present study suggests to make cities more compact, and the need to take proper land and housing policy by the local governing authority and policy makers.

TI  - Are phenological variations in natural teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i>) forests of India governed by rainfall? A remote sensing based investigation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and assessment of vegetation phenology at the regional to global scale are essential to understand the characteristics of various biophysical parameters in terrestrial ecosystems. Passive optical remote sensing data have been used extensively in the recent past to study phenology of vegetation, also called land surface phenology, at diverse landscapes across the globe. In the present study, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series data (2000-2013) was used to study the phenology of dry and moist teak (Tectona grandis) forests of different biogeographic provinces of India. Four phenology metrics, viz., start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), peak of season (POS) and length of season (LOS) were derived using the TIMESAT tool. The SOSs' of dry and moist teak were found during July-August. LOS of moist teak was found to be much longer (similar to 48 days) than dry teak. Also, a significant difference of leaf area index (LAI) (similar to 2.8) of dry and moist teak forests was noticed during peak season from MODIS LAI product (MOD15A2). Vegetation phenology is greatly responsive to the fluctuation of climatic parameters such as rainfall. Hence, preseason cumulative rainfall data were analysed to understand the control of rainfall over phenological variations in natural teak forests of India. It was noticed that rainfall was reasonably well correlated with SOS (R-2 = 0.57-0.72) for both types of teak forests. The study highlighted the efficacy of time series MODIS EVI data to study the phenological variations in different teak forest types of India in a data-limited situation.

TI  - Natural Hazards, Human Factors, and "Ghost Towns": a Multi-Level Approach
T2  - GEOHERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The abandonment of inhabited places is a phenomenon that concerns many countries worldwide and Italy particularly where a large number of deserted settlements are hosted. Many are the factors driving and conditioning the abandonment of a site, such as natural extreme events (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, and floods) and/or human (not) actions. Once the site is abandoned, the built-up area experiences a progressive physical decay so posing problems about the policies to be adopted to manage and maintain the buildings (or their ruins). That being stated, the article proposes an integrated methodological approach to analyse both the natural/human factors causing the abandonment of settlements and conservation state of deserted places over time. To test the methodology, we considered the old town of Craco (Basilicata, Southern Italy) as a case study. That "ghost town", whose fascinating urban and natural landscapes have been the set of numerous international films, was gradually transferred to other two places since the 1960s due to the landslides that have affected the site over the centuries. Three were the explicit key aims of the research. The first was to scrutinise the activations/reactivations of the landslides jointly with their effects on the built environment so to critical go over the actions put into the field by the institutions to mitigate the hydrogeological risk. The second was to examine whether and how the landslide occurrences conditioned the urban growth of the Craco over time. The third was to investigate in relation to the vegetation growth in the Craco downtown over the last 15 years or so, to infer clues on future decay trends and conservation strategies of the built environment. The purposes were reached considering a geological-geomorphological, historical, and remote-sensing approach. In detail, the first goal was met (re)considering a cross-correlated analysis, in diachronic key, of edited/unedited archive sources with geological/geomorphological perspectives. The second was followed up performing the analysis of the Craco urban growth over the centuries and correlating it with the history of landslide occurrences. The third target was pursued by means of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series obtained from Landsat TM and Sentinel 2 data along with HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour system techniques applied to multi-date Google Earth photos. From the perspective angle, the results of this research can contribute to setup proper resilience strategies for sites subject to hydrogeological hazard similar to that affects Craco, thus helping to identify conservation plans as well as enhancement policies of "ghost towns".

TI  - The Curious Case of Cu Chulainn: Nationalism, Culture, and Meaning-Making in the Contested Symbols of Northern Ireland
T2  - STUDIES IN ETHNICITY AND NATIONALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the ways that political movements utilize contested imagery to further ideological goals. While scholars have long recognized the importance of symbols for nationalism, most analyses rely on national symbols being relatively unambiguous. I seek to understand how such processes function when this is not the case, examining how organizations on both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland deployed the same symbol - representations of the Irish hero Cu Chulainn - to support diametrically opposed political programmes. I argue that the different movements in Northern Ireland imbued symbols such as Cu Chulainn with their own meaning by emplotting them within their ideological narratives. These narratives shaped and gave significance to visual symbols, producing myths that sought to structure the ways members of society viewed the world. In return, these symbols and myths provided evidence which reciprocally strengthened and supported the ideological narratives of the movements that produced them, serving as potent reminders of the ideological worldview such narratives advocate.

TI  - A Review of the Application of Remote Sensing Data for Abandoned Agricultural Land Identification with Focus on Central and Eastern Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - This study aims to analyze and assess studies published from 1992 to 2019 and listed in the Web of Science (WOS) and Current Contents (CC) databases, and to identify agricultural abandonment by application of remote sensing (RS) optical and microwave data. We selected 73 studies by applying structured queries in a field tag form and Boolean operators in the WOS portal and by expert analysis. An expert assessment yielded the topical picture concerning the definitions and criteria for the identification of abandoned agricultural land (AAL). The analysis also showed the absence of similar field research, which serves not only for validation, but also for understanding the process of agricultural abandonment. The benefit of the fusion of optical and radar data, which supports the application of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, is also evident. Knowledge attained from the literary sources indicated that there exists, in the world literature, a well-covered problem of abandonment identification or biomass estimation, as well as missing works dealing with the assessment of the natural accretion of biomass in AAL.

TI  - A fuzzy model integrating shoreline changes, NDVI and settlement influences for coastal zone human impact classification
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current approaches for obtaining shoreline change rates suffer from inability to give a specialist interpretation of the numerical results represented by velocities (m/yr). This study proposes a fuzzy model for coastal zone human impact classification that integrates shoreline changes, NDVI, and settlement influences to enhance numerical-linguistic fuzzy classification through Geographical Information System (GIS)'s graphical visualization prowess. The model output representing scores are numbers ranging from zero to one, which are convertible into fuzzy linguistic classification variables; i.e., low, moderate, and high on the one hand. On the other hand, use of GIS through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) provides enhancement through graphic visualization. Using Itamaraca Island in Brazil as an example, multi-temporal satellite images are processed to provide all the required input variables. The resulting output divides the entire island into five sectors representing both quantitative and qualitative outcomes (i.e., fuzzy classification composed of both scores and maps), showcasing the capability of the proposed approach to complement shoreline change analysis through physical (map) interpretation in addition to the frequently used numbers. The proposed fuzzy model is validated using random in-situ samples and high resolution image data that has been classified by a coastal geomorphology specialist. The accuracy of the interpretation show 81% of matches are achievable compared to the results of the fuzzy model. The final results delivered by the proposed fuzzy approach show the complex behavior of the local dynamics, thereby adding useful and substantial information for environmental issues and Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports investigation data on ridge landscape patterns (formed by Baer knolls) in the North Caspian region obtained by mathematical approaches to landscape morphology. The investigation procedure involves remote sensing data and mathematical methods. A mathematical analysis of six sample areas has revealed that perimeters and diameters of the ridges fit the lognormal distribution. Discrete indicators that characterize the ridge location are compliant with the Poisson's distribution in most cases. Due to river erosion activity, which destroys the knolls, their diameters do not fit the lognormal distribution anymore. The arguments have been considered in favor of various theories of the Baer knolls origin from the standpoint of quantitative features of the morphological structure.

AB  - Introduction. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with foci of invasion measuring <= 1 mm (DCISM), represents < 1% of all invasive breast cancers. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been a standard component of surgery for patients with invasive carcinoma or extensive DCIS. We hypothesize that selective performance of SLNB may be appropriate given the low incidence of sentinel node (SN) metastasis for DCISM. We investigated the clinicopathologic predictors for SN positivity in DCISM, to identify which patients might benefit from SLNB.Methods. A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database was performed for cases from 2012 to 2015. Clinical and tumor characteristics, including SN results, were evaluated, and Pearson's Chi square tests and logistic regression were performed.Results. Of 7803 patients with DCISM, 306 (4%) had at least one positive SN. Patients with positive SNs were younger, more often of Black race, had higher-grade histology and larger tumor size, and were more likely to have lymphovascular invasion (LVI; all p < 0.001). In an adjusted model, the presence of LVI was associated with the highest odds ratio (OR) for node positivity (OR 8.80, 95% confidence interval 4.56-16.96).Conclusions. Among women with DCISM, only 4% had a positive SN. Node positivity was associated with more extensive and higher-grade DCIS, and the presence of LVI was strongly correlated with node positivity. Our data suggest that LVI is the most important factor in determining which patients with DCISM will benefit from SN biopsy.

TI  - Application of NDVI in Digital Mapping of Phosphorus Content in Soils and Phosphorus Supply Assessment in Plants
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for the digital mapping of phosphorus (total, organic, and labile) content in soils has been developed using spatially distributed NDVI values calculated from Landsat 8 image (30-m resolution). A comparative analysis of the phosphorus content has been performed in high- and medium-humous soils. Medium-humous soil (agrochernozems, agro-dark gray) has been found to have lower contents of the total (by a factor of 1.1) and organic (by a factor of 1.5-1.7) phosphorus compared with high-humous agrochernozems. The reverse trend has been identified for the labile phosphorus; that is, medium-humous soils twice exceeded the high-humous agrochernozems in its content. The plants have been proven to have a sufficient supply of phosphorus, since the element content in the aboveground phytomass of the oat-pea mixture was in the optimal range of 0.23-0.5% on a dry weight basis. No phosphorus deficiency symptoms have been detected in the plants by visual diagnostics. No correlation has been found between the phosphorus content in plants, aboveground phytomass stock of the oat-pea mixture and NDVI.

TI  - Effect of Slope Mesorelief on the Spatial Variability of Soil Properties and Vegetation Index Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article evaluates the effect of terrain morphometric parameters calculated from the digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM, 30 m) on the spatial variability of soil properties and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of a forb-oat mix. According to regression analysis, the morphometric parameters contribute 42% to the spatial variability of soil moisture; 59 and 46% to physical clay and humus content, respectively; and 86% to the NDVI of the oat-herb mixture. Indicators of moisture and physical clay and humus content in a plow layer of agro-grey soil of the transitional part of the slope are lower when compared with the alluvial part of the slope. In our opinion, this is a result of the development of erosional processes on the sloped terrain site, less favorable hydrothermal conditions, and human economic activities. The statistical relationships between soil properties and morphometric parameters of the terrain make it possible to build a predictive map of the soil properties.

AB  - Pinus tabuliformis is an important afforestation species in the Loess Plateau. Quick and accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) of P. tabuliformis plantations plays an important role in monitoring regional forest resources. Here, we used multi-spectral remote sensing data of domestic satellite GF-2 and the field data to estimate the aboveground biomass of P. tabuliformis plantations in Shibao forest farm of Huanglong Mountain in Shaanxi Province. We calculated eight texture features and five vegetation indices, and then built models based four texture windows (3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9) by using five regression methods including normal regression, stepwise regression, ridge regression, Lasso regression and principal component regression. We used the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) to test the estimation accuracy of each model. We found serious multi-collinearity relationships between the extracted remote sensing factors. Most of the remote sensing factors had significant correlations with aboveground biomass of P. tabuliformis plantations. GF-2 data could achieve higher accuracy in the inversion of aboveground biomass of P. tabuliformis plantations in the Shibao forest farm. The best estimation result was the principal component regression model using 9x9 texture window, and the worst one was the normal regression model using 3x3 texture window. Inversion of aboveground biomass of P. tabuliformis plantation using domestic high-resolution satellite imagery could provide a scientific basis for forestry biomass monitoring, resource management, and sustainable management in the forestry departments of northwest China.

TI  - Decadal-Scale Aquifer Dynamics and Structural Complexities at a Municipal Wellfield Revealed by 25 Years of InSAR and Recent Groundwater Temperature Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 35 years the Buckman wellfield near Santa Fe, New Mexico, experienced production well drawdowns in excess of 180 m, resulting in ground subsidence and surface cracks. Increased reliance on surface water diversions since 2011 has reduced pumping and yielded water level recovery. To characterize the impact of wellfield management decisions on the aquifer system, we reconstruct the surface deformation history through the European Remote Sensing Satellite, Advanced Land Observing Satellite, and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis during episodes of drawdown (1993-2000), recovery (2007-2010), and modern management (2015-2018) in discontinuous observations over a 25-year period. The observed deformation generally reflects changes in hydraulic head. However, at times during the wellfield recovery, the deformation signal is complex, with patterns of uplift and subsidence suggesting a compartmentalized aquifer system. Recent records of locally high geothermal gradients and an overall warming of the system (similar to 0.5 degrees C during the water level recovery) obtained from repeat temperature measurements between 2013 and 2018 constrain a conceptual model of convective heat transfer that requires a vertical permeable zone near an observed fault. To reproduce observed temperature patterns at monitoring wells, high basal heat flow and convective cooling associated with downward flow of water from cool shallow aquifers during the drawdown period is necessary. The fault, however, appears to die out southward or may be locally permeable, as conceptual cross-sectional hydrologic modeling reproduces the surface deformation without such a structure. Our work demonstrates the importance of incorporating well-constrained stratigraphy and structure when modeling near-surface deformation induced by, for instance, groundwater production.

TI  - Global ocean primary production trends in the modern ocean color satellite record (1998?2015)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean primary production (PP), representing the uptake of inorganic carbon through photosynthesis, supports marine life and affects carbon exchange with the atmosphere. It is difficult to ascertain its magnitude, variability, and trends due to our inability to measure it directly at large scales. Yet it is paramount for understanding changes in marine health, fisheries, and the global carbon cycle. Using assimilation of ocean color satellite data into an ocean biogeochemical model, we estimate that global net ocean PP has experienced a small but significant decline ?0.8 PgC y(?1) (?2.1%) decade(?1) (P;<;0.05) in the 18-year satellite record from 1998 to 2015. This decline is associated with shallowing surface mixed layer depth (?2.4% decade(?1)) and decreasing nitrate concentrations (?3.2% decade(?1)). Relative contributions to PP by various types of ocean phytoplankton have changed, with decreases in production by intermediate-sized phytoplankton represented by chlorophytes (?14.3% decade(?1)). This is partially compensated by increases from the unique, more nutrient-efficient, coccolithophores (8.4% decade(?1)). Geographically, the North and Equatorial Indian Oceans are responsible for much of the decline in PP, falling 0.16 and 0.69 PgC y(?1) decade(?1), respectively. Reduced production by large, fast-growing diatoms along with chlorophytes characterizes the decline here. In contrast, increases in PP are found in the North and North Central Pacific. The increases here are led by chlorophytes in the North Pacific and the small cyanobacteria in the North Central Pacific. These results suggest that the multi-decadal satellite observational record, coupled with an underlying representation of marine biodiversity in a model, can monitor the uptake of carbon by phytoplankton and that changes, although small, are occurring in the global oceans.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection for patients with invasive breast cancer at Charlotte Maxeke and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospitals
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The extent of axillary surgery correlates with its morbidity and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the standard of care in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients.This study aims to evaluate the application of SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and the associated risk factors for node-negative ALND in our units. Methods: We included female patients with primary breast cancer who underwent axillary surgery in the breast units at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from March 2013 to March 2015. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with pathological node-negative (pN0) ALND.Results: 505 patients were included and 344 patients were staged clinically node-positive (68.1%), 161 (31.9%) were assessed as clinically node-negative and deemed eligible for SLNB. Sensitivity of clinical nodal staging was 85.9% with a positive predictive value of 76.5%. The majority of patients (313, 61.9%) underwent primary surgery while 192 (38.1%) underwent surgery after NACT. We performed 118 SLNBs and 387 ALNDs of which 97 were pathologically node-negative. Risk was not increased after NACT ( OR 1.06, p = 0.790). We identified a significant risk in patients with triple-negative and HER-2 enriched subtypes compared to hormone receptor-positive patients (OR 3.05, 95% CI: 1.6-5.7, p = 0.001 and OR 2.25, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8, p = 0.035).Conclusions: The prevalence of pN0 ALND was 25.06%. In our cohort a significantly higher risk was found in hormone receptor-negative tumours.Preoperative nodal assessment needs to be optimised and include pathological confirmation. SLNB needs to be extended to patients after NACT despite resource-constraints.

TI  - On-Orbit Analysis and Correction of the Inconsistency in the Response Characteristics of TG-2/MAI CCD Pixels
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The difference in the response characteristics of charge-coupled device (CCD) pixels is one of the main factors restricting the quality of the Multi-angle Polarization Imager (MAI) and its quantitative application. In order to improve the quality of CCD imaging, this paper used a total of 104,403 frames of observational data from September 2016 to March 2018, based on the full-range multi-section analysis and correction method, to realize the analysis and correction for the inconsistency in the pixel response characteristics of MAI polarized and non-polarized channels. And the results were verified using the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Firstly, assuming there are sufficient observational samples, that is, the objects observed by each pixel have the same ergodicity, and the average Digital Number (DN) value of all samples corresponding to each CCD pixel could represent the response characteristics of each pixel of the CCD. Secondly, constructing reference images for each channel by using 104 403 frames observation data, and the 5X 5 pixels in the CCD center are used as standard DN values corresponding to each reference image. Next, the response characteristics of the MAI polarized and non-polarized channels are analyzed respectively. The results show that there is significant inconsistency in the response characteristics in each MAI pixel and each channel. The inconsistency in each channel falls roughly between 4% and 10%. And for polarized channels, the inconsistencies in the pixel response characteristics between the three polarized channels in the same polarization band have some similarities, but there are certain differences, and the difference in pixel response inconsistency is basically within 1%. Then, the observational data for two years are divided into two periods for comparative analysis. The result shows that the CCD pixel response characteristics do not decay over time. This also shows that the amount of reference image data is sufficient, which further rerifies the rationality of the above assumptions. Therefore, the full-range multi-section correction method can be used to correct the inconsistency of each pixel's response characteristics on a channel-by-channel basis. After correction was performed based on this method, the image quality of MAI is significantly improved. The dependence on the observational zenith angle of the CCD pixel response is significant. The image is smoother, and the graininess is basically eliminated. Also, the scenes of some areas have changed especially targets with a reflectivity between low and medium reflectivity, such as broken cloud and so on. Compared with GOME-2, the average absolute deviations between the reflectance of the MAI 565, 670, and 763nm bands and the GOME-2 reference reflectance are reduced from 1. 6%, 4. 2%, and 2. 2% to 0. 5%, 2. 6%, and 0. 4% after correction, respectively. In addition, the cloud detection result based on the multi-hand cloud identification method shows that, compared with the MODIS cloud detection product at a similar time, the corrected MAI cloud detection result looks more accurate. Therefore, the full-range multi-section analysis and correction method can realize the monitoring and correction of the inconsistency in the response characteristics of the MAI CCD pixels, which significantly improves the quality of the on-orbit observations of this instrument. And this method can also be applied to the on-orbit calibration of other CCD instruments.

TI  - Derivation of air temperature of agricultural areas of Morocco from remotely land surface temperature based on the updated Koppen-Geiger climate classification
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature is an important meteorological variable in many fields of our life. However, the availability of air temperature measurements over large geographic areas is often limited by the weather stations spatial distribution inadequacy, their low density and difficulties of data quality and collection. In this context, this study consists to develop four simple models to estimate the three components of air temperature (T-min, T-max and T-mean) from remotely sensed land surface temperature (T-s) derived from NOAA-AVHRR images, and based on the international Koppen-Geiger climate classification of Morocco. The results confirmed the existence of good relationships between the three components of measured air temperatures and land surface temperature derived from NOAA-AVHRR images for the main four climate classes of Morocco. The coefficient of determination, R-2, varied between 0.69 and 0.80 for T-min versus T-s, between 0.62 and 0.74 for T-max versus T-s, and between 0.69 and 0.79 for T-mean versus T-s. The root mean square error varied between 3.1 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C for T-min versus T-s, between 3.2 and 4.1 degrees C for T-max versus T-s and between 2.7 and 3.4 degrees C for T-mean versus T-s. K-fold cross validation method was performed to assess the accuracy and the stability of proposed models. The limited number of proposed models is a great advantage to carry further studies requiring air temperature's components at larger scale.

TI  - A lymphedema Surveillance Program for Breast Cancer Patients Reveals the Promise of Surgical Prevention
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the most significant survivorship issues in breast cancer management. Presently, there is no cure for BCRL. The single greatest risk factor for developing BCRL is an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventative Healing Approach (LYMPHA) is a surgical procedure to reduce the risk of lymphedema in patients undergoing an ALND. We present our single institution results after offering LYMPHA in the context of an established lymphedema surveillance program.Materials and methods: A retrospective review of our lymphedema surveillance program at the University of Florida was performed over a 2-year period (March 2014-March 2016). LYMPHA was offered to patients undergoing ALND beginning in March 2015. Patients who developed lymphedema were compared with those who did not. Demographics and potential risk factors for development of lymphedema such as age, body mass index, clinical stage, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were reviewed.Results: Eighty-seven patients participated in the surveillance program over the study period with an average age of 60 y (range 32-83) and body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) (range 1746). The single most significant risk factor for the development for lymphedema was an ALND (P < 0.001). One of 67 patients undergoing a sentinel lymph node biopsy developed lymphedema (1.5%). Four of 10 patients who underwent an ALND alone developed lymphedema (40%). One of 8 patients in the ALND LYMPHA group developed transient lymphedema (12.5%).Conclusions: Offering LYMPHA with ALND decreased our institutional rate of lymphedema from 40% to 12.5%. Long-term follow-up and randomized control trials are necessary to further elucidate the promise of this surgical technique to reduce the incidence of BCRL. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Large-Eddy Simulations of Real-World Episodes in Complex Terrain Based on ERA-Reanalysis and Validated by Ground-Based Remote Sensing Data
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A computationally efficient and inexpensive approach for using the capabilities of large-eddy simulations (LES) to model small-scale local weather phenomena is presented. The setup uses the LES capabilities of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-LES) on a single domain that is directly driven by reanalysis data as boundary conditions. The simulated area is an example for complex terrain, and the employed parameterizations are chosen in a way to represent realistic conditions during two 48-h periods while still keeping the required computing time around 10(5) CPU hours. We show by evaluating turbulence characteristics that the model results conform to results from typical LES. A comparison with ground-based remote sensing data from a triple Doppler-lidar setup, employed during the "ScaleX" campaigns, shows the grade of adherence of the results to the measured local weather conditions. The representation of mesoscale phenomena, including nocturnal low-level jets, strongly depends on the temporal and spatial resolution of the meteorological boundary conditions used to drive the model. Small-scale meteorological features that are induced by the terrain, such as katabatic flows, are present in the simulated output as well as in the measured data. This result shows that the four-dimensional output of WRF-LES simulations for a real area and real episode can be technically realized, allowing a more comprehensive and detailed view of the micrometeorological conditions than can be achieved with measurements alone.

TI  - Spatial Neglect in Stroke: Identification, Disease Process and Association with Outcome During Inpatient Rehabilitation
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We established spatial neglect prevalence, disease profile and amount of therapy that inpatient stroke survivors received, and outcomes at discharge using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data. We used data from 88,664 National Health Service (NHS) admissions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (July 2013-July 2015), for stroke survivors still in hospital after 3 days with a completed baseline neglect National Institute for Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Thirty percent had neglect (NIHSS item 11 >= 1) and they were slightly older (78 years) than those without neglect (75 years). Neglect was observed more commonly in women (33 vs. 27%) and in individuals with a premorbid dependency (37 vs. 28%). Survivors of mild stroke were far less likely to present with neglect than those with severe stroke (4% vs. 84%). Those with neglect had a greatly increased length of stay (27 vs. 10 days). They received a comparable amount of average daily occupational and physiotherapy during their longer inpatient stay but on discharge a greater percentage of individuals with neglect were dependent on the modified Rankin scale (76 vs. 57%). Spatial neglect is common and associated with worse clinical outcomes. These results add to our understanding of neglect to inform clinical guidelines, service provision and priorities for future research.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Hourly and Kilometer Resolution Retrospective and Real-Time Surface Meteorological Blended Forcing Dataset (SMBFD) in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A real-time, long-term surface meteorological blended forcing dataset (SMBFD) has been developed based on station observations, satellite retrievals, and reanalysis products in China. The observations are collected at national and regional automatic weather stations, satellite data are obtained from the Fengyun (FY) series satellites retrievals, and the reanalysis products are obtained from the ECMWF. The 90-m resolution digital terrain elevation data in China are obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) for temperature and humidity elevation adjustment. The dataset includes 2-m air temperature and humidity, 10-m zonal and meridional winds, downward shortwave radiation, surface pressure, and precipitation. The spatial resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is 1 h. During the data processing procedure, various data fusion techniques including the space-time multiscale variational analysis, the discrete ordinates radiative transfer (DISORT) model, the hybrid radiation estimation model, and a terrain correction algorithm are employed. Dependent and independent evaluations of the dataset are performed against observations. The SMBFD dataset is also compared with similar datasets produced in other major meteorological operational centers in the world. The results are as follows. (1) All variables show reasonable geographic distribution features and realistic spatial and temporal variations. (2) Dependent and independent evaluations both indicate that the gridded SMBFD dataset is close to the observations, while the dependent evaluation yields better results than the independent evaluation. (3) Compared with similar datasets produced in other meteorological operational centers, the real-time and retrospective surface meteorological fusion data obviously have higher quality. The dataset introduced in the present study is in general stable and accurate, and can be applied in various practice such as meteorology, agriculture, ecology, environmental protection, etc. Meanwhile,this dataset has been used as the atmospheric forcing data to drive the operational High-resolution Land Data Assimilation System of China Meteorological Administration. The dataset with the network Common Data Form (NETCDF) can be decoded by various programming languages, and it is freely available to non-commercial users.

TI  - Analysis of Tidal Deflection and Ice Properties of Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, by using DDInSAR Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the tide deformation of land boundary regions on the east (Region A) and west (Region B) sides of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica using Double-Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DDInSAR). A total of seven Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired in 2015-2016 were used to estimate the accuracy of tide prediction model and Young's modulus of ice shelf. First, we compared the Ross Sea Height-based Tidal Inverse (Ross_Inv) model, which is a representative tide prediction model for the Antarctic Ross Sea, with the tide deformation of the ice shelf extracted from the DDInSAR image. The accuracy was analyzed as 3.86 cm in the east region of Ross Ice Shelf and it was confirmed that the inverse barometric pressure effect must be corrected in the tide model. However, in the east, it is confirmed that the tide model may be inaccurate because a large error occurs even after correction of the atmospheric effect. In addition, the Young's modulus of the ice was calculated on the basis of the one-dimensional elastic beam model showing the correlation between the width of the hinge zone where the tide strain occurs and the ice thickness. For this purpose, the grounding line is defined as the line where the displacement caused by the tide appears in the DDInSAR image, and the hinge line is defined as the line to have the local maximum/minimum deformation, and the hinge zone as the area between the two lines. According to the one-dimensional elastic beam model assuming a semi-infinite plane, the width of the hinge region is directly proportional to the 0.75 power of the ice thickness. The width of the hinge zone was measured in the area where the ground line and the hinge line were close to the straight line shown in DDInSAR. The linear regression analysis with the 0.75 power of BEDMAP2 ice thickness estimated the Young's modulus of 1.77 +/- 0.73 GPa in the east and west of the Ross Ice Shelf. In this way, more accurate Young's modulus can be estimated by accumulating Sentinel-1 images in the future.

TI  - Spectral reflectance behavior of different boreal snow types
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral reflectance of natural snow samples representing various stratigraphies was investigated in a controlled dark laboratory environment. Mean and Std dev. of band specific reflectance values were determined for several satellite sensor bands utilized in remote sensing of snow. The reflectance values for dry, moist, wet and wet and littered snow for different instruments varied between 0.63-0.97 in the visible and near-infrared bands at an incoming light zenith angle of theta = 55 degrees. The results indicate that in MODIS band 4 (545-565 nm), essential to snow mapping, the reflectance of snow drops by 9% when dry snow changes to wet snow and by a further 10% when typical forest litter inclusions exist on the wet snow surface. A separate investigation of individual snow types revealed that they can be grouped either as dry or wet snow based on their spectral behavior. However, some snow types were located between these two distinct groups, such as snow with near-surface melt-freeze crusts, and could not be clearly distinguished. The reflectance statistics collected and analyzed here can be directly used to refine accuracy characterization and parametrization of snow mapping algorithms, such as the SCAmod method, used for the mapping of snow cover area.

TI  - High resolution crop intensity mapping using harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in crop intensity could improve crop yield but may also lead to a series of environmental problems, such as depletion of ground water and increased soil salinity. The generation of high resolution (30 m) crop intensity maps is an important method used to monitor these changes, but this is challenging because the temporal resolution of the 30-m image time series is low due to the long satellite revisit period and high cloud coverage. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite could provide optical images at 10-60 m resolution and thus improve the temporal resolution of the 30-m image time series. This study used harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data to identify crop intensity. The sixth polynomial function was used to fit the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) curves. Then, 15-day NDVI and EVI time series were then generated from the fitted curves and used to generate the extent of croplands. Lastly, the first derivative of the fitted VI curves were used to calculate the VI peaks; spurious peaks were removed using artificially defined thresholds and crop intensity was generated by counting the number of remaining VI peaks. The proposed methods were tested in four study regions, with results showing that 15-day time series generated from the fitted curves could accurately identify cropland extent. Overall accuracy of cropland identification was higher than 95%. In addition, both the harmonized NDVI and EVI time series identified crop intensity accurately as the overall accuracies, producer's accuracies and user's accuracies of non-cropland, single crop cycle and double crop cycle were higher than 85%. NDVI outperformed EVI as identifying double crop cycle fields more accurately.

TI  - Dance/Movement Therapy in Cross-Cultural Practice: Fostering Assertiveness with Torture Survivors
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DANCE THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - A U.S. dance/movement therapist's report on case histories of three adult African survivors of human rights abuse, this narrative addresses approaches taken to foster assertiveness following exposure to torture and trafficking. The author points to dilemmas experienced in working cross-culturally, including the risk of therapist ethnocentricity in promoting values of independence and self-sufficiency that may be culturally inappropriate for survivors from traditional cultures of the global South. Sue's framework for considering worldview by examining the effects of differences between therapist and client in terms of "locus of control" and "locus of responsibility" is highlighted for its usefulness to mental health providers who aim to avoid imposing individualist assumptions on persons from collectivist environments.

TI  - Cloud Deep Networks for Hyperspectral Image Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing hardware have led to a significantly increased capability for high-quality data acquisition, which allows the collection of remotely sensed images with very high spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolution. This trend calls for the development of new techniques to enhance the way that such unprecedented volumes of data are stored, processed, and analyzed. An important approach to deal with massive volumes of information is data compression, related to how data are compressed before their storage or transmission. For instance, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are characterized by hundreds of spectral bands. In this sense, high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing (HTC) offer interesting alternatives. Particularly, distributed solutions based on cloud computing can manage and store huge amounts of data in fault-tolerant environments, by interconnecting distributed computing nodes so that no specialized hardware is needed. This strategy greatly reduces the processing costs, making the processing of high volumes of remotely sensed data a natural and even cheap solution. In this paper, we present a new cloud-based technique for spectral analysis and compression of HSIs. Specifically, we develop a cloud implementation of a popular deep neural network for non-linear data compression, known as autoencoder (AE). Apache Spark serves as the backbone of our cloud computing environment by connecting the available processing nodes using a masterslave architecture. Our newly developed approach has been tested using two widely available HSI data sets. Experimental results indicate that cloud computing architectures offer an adequate solution for managing big remotely sensed data sets.

TI  - Weather conditions and warm air masses during active fire-periods in boreal forests
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather conditions for concurrent widespread fires in boreal forests were examined by various weather maps and temperature charts. The four study regions in boreal forests are three in East Siberia and one in Alaska. We applied preliminary analysis method for Sakha proposed by the authors to show the effectiveness of our approach. More than 12 very active fire-periods were identified from satellite hotspot data. Analysis results clearly showed fires during all active fire-periods became very active as warm air masses from south approached four study regions. These movements of warm air masses were mainly related to the meandering of large westerlies. To explain the large increase of daily hotspots (fires) during active fire-periods, a preliminary wind analysis was carried out. Strong wind conditions occurred when warm and dry air masses were approaching, stagnating, and passing over Southern Sakha under various weather conditions at lower air. During the top fire-period in Southern Sakha, wind velocity at lower air (925 hPa) changed from about 1 to 8 m/s while number of hotspot increased from around 1000 to 9000.

TI  - Aboveground Biomass Mapping Using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Time-Series Images for Borneo's Forest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global carbon cycle research and climate change mitigation measures require a means for large-scale monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB). L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of promising means, although its signal is saturated at 75-150 Mg ha(-1) of AGB, making it difficult to monitor high biomass forest. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) conducts ScanSAR mode observations that cover the whole tropical region about nine times a year. We investigated whether such time-series data is effective in overcoming the signal saturation issue. In Borneo, we adopted a spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-derived AGB data for training and validation data, then developed an AGB estimation model using the Random Forest algorithm. As a result, we improved the saturation issue, and estimated the AGB up to 280 Mg ha(-1) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 62.8 Mg ha(-1). Such an AGB range covers 83% of Borneo's forests. The developed model was applied to create an AGB map of Borneo with a 250-m resolution as of 2016. Total AGB of Borneo was calculated at 12.8 Gt with an average of 173.3 Mg ha(-1). This article showed the PALSAR-2 time-series data to be highly useful in the AGB mapping of high carbon stock forests. However, we needed to correct the difference in observation years between GLAS and PALSAR-2 using a simple biomass growth model, but the accuracy will be improved by using future LiDAR and SAR sensors.

TI  - Coal mine area monitoring method by machine learning and multispectral remote sensing images
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is currently the main energy in the world. A large amount of gangue is produced during the coal mining process, and the gangue contains a large amount of metal and sulfide, which is one of the environmental pollution sources. Therefore, how to monitor changes in coal mines in real time is an important task. With regard to this problem, we propose a new method of monitoring coal mining area. First, we collect samples of coal, gangue, and other objects from the Shenhua Baori Xile coal mine, and then measure the ground measured spectral reflectance data of these samples. For satellite data, we remove the interference information of the reflectance spectra from these images and established a relationship with the ground measured data. We propose a tree root algorithm and then combine extreme learning machine to build a classification model. Finally, the model is applied to remote sensing images, and a good extraction effect is obtained. Compared with typical monitoring methods, our method has the superiorities of high precision, low-priced, and fast speed, and it can monitor the changes in the coal mine area in real time. This is the basis for improving the environmental pollution around the coal mining area.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite-Derived Precipitable Water Vapor Through Near-Infrared Remote Sensing Channels
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval accuracies of three typical near-infrared (NIR) precipitable water vapor (PWV) products are thoroughly discussed in this article. The NIR PWV data are obtained from three satellite sensors: the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra, the medium-resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS)/Envisat, and the medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI)/FY-3A. Collocated Global Positioning System (GPS) PWV data from GPS network are employed as the reference data set because of its high precision in water vapor measurement. Relative difference and root-mean-square (rms) difference are computed for "Clear," "Cloudy," and "All Weather" categories for each NIR water vapor product. The results reveal that PWV derived from NIR sensors tend to underestimate the water vapor values with the existence of cloud, as NIR signals cannot penetrate the cloud. Under "Clear" condition, the overall rms for remote sensors are close to the expected goal accuracies, namely, with root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 5.480 mm for MODIS/Terra, 3.708 mm for MERIS/Envisat, 8.644 mm for MERSI/FY-3A. MERIS/Envisat has the highest PWV retrieval accuracy, while the MODIS/Terra PWV product has the best correlation with GPS PWV (R-2 is 0.951). The MODIS/Terra tends to overestimate PWV value, while MERSI/FY-3A tends to underestimate the PWV value. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison of seasonal variation and wet/dry variation for each NIR PWV product is also performed in this study. The results indicate that the RMSE increases significantly under wet conditions (PWV larger than 20 mm) than under dry conditions (PWV smaller than 20 mm) for all remote sensing PWV products.

TI  - An Analysis Applying InSAR of Subsidence Caused by Nearby Mining-Induced Earthquakes
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake occurrence is usually unpredictable apart from sites in the vicinity of volcanoes. It is not easy to measure displacements caused by seismic phenomena using classical geodetic methods, which are based on point survey. Therefore, the surveying of ground movements caused by seismic events should be carried out continuously. Nowadays, remote sensing data and InSAR are often applied to monitor ground displacements in areas affected by seismicity. The effects of severe nearby mining-induced earthquakes have been discussed in the paper. The earthquakes occurred in 2017 and had a magnitude of 4.7 and 4.8. The distance between the epicenters of the mining-induced earthquakes was around 1.6 km. The aim of the investigation has been to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of ground movements caused by the two tremors using the InSAR technique. Superposition of surface displacement has been studied in time and space. The main scientific aim has been to prove that in the areas where high-energy tremors occur, ground movements overlap. Due to proximity between the epicenters, the mining-induced earthquakes caused the formation of a large subsidence trough with the dimension of approximately 1.2 km x 4.2 km and total subsidence of ca. 116 mm. Two-time phases of subsidence were determined with temporal overlapping. The subsidence analysis has enhanced the cognition of the impact of mining-induced seismicity on the kinematics of surface changes. Moreover, the present work supports the thesis that InSAR is a valuable and adequately accurate technique to monitor ground displacements caused by mining induced earthquakes.

TI  - Comparison of guidelines for the management of patients with high-risk and advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) can be a challenge as evidence from high quality clinical trials is rare. Guideline developers are challenged to provide practical and useful guidance for clinicians even in the absence of good evidence. In order to compare treatment recommendations for high-risk and advanced cSCC among national and international guidelines and to extract the most precise guidance provided, a systematic search was carried out in guideline databases Medline and Embase with a cutoff of 4 March 2019. Treatment recommendations for predefined clinical scenarios were extracted from selected guidelines and compared qualitatively. Five guidelines published from 2015 to 2018 were included. Excision of high-risk tumours with margin assessment was recommended in all guidelines. A safety margin of at least 6 mm was suggested in four guidelines. There was no clear recommendation to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy in any guideline. Lymph node dissection was uniformly recommended in the presence of nodal disease. Treatment for metastatic cSCC was poorly characterized and restricted to the use of chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Recommendations for the management of high-risk and advanced cSCC were limited. We propose that guidelines should be updated to reflect recent advances in checkpoint blockade for metastatic cSCC.

TI  - Characterisation of Sand Accumulations in Wadi Fatmah and Wadi Ash Shumaysi, KSA, Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area has three sand accumulations: Two in Wadi Fatmah and one in Wadi Ash Shumaysi, midwest of Saudi Arabia. The spatial extents of these sand accumulations have significantly increased over the last few decades. Multi-source satellite imagery, such as CORONA (1967, 1972), SPOT 5 (2013), LandSat (TM) (1986), and LandSat 8 OLI (2013), enabled monitoring and analysis of the interplay between the changes in the anthropogenic activities and spatial expansion of the areas of sand accumulation. The main driving force of the spatial expansion could be strongly linked to extensive changes in the anthropogenic regimes in the middle zone of Wadi Fatmah and its surrounding landforms and mountain masses. In this context, the once dominant agricultural lands of the middle zone of Wadi Fatmah have been transformed into abandoned agricultural areas. Extensive off-road driving has resulted in soil degradation. Excavation and mining activities for urban spatial expansion are widespread over the valley floor, the adjacent bajada, and the mountain blocks. These anthropogenic activities have remarkably induced strong wind erosion of the soil in severe arid conditions in the middle zone of Wadi Fatmah and Wadi Ash Shumaysi. Wind erosion has eventually produced a sufficient sand budget to be transported into the areas of sand accumulation. The primary consequence of the excess sand budget has been an increase in the spatial extents and dune migration rates of sand accumulations in the study area. However, this increase varies from one sand accumulation to another. In this study, we used multi-source remote sensing imagery and the state-of-the-art COSI-Corr technology to characterize sand accumulations in the study area and to determine the spatio-temporal changes in both the spatial extents and the dune migration rates. The mean annual migration rates of sand dunes in the three sand accumulations ranged from 5.5 and 7.2 to 8.6 m/yr. Analysis of the spatial extent and migration rates of sand accumulations indicates that the study area may have experienced desertification in response to changes in the anthropogenic regimes through the last few decades.

TI  - Between Church and State: a Christian Brotherhood's Faithful Claims to Secularity in Mexico City
T2  - QUALITATIVE SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Good News Businessmen's Brotherhood (GNBB) is a Christian organization with evangelical commitments, charismatic practices, and whose members insist that their organization is secular. How are we to understand such a Christian claim to secularity? Members of GNBB draw on the multiple overlapping meanings of the secular in order to reach otherwise inaccessible places and audiences, but they also do so in an attempt to disavow conventional religious-secular distinctions. The GNBB claim to secularity is, therefore, an everyday life instantiation of two kinds of recent scholarly criticism: the secular injunction to separate religion from politics is a practical impossibility; and the apparent neutrality of secularism's public/private and church/world distinctions masks an underlying affinity with a Protestant Christian worldview. Good News brothers' everyday intertwining of faith and politics mirrors these scholarly critiques, with the exception that, where the latter finds grounds for criticism, the former find practical possibilities for building a project.

TI  - High fire disturbance in forests leads to longer recovery, but varies by forest type
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the world, millions of hectares of forest are burned by wildfires each year. Satellite remote sensing, particularly when used in time series, can describe complex disturbance-recovery processes, but is underutilized by ecologists. This study examines whether a greater disturbance magnitude equates to a longer recovery length, in the fire-adapted forests of south-east Australia. Using Landsat time series, spectral disturbance and recovery maps were first created, for 2.3 million hectares of forest, burned between 2002 and 2009. To construct these maps, a piecewise linear model was fitted to each pixel's Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) temporal trajectory, and used to extract the disturbance magnitude (change in NBR) and the spectral recovery length (number of years for the NBR trajectory to return to its pre-fire state). Pearson's correlations between disturbance magnitude and spectral recovery length were then calculated at a state level, bioregion level and patch level (600 m x 600 m, or 36 hectares). Our results showed overall correlation at the state level to be inconclusive, due to confounding factors. At the bioregion level, correlations were predominantly positive (i.e. a greater disturbance equals a longer recovery). At the patch level, both positive and negative correlations occurred, with clear evidence of spatial patterns. This suggests that the relationship between disturbance magnitude and recovery length is dependent on forest type. This was further explored by investigating the major vegetation divisions within one bioregion, which provided further evidence that relationships varied by vegetation type. In Heathy Dry Forests, for example, a greater disturbance magnitude usually led to a longer recovery length, while in Tall Mist Forests, the opposite behaviour was evident. Results of the patch-level analysis were particularly promising, demonstrating the utility of satellite remote sensing in producing landscape scale information to inform policy and management.

TI  - Mapping Precise Two-dimensional Surface Deformation on Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii using ALOS2 PALSAR2 Spotlight SAR Interferometry
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Kilauea Volcano is one of the most active volcano in the world. In this study, we used the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 satellite imagery to measure the surface deformation occurring near the summit of the Kilauea volcano from 2015 to 2017. In order to measure two-dimensional surface deformation, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and multiple aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) methods were performed using two interferometric pairs. To improve the precision of 2D measurement, we compared root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the difference of measurement value as we change the effective antenna length and normalized squint value, which are factors that can affect the measurement performance of the MAI method. Through the compare, the values of the factors, which can measure deformation most precisely, were selected. After select optimal values of the factors, the RMSD values of the difference of the MAI measurement were decreased from 4.07 cm to 2.05 cm. In each interferograms, the maximum deformation in line-of-sight direction is -28.6 cm and -27.3 cm, respectively, and the maximum deformation in the along-track direction is 20.2 cm and 20.8 cm, in the opposite direction is -24.9 cm and -24.3 cm, respectively. After stacking the two interferograms, two-dimensional surface deformation mapping was performed, and a maximum surface deformation of approximately 30.4 cm was measured in the northwest direction. In addition, large deformation of more than 20 cm were measured in all directions. The measurement results show that the risk of eruption activity is increasing in Kilauea Volcano. The measurements of the surface deformation of Kilauea volcano from 2015 to 2017 are expected to be helpful for the study of the eruption activity of Kilauea volcano in the future.

TI  - Improved supervised classification of bedrock in areas of transported overburden: Applying domain expertise at Kerkasha, Eritrea
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A regional bedrock map provides a foundation from which to build geological interpretations. However, rapid and accurate bedrock mapping in an area that lacks outcrop is a common problem, especially in regions with sparse data. A historic bedrock map from an Au and base metal project in the Kerkasha district, Eritrea, is significantly improved by predicting bedrock distribution in areas previously mapped as transported overburden. Publicly-available remote sensing data (DTM and ASTER) were combined with airborne geophysical data (magnetics and radiometrics) to provide features for bedrock prediction. Remote sensing data were pre-processed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to yield an equal number of principal components (PC) as input features. Four iterations were trialled, using different combinations of remote sensing PC features. The two initial trials used all available remote sensing data but compared results when feature ranking and selection is applied to reduce the number of PCs used for training and classification. The subsequent two trials used subsets of available remote-sensing data, selected based on domain expertise (i.e., the domain-specific knowledge of a geologist), with all respective PCs were retained. Five-fold cross-validation scores were highest when a DTM, magnetics, and radiometrics data were included as input features. However, qualitative visual appraisal of predicted results across trials, complemented by maps of class membership uncertainty (using a measure of entropy), indicate that geologically-meaningful results are also produced when radiometrics are omitted and only the DTM and magnetics are used. The study concludes with a generalised workflow to assist geologists who are seeking to improve the bedrock interpretation of areas under cover in a single area of interest. Domain expertise is shown to be critical for the selection of appropriate input features and validation of results during predictive lithologic mapping.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring of Posttensioned Bridges Using High-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the results of spaceborne monitoring of two posttensioned bridges in Virginia. Routine safety inspections revealed extensive cracking in the concrete girders. Problems were traced to the inadequate quality of tendon grouting, resulting in the partially bonded condition. The TerraSAR-X radar satellite, operated by the German Aerospace Center, was used to acquire radar imagery in the Staring SpotLight mode from the ascending and descending orbits at 11-day intervals. The data were processed with the SqueeSAR algorithm, resulting in millimeter-range precision of the time-displacement series. No permanent deformations were detected at the posttensioned segments during the monitoring period of 1.3 years. The high density of the measurement points allowed adequate characterization of bridge displacements. The results of the interferometric analysis attest to the feasibility of implementing satellite-based performance monitoring of bridges, offering an innovative asset management tool that can complement and augment current inspection methods.

TI  - Stochastic programming solution for placement of satellite ground stations
T2  - ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster recovery efforts are enhanced through the collection and dissemination of satellite data, which is downloaded from satellites to ground stations. The optimal ground station locations vary depending on the location of the disaster, but ground station construction occurs before the realization of a disaster. Thus, a stochastic optimization problem arises: decide the location of ground stations before disasters with uncertain locations. We use a stochastic programming approach to select the location of ground stations given a set of potential disaster scenarios. The objective is to maximize the expected amount of data downloaded. The problem formulation consists of a two-stage stochastic program where the first-stage determines the locations of the ground stations and the second-stage schedules the uploading and downloading of data. We solve the problem using the L-shaped method; we find that it significantly outperforms solving the deterministic equivalent problem directly. We also find that an alternate second-stage formulation significantly improves solution time. The optimized set of ground stations found by our algorithm is compared to the set of ground stations operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's; results confirm that the current placement is effective and demonstrate the benefit in adding additional ground stations.

TI  - Estimating biomass and carbon sequestration of plantations around industrial areas using very high resolution stereo satellite imagery
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations established in highly-pollutant industrial areas have a crucial role to absorb greenhouse gases, particularly CO2. A thorough monitoring of their aboveground biomass and carbon balance is essential to ensure their beneficial effects. This can be operationally supported by using a combination of field and multispectral stereo remote sensing data to provide surface height information with high resolution and wide coverage. We estimated the fresh and dry aboveground biomass and the carbon sequestration from pairs of Pleiades satellite imagery of 25-year-old monoculture plantations of Pinus eldarica Medw., Cupressus arizonica Greene, Morus alba L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L., around the Mobarakeh Steel Complex near the megacity Isfahan. This complex is the largest-scale of its kind in semi-arid Iran. Tree heights were derived from a Canopy height model (CHM) at plantation management unit level. Parsimonious regression models were developed, and the accuracy was assessed by the coefficient of determination, bias and root mean square errors (RMSEs) at plot level. This resulted in R-2 of total biomass, dry biomass, carbon sequestration, tree height and tree count of 0.90, 0.90, 0.91, 0.89, and 0.88, respectively. Moreover, mixed bias (with lowest value of -0.12 m for tree height) and NRMSE% (with lowest value of 5.93 % for tree carbon sequestration) values were obtained. The results demonstrated that pairs of stereo imageries can be effectively used for predicting forest biomass and carbon sequestration across semi-arid plantations, hence enabling a continuous monitoring of vegetation established around pollutant industrial areas.

TI  - Data Fusion and Accuracy Analysis of Multi-Source Land Use/Land Cover Datasets along Coastal Areas of the Maritime Silk Road
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision land use/land cover classification mapping derived from remote sensing supplies essential datasets for scientific research on environmental assessment, climate change simulation, geographic condition monitoring, and environmental management at global and regional scales. It is an important issue in the study of earth system science, and the coastal area is a hot spot region in this field. In this paper, the coastal areas of the Maritime Silk Road were used as the research object and a fusion method based on agreement analysis and fuzzy-set theory was adopted to achieve the fusion of three land use/land cover datasets: MCD12Q1-2010, CCI-LC2010, and GlobeLand30-2010. The accuracy of the fusion results was analyzed using an error matrix, spatial confusion, average overall consistency, and average type-specific consistency. The main findings were as follows. (1) After the establishment of reference data based on Google Earth, both the producer accuracy and user accuracy of the fusion data were improved when compared with those of the three input data sources, and the fusion data had the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, with values of 90.37% and 0.8617, respectively. (2) Various input data sources differed in terms of the correctly classified contributions and misclassified influences of different land use/land cover types in the fusion data; furthermore, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient between the fusion data and any one of the input data sources were far higher than those between any two of the input data sources. (3) The average overall consistency of the fusion data was the highest at 89.29%, which was approximately 5% higher than that of the input data sources. (4) The average type-specific consistencies of cropland, forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, artificial surfaces, bare land, and permanent snow and ice in the fusion data were the highest, with values of 69.95%, 74.41%, 21.24%, 34.22%, 97.62%, 51.83%, 84.39%, and 2.46%, respectively; compared with the input data sources, the average type-specific consistencies of the fusion data were 0.61-20.32% higher. This paper provides information and suggestions for the development and accuracy evaluation of future land use/land cover data in global and regional coastal areas.

TI  - Remote sensing-assisted data assimilation and simultaneous inference for forest inventory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation (DA) has a broad category of mathematical procedures for updating and calibrating existing predictions or parameter estimates using new observations. Typical DA procedures such as the Kalman filter require that the observations of a variable of interest used in a forecast of this variable to be collected just prior to the updating procedure and that they continue to be collected over time, a requirement that is not always practical for forest inventory problems. Distinct from the Kalman filter, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) circumvents this time constraint, because it can calibrate the predicted values of a variable of interest using observations from other variables correlated with this variable of interest. Remote sensing played a major role in this study by providing the latter observations. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to propose and illustrate a DA calibration procedure that incorporates simultaneous predictions and BLUP to improve prediction accuracy; (2) to expand this procedure in the framework of model-based inference; and (3) to compare the inferential properties before and after DA calibration for multiple scenarios. Four major conclusions are relevant. First, the prediction accuracies for all variables of interest were consistently increased by 10%-74% after implementing the DA procedure. Second, the DA procedure supported simultaneous inference, and the precision of the simultaneously estimated population means for the variables of interest were increased by 55%-76% after implementing this procedure. Third, the parametric bootstrap procedures used to estimate the inferential precisions for this complex estimation problem were effective and converged rapidly. In addition, this DA calibration procedure is universally applicable for DA calibrations using other data sources such as airborne or terrestrial laser scanning and spectral data, given that cross-model correlations exist. Overall, the proposed procedure demonstrated considerable potential for better serving forest inventory with respect to both simultaneous inference and inferential precision.

T2  - American journal of psychoanalysis
M3  - Historical Article
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Ferenczi's deviations from Freudian thinking have caused enormous controversy. This paper re-examines Ferenczi's theoretical and technical innovations through the lens of Orpha-one of his most characteristic and valuable contributions, the culmination point of his thought, and the leitmotif of his work. So far research on Ferenczi's Orpha concept has been relatively sparse and there is still much obscurity about this term that he adopted from or co-created with his "evil genius" Elizabeth Severn. The following paper will attempt to shed more light on the origin, evolution, functions, and the philosophical foundations of the Orpha concept. Along with the theoretical, therapeutic and philosophical aspects, this point of view will enable a better understanding of the poetic value and the lyricism of Ferenczi's work. Orphic harmony-the fusion of Dionysian ecstasy and Apollonian clarity into the "principal instinct of tranquility" proclaimed by Ferenczi in 1930 and into the "primordial chant of cosmic unity" (Herder), emerges as the essence of the Ferenczian work and worldview.

TI  - Retrieval of Horizontal Visibility Using MODIS Data: A Deep Learning Approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal visibility (HVIS) is a primary index used for assessing air quality. Although satellite images provide information regarding atmospheric aerosols, atmospheric visibility is not directly measured. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to retrieve HVIS using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis dataset, and ground-based visibility observations. The deep neural network model comprises a multi-layer unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a layer for supervised learning. The dropout mechanism was used in the training process to overcome the errors caused by over-fitting. The results demonstrate that the correlation coefficient values between HVIS observations and retrievals during training, pre-validating, and evaluation were 0.74, 0.723, and 0.697, respectively. The retrieved HVIS in Eastern China exhibited a north-to-south increasing trend, increasing and decreasing in summer and winter, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed model presents an effective and more reliable method for HVIS retrieval. However, the small samples, low AOD, low albedo, high total column water, high longitude, and the low vertical wind component at 10 m likely cause HVIS bias.

TI  - A High-Temperature Risk Assessment Model for Maize Based on MODIS LST
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, high-temperature risk assessments of crops at the regional scale are usually conducted by comparing the observed air temperature at ground stations or via the remote sensing inversion of canopy temperature (such as MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) land surface temperature (LST)) with the threshold temperature of the crop. Since this threshold is based on the absolute temperature value, it is difficult to account for changes in environmental conditions and crop canopy information between different regions and different years in the evaluation model. In this study, MODIS LST products were used to establish an evaluation model (spatiotemporal deviation mean (STDM)) and a classification method to determine maize-growing areas at risk of high temperatures at the regional scale. The study area was the Huang-Huai-Hai River plain of China where maize is grown and high temperatures occur frequently. The spatiotemporal distribution of the high-temperature risk of summer maize was determined in the study area from 2003 to 2018. The results demonstrate the applicability of the model at the regional scale. The distribution of high-temperature risk in the Huang-Huai-Hai region was consistent with the actual temperature measurements. The temperatures in the northwestern, southwestern, and southern parts were relatively high and the area was classified as a stable zone. Shijiazhuang, Jiaozuo, Weinan, Xi'an, and Xianyang city were located in a zone of increasing high temperatures. The regions with a stable high-temperature risk were Xiangfan, Yuncheng, and Luoyang city. Areas of decreasing high temperatures were Handan, Xingtai, Bozhou, Fuyang, Nanyang, Linfen, and Pingdingshan city. Areas that need to focus on preventing high-temperature risks include Luoyang, Yuncheng, Xianyang, Weinan, and Xi'an city. This study provides a new method for the detailed evaluation of regional high-temperature risk and data support.

TI  - Combining Landsat images with historic records to estimate the live coral cover of Luhuitou fringing reef in Northern South China Sea
T2  - IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an efficient indicator of coral reef health, live coral cover (LCC) is regularly surveyed and recorded by many coral reef documents. However, there usually exist some blanks for the historic records, while current in-field surveys are impossible to fill the blanks. To overcome such difficulties, we focus on exploiting the potential of optical satellite images. The purpose is to fill the blanks of the records over the past and further estimate the LCC in future. As historic records were usually lack of accurate geographical locations to match to the satellite images, a spectral index was defined based on the mean of the subsurface remote sensing reflectance. The index was then used to link the LCC with the satellite images by a cubic polynomial function. Thereafter, the LCC and the coefficients of the polynomial function were finally estimated by simultaneously combining the mean subsurface remote sensing reflectance, the historic LCC records, and the constraints among LCC in adjacent years. Experiments on a series of Landsat images of Luhuitou fringing reef (1973 to 2018) demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and feasible, where the introduction of the satellite images can greatly improve the accuracy. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Relative Errors (MRE) of the LCC were able to reach 5.4%, 4.0%, and 15.9% respectively. This is regarded as the first test on LCC estimation by combining such a long-term LCC records with a series of satellite images. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - TEMPORAL-SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND KEY INFLUENCING FACTORS OF PM<sub>2.5</sub> CONCENTRATIONS IN CHINA BASED ON STIRPAT MODEL AND KUZNETS CURVE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - China's tremendous economic developments are achieved at the expense of environmental deterioration. In recent years, PM2.5 pollution has become increasingly serious in China, attracting widespread attention from the citizens and the government. This study aims to investigate the temporal-spatial characteristics of PM2.5 in China in 1998-2012, fully considering the potential influencing factors of PM2.5. The satellite remote sensing data compensate for the deficiency of surface monitoring data in China, such as minimising bias from data contamination, broad coverage and representing long-term temporal-spatial resolution data. A largely expanded list of potential impacting factors is selected based on environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory and Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) framework. Moran's I tests are used to examine the spatial correlation of PM2.5, and the pooled regression, spatial lag and time-fixed effects spatial lag models are used and compared to explore the influencing factors of PM2.5. The thresholded first-order inverse distance spatial weight matrix can measure the spatial spillover effect of PM2.5 more accurately by fully considering the effect of distance on spatial influence level. Several important findings are derived. Firstly, China's PM2.5 shows a distinct positive spatial correlation. The local Moran's I test shows that the significant high-high PM2.5 agglomeration regions include Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and central China, connecting the two economic urban agglomerations. Secondly, the regression results of the time-fixed effects spatial lag model indicate that that PM2.5 of a given region increases by 0.362% if the PM2.5 of its ambient region increases by 1%. Thirdly, factors from all perspectives of STIRPAT model are very effective in explaining PM2.5. Fourthly, no inverted "U" shape EKC is found between the overall economic development level and the PM2.5 concentration in China in 1998-2012.

TI  - Evaluating <i>Himawari-8</i> Cloud Products Using Shipborne and <i>CALIPSO</i> Observations: Cloud-Top Height and Cloud-Top Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-top height (CTH) and cloud-top temperature (CTT) retrieved from the Himawari-8 observations are evaluated using the active shipborne radar-lidar observations derived from the 31-day Clouds, Aerosols, Precipitation Radiation and Atmospheric Composition over the Southern Ocean (CAPRICORN) experiment in 2016 and 1-yr observations from the spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) cloud product over a large sector of the Southern Ocean. The results show that the Himawari-8 CTH (CTT) retrievals agree reasonably well with both the shipborne estimates, with a correlation coefficient of 0.837 (0.820), a mean bias error of 0.226 km (-2.526 degrees C), and an RMSE of 1.684 km (10.069 degrees C). In the comparison with CALIOP, the corresponding quantities are found to be 0.786 (0.480), -0.570 km (1.343 degrees C), and 2.297 km (25.176 degrees C). The Himawari-8 CTH (CTT) generally falls between the physical CTHs observed by CALIOP and the shipborne radar-lidar estimates. However, major systematic biases are also identified. These errors include (i) a low (warm) bias in CTH (CTT) for warm liquid cloud type, (ii) a cold bias in CTT for supercooled liquid water cloud type, (iii) a lack of CTH at 3 km that does not have a corresponding gap in CTT, (iv) a tendency of misclassifying some low-/mid-top clouds as cirrus and overlap cloud types, and (v) a saturation of CTH (CTT) around 10 km (-40 degrees C), particularly for cirrus and overlap cloud types. Various challenges that underpin these biases are also explored, including the potential of parallax bias, low-level inversion, and cloud heterogeneity.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Decadal time-series derived from satellite observations are useful for discriminating crops and identifying crop succession at national and regional scales. However, use of these data for crop modeling is challenged by the presence of mixed pixels due to the coarse spatial resolution of these data, which influences model accuracy, and the scarcity of field data over the decadal period necessary to calibrate and validate the model. For this data article, cloud-free satellite "Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 250 m" Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) vector field data, were collected throughout France for the 12-year period from 2006 to the end of 2017. A GIS workflow was developed using R software to combine the MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products, and then to select "pure" MODIS pixels located within single-crop parcels over the entire period. As a result, a dataset for 21,129 reference plots (corresponding to "pure" pixels) was generated that contained a spectral time-series (red band, near-infrared band, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and the associated annual crop type with an 8-day time step over the period. This dataset can be used to develop new classification methods based on time-series analysis using deep learning, and to monitor and predict crop succession. (c) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Botanical gardens provide valuable baseline <i>Phytophthora</i> diversity data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytophthora species are important plant pathogens especially due to their ability to invade and change ecosystems. However, information regarding their diversity and distribution is not available in many parts of the world. In these areas, surveys of botanical gardens can provide opportunities to detect novel plant-microbe interactions on both indigenous and exotic plants. Three botanical gardens and one historical urban garden in the Western Cape Province of South Africa were surveyed to establish baseline information of Phytophthora species diversity in the Cape Floristic Region. Eight described species (P. amnicola, P. asparagi, P. capensis, P. cinnamomi, P. chlamydospora, P. lacustris, P. multivora and P. tropicalis), the known but as yet unnamed P. sp. emzansi and 3 putative hybrids were recovered. Forty eight of 103 samples collected were positive for Phytophthora species and P multivora was the most frequently isolated species. Three species (P. amnicola, P. asparagi and P. tropicalis) had not previously been reported in South Africa, although hybrid progeny of P. amincola had been found in two previous studies. These results highlight the value of botanical gardens as areas for baseline data collection and early warning systems.

TI  - Long-Term Outcomes of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is controversial. Using population-cohort data, we examined whether SLNB improves long-term outcomes among patients with DCIS who underwent breast-conserving surgery. We identified 12776 women aged 67-94 years diagnosed during 2001-2013 with DCIS who underwent breast-conserving surgery from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare dataset, 1992 (15.6%) of whom underwent SLNB (median follow-up: 69 months). Tests of statistical significance are two-sided. Patients with and without SLNB did not differ statistically significantly regarding treated recurrence (3.9% vs 3.7%; P = .62), ipsilateral invasive occurrence (1.4% vs 1.7%, P = .33), or breast cancer mortality (1.0% vs 0.9%, P = .86). With Mahalanobis-matching and competing-risks survival analyses, SLNB was not statistically significantly associated with treated recurrence, ipsilateral invasive occurrence, or breast cancer mortality (P >= .27). Our findings do not support the routine performance of SLNB for older patients with DCIS amenable to breast conservation.

TI  - Identification of disturbances in the Colombian tropical rainforest from Landsat satellite image time series using the Landtrendr algorithm
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis of satellite images for detection of deforestation and forest disturbances at specific dates has been a subject of research over the last few years. There are many limitations to identify the exact date of deforestation due mainly to the large volume of data and the criteria required for its correct characterization. A further limitation in the analysis of multispectral time series is the identification of true deforestation considering that forest vegetation may undergo different changes over time. This study analyzes deforestation in a zone within the Colombian Amazon using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on semestral median mosaics generated from Landsat images collected from 2000 to 2017. Several samples representing trends of change over the time series were extracted and classified according to their degree of change and persistence in the series, using four categories: (i) deforestation, (ii) degradation, (iii) forest plantation, and (iv) regeneration. Specific deforestation samples were analyzed in the same way using the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to reduce the effect of spectral response variations due to soil reflectance changes. It is concluded that the two indices used, together with the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR 1) spectral bands, allow to extract values and intervals where the change produced by deforestation on forest vegetation is identified with acceptable accuracy. The analysis of time series using the Landtrendr algorithm confirmed a reliable change detection in each of the forest disturbance categories.

TI  - STATISTICAL STUDY OF MODIS ALGORITHMS IN ESTIMATING AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH OVER THE CZECH REPUBLIC
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-STAVEBNI OBZOR
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of the rapid development of remote sensing techniques and accurate satellite observations, it has become customary to use these technologies in ecological and aerosols studies on a regional and global level. In this paper, we analyse the performance of three Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithms in estimating Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the Czech Republic to gain knowledge about their accuracy and uncertainty. The Dark Target (DT), the Deep Blue (DB), and the merged algorithm (DTB) of the MODIS latest collection 6.1 Level 2 aerosol products (MOD04_L2) were tested by comparing its results with the measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Level 3 Version 2.0 ground station at Brno airport. The DT algorithm is compatible the best with AERONET observations with a correlation coefficient (R = 0.823), retrievals falling within the EE envelope (EE% = 82.67%), root mean square error (RMSE = 0.059), and mean absolute error (MAE = 0.044). The DTB algorithm provided close results of the DT algorithm but with less accuracy, on the other hand the DB algorithm has the lowest accuracy between all, but this algorithm was able to provide a bigger sample size than the other two algorithms.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Image Time Series for land cover mapping via a multi-source deep learning architecture
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The huge amount of data currently produced by modern Earth Observation (EO) missions has allowed for the design of advanced machine learning techniques able to support complex Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping tasks. The Copernicus programme developed by the European Space Agency provides, with missions such as Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), radar and optical (multi-spectral) imagery, respectively, at 10 m spatial resolution with revisit time around 5 days. Such high temporal resolution allows to collect Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) that support a plethora of Earth surface monitoring tasks. How to effectively combine the complementary information provided by such sensors remains an open problem in the remote sensing field. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture to combine information coming from S1 and S2 time series, namely TWINNS (TWIn Neural Networks for Sentinel data), able to discover spatial and temporal dependencies in both types of SITS. The proposed architecture is devised to boost the land cover classification task by leveraging two levels of complementarity, i.e., the interplay between radar and optical SITS as well as the synergy between spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the Koumbia site in Burkina Faso and Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean), demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

TI  - Mapping flood vulnerability from socioeconomic classes and GI data: Linking socially resilient policies to geographically sustainable neighborhoods using PLS-SEM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulnerability studies often measure the risk that influences a system's ability to react during the occurrence of a hazardous event. Risk is generally associated with the physical, social, and economic aspects of the system. Climate-related hazards such as floods involve an additional spatial dimension, however. It is challenging combining social and geophysical vulnerabilities to model their interrelations to overall flood vulnerability. This study proposes the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) with several latent variables of geographical characteristics of houses and socioeconomic dimensions of households representing flood vulnerability. The former includes GIS/remote sensing data, while the latter comprises household surveys. The results indicate social indicators get contribution mainly from direct effects of spatial neighborhoods and socioeconomic conditions, and indirect effects of land tenure and demographics, with path coefficients equal to 0.47, 0.42, 0.83, and 0.61, respectively, all significant at the p < 0.0001 level. Overall, the goodness of fit equals 0.72 indicates good explanatory power of the model. We conclude that the PLS-SEM successfully incorporated the combined vulnerability from social and geographical factors. The SEM framework allows integrative assessing vulnerability variables from different disciplines, formats, and scales, and thus, offers an opportunity for creating more tailored policies to combat hazards.

TI  - Integrated Procedure for Monitoring and Assessment of Linear Infrastructures Safety (I-Pro MONALISA) Affected by Slope Instability
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of geological events such as landslides is one of the main causes of damage along linear infrastructures: Damage to transport infrastructures, as roads, bridges, and railways, can restrict their optimal functions and contribute to traffic accidents. The frequent and accurate monitoring of slope instability phenomena and of their interaction with existing man-made infrastructures plays a key role in risk prevention and mitigation activities. In this way, the use of high-resolution X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, characterized by short revisiting times, has demonstrated to be a powerful tool for a periodical noninvasive monitoring of ground motion and superstructure stability, aimed at improving the efficiency of inspection, repairing, and rehabilitation efforts. In the present work, we suggest a semiautomatic GIS approach, which, by using satellite radar interferometry data and results of geomorphological field survey integrated in a qualitative vulnerability matrix, allows to identify sections with different levels of damage susceptibility, where detailed conventional in situ measurements are required for further analysis. The procedure has been tested to investigate landslide-induced effects on a linear infrastructure in Campania Region (Italy), the Provincial Road "P.R. 264", which is affected, along its linear development, by several slope instabilities. COSMO-SkyMed interferometric products, as indicator of ground kinematics, and results of in situ damage survey, as indicator of consequences, have been merged in a qualitative 4 x 4 matrix, thus obtaining a vulnerability zoning map along a linear infrastructure in January 2015. Furthermore, an updating of landslide inventory map is provided: In addition to 24 official landslides pre-mapped in 2012, 30 new events have been identified, and corresponding intensity and state of activity has been detected.

TI  - Satellite Interferometry as a Tool for Early Warning and Aiding Decision Making in an Open-Pit Mine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope failures are life-threatening geohazards well-known in the mining industry, where a single accident can endanger workers and cause million dollars' -worth of activity downtime. Therefore, a detailed ground deformation map of an open-pit mine represents a vital planning tool and high-frequency monitoring is pivotal, since false or anticipated alarms may represent a higher impact than missed alarms. This article presents an application of interferometric satellite data from Sentinel-1. The scope of the study is showing the potential of the new generation of satellites for the detection of the boundary, typology, and kinematics of the on-going slope instabilities in open-pit mines. Most notably, this experience discloses how the short revisiting time (six days) permits the implementation of time of failure forecasting methods, which so far were a prerogative of ground-based monitoring systems. Only recently, a few experiences have shown the possibility of (a posteriori) predicting slope failures using displacement time series measured from satellite; the case study here described represents one of such first examples. Moreover, 11 other areas of instability have been detected and classified in terms of subsidence (sediment compaction) or slope failures, based on considerations concerning the acquisition geometry used to detect the movements. The movement vectors along the ascending and descending lines of sight have been combined to compute horizontal and vertical vectors, which have been employed to infer the geometry of the sliding surface of some selected slope instabilities. Despite the advancements of the technique, clear limitations still exist and are discussed in this article.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Investigations of Aerosol Optical Properties Over Bangladesh for the Period 2002-2016
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the aerosol optical properties over Bangladesh using Terra MODIS-based collection 06 (DT and DB) aerosol optical depth (AOD), ozone monitoring instrument (OMI)-based aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), emission database for global atmospheric research (EDGAR) measured black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), and modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications (MERRA) retrieved dust. In addition, ground-based aerosol robotic network (AERONET) retrieved optical properties such as aerosol volume size distribution, single scattering albedo (SSA), and asymmetry parameter (ASY) are studied in understanding the behavior of aerosol properties. Both the satellite-based MODIS DB and DT algorithms detect the high AOD (>0.5) all over Bangladesh except for a small portion in the eastern side. High AOD is also observed in all seasons except for SON. AOD significantly (at 95% level) increased over the period 2002-2016. The correlation coefficient between MODIS and AERONET AOD at Dhaka University site is 0.78 (0.76) for DT (DB). The Expected Error envelope is found 75.70% (54.38%) with small (large) RMSE for DT (DB) product. OMI-based AAOD indicates the presence of absorbing aerosols over the study area which is confirmed with AEROENT-based SSA and ASY. Three different types of absorbing aerosols such as BC, OC, and dust are identified from the EDGAR and MERRA data. In Bangladesh, the BC, OC, and dust are significantly (at 95% level) increasing. Further work is suggested to simulate and assess aerosols against the observations, which will help projecting aerosols in the future climate.

TI  - Inverse estimation of NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions over China and India 2005?2016: contrasting recent trends and future perspectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bottom-up emission inventories can provide valuable information for understanding emission status and are needed as input datasets to drive chemical transport models. However, this type of inventory has the disadvantage of taking several years to be compiled because it relies on a statistical dataset. Top-down approaches use satellite data as a constraint and overcome this disadvantage. We have developed an immediate inversion system to estimate anthropogenic NOx emissions with NO2 column density constrained by satellite observations. The proposed method allows quick emission updates and considers model and observation errors by applying linear unbiased optimum estimations. We used this inversion system to estimate the variation of anthropogenic NOx emissions from China and India from 2005 to 2016. On the one hand, NOx emissions from China increased, reaching a peak in 2011 with 29.5 Tg yr(?1), and subsequently decreased to 25.2 Tg yr(?1) in 2016. On the other hand, NOx emissions from India showed a continuous increase from 2005 to 2016, reaching 13.9 Tg yr(?1) in 2016. These opposing trends from 2011 to 2016 were ?0.83 and +0.76 Tg yr(?1) over China and India, respectively, and correspond to strictly regulated and unregulated future scenarios. Assuming these trends continue after 2016, we expect NOx emissions from China and India will be similar in 2023, with India becoming the world?s largest NOx emissions source in 2024.

TI  - Intra- and Inter-Tumor <i>BRAF</i> Heterogeneity in Acral Melanoma: An Immunohistochemical Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The current development of BRAF inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment of unresectable melanoma. As the potential heterogeneity of BRAF mutations in melanoma has been reported, accurate detection of BRAF mutations are important. However, the genetic heterogeneity of acral melanoma-a distinct type of melanoma with a unique genetic background-has not fully been investigated. We conducted a retrospective review of our acral melanoma patients. Of the 196 patients with acral melanoma, we retrieved 31 pairs of primary and matched metastatic melanomas. We immunostained the 31 pairs with VE1, a BRAF(V600E)-mutation-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunohistochemistry with VE1 showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting BRAF(V600E) mutations compared with the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. A total of nine primary (29.0%) and eight metastatic (25.8%) acral melanomas were positive for VE1. In three patients (9.7%), we observed a discordance of VE1 staining between the primary and metastatic lesions. Of note, VE1 immunohistochemical staining revealed a remarkable degree of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in acral melanoma. Our study reveals that VE1 immunostaining is a useful ancillary method for detecting BRAF(V600E) mutations in acral melanoma and allows for a clear visualization of intra- and inter-tumor BRAF heterogeneity.

TI  - PROBLEMS OF RUSSIAN NATIONALISM IN PAPERS AND SERMONS OF METROPOLITAN ANTHONY (KHRAPOVITSKY)
T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper for the first time takes a close look at the attitude of the prominent figure of the Russian Orthodox Church, well-known theologian, Metropolitan (formerly Bishop and Archbishop) Anthony (Khrapovitsky) to the ideology and practice of Russian nationalism in the early 20th century. Special attention is given to the orthodox and conservative criticism of "tribal", "pagan", "zoological" nationalism, Metropolitan's attitude to the "Russian question", anti-Semitism and cosmopolitism. Having accepted the classical Slavophilism as a flow of national thoughts compatible with church worldview, Metropolitan repudiated neoslavism and a western model of nationalism as an ideology opposed to the Orthodox teachings. Being anything but an opponent of Russian nationalism per se (more exactly, the need to strengthen the Russian national self-awareness and protection of Russian interests in the Russian Empire), Metropolitan Anthony, as an adherent of conservative political opinions, was ready to cooperate with Russian nationalists as well. However, he used to criticise them in his homiletics, trying to dissuade Russian nationalists from copying the ideology and practice of West European nationalism and reviling against such reckless phenomena as racism, radical anti-Semitism, xenophobia, secularism, and national egotism. Anthony (Khrapovitsky) made efforts to guide Russian nationalism to the church and patriotism to harness it to the betterment of the messianic idea - preservation and protection of Orthodox faith purity and the Orthodox nature of Russian statehood. The study is based on papers, speeches and sermons of Anthony (Khrapovitsky) published in pre-revolutionary church and secular periodicals. Some of these works have never been instrocuded to the academic discussion before.

AB  - An analysis of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image from the Radarsat-2 satellite acquired at the end of September 2013 has been carried out. A manifestation of the atmospheric front passing over the Northern Caspian Sea is found on the image. An analysis of SAR image using the data of the NOAA, Terra, and Aqua satellites; sub-satellite data; meteorological measurements; and reanalysis allows us to obtain not only qualitative but also quantitative information about the phenomenon displayed in the SAR data. The front had a characteristic set of radar signatures and was identified as a cold front; it had a narrow zone of frontal squalls and moved in the southeastern direction. Estimates of the front motion speed, wind speed in the regions before and after the front, and other characteristics have been obtained.

These structures control the gold mineralization position in the Toupugol-Khanmeishor ore district (Novogodnenskoe ore cluster, Polar Urals). This area has been compared with the Tur'insk-Auerbakh ore district (Auerbakh ore cluster, Northern Urals). Similar geological features, regularity in the structures, and the location of gold mineralization in the system of morphostructures have been revealed. The formation depth of the magmatic chambers has been determined for the Novogodnenskoe and Auerbakh paleovolcanic structures for the first time. These chambers are located at depths of similar to 4 and similar to 20 km, respectively, in the upper and middle parts of the earth's crust. The Novogodnenskoe structure is a monogenic structure. It was formed under the influence of one leading geological process. The Auerbakh structure is a larger and more complex structure; it is characterized by a long and multistage development. According to the paleovolcanic reconstruction results, the root (focal) part of the Auerbakh structure plunged from the southeast to the northwest during the evolution of the magmatic process. Gold mineralization within the studied areas of the Northern Urals is confined to the intersections of radial faults near the centers of large concentric morphostructures.

TI  - Vegetation, rainfall, and pulsing hydrology in the Pantanal, the world?s largest tropical wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services and play a central role in global carbon cycling. Changes in rainfall and the flood-pulse are likely to disrupt the processes that maintain these landscapes; further, landscape modification may dramatically alter wetlands and promote terrestrialization. The Pantanal, South America, is the world?s largest wetland due to flooding along the Upper Paraguay River. Predicting how water resources in the Pantanal may change is problematic due to a complex drainage network, resulting in the out-of-phase timing of rainfall and the flood pulse. We use remote sensing data of vegetation and climate to better understand the relationships among the rains, the flood pulse, and vegetation. Although rainfall is regionally synchronous, vegetation responses differ based on position relative to inundated areas. Away from rivers, vegetation greening occurs immediately following rainfall. Along channels, greening may lag rainfall by six months, responding closely to local flood stage. Interannual rainfall variability also impacts vegetation differently near flooded areas, with weaker, lagged responses to rainfall due to local water storage. This work suggests that the importance of flood pulse timing for vegetation productivity in inundated areas means that local conditions in wetlands may be the strongest controls on biogeochemical processes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is estimated using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radio-meter) Terra level 3 data with daily resolution i. e MOD08_D3 at 64 cGPS (continuous Global Positioning System) stations spatially spread over Indian subcontinent between geodetic latitude 5 degrees to 35 degrees N and geodetic longitude of 70 degrees to 96 degrees E. MODIS-PWV is compared with GPS-PWV estimated at these cGPS stations to check the validity of water vapor retrieved from MODIS data in Indian subcontinent. Correlation coefficient (R-2) between daily values of MODIS and GPS water vapor is above 0.9 with RMSE (root mean square error) of 2-5 mm for 22 cGPS in peninsular India, above 0.9 with RMSE of 3-6 mm for 5 cGPS in northeast India and above 0.8 with RMSE of 1-9 mm for 26 cGPS in Himalayas. PWV time series at all the cGPS stations indicated distinct seasonal cycle for both MODIS and GPS PWV with high RMSE (similar to 6 nun) in wet months and low RMSE (similar to 3 mm) during dry months. Taking advantage of broad spatial spread of stations and long span of data, model for spatial variability of GPS-PWV for Indian subcontinent is proposed. Inter-annual and seasonal variability of GPS-PWV is discussed in detail for peninsular India, northeast India and Himalayas.

TI  - Investigating the role of antecedent SMAP satellite soil moisture, radar rainfall and MODIS vegetation on runoff production in an agricultural region
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following results by Crow et al. (2017) [Geophys. Res. Lett. 44, 5495-5503] on the impact of antecedent soil moisture on runoff production, we investigate total runoff production during individual rainfall-runoff events in agricultural landscapes as a function of antecedent soil moisture, total rainfall, and vegetation cover for catchments with drainage areas ranging from 80 to 1000 km(2) in the state of Iowa, USA. For our study, we use Enhanced SMAP soil moisture estimates, the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), gauge-corrected Stage IV radar rainfall, and USGS streamflow data. We analyze the event runoff ratio as a function of event-scale rainfall, antecedent SMAP soil moisture and soil-moisture-deficit-normalized rainfall for the events in a period from March 31, 2015 to October 31, 2018. Our goal is to confirm the relationships identified by Crow et al. (2017) in heavily managed agricultural landscapes and to refine some of their methodological steps to quantify the role of additional variables controlling runoff production. To this end, we define three different strategies to identify rainfall-runoff events and add a baseflow separation step to better insulate event scale storrnflow runoff. We test the effects of antecedent soil moisture, rainfall, and vegetation on the event-scale runoff ratio. The antecedent SMAP soil moisture and event-scale rainfall are found to have significant predictive power in estimating event runoff ratio. Soil moisture deficit-normalized rainfall, introduced as the ratio of event-scale rainfall to available space in top soil before initiation of the event, exhibited a more distinct relationship with runoff ratio. The long-term analysis of runoff ratio, rainfall, and MODIS EVI indicated that, in an agricultural region, vegetation plays a significant role in determining event-scale runoff ratios. The methodology and outcome of our study have direct implications on real-time flood forecasting and long-term hydrologic assessments.

TI  - Leukemic Non-nodal Mantle Cell Lymphoma: Diagnosis and Treatment
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) encompasses nearly 6% of all the non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It is considered an incurable neoplastic process arising from B cells. The cytogenetic abnormality t(11;14) (q13; q32) leading to cyclin D1 overexpression is the sentinel genetic event and provides an exceptional marker for diagnosis. MCL is generally considered to have an aggressive course as compared with other indolent lymphomas with traditionally reported median survival of 3-5 years. According to the 2016 WHO classification, there are two major known variants of MCL: classical which affects the lymph nodes and extra nodal sites and leukemic non-nodal MCL (L-NN-MCL) which characteristically involves the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and the spleen. It is important to distinguish between classical and leukemic non-nodal MCL since the latter variant of MCL follows a rather indolent course with a wait and watch approach in order to avoid overtreatment. However, a subset of patients with L-NN-MCL can transform into a more aggressive course requiring treatment. Current evidence suggests those patients with alteration in TP53 gene do not respond to standard chemotherapy agents and may need targeted therapy. In this review, we describe the characteristics of L-NN-MCL, its diagnosis, and management.

TI  - A Radiation Oncologist's Guide to Axillary Management in Breast Cancer: a Walk Through the Trials
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The axilla is the most common site for breast cancer nodal metastases. Aggressive management includes axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), radiotherapy, and systemic therapy, but carries the risks of lymphedema and "overtreatment". We review the clinical trials that led to de-escalation of axillary management and their nuances that are often overlooked. Recent Findings With the rise of sentinel lymph node biopsy, several trials conclude that ALND can be omitted in specific populations. However, the subtleties in those trials, such as the role of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have yet to be clarified. These discussions carry forward into the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, where ongoing trials investigate who needs ALND and/or radiation. This review examines the clinical trials that form the standard of care, and highlights why axillary management is individualized today.

TI  - Acute arterial thrombosis during adjuvant Adriamycin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in a patient with early breast cancer A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Cancer and chemotherapy individually confer hypercoagulability and increased risks of thrombosis. Most thromboembolic complication after breast cancer chemotherapy was venous thrombosis after multiagent chemotherapy. Arterial thrombosis is extremely rare in early breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.Presenting concerns: A 55-year-old woman with right breast cancer presented to the emergency department with sudden pain, numbness, and swelling in her left hand. She underwent breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy 2 months before the visit. She received the second cycle of adjuvant Adriamycin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy 5 days before.Interventions: Computed tomography angiography revealed acute arterial thrombosis in the left brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries. Unfractionated heparin was initiated immediately, followed by brachial and radial-ulnar thrombectomy, restoring perfusion to the extremity. The postoperative course was uncomplicated; she was discharged on warfarin at a daily dose of 4 mg.Outcomes: Chemotherapy was discontinued. Anticoagulation with warfarin was continued. She subsequently received adjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor and adjuvant radiotherapy.Main lessons: Despite the low risks of arterial thrombosis in breast cancer, it is a devastating complication with significant morbidity and mortality. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in those at risk. Immediate anticoagulant therapy and surgical intervention should be considered in affected cases.

TI  - Artificial recharge to groundwater using geospatial and groundwater modelling techniques in North Western Himalaya, India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Artificial recharge to groundwater is an important process for the management of surface and subsurface water resources. In the present study suitable sites for artificial recharge to groundwater were delineated using geospatial techniques and groundwater modelling in Jammu Himalaya, India. Different thematic layers were prepared from remote sensing data (IRS-P6 and LISS-IV), and SRTM-DEM and aquifer parameters thematic layers were prepared from pumping test data and well inventory data collected during the field observations were integrated using the weighted index overlay method in the GIS environment to prepare the artificial recharge zone map. Further, suitable sites for artificial recharge map were determined by superimposing a drainage network map over the artificial recharge zones map, considering the terrain and local conditions for artificial recharge. The groundwater modelling for artificial recharge to groundwater was also carried out using Visual Modflow Flex software to determine the modeling zones for artificial recharge to groundwater. The lithologs data, aquifer thickness, hydraulic conductivity, specific yield and water level data were used to generate simulations of groundwater modelling zones. Finally, GIS based artificial recharge zones map and groundwater modelling zones were compared to validate artificial recharge zones. Simultaneously, a case study was also carried out to determine the impact of discharge and artificial recharge to surrounding aquifers. The results achieved from the current research proved the efficiency of geospatial technology and groundwater modelling techniques for delineating suitable zones and sites for artificial recharge to groundwater and their implementation in the field.

TI  - Impact of drought on dust storms: case study over Southwest Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are common meteorological events in arid and semi -arid regions, particularly in Southwest Iran (SWI). Here we study the relation between drought events in Iraq and dust storms in SWI between 2003 and 2018. The HYSPLIT model showed that central and southern Iraq are the main dust sources for SWI. Mean annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) analysis demonstrated that 2008 and 2009 were the dustiest years since 2003 and there is an increased frequency of summertime extreme dust events in the years 2008 and 2009. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index revealed that drought in Iraq significantly affects dust storms in Iran. Similarly, dramatic desiccation of Iraq wetlands has contributed to increasing fall dust events in SWI. AOD in SWI is highly correlated (-0.76) with previous -month vapor pressure deficit (VPD) over Iraq, demonstrating the potential of VPD for dust event forecasting.

TI  - A Study on Classifying Sea Ice of the Summer Arctic Ocean Using Sentinel-1 A/B SAR Data and Deep Learning Models
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of high-resolution sea ice maps of the Arctic Ocean is increasing due to the possibility of pioneering North Pole Routes and the necessity of precise climate prediction models. In this study, sea ice classification algorithms for two deep learning models were examined using Sentinel-1 A/B SAR data to generate high-resolution sea ice classification maps. Based on current ice charts, three classes (Open Water, First Year Ice, Multi Year Ice) of training data sets were generated by Arctic sea ice and remote sensing experts. Ten sea ice classification algorithms were generated by combing two deep learning models (i.e. Simple CNN and Resnet50) and five cases of input bands including incident angles and thermal noise corrected HV bands. For the ten algorithms, analyses were performed by comparing classification results with ground truth points. A confusion matrix and Cohen's kappa coefficient were produced for the case that showed best result. Furthermore, the classification result with the Maximum Likelihood Classifier that has been traditionally employed to classify sea ice. In conclusion, the Convolutional Neural Network case, which has two convolution layers and two max pooling layers, with HV and incident angle input bands shows classification accuracy of 96.66%, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.9499. All deep learning cases shows better classification accuracy than the classification result of the Maximum Likelihood Classifier.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Advances in Agrometeorology for Managing Climatic Risks of Farmers (INAGMET)
CL  - New Delhi, INDIA
AB  - The present study was undertaken to explore the applicability of multi date satellite imageries for assessment of paddy stubble burnt areas in Karnal; a major paddy growing district of Haryana. Temporal data sets (pre-burning and post-burning during the year 2017) of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), having spatial resolution of 30 meters and temporal resolution of 16 days were used for the quantitative estimation of burnt areas. Due to non availability of multidate cloud free Lands at 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data, two images viz. September 20, 2017 and October 22, 2017 data were used for the study. Moderate resolution Landsat OLI data provides estimate of the burnt area, however; frequent assessment was not possible due to presence of cloud cover during the rice harvesting period. Supervised classification technique was used for the analysis of digital data in order to generate land cover type through selection of reference training sites. Images were classified into 6 major classes namely burnt area, other crops & grasses, water body, built-up land, forest/tree, and fallow land. To improve the classification accuracy, the non-agricultural areas were masked out. The area was estimated by computing pixels under the classified image using post classification technique. The area estimates are based on the available Landsat OLI classified satellite data and the paddy stubble burnt area as identified on the October 22, 2017 image. Total paddy stubble burnt area was observed to be 49000ha; which is almost 28.4% of the total rice area grown in Karnal (1, 72, 474 ha). Study indicates that concentration of paddy stubble burnt area is more in Assandh and Karnal tehsils of Karnal as compared to others. Concentration of paddy stubble burnt area is moderate in Gharaunda and Nilokheri tehsil while in Indri tehsil, very less paddy stubble burning was observed. The reduced burning in Indri tehsil might be due to cultivation of scented rice. The scented rice is manually harvested and the straw is being used as animal feed, thus restricting burning of residues. The present study summarizes that remote sensing can be used as an effective tool for estimating the rice stubble burnt area to further help in value addition of weather based agro-advisory.

TI  - Statistical Prediction for Annual Start Date and Duration of Sea-Ice Coverage at Qinhuangdao Observation Station
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinhuangdao City is located in the mid-latitude monsoon-affected region, and the timing of sea-ice coverage changes from year to year, making sea-ice forecasting difficult. In this paper, we propose a statistical model using the 1980-2013 data collected at the Qinhuangdao observation station. The start date and the duration of ice coverage are fitted with four marginal distributions, from which the best-fitted, i.e., the Weibull distribution, is selected to form a joint probability density function (PDF), built by the Gaussian copula method, for the two variables. With a given start date forecast by the Gray-Markov model (GMM), the joint PDF becomes a conditional probability model, which predicts that the duration of ice coverage is most likely 33 days at the Qinhuangdao observation station in 2014-2015. The predicted duration value is only two days less than the actual situation. The results prove that the new prediction model is feasible and effective to predict the period of ice coverage. The general sea-ice conditions that the sea ice would most likely form on December 8 and last for 80 days at the Qinhuangdao observation station could also be obtained from the joint PDF. The statistical model provides a useful tool to forecast ice conditions for planning and management of maritime activities.

TI  - Neutralizing Prejudices
T2  - GROUNDED THEORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a social profile of a tolerant and global ideological behavior. The in-group-behavior revolves around enforcing the tolerant virtue and rooting out and eliminating prejudiced attitudes that affect minorities and the collective environment. The main concern is conceptualized as "enabling a nonjudgmental environment" for oneself and others. The recurrent solution to this concern is "neutralizing prejudices." Neutralizing prejudices is a means to engage and deal with prejudiced oppression and prejudice-related behavior. Mindsets with a tolerant worldview use neutralization as a way to assert their worldview and cope with the prejudiced attitudes they experience towards minorities and the collective environment. Neutralizing prejudices is a way to negate, defuse, disqualify, or override a prejudiced context by applying an opposite or contrary force or effect. As such, neutralizing is mainly a rhetorical requisite. As a basic social process, neutralizing prejudices is a process of "collective regrouping" in relation to a social, moral, and global objective.

TI  - Neuropathological lesions in the brains of goats in North-Western Nigeria: possible impact of artisanal mining
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indiscriminate small-scale artisanal gold mining activities were reported to have caused anthropogenic heavy metal environmental pollution in Zamfara State, north-western Nigeria. There is little or no information on the neurotoxic effects and related neuropathological lesions due to environmental pollution in the animal population. Therefore, this work investigated the concentration of heavy metal and associated lesions in the brain of goats around an artisanal mining site in Zamfara. Brain samples were collected from 40 goats at slaughter slabs in Bagega (Zamfara State) while 15 goats with the same demography but without a history of environmental exposure at the time of this study served as controls. The concentration of lead and cadmium in brain tissue and histopathologic changes were assessed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, histology and immunohistochemistry. The metal concentrations were significantly higher in exposed goats than in the unexposed animals. Cresyl violet staining and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry indicated chromatolysis and increased astrocytic activity respectively in the exposed goats. This study is of epidemiological importance as it shows a generalised increase of the metal concentrations in the brain of goats exposed to artisanal mining in Zamfara, north-western Nigeria. This could have health effects on the animals associated with nervous co-ordination, growth and development and as a good sentinel for pathogenesis of the heavy metal exposure.

T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive vinegar fly, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is a major economic pest of soft-skinned fruit in the USA. In order to identify suitable biological control agents in Wisconsin, we assessed the presence and impact of potential natural enemies of D. suzukii in tart cherry and raspberry farms with documented D. suzukii populations. Yellow sticky cards and sentinel traps baited with D. suzukii or D. melanogaster larvae and pupae were deployed in these agricultural areas in the foliage and near the soil surface. Four families of parasitoids with known species that successfully parasitize D. suzukii (Pteromalidae, Braconidae, Figitidae, and Diapriidae) were found on sticky traps at all sampling sites. However, no parasitoids emerged from D. suzukii or D. melanogaster sentinel larvae or pupae throughout the duration of the field assessment. Predation was documented on sentinel D. suzukii pupae (1-4%) and sentinel D. melanogaster pupae (5-8%). The majority of sentinel pupae never emerged upon their return from the field and showed no evidence of field predation. Between 70 and 92% of recovered D. suzukii pupae were dead, and 46-72% of D. melanogaster pupae were dead. The absence of parasitoids found emerging from the sentinel drosophilid larvae and pupae and overall low levels of predation suggests that native biological control may provide limited potential as a management option against D. suzukii in Wisconsin at this time.

TI  - Evaluating the roles of green and built-up areas in reducing a surface urban heat island using remote sensing data
T2  - URBANI IZZIV-URBAN CHALLENGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has several negative effects on both the environment and human health. Urbanization has also become an important contributor to global warming. One of these effects is the urban heat island (UHI), which is caused by human activities and defined as the temperature difference between urban and surrounding rural areas. With rapid urbanization in the past few decades, Skopje has experienced remarkable UHI effects. To investigate the roles of built-up and green areas in a surface UHI, this article uses satellite data from Landsat ETM+ to analyse the land surface temperature and high-resolution Planet Scope DOVE data to analyse built-up and green areas. For geostatistical analyses, seventeen randomly selected subareas in Skopje were used. The results show a significant correlation between the UHI and built-up areas, and strong correlation between green areas and areas not affected by the UHI, indicating that the UHI effect can be significantly weakened with additional green areas. One of the significant findings in the study is the ideal proportion of built-up (40%) and green areas (60%), where the UHI effect is weak, or in some cases prevented. For future studies, investigating other factors that may contribute to the UHI phenomenon is suggested.

TI  - Postmastectomy radiotherapy in T1-2 patients with one to three positive lymph nodes - Past, present and future
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Review
AB  - Past: The role of post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with tumor <5 cm and one to three positive lymph nodes after axillary dissection (ALND) is vigorously debated. Initial doubts over the efficacy and safety of PMRT in these patients were partially overcome by improvement in technology and systemic treatments. Several randomized controlled clinical trials confirmed benefit of PMRT in N1 patients, which were meta-analyzed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). This meta-analysis provides the sole high-level evidence to guide clinical decision-making.Present: Nevertheless, concerns have been evoked around these results, most notably concerning the patient selection bias and the era in which the patients were treated. More recent studies, albeit retrospective, are in contrast with this level I evidence, unequivocally reporting inferior recurrence rates in control arms than those of the EBCTCG meta-analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that one solution would not fit all N1 patients and that patient selection for PMRT shall be stratified upon risks factors. Most prominent of such factors identified are: patient age; number and ratio of positive lymph nodes; histological features such as lymphovascular invasion; and hormone receptor expression.Future: A prospective randomized controlled trial SUPREMO will release its final results in 2023 and shed light onto the subject. Genomic tumor cell profiling will likely provide further guidelines in terms of risk stratification. SUPREMO translational sub-study will also offer material for genomic analyses. A cross-field tendency to forgo nodal dissection in favor of sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by nodal irradiation might eventually render the question of PMRT indication after ALND irrelevant.

TI  - An integrated approach for identification of waterlogged areas using RS and GIS technique and groundwater modelling
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated approach using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) and groundwater modelling (GM) has been used for waterlogged areas identification in the Rohtak district of Haryana State, India. Surface waterlogged areas were delineated using optical remote sensing satellite data-based normalized difference water index (NDWI) technique. Sentinel 2 MSS (optical data) images pertaining to pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were acquired and processed to extract water pixels. To overcome the limitation of false positives and cloud penetration associated with optical images, water pixels were also extracted using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel 1A. Thresholding of NDWI for optical images and sigma naught for SAR images was done using the respective histograms to distinguish water and terrestrial features. Surface waterlogged areas were delineated from the generated combined water body raster based on the visual interpretation technique in a GIS environment. Sub-surface waterlogging conditions were simulated for the same year using process-based groundwater model MODFLOW. A conceptual model was created to simulate groundwater system based on flow processes, hydrogeological characteristics, aquifer hydraulic properties, source and sinks and boundary conditions. Sub-surface waterlogged areas were delineated based on depth to water table classification criteria. It was found that surface waterlogged area varies from 0.55 to 1.0% of the district area from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon season, while the percentage of sub-surface waterlogged areas was higher, varying from 9.1 to 21.6%, respectively. Statistics also shows that most of the surface waterlogged areas do not fall under the areas plagued by sub-surface waterlogging.

TI  - Monitoring Within-Field Variability of Corn Yield using Sentinel-2 and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and prediction of within-field crop variability can support farmers to make the right decisions in different situations. The current advances in remote sensing and the availability of high resolution, high frequency, and free Sentinel-2 images improve the implementation of Precision Agriculture (PA) for a wider range of farmers. This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R-2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4-R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R-2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4-R6).

TI  - Assessing Spatio-Temporal Variability of Wildfires and their Impact on Sub-Saharan Ecosystems and Air Quality Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data and Trend Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, wildfires are considered the most commonly occurring disasters, resulting from natural and anthropogenic ignition sources. Wildfires consist of burning standing biomass at erratic degrees of intensity, severity, and frequency. Consequently, wildfires generate large amounts of smoke and other toxic pollutants that have devastating impacts on ambient air quality and human health. There is, therefore, a need for a comprehensive study that characterizes land atmosphere interactions with regard to wildfires, critical for understanding the interrelated and multidimensional impacts of wildfires. Current studies have a limited scope and a narrow focus, usually only focusing on one aspect of wildfire impacts, such as air quality without simultaneously considering the impacts on land surface changes and vice versa. In this study, we use several multisource data to determine the spatial distribution, frequency, disturbance characteristics of and variability and distribution of pollutants emitted by wildfires. The specific objectives were to (1) study the sources of wildfires and the period they are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa over a 9 year period, i.e., 2007-2016, (2) estimate the seasonal disturbance of wildfires on various vegetation types, (3) determine the spatial distribution of black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke, and (4) determine the vertical height distribution of smoke. The results show largest burned areas in December January February (DJF), June July August (JJA) and September October November (SON) seasons, and reciprocal high emissions of BC, CO, and smoke, as observed by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). In addition, the results reveal an increasing trend in the magnitude of BC, and CO concentration driven by meteorological conditions such as low precipitation, low relative humidity, and low latent heat flux. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of multisource remotely sensed data in characterising long-term wildfire patterns and associated emissions. The results in this study are critical for informing better regional fire management and air quality control strategies to preserve endangered species and habitats, promote sustainable land management, and reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions.

TI  - Generation of an efficient structural evidence layer for mineral exploration targeting
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of enhanced and augmented evidence maps corresponding to operation of ore-forming geological processes improves mineral exploration success. Structural lineaments have a substantial impact on such processes. Therefore, precise recognition of the lineaments facilitates mineral exploration targeting toward undiscovered mineralized zones. The paper aims 1) to recognize and analyze structural lineaments, especially those which are spatially and genetically associated with orogenic gold mineral system, through analysis of a multidisciplinary geospatial dataset including aeromagnetic geophysics, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission, and Reflection Radiometer imagery and Digital Elevation Model data and 2) to generate an efficient structural evidence layer for exploration targeting. The methods applied are edge enhancement filters with line detection algorithms. The detection algorithm, Hough Transform, and total horizontal derivative of upward continued filter and its tilt derivative) were utilized to extract structural lineaments. Evaluation of the spatial association of known Au mineralization in the study area with the recognized structural features demonstrated that abundance, density, and trend of such features strongly control the localization of Au mineralization. In addition, band ratio, principal component analysis, spectral angle mapper, and spectral feature fitting were applied to map and generate mineralization-related alteration layer. The evidence layers were then integrated through the conventional TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method to delineate reliable exploration targets.

TI  - Influence of Surface Water Bodies on the Land Surface Temperature of Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent climate change has resulted in the reduction of several surface water bodies (SWBs) all around the globe. These SWBs, such as streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, reservoirs, and creeks have a positive impact on the cooling of the surrounding climate and, therefore, reduction in SWBs can contribute to the rise of land surface temperature (LST). This study presents the impact of SWBs on the LST across Bangladesh to quantify their roles in the rapid temperature rise of Bangladesh. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and water mask data of Bangladesh for the period 2000-2015 are used for this purpose. Influences of topography and geography on LST were first removed, and then regression analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of SWBs on the LST. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to assess the changes in LST and SWBs. The results revealed that SWBs were reduced from 11,379 km(2) in 2000 to 9657 km(2) in 2015. The trend analysis showed that changes in SWBs have reduced significantly at a 90% level of confidence, which contributed to the acceleration of LST rise in the country due to global warming. The spatial analysis during the specific years showed that an increase in LST can be seen with the reduction of SWBs. Furthermore, the reduction of 100 m(2) of SWBs can reduce the LST of the surrounding regions from -1.2 to -2.2 degrees C.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Black Spruce Bud Phenology across Quebec Based on MODIS-NDVI Time Series and Field Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a widely accessible tool to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in the bud phenology of evergreen species, which show limited seasonal changes in canopy greenness. However, there is a need for precise and compatible data to compare remote sensing time series with field observations. In this study, fortnightly MODIS-NDVI was fitted using double-logistic functions and calibrated using ordinal logit models with the sequential phases of bud phenology collected during 2015, 2017 and 2018 in a black spruce stand. Bud break and bud set were spatialized for the period 2009-2018 across 5000 stands in Quebec, Canada. The first phase of bud break and the last phase of bud set were observed in the field in mid-May and at the beginning of September, when NDVI was 80.5% and 92.2% of its maximum amplitude, respectively. The NDVI rate of change was estimated at 0.07 in spring and 0.04 in autumn. When spatialized on the black spruce stands, bud break was detected earlier in the southwestern regions (April-May), and later in the northeastern regions (mid to end of June). No clear trend was observed for bud set, with different patterns being detected among the years. Overall, the process bud break and bud set lasted 51 and 87 days, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of satellite remote sensing for providing reliable timings of bud phenological events using calibrated NDVI time series on wide regions that are remote or with limited access.

TI  - Natural vegetation cover analysis in Wadi Hagul, Egypt using hyperspectral remote sensing approach
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural vegetation of Wadi Hagul in the eastern desert of Egypt suffers from serious changes due to the uncontrolled human activities. Present research is the first attempt to study the natural vegetation cover of Wadi Hagul in regard of spectroscopic characteristics. This was achieved by analyzing the relationship between the spectral signatures of wild plants and variation of the morphological and ecological characteristics using hyperspectral sensor. ASD field Spec was used to measure the reflection of 27 plant species in different localities. The optimal waveband was firstly selected then the optimal wavelength in order to discriminate the studied taxa using ANOVA-Tukey's and LDA analysis. The vitality of the plant was estimated using numbers of vegetation indices derived from spectroscopic measurements. Multi-temporal Landsat images were processed to produce NDVI to detect the spatiotemporal change in vegetation cover. The study analyses showed that the investigated plant species of Wadi Hagul are belonging to 19 genera and 12 families. Statistical analyses indicated that Red and NIR spectral zones are the optimal zones to differentiate various plant species. The optimal wavelength of each plant species was found variable and analyses showed that there are wide spectral unique zones for Centaurea aegyptiaca and Ochradenus baccatus, which facilitate separating these species by various sensors. Indices analyses showed that most of the investigated plant species lies in the good conditions. It can be concluded the spectral signature of the wild plant species is very necessary for documentation of the natural vegetation in such Wadies.

TI  - Forest Damage Detection Using Daily Normal Vegetation Index Based on Time Series LANDSAT Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree growth and vitality in forest shows seasonal changes. So, in order to detect forest damage accurately, we have to use satellite images before and after damages taken at the same season. However, temporal resolution of high or medium resolution images is very low, so it is not easy to acquire satellite images of the same seasons. Therefore, in this study, we estimated spectral information of the same DOY using time-series Landsat images and used the estimates as reference values to assess forest damages. The study site is Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, where forest damage occurred due to hail and drought in 2017. Time-series vegetation index (NDVI, EVI, NDMI) maps were produced using all Landsat 8 images taken in the past 3 years. Daily normal vegetation index maps were produced through cloud removal and data interpolation processes. We analyzed the difference of daily normal vegetation index value before damage event and vegetation index value after event at the same DOY, and applied the criteria of forest damage. Finally, forest damage map based on daily normal vegetation index was produced. Forest damage map based on Landsat images could detect better subtle changes of vegetation vitality than the existing map based on UAV images. In the extreme damage areas, forest damage map based on NDMI using the SWIR band showed similar results to the existing forest damage map. The daily normal vegetation index map can used to detect forest damage more rapidly and accurately.

TI  - A Study on the Calculation of Evapotranspiration Crop Coefficient in the Cheongmi-cheon Paddy Field
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, crop coefficients were calculated in two different methods and the results were evaluated. In the first method, appropriateness of GLDAS-based evapotranspiration was evaluated by comparing it with observed data of Cheongmi-cheon (CMC) Flux tower. Then, crop coefficient was calculated by dividing actual evapotranspiration with potential evapotranspiration that derived from GLDAS. In the second method, crop coefficient was determined by using MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) analysis with vegetation index (NDVI, EVI, LAI and SAVI) derived from MODIS and in-situ soil moisture data observed in CMC, In comparison of two crop coefficients over the entire period, for each crop coefficient GLDAS K-c and SM&VI K-c, shows the mean value of 0.412 and 0.378, the bias of 0.031 and -0.004, the RMSE of 0.092 and 0.069, and the Index of Agree (IOA) of 0.944 and 0.958. Overall, both methods showed similar patterns with observed evapotranspiration, but the SM&VI-based method showed better results. One step further, the statistical evaluation of GLDAS K-c and SM&VI K-c in specific period was performed according to the growth phase of the crop. The result shows that GLDAS K-c was better in the early and mid-phase of the crop growth, and SM&VI K-c was better in the latter phase. This result seems to be because of reduced accuracy of MODIS sensors due to yellow dust in spring and rain clouds in summer. If the observational accuracy of the MODIS sensor is improved in subsequent study, the accuracy of the SM&VI-based method will also be improved and this method will be applicable in determining the crop coefficient of unmeasured basin or predicting the crop coefficient of a certain area.

TI  - A Feasibility Study on the Application of TVDI on Accessing Wildfire Danger in the Korean Peninsula
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a major natural disaster affecting socioeconomics and ecology. Remote sensing data have been widely used to estimate the wildfire danger with an advantage of higher spatial resolution. Among the several wildfire related indices using remote sensing data, Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) assesses wildfire danger based on both Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). Although TVDI has physical advantages by considering both weather and vegetation condition, previous studies have shown TVDI does not performed well compare to other wildfire related indices over the Korean Peninsula. In this study we have attempted multiple modification to improve TVDI performance over the study region. In-situ measured air temperature was employed to increase accuracy, regression line was generated using monthly data to include seasonal effect, and TVDI was calculated at each province level to consider vegetation type and local climate. The modified TVDI calculation method was evaluated in wildfire cases and showed significant improvement in wildfire danger estimation.

TI  - Comparison of Spatio-temporal Fusion Models of Multiple Satellite Images for Vegetation Monitoring
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For consistent vegetation monitoring, it is necessary to generate time-series vegetation index datasets at fine temporal and spatial scales by fusing the complementary characteristics between temporal and spatial scales of multiple satellite data. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the prediction accuracy of time-series change information extracted from spatio-temporal fusion models of multiple satellite data for vegetation monitoring. As for the spatio-temporal fusion models, we applied two models that have been widely employed to vegetation monitoring, including a Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). To quantitatively evaluate the prediction accuracy, we first generated simulated data sets from MODIS data with fine temporal scales and then used them as inputs for the spatio-temporal fusion models. We observed from the comparative experiment that ESTARFM showed better prediction performance than STARFM, but the prediction performance for the two models became degraded as the difference between the prediction date and the simultaneous acquisition date of the input data increased. This result indicates that multiple data acquired close to the prediction date should be used to improve the prediction accuracy. When considering the limited availability of optical images, it is necessary to develop an advanced spatio-temporal model that can reflect the suggestions of this study for vegetation monitoring.

TI  - Detection of Change in Water System Due to Collapse of Laos Xe pian-Xe namnoy Dam Using KOMPSAT-5 Satellites
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, disaster accidents have occurred frequently over the world, and disaster have been continuously studied using remote sensing due to large scale and hard-to-reach features. The collapse of Laos Xe pian-Xe namnoy dam in 2018 also caused a lot of human and economic damage. This study's purpose is to change detect water system due to the collapse of Xe pian-Xe namnoy dam in Laos and to derive areas where future flooding is expected. The water system is extracted from each image of KOMPSAT-5 before and after the dam collapse in order to quantitatively change detect in the water system. The result of the water system area increased more than 10 times after the dam collapse. In addition, it is confirmed that the newly created water system is thickly created in areas of low altitude area. This study result can be used in the future to systematize the pre-response to abnormalities and issues in existing operating dams. And then, if combined with other remote sensing data, more diverse and specific results could be obtained.

TI  - Long-Term High-Resolution Sediment and Sea Surface Temperature Spatial Patterns in Arctic Nearshore Waters Retrieved Using 30-Year Landsat Archive Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is directly impacted by climate change. The increase in air temperature drives the thawing of permafrost and an increase in coastal erosion and river discharge. This leads to a greater input of sediment and organic matter into coastal waters, which substantially impacts the ecosystems, the subsistence economy of the local population, and the climate because of the transformation of organic matter into greenhouse gases. Yet, the patterns of sediment dispersal in the nearshore zone are not well known, because ships do not often reach shallow waters and satellite remote sensing is traditionally focused on less dynamic environments. The goal of this study is to use the extensive Landsat archive to investigate sediment dispersal patterns specifically on an exemplary Arctic nearshore environment, where field measurements are often scarce. Multiple Landsat scenes were combined to calculate means of sediment dispersal and sea surface temperature under changing seasonal wind conditions in the nearshore zone of Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk in the western Canadian Arctic since 1982. We use observations in the Landsat red and thermal wavebands, as well as a recently published water turbidity algorithm to relate archive wind data to turbidity and sea surface temperature. We map the spatial patterns of turbidity and water temperature at high spatial resolution in order to resolve transport pathways of water and sediment at the water surface. Our results show that these pathways are clearly related to the prevailing wind conditions, being ESE and NW. During easterly wind conditions, both turbidity and water temperature are significantly higher in the nearshore area. The extent of the Mackenzie River plume and coastal erosion are the main explanatory variables for sediment dispersal and sea surface temperature distributions in the study area. During northwesterly wind conditions, the influence of the Mackenzie River plume is negligible. Our results highlight the potential of high spatial resolution Landsat imagery to detect small-scale hydrodynamic processes, but also show the need to specifically tune optical models for Arctic nearshore environments.

TI  - Health of Vegetation in the Area of Mass Outbreaks of Siberian Moth Based on Satellite Data
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of analyzing the state and dynamics of damaged vegetation from satellite images of high and ultrahigh spatial resolution. This study was conducted based on the example of the site of coniferous forests in the Lower Angara region (Krasnoyarsk krai), where a large outbreak of the Siberian moth took place in 1944-1995. The remote assessment of the state of dark coniferous forests revealed the trends of the SWVI (or NDMI) and NDVI indices that characterize long-term changes in the vegetation cover over the period 2000-2018. The SWVI index is the most informative indicator: a sharp decrease in average values and increase in the coefficient of variation of the index are noted for dead and severely damaged wood stands (crown defoliation of more than 75%). The area of dead forests was calculated according to the difference images of the indices (Delta SWVI) with the threshold criterion l sigma (the standard deviation). In 2000, the area of forests that died under the impact of the Siberian moth was approximately 19 200 ha. Alter two major fires in 2004 and 2011 and as a result of destructive factors combination, the area of dead forests increased up to 20 400 ha by 2017-2018. Reforestation within the boundaries of dead stands was estimated from the classification of Landsat images (June 20, 2017; June 23, 2018) by the Random Forest algorithm using the selection of templates from detailed Resurs-P images with a spatial resolution of 1 m (Geoton-LI-July 22, 2015 and December 3, 2018), which were taken during different seasons. The classification proved to be highly reliable (Kappa index is more than 0.9). The areas of classified deciduous and coniferous stands, deciduous and mixed stands with mainly coniferous regrowth, grass-shrub vegetation, and barren soil were calculated. Natural regeneration of mainly coniferous undergrowth occurred in 17% of the damaged area, and deciduous regrowth occurred in approximately 10% of the area 23 years after damage by pests. The area damaged by the moth affected reforestation: the larger the area of the outbreak, the higher the share of open lands with grass and shrub vegetation (it accounts for more than half of the area for the large outbreak and approximately 45% for smaller outbreaks). Regrowth was found in proximity of patches of stands and deadwood in the sites unaffected by large fires. Frequent fires in the territory of moth infestation limit the process of reforestation; therefore, most of the vegetation was at the initial stage of the succession cycle.

TI  - Transmission of a Freshwater Isolate of <i>Ichthyophonus</i> (Clade C) to Two Marine Fish Species
T2  - JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ingestion of infected prey is the most recognizable mode of transmission for Ichthyophonus, but because this mode of transmission is unidirectional from small prey fish to larger predators, it cannot sustain the parasite within or among populations nor does it explain transmission to planktivores. Recently, waterborne transmission was demonstrated in cultured Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, which could explain how the parasite is transmitted without piscivory. However, it is possible that this is an adaptation to aquaculture conditions, and may not occur among wild fish. To address this question, experiments were conducted to determine if a freshwater isolate of Ichthyophonus is infectious and pathogenic to marine species, as well as if transmission is possible between different marine species. Pacific Staghorn Sculpins Leptocottus armatus were fed a freshwater isolate of Ichthyophonus (clade C) and then housed with susceptible sentinel Rock Soles Lepidopsetta bilineata. Ninety two percent of the orally exposed sculpins and 30% of the sentinel soles were Ichthyophonus-positive at the end of the study, with 0% infected controls. These results demonstrate that a freshwater isolate of Ichthyophonus is infectious and pathogenic to marine species and can be transmitted in seawater in the absence of piscivory. It also provides a plausible mechanism for transmission to small prey fish and planktivores, as well as within a population of piscivores when infected prey is not available.

TI  - A two-scale approach for estimating forest aboveground biomass with optical remote sensing images in a subtropical forest of Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests account for 80% of the total carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, to better manage our responses to global warming, it is important to monitor and assess forest aboveground carbon and forest aboveground biomass (FAGB). Different levels of detail are needed to estimate FAGB at local, regional and national scales. Multi-scale remote sensing analysis from high, medium and coarse spatial resolution data, along with field sampling, is one approach often used. However, the methods developed are still time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for systematic monitoring, especially for developing countries, as they require vast numbers of field samples for upscaling. Here, we recommend a convenient two-scale approach to estimate FAGB that was tested in our study sites. The study was conducted in the Chitwan district of Nepal using GeoEye-1 (0.5 m), Landsat (30 m) and Google Earth very high resolution (GEVHR) Quickbird (0.65 m) images. For the local scale (Kayerkhola watershed), tree crowns of the area were delineated by the object-based image analysis technique on GeoEye images. An overall accuracy of 83% was obtained in the delineation of tree canopy cover (TCC) per plot. A TCC vs. FAGB model was developed based on the TCC estimations from GeoEye and FAGB measurements from field sample plots. A coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.76 was obtained in the modelling, and a value of 0.83 was obtained in the validation of the model. To upscale FAGB to the entire district, open source GEVHR images were used as virtual field plots. We delineated their TCC values and then calculated FAGB based on a TCC versus FAGB model. Using the multivariate adaptive regression splines machine learning algorithm, we developed a model from the relationship between the FAGB of GEVHR virtual plots with predictor parameters from Landsat 8 bands and vegetation indices. The model was then used to extrapolate FAGB to the entire district. This approach considerably reduced the need for field data and commercial very high resolution imagery while achieving two-scale forest information and FAGB estimates at high resolution (30 m) and accuracy (R-2=0.76 and 0.7) with minimal error (RMSE=64 and 38 tons ha(-1)) at local and regional scales. This methodology is a promising technique for cost-effective FAGB and carbon estimations and can be replicated with limited resources and time. The method is especially applicable for developing countries that have low budgets for carbon estimations, and it is also applicable to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) monitoring reporting and verification processes.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the modern humanitarian and pedagogical scientific worldview, the religious and purely scientific format of the knowledge content and methods of its production are either unreasonably opposed or are identified for several significant reasons, but none of the above extreme points of view is logically and substantively sound. This complicates the fruitful development of the pedagogical research methodology and perplexes the very content of Pedagogy. Therefore, the concept of,faith. is analysed in this article. The article shows the similarities as well as a significant difference of the attributes dogmatically communicated to the believer's mind that are related to the world order and moral behaviour along with conscious pedagogy of trust and humanity. The analysis is underlain by the opposition of the religious faith and a varying degree of confidence of the teacher, who conducts research, in the conclusions and results of his/her own research project or one submitted by someone for reflection, including: a) confidence in the statistical results of the assessment of samples that show the distribution of certain parameters of the educational environment or the student; b) confidence in the correct application of the theoretical confirmation of the conclusion proposed; c) confidence in the opinions of the expert scholars in the field of Pedagogy, Psychology, and Philosophy of education and in the academic traditions of presenting the content of Pedagogy and methods of pedagogical knowledge.

TI  - Examining the potential of open source remote sensing for building effective decision support systems for precision agriculture in resource-poor settings
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) has become increasingly important to farmers particularly in resource-poor and risk-prone settings in the developing world. However, due to cost and technical constraints, deploying PA infrastructure as decision support systems (DSSs) in smallholder farming settings is often hindered. This paper draws on freely available satellite data (Sentinel-2A) and software (SNAP Toolbox), within the framework of open source remote sensing (OSRS) to demonstrate the potential of monitoring crop health and development towards building an effective DSS to inform farm management and resource allocation decision making using the Tono Irrigation Scheme-a resource-poor rural irrigation system in Ghana, as a case study. We find that vegetation index algorithms in SNAP Toolbox can accurately identify biophysical and growth conditions of crops including chlorophyll content, nitrogen status, pest and disease infestation, and water requirements. Despite the potential inherent in this novel cost-effective OSRS-based monitoring system, basic training of scheme managers and extension officers is required to enable them interpret output from OSRS analysis. Given the potential to reduce costs, improve allocation of scarce resources and increase yields, it is worth implementing OSRS as a DSS for smallholder farmers in other resource-poor settings.

TI  - Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions in Zambian Sermons about the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the contemporary literature about the relationship between religion and COVID-19, vertical as well as horizontal responses can be distinguished. Much of the current literature is based on personal reflection or on quantitative research. This article adds a qualitative research perspective and offers a preliminary analysis of the religious frameworks used by pastors in the Reformed Church in Zambia. Although the pastors acknowledge the need for communal action, their livestreamed services show an emphasis on the vertical dimension, i.e., the relation with God. As this article argues, this can be understood from an African worldview. There is also evidence that the initial vertical dimension of the services shifts to more horizontal concerns as the pandemic progresses.

TI  - The Poetic Realization of Perceptual Images in the Poem "The Brotherhood of Believers" by O. Brezina (A Case Study of the Original and Translated Texts)
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the linguistic and stylistic analysis of the poem "The Brotherhood of Believers" in the context of the poetic and philosophical works of the Czech Symbolist poet Otokar Brezina. It focuses on how the key perceptional images are conveyed through the linguistic means of expression in the original text and its Russian translations and deals with the linguistic transformations that are caused by the author's individual worldview and poetic tradition. One of the tasks associated with the modem research in the field of text theory and its philological analysis is to compare the original text with the two versions of its Russian translations done by K. Balmont and O. Malevich. The first part of the article describes the connection between Brezina's poetic works and his philosophical views, such as his understanding of the true faith, the interdependence between life and death and the contraposition of what is here and beyond. Based on the material of the poems and essays included into different book collections, it is shown that, in Brezina's opinion, the true meaning of life is realized through the consolidation of the souls of brothers, i.e. companions or preachers of the true mystical faith that should lead the humanity to what lies beyond. The poet portrays the supernatural worlds with the help of complex metaphors, chains of abstract images with accented perceptual semantics and possible sensory associations. The comparative analysis, that is presented in the second (main) part of the article, has revealed that, at the semantic level, the Russian translations demonstrate either a "strengthening" or "weakening" of the perceptual component and a change of the "key" perceptional mode in each stanza At the stylistic level, the poetic translations retain certain perceptual metaphors and synesthetic combinations that form the emotional tone of the poem. The translators tend to preserve the original understanding of life and death, which results in almost literal translations of the repetitions with the semantics of "unity". Balmont's translation is based on the metaphorical reflection of reality and contains perceptual images associated with the hidden mystical meaning of the original text. Malevich's translation almost literally reproduces Brezina's poem in a number of stanzas, while the hidden metaphorical representation of reality, which was expressed by the Czech poet through the key perceptual images, is not always explicit. The results of the analysis indicate that studying the perceptual picture of the world, presented in the original text of the poem and in its translations, improves the knowledge of the conceptual and emotional component of "The Brotherhood of Believers". The poem presents a mystical and philosophical understanding of the true faith that unites the poetic and philosophical works of Brezina.

AB  - The patient was a 57-year-old woman with Castleman's disease. The follow-up CT scans obtained during the treatment of Castleman's disease, detected a 15mm nodule in the right breast AC area, and the patient was diagnosed with breast cancer. Lymphadenopathy was noted on both sides of the axilla; however, it was considered to be due to Catsleman's disease. Mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed with preoperative diagnosis of cT1cN0M0, cStage Ⅰ. Rapid diagnosis of the sentinel lymph node during the operation showed a metastatic tumor measuring 3mm and axillary dissection was performed. However, no metastasis was found in the dissected lymph node, which was, therefore, considered as an enlargement due to Castleman's disease.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents estimation and validation of tree heights extracted from synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) digital elevation model (DEM). InSAR technique was used to generate DEM in terms of top of the canopy digital surface model (TCDSM). Multitemporal Radarsat-1 InSAR data pair of February 12, 2004 and March 7, 2004 and Sentinel-1 data pair of December 9, 2017 and December 21, 2017 were used. The TCDSM values at ground truth locations were subtracted from the DEM obtained at forest gap areas (i.e., forest floor elevation). The satellite-derived TCDSM-based tree height was compared with the ground observed data. For this purpose, an experiment in Tundi Reserved Forest, Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India was conducted using global positioning system and altimeter. The study area is a hilly forest tract dominated by Shorea robusta (Sal) with average height of 12 m. Total 275 numbers of trees were selected at 11 locations in different elevation strata. Ground truth locations were also selected on the basis of variability, tree height categories, and accessibility in the area. It was noticed that mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between in situ and estimated heights for Radarsat-1 were 1.48 and 1.53 m, respectively, whereas for Sentinel-1 in 2017, MAE and RMSE were 1.3 and 1.34 m, respectively, with strong correlation of >80%.

TI  - Hydro-geochemical characteristics of glacial meltwater from Naradu Glacier catchment, Western Himalaya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The pattern of changing hydro-geochemical characteristics of water in Himalayan rivers is primarily controlled by sediment load from natural sources in higher altitudes and anthropogenic sources such as the burning of fossil fuels for domestic use, vehicular emissions, and wind transported industrial pollutants in the downstream region. The assessment of water quality is critical for the comparison of natural and anthropogenic sources in the downstream areas due to the dependence of the population on the glacial meltwater for freshwater supply. In the present study, we investigate the physical and ionic characteristics of glacial meltwater from Naradu Glacier catchment concerning the dominant weathering process. The freshwater samples were collected during the ablation period of 2016 and 2017 from specified locations. The physical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature) were measured in the field while the analyses for concentrations of major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) and major anions (Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-) were done in the laboratory. The anions (HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-) and cations (Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+) concentrations were observed to have similar trends for both of the ablation period. The statistical analysis shows the predominance of geological weathering processes in the catchment as the controlling factor for the variation in concentration of different ionic species. The catchment was found to be rich in rocks with carbonate mineral making the Ca2+ and HCO3- the most dominant ions in the glacial meltwater.

AB  - Remote sensing-based Crop evapotranspiration can help and provide guidance for crop water management. This paper quantified crop water requirement and crop water stress for soybean according to vegetation cover and land surface changes in the semi-arid region using remote sensing data. In this regard, MODIS products of land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to estimate crop coefficient (Kc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) for period of 2016-17. The FAO-Penman- Monteith (FPM) model was employed to compute reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Lysimeter crop data were collected IARI, New Delhi to evaluate performance of remote sensed crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The performance evaluation results viz. MBE, RMSE and MPE were found 0.44mm, 0.66mm and 25.15% respectively. A linear relation between lysimeter and remote sensed crop coefficient were established correlation coefficient as high as 0.86. Crop water requirement during crop growing period were 304.40mm and 349.50mm by remote sensing and lysimeter respectively. Crop was not suffering from water stress during initial to mid-stage, however, increasing trend was found at late-stage. It can be inferred that ETc and CWSI developed from remotely sensed indices are a useful tool for quantifying crop water consumption at regional and field scales.

AB  - Background Our earlier report reported that the (Nursery) School Absenteeism Surveillance System ((N)SASSy) can decrease numbers of patients. This study evaluates (N)SASSy's cost-effectiveness. Methods A social perspective is taken for economic evaluation. For simplicity, 8,000 yen is assumed for direct medical costs. We assume the home health care duration to be 6 days, with 30 000 yen as the indirect opportunity cost of family nursing. Benefit-cost ratios are used as indicators of cost-effectiveness. Results By multiplying the disease burden per patient by the reduced number of patients, the (N)SASSy effect was estimated as 206.9 billion yen, with 95% confidence interval of [67.3,346.6] billion yen. The total cost attributable to (N)SASSy throughout Japan is expected to be 2.63 billion yen. The benefit-cost ratio is expected to be approximately 60. Conclusions The estimated benefit-cost ratio is much higher than that for the routine immunization of children.

TI  - A Statistical Forest Reflectance Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability of forest reflectance among hemiboreal forests can be described with a few basis functions. Five basis functions describe almost 98% of variability of directional reflectance spectra in the optical spectral domain (400-1700 nm) in forest stands at the top of a canopy in nadir. A statistical forest reflectance model (SFRM) was developed, the input parameters of which are the forest parameters measured in the course of regular forest inventory. Nadir spectral reflectance of a forest stand is expressed in the SFRM as a linear combination of basis functions, the weights of which are linear combinations of the 15 stand parameters in the forest inventory database. Multiple correlations of the weights on the forest inventory parameters are determined separately for pine, spruce, and broadleaf forests. The basis functions are found from low altitude airborne measurements over managed forests in southeastern Estonia, where a forest management database is available. The model was validated against more than 3000 spectral signatures of forest stands from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) measurements over a test site in southeastern Estonia. In most cases, the model predicts the forest reflectance spectrum at nadir with a relative error about 20-40%. The errors of reflectance values are less than 0.02 in most cases. The sole exception is the reflectance of broadleaf stands, which in near infrared bands of Sentinel-2 MSI is overestimated by 0.02-0.05.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring of Transformation from Pastoral to Agricultural Land Use Using Time-Series Landsat Data in the Feija Basin (Southeast Morocco)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agricultural land at the cost of pastoral land is the common cause of land degradation in the arid areas of developing countries, especially in Morocco. This study aims to assess and monitor the transformation of pastoral land to agricultural land in the arid environment of the Feija Basin (Southeast of Morocco) and to find the key drivers and the issues resulting from this transformation. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to multi-temporal (1975-2017) and multi-sensor (i.e. Multi-spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper, and Operational Land Imager) Landsat satellite images, from which land use classifications were derived. The remote sensing data in combination with ground reference data (household level), groundwater and climate statistics were used to validate and explain the derived land use change maps. The results of the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural lands show two patterns of changes, a middle expansion from 1975 to 2007, and a rapid expansion from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the overall accuracy demonstrated a high accuracy of 94.4%. In 1975 and 1984, the agricultural lands in Feija covered 0.17 km(2) and 1.32 km(2), respectively, compared with 20.10 km(2) in 2017. Since the adoption of the Green Morocco Plan in 2008, the number of watermelon farms and wells has increased rapidly in the study area, which induced a piezometric level drawdown. The results show that spectral mixture analysis yields high accuracies for agricultural lands extraction in arid dry lands and accounts for mixed pixels issues. Results of this study can be used by local administrators to prepare an effective environmental management plan of these fragile drylands. The proposed method can be replicated in other regions to analyse land transformation in similar arid conditions.

TI  - Twenty Years of "Lipid World": A Fertile Partnership with David Deamer
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - "The Lipid World" was published in 2001, stemming from a highly effective collaboration with David Deamer during a sabbatical year 20 years ago at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The present review paper highlights the benefits of this scientific interaction and assesses the impact of the lipid world paper on the present understanding of the possible roles of amphiphiles and their assemblies in the origin of life. The lipid world is defined as a putative stage in the progression towards life's origin, during which diverse amphiphiles or other spontaneously aggregating small molecules could have concurrently played multiple key roles, including compartment formation, the appearance of mutually catalytic networks, molecular information processing, and the rise of collective self-reproduction and compositional inheritance. This review brings back into a broader perspective some key points originally made in the lipid world paper, stressing the distinction between the widely accepted role of lipids in forming compartments and their expanded capacities as delineated above. In the light of recent advancements, we discussed the topical relevance of the lipid worldview as an alternative to broadly accepted scenarios, and the need for further experimental and computer-based validation of the feasibility and implications of the individual attributes of this point of view. Finally, we point to possible avenues for exploring transition paths from small molecule-based noncovalent structures to more complex biopolymer-containing proto-cellular systems.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Land Cover and Heat Island Effects in Six Districts of Chongqing's Main City
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect has always been one of the hottest issues in urban development. In this study, Landsat images from the summers of 2001, 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2018 were used to identify land cover type in six districts of Chongqing's main city. Land cover was categorized as water, vegetation or impervious surface with the object-oriented method. Land surface temperature (LST) data was calculated with the atmospheric radiation transfer equation method, and was then divided into different heat island intensity grades. Next, the spatial and temporal changes in land cover type and heat island effect were analyzed in the six districts. Center migration analysis and heat island coefficients were used to quantitatively reflect the spatiotemporal evolution relationship between land cover and heat island effect. All six districts exhibited a trend of expanding impervious surface, with a 419.38% increase from 2001 to 2018, and shrinking vegetation, with a 17.81% decrease from 2001 to 2018. Also from 2001 to 2018, Yuzhong District had the most significant heat island effect, with a heat island coefficient 0.35 higher than the mean value of the whole study area. The impervious surface center migrated in different directions in each district. Both the direction and the corresponding velocity of the impervious surface and heat island centers were tightly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.53. Relative heat island coefficients (the difference from the mean) of water ranged from -2.08 to -1.17 in different districts. That of impervious surface ranged from 1.60 to 1.93, and that of vegetation ranged from -0.22 to 1.09. The internal heterogeneity of land cover and heat island effect in Chongqing's main city was huge. This study quantitatively analyzed the evolution of the heat island effect in the study area to help provide each district with some targeted suggestions for future urban planning.

AB  - In this paper, oceanographic characteristics of Oman Sea has been simulated using oceanographic model ROMS. The study area was limited from Arvand Roud in the north of Persian Gulf to RAAS AL HAD in the south east of Oman Sea. Oceanographic parameters on the study area were simulated by the ROMS model for 7 years period and the results were analyzed in comparison to satellite data in the study area in different seasons. Propagation pattern of Indian Ocean Surface Water (IOSW) in to the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea was considered for examination using the ROMS model. The model outputs for surface currents and temperature show the similar pattern as compared to remote sensing data and previous work.

TI  - Treatment of Harvest Mite Infestation in Dogs Using a Permethrin 54.5% and Fipronil 6.1% (Effitix®) Topical Spot-On Formulation
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background-The study aims to assess the efficacy of a permethrin 54.5%-fipronil 6.1%-based spot-on solution in dogs naturally infested with Neotrombicula in an open-label controlled study. Methods-Ten naturally infested dogs received one drop per affected site on day (D) 0, and on D14, the rest of the pipette was applied on the skin between the shoulders. Five dogs served as sentinels. Parasite score (0-3), skin lesions (0-4), and investigator pruritus scale (0-4) were assessed on D0, D1, D14, and D28. Results-No treated dogs developed adverse reactions. Parasite score of sentinel dogs was maintained between 1.8 (D0, D1, and D28) and 2.2 (D14). In treated dogs, D0 parasite score was 2.4. It was significantly reduced from D1 (0.5; p < 0.002) to D28 (0.1; p < 0.002). The lesion score was 2.9 on D0 and D1; it was significantly reduced on D14 (0.6; p < 0.002) and D28 (0.1; p < 0.002). Similarly, investigator pruritus scale (D0, 2.2) scores significantly decreased on D14 (0.4; p < 0.004) and D28 (0.2; p < 0.002). Conclusions-The combination permethrin-fipronil appears to be well-tolerated, rapidly and durably effective in the control of localized canine harvest mite infestation.

TI  - SCIENCE AND RELIGION AS LANGUAGES: UNDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE-RELIGION RELATIONSHIP USING METAPHORS, ANALOGIES, AND MODELS
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scholars often use the terms "metaphors," "analogies," and "models" interchangeably and inadvertently overlook the uniqueness of each word. According to recent cognitive studies, the three terms involve distinct cognitive processes using features from a familiar concept and applying them to an abstract, complicated concept. In the field of science and religion, there have been various objects or ideas used as metaphors, analogies, or models to describe the science-religion relationship. Although these heuristic tools provided some understanding of the complex interaction, they failed to address the broad nature of science and religion as well as the multifarious relationship between the two in a sociocultural context. Unlike the previous candidates, the concept of language, including the notions of linguistic worldview, linguistic identity, dialects, power, and bilingualism, offers a unique and comprehensive window through which science, religion, and the relationship between the two are seen with clarity.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning Algorithm and Remote-sensed Data to Estimate Forest Gross Primary Production at Multi-sites Level
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest covers 30% of the Earth's land area and plays an important role in global carbon flux through its ability to store much greater amounts of carbon than other terrestrial ecosystems. The Gross Primary Production (GPP) represents the productivity of forest ecosystems according to climate change and its effect on the phenology, health, and carbon cycle. In this study, we estimated the daily GPP for a forest ecosystem using remote-sensed data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM). MODIS products were employed to train the SVM model from 75% to 80% data of the total study period and validated using eddy covariance measurement (EC) data at the six flux tower sites. We also compare the GPP derived from EC and MODIS (MYD17). The MODIS products made use of two data sets: one for Processed MODIS that included calculated by combined products (e.g., Vapor Pressure Deficit), another one for Unprocessed MODIS that used MODIS products without any combined calculation. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation coefficient (R), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the outcomes of the model. In general, the SVM model trained by the Unprocessed MODIS (R = 0.77 - 0.94, p < 0.001) derived from the multi-sites outperformed those trained at a single-site (R =0.75 -0.95, p <0.001). These results show better performance trained by the data including various events and suggest the possibility of using remote-sensed data without complex processes to estimate GPP such as non-stationary ecological processes.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Habitat Suitability Index for the <i>Todarodes pacificus</i> (Japanese Common Squid) around South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate-induced changes in marine fishery resources in South Korea have been a big concern over the last decades. The climate regime shift has led to not only a change in the dominant fishery resources, but also a decline in fishery landings in several species. The habitat suitability index (HSI) has been widely used to detect and forecast fishing ground formation. In this study, the catch data of the Todarodes pacificus (Japanese Common Squid) and satellite-derived environmental parameters were used to estimate the HSI for the T. pacificus around South Korea. More than 80% of the total catch was found in regions with a sea surface temperature (SST) of 14.91-27.26 degrees C, sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) of 0.05-0.20 m, chlorophyll-a of 0.32-1.35 mg m(-3), and primary production of 480.41-850.18 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Based on these results, the HSI model for T. pacificus was derived. A strong positive relationship (R-2 = 0.9260) was found between the HSI and the fishery landings. The climatological monthly mean HSI from 2002 to 2016 showed several hotspots, coinciding with the spawning and feeding grounds of T. pacificus. This outcome implies that our estimated HSI can yield a reliable prediction of the fishing ground for T. pacificus around South Korea. Furthermore, the approach with the simple HSI model used in this study can be applied elsewhere, and will help us to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of fishery resources.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance obtained by absolute atmospheric correction from satellite images is useful for scientific land applications and analysis ready data (ARD). For Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, many types of radiometric processing methods have been developed, and these images are supported by most commercial and open-source software. However, in the case of KOMPSAT 3/3A images, there are currently no tools or open source resources for obtaining the reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC). In this study, the atmospheric correction module of KOMPSAT 3/3A images is newly implemented to the optical calibration algorithm supported in the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), a remote sensing open-source tool. This module contains the sensor model and spectral response data of KOMPSAT 3A. Aerosol measurement properties, such as AERONET data, can be used to generate TOC reflectance image. Using this module, an experiment was conducted, and the reflection products for TOA and TOC with and without AERONET data were obtained. This approach can be used for building the ARD database for surface reflection by absolute atmospheric correction derived from KOMPSAT 3/3A satellite images.

TI  - Improving the catchment scale wetland modeling using remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an integrated wetland-watershed modeling approach that capitalizes on inundation maps and geospatial data to improve spatial prediction of wetland inundation and assess its prediction uncertainty. We outline problems commonly arising from data preparation and parameterization used to simulate wetlands within a (semi-) distributed watershed model. We demonstrate how wetland inundation can be better captured by the wetland parameters developed from remotely sensed data. We then emphasize assessing model prediction using inundation maps derived from remotely sensed data. This integrated modeling approach is tested using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with an improved riparian wetlands (RWs) extension, for an agricultural watershed in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain, US. This study illustrates how spatially distributed information is necessary to predict inundation of wetlands and hydrologic function at the local landscape scale, where monitoring and conservation decision making take place.

TI  - Estimating Fine Particulate Matter Concentration using GLDAS Hydrometeorological Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is not only affected by anthropogenic emissions, but also intensifies, migrates, decreases by hydrometeorological factors. Therefore, it is essential to understand relationships between the hydrometeorological factors and PM2.5 concentration. In Korea, PM2.5 concentration is measured at the ground observatories and estimated data are given to locations where observatories are not present. In this way, the data is not suitable to represent an area, hence it is impossible to know accurate concentration at such locations. In addition, it is hard to trace migration, intensification, reduction of PM2.5. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between hydrometeorological factors, acquired from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and PM2.5 by means of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). By BMA, we also selected factors that have meaningful relationship with the variation of PM2.5 concentration. 4 PM2.5 concentration models for different seasons were developed using those selected factors, with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Finally, we mapped the result of the model, to show spatial distribution of PM2.5. The model correlated well with the observed PM2.5 concentration (R similar to 0.7; IOA similar to 0.78; RMSE similar to 7.66 mu g/m3). When the models were compared with the observed PM2.5 concentrations at different locations, the correlation coefficients differed (R: 0.32-0.82), although there were similarities in data distribution. The developed concentration map using the models showed its capability in representing temporal, spatial variation of PM2.5 concentration. The result of this study is expected to be able to facilitate researches that aim to analyze sources and movements of PM2.5, if the study area is extended to East Asia.

TI  - Forest Fire Severity Classification Using Probability Density Function and KOMPSAT-3A
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research deals with algorithm for forest fire severity classification using multi-temporal KOMPSAT-3A image to mapping forest fire areas. The recent satellite of the KOMPSAT series, KOMPSAT-3A, demonstrates high resolution and multi-spectral imagery with infrared and high resolution electro-optical bands. However, there is a lack of research to classify forest fire severity using KOMPSAT-3A. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze forest fire severity using KOMPSAT-3A images. In addition, this research used pre-fire and post-fire Sentinel-2 with differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to taking for burn severity distribution map. To test the effectiveness of the proposed procedure on April 4, 2019, Gangneung wildfires were considered as a case study. This research used the probability density function for the classification of forest fire damage severity based on R software, a free software environment of statistical computing and graphics. The burn severities were estimated by changing NDVI before and after forest fire. Furthermore, standard deviation of probability density function was used to calculate the size of each class interval. A total of five distribution of forest fire severity were effectively classified.

TI  - Risk factors of community-onset extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> bacteraemia in South Korea using national health insurance claims data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although it is essential to know the particular causes of antibiotic-resistant infections in the community, there is lack of evidence regarding risk factors for community-onset extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) bacteraemia in South Korea. As such, this study aimed to identify risk factors for community-onset ESBL-KP bacteraemia.Methods: From May 2016 to April 2017, patients with community-onset KP bloodstream infection (BSI) (n = 408) from six sentinel hospitals participating in the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System in South Korea were included in this study. Risk factors of ESBL-KP BSI were assessed. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to identify genes encoding ESBLs and multi-locus sequence typing were performed.Results: Of the 408 patients with community-onset KP BSI, 70 (17%) had ESBL-KP BSI. Admission to a long-term-care hospital within the previous 3 months [odds ratio (OR) 5.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-15.6; P = 0.001], previous use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMT; OR 11.5, 95% CI 2.7-48.6; P = 0.001) or extended-spectrum cephalosporin (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9; P = 0.01), and previous use of a urinary catheter (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.5; P = 0.02) were independent risk factors for community-onset ESBL-KP BSI. ESBL-KP isolates most frequently carried the CTX-M-1 group ESBL (74%, n = 52). The most prevalent sequence type (ST) among the ESBL-KP isolates was ST48 (14%, n = 10). Among non-ESBL-KP isolates, ST23 was most prevalent (21%, n = 70).Conclusion: Previous admission to a long-term-care hospital, use of a urinary catheter and use of TMP/SMT or extended-spectrum cephalosporin within the previous 3 months were identified as risk factors for community-onset ESBL-KP BSI. Strict antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures are needed for long-term-care hospitals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.

TI  - InSAR phase simulation of solid earth tide and its influence on surface deformation monitoring at wide-area scale
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The amplitude of vertical displacement caused by solid earth tide (SET) on the Earth's surface can reach 40 similar to 50 cm and its deformation gradient can reach 2 cm/100 km, which is one of the main influence factors that should be corrected in precision geodetic and geophysical measurements. With the increasing observation swath and accuracy requirements of space-borne interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the influence of SET on InSAR deformation measurements can not be ignored. In this paper, based on the InSAR observation geometry and the Sentinel-1 satellite imaging parameters, the phase of SET displacement is simulated by using the SET displacement theoretical mode. We quantitatively analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of InSAR phase of SET. Moreover, two case studies based on Sentinel-1 SAR images are carried out at the Jianghan Plain in the central China and the Great Plain in the Midwestern United States to explore the SET influence on monitoring large-scale deformation with the InSAR technique. The results show that the contribution of SET displacement has a great influence on interferometric phase and should be corrected in interferometric processing. In the range of 250 km x 250 km, the variation can reach 52 mm for C-band SAR. And the phase of SET displacement varies greatly in the middle and low latitudes (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) but small in the two poles, and its temporal evaluation is obviously periodic. In the two case studies, the interferometric phase is improved after removing the SET phase. Compared with the original interferogram, the standard deviation of the corrected unwrapped phase is reduced by about 29%, which demonstrates potentials of the SET theoretical mode to migrate the SET influence on InSAR deformation measurements. This study is of great significance for understanding the temporal and spatial characteristics of SET InSAR phase and improving the accuracy and reliability of space-borne InSAR for monitoring wide-area surface deformation.

TI  - Marine Oil Slick Detection Based on Multi-Polarimetric Features Matching Method Using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar is an important tool in the effective detection of marine oil spills. In this study, two cases of Radarsat-2 Fine mode quad-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar datasets are exploited to detect a well-known oil seep area that collected over the Gulf of Mexico using the same research area, sensor, and time. A novel oil spill detection scheme based on a multi-polarimetric features model matching method using spectral pan-similarity measure (SPM) is proposed. A multi-polarimetric features curve is generated based on optimal polarimetric features selected using Jeffreys-Matusita distance considering its ability to discriminate between thick and thin oil slicks and seawater. The SPM is used to search for and match homogeneous unlabeled pixels and assign them to a class with the highest similarity to their spectral vector size, spectral curve shape, and spectral information content. The superiority of the SPM for oil spill detection compared to traditional spectral similarity measures is demonstrated for the first time based on accuracy assessments and computational complexity analysis by comparing with four traditional spectral similarity measures, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). Experiment results indicate that the proposed method has better oil spill detection capability, with a higher average accuracy and kappa coefficient (1.5-7.9% and 1-25% higher, respectively) than the four traditional spectral similarity measures under the same computational complexity operations. Furthermore, in most cases, the proposed method produces valuable and acceptable results that are better than the RF, SVM, and DT in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

TI  - Polarization Dependence of Azimuth Cutoff From Quad-Pol SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although basic understanding of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging mechanism of ocean waves has been achieved, challenges still remain. In this paper, a large number of quad-polarized SAR images are analyzed to help assess how the standard SAR imaging transformation applies to all polarization channels. Foremost, the azimuth cutoff, a parameter essentially governed by the detected wave motions, is today solely related to radar configuration and the ocean wave spectrum but not to the polarization configuration. As obtained, the analyses based on quad-polarized Radarsat-2 and Gaofen-3 products document the distinct dependence of azimuth cutoff on polarization and incidence angle. Especially for cross-polarized VH measurements, azimuth cutoff estimates are generally larger than copolarized HH ones, the latter already being larger than values estimated under VV configuration. This trend increases with the incidence angle. The systematic comparisons between SAR measurements and simulations further demonstrate that the present SAR nonlinear transformation may not properly take into account the differing coherence time associated with the multi-polarized observation of ocean scenes. In particular, to reproduce the large azimuth cutoff parameters of cross-polarized images, a reduced coherence time shall be expected. This measurable sensitivity shall enhance the capabilities of polarized SAR systems to precisely derive more ocean surface properties, especially the influence of wave breakers, by combining both the copolarization and cross-polarization measurements.

TI  - A Method of Extracting Mining Disturbance in Arid Grassland Based on Time Series Multispectral Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining will completely change the original landscape pattern of land use, directly destroy the local ecological environment, and even affect the production and life of the nearby residents; therefore, more and more scholars have begun to pay attention to mining disturbance. Previous studies on extracting mining disturbances from temporal multispectral images focused on forest areas with single disturbance form. However, most surface mines in China are concentrated in grassland areas, and in the grassland mining areas in northeastern China, mining disturbances are more difficult to be identified because of their fragile ecological environment and the existence of various other forms of disturbance. In order to clarify the mining disturbance of grassland open stope in ecologically fragile areas in northeastern China, the authors taking Shengli mining area as an example, firstly employs 27 Landsat multi-spectral remote sensing images from 1986 to 2017, and bases the study on the long time series trajectory change characteristics of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). (In order to remove the effects of phenology, cloud and shadow on time series multispectral images, BISE-WT filter is used to filter the original NDVI time series to effectively remove the noise in the time series NDVI data and retain the effective information at the same time). After sample point training, CV threshold (Coefficient of Variation) and Max vegetation threshold are obtained. The Max vegetation threshold (vegetation threshold) is then used to construct the CV-Max disturbance recognition model and extract the disturbance distribution in the study area. Furthermore, using vegetation threshold, NDVI time series trajectory is analyzed to obtain disturbance interannual information and reconstruct disturbance history map. Then, by analyzing the spectral characteristics of typical terrain in the study area, bare coal extraction rules are constructed to extract the distribution of hare coal in the study area. Finally, the topological relationship between bare coal and disturbance area is constructed and a spatial topological overlay analysis is conducted to obtain mining disturbance information. The accuracy verification reveals the extraction accuracy of mining disturbance is 93. 17% (Kappa coefficient= 0. 85) and the extraction accuracy of disturbance interannual information is 83. 35% (Kappa coefficient= 0. 81) respectively. The results show that during the study period, the mining disturbance area accounts for 8. 90% of the total area of the study area in space; in terms of time, the occurrence of mining disturbance concentrated in 2000-2009, during which the mining disturbance pixels accounted for 76. 70% of the total mining disturbance pixels; the years from 1988 to 1998 witness the initial period of land destruction, and in 2000-2005, land destruction increased in the mining area, and in 2006-2009, the land destruction the mining area reached the peak. The proportion trend of mining disturbance pixels in 2010-2017 is relatively flat and continues to be at a low level, and the scope of land damage in mining area is basically stable. In view of the ecologically fragile grassland mining area in northeastern China, the method of extracting mining disturbance information by using NDVI and hare coal spectral features based on time series multispectral images is feasible. The research results can provide data and theoretical method support for the sustainable development of arid and semi-arid grassland surface mining area.

TI  - A Method of Watershed Delineation for Flat Terrain Using Sentinel-2A Imagery and DEM: A Case Study of the Taihu Basin
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate watershed delineation is a precondition for runoff and water quality simulation. Traditional digital elevation model (DEM) may not generate realistic drainage networks due to large depressions and subtle elevation differences in local-scale plains. In this study, we propose a new method for solving the problem of watershed delineation, using the Taihu Basin as a case study. Rivers, lakes, and reservoirs were obtained from Sentinel-2A images with the Canny algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE), rather than from DEM, to compose the drainage network. Catchments were delineated by modifying the flow direction of rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and overland flow, instead of using DEM values. A watershed was divided into the following three types: Lake, reservoir, and overland catchment. A total of 2291 river segments, seven lakes, eight reservoirs, and 2306 subwatersheds were retained in this study. Compared with results from HydroSHEDS and Arc Hydro, the proposed method retains crisscross structures in the topology and prevented erroneous streamlines in large lakes. High-resolution Sentinel-2A images available on the GEE have relatively greater merits than DEMs for precisely representing drainage networks and catchments, especially in the plains area. Because of the higher accuracy, this method can be used as a new solution for watershed division in the plains area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in the Yellow River Estuary, China during the past two decades based on time-series Landsat and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-two years of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in the Yellow River estuary and adjacent sea, China were derived from 532 Landsat and Sentinel 2A/B satellite images. Optimal SPM retrieval model was selected by comparing five state-of-art models using 79 in-situ datasets and recalibrated to ensure consistency among multiple-sensor-derived SPM concentrations. SPM in the estuary, in South Bohai Bay, and Laizhou Bay exhibited distinct temporal variations. 73% and 52% of the interannual and monthly SPM variations near the river mouth were explained by riverine water and sediment discharge, showing impact of the operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir and Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme. Land area accretion and erosion in river delta are associated with SPM variation. Riverine impacts on SPM rapidly declined off-shore because of the rapid deposition of the coarse-grain sediment. Ocean current and wind-wave forces explained high concentrations and intra-annual variations of SPM in the South Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay.

TI  - A Triangle-Oriented SpatialTemporal Phase Unwrapping Algorithm Based on Irrotational Constraints for Time-Series InSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sparse 3-D phase unwrapping (PU) is a significant problem in the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TSInSAR), which is a popular technique on the extraction of the ground deformation. The popular 1-D 2-D strategies in 3-D PU provide an initial temporal estimation of the phase gradients followed by a spatial integration procedure. However, the temporal PU (TPU) solution is prone to be spatially inconsistent, which increases the difficulty of the subsequent spatial PU (SPU). To solve the problem, in this article, an improved global TPU formulation targeting at a totally irrotational phase-gradient field is first proposed, which, however, has a heavy computation complexity, because numerous variables have to be optimized simultaneously. Consequently, a more feasible and practical triangle-oriented TPU (TOTPU) strategy is subsequently suggested, in which a triangle rather than an arc is the elementary unwrapping unit with the spatial irrotational constraints imposed. Furthermore, a residue-minimization algorithm is proposed to settle the problem of the conflict edges introduced by TOTPU, which occurs in just a small portion of arcs. Finally, the improved TPU phase gradients are integrated using an $L<^>{1}$ -norm SPU method with a novel weight function to obtain more reliable unwrapped phases. The proposed triangle-oriented spatialtemporal (TOST) algorithm is validated to be effective and reliable with both the simulated data and the real TerraSAR-X images. Moreover, it can be transplanted into a parallel platform for large-scale applications.

TI  - Extreme rainfall trends of 21 typical urban areas in China during 1998-2015 based on remotely sensed data sets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase of population, many cities are growing in size at a phenomenal rate. Urbanization changes the urban underlying surface, influences the micro-climate, and sometimes affects the local precipitation process. In this study, we investigated the trends of extreme rainfall in China's 21 typical urban areas. Based on a series of daily rainfall and "Urban/built-up" dataset from TMPA 3B42 and MCD12Q1 products in China, trends in extreme precipitation, with the threshold defined as 95th (pre95p) and 99th (pre99p) percentiles of annual rain days during 1998-2015, have been assessed in China, and especially in 21 typical urban areas from 1998 to 2015. The tendency curves in extreme rainfall of different years are presented. In this period, more than 66% regions of China covered by TMPA 3B42 have increasing trends in extreme rainfall with pre95p threshold. The 21 typical urban areas showed different trends-in over half of these areas, upward tendencies in extreme rainfall were observed, particularly in Dalian, Beijing, and Chongqing. Seventeen urban areas showed increasing tendencies in pre95p extreme rainfall days, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results also illustrate that southeastern coastal urban areas of China may have experienced decreasing occurrences in extreme rainfall.

TI  - Real-Time Kinematic Precise Orbit Determination for LEO Satellites Using Zero-Differenced Ambiguity Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growing number of earth observation missions and commercial low-earth-orbit (LEO) constellation plans have provided a strong motivation to get accurate LEO satellite position and velocity information in real time. This paper is devoted to improve the real-time kinematic LEO orbits through fixing the zero-differenced (ZD) ambiguities of onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) phase observations. In the proposed method, the real-time uncalibrated phase delays (UPDs) are estimated epoch-by-epoch via a global-distributed network to support the ZD ambiguity resolution (AR) for LEO satellites. By separating the UPDs, the ambiguities of onboard ZD GPS phase measurements recover their integer nature. Then, wide-lane (WL) and narrow-lane (NL) AR are performed epoch-by-epoch and the real-time ambiguity-fixed orbits are thus obtained. To validate the proposed method, a real-time kinematic precise orbit determination (POD), for both Sentinel-3A and Swarm-A satellites, was carried out with ambiguity-fixed and ambiguity-float solutions, respectively. The ambiguity fixing results indicate that, for both Sentinel-3A and Swarm-A, over 90% ZD ambiguities could be properly fixed with the time to first fix (TTFF) around 25-30 min. For the assessment of LEO orbits, the differences with post-processed reduced dynamic orbits and satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals are investigated. Compared with the ambiguity-float solution, the 3D orbit difference root mean square (RMS) values reduce from 7.15 to 5.23 cm for Sentinel-3A, and from 5.29 to 4.01 cm for Swarm-A with the help of ZD AR. The SLR residuals also show notable improvements for an ambiguity-fixed solution; the standard deviation values of Sentinel-3A and Swarm-A are 4.01 and 2.78 cm, with improvements of over 20% compared with the ambiguity-float solution. In addition, the phase residuals of ambiguity-fixed solution are 0.5-1.0 mm larger than those of the ambiguity-float solution; the possible reason is that the ambiguity fixing separate integer ambiguities from unmodeled errors used to be absorbed in float ambiguities.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in Jungar Banner of China during 2000-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that the exploitation of opencast coal mines has seriously damaged the environments in the semi-arid areas. Vegetation status can reliably reflect the ecological degeneration and restoration in the opencast mining areas in the semi-arid areas. Long-time series MODIS NDVI data are widely used to simulate the vegetation cover to reflect the disturbance and restoration of local ecosystems. In this study, both qualitative (linear regression method and coefficient of variation (CoV)) and quantitative (spatial buffer analysis, and change amplitude and the rate of change in the average NDVI) analyses were conducted to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation during 2000-2017 in Jungar Banner of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, at the large (Jungar Banner and three mine groups) and small (three types of functional areas: opencast coal mining excavation areas, reclamation areas and natural areas) scales. The results show that the rates of change in the average NDVI in the reclamation areas (20%-60%) and opencast coal mining excavation areas (10%-20%) were considerably higher than that in the natural areas (<7%). The vegetation in the reclamation areas experienced a trend of increase (3-5 a after reclamation)-decrease (the sixth year of reclamation)-stability. The vegetation in Jungar Banner has a spatial heterogeneity under the influences of mining and reclamation activities. The ratio of vegetation improvement area to vegetation degradation area in the west, southwest and east mine groups during 2000-2017 was 8:1, 20:1 and 33:1, respectively. The regions with the high CoV of NDVI above 0.45 were mainly distributed around the opencast coal mining excavation areas, and the regions with the CoV of NDVI above 0.25 were mostly located in areas with low (28.8%) and medium-low (10.2%) vegetation cover. The average disturbance distances of mining activities on vegetation in the three mine groups (west, southwest and east) were 800, 800 and 1000 m, respectively. The greater the scale of mining, the farther the disturbance distances of mining activities on vegetation. We conclude that vegetation reclamation will certainly compensate for the negative impacts of opencast coal mining activities on vegetation. Sufficient attention should be paid to the proportional allocation of plant species (herbs and shrubs) in the reclamation areas, and the restored vegetation in these areas needs to be protected for more than 6 a. Then, as the repair time increased, the vegetation condition of the reclamation areas would exceed that of the natural areas.

TI  - Assimilating spatiotemporal MODIS LAI data with a particle filter algorithm for improving carbon cycle simulations for bamboo forest ecosystemsyy
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests are an important part of the forest ecosystem, which has strong carbon sequestration potential and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. As a key parameter for simulating the carbon cycle using forest ecosystem models, the quality of leaf area index (LAI) data has a direct influence on the accuracy of modelling results. Here, we used the particle filter (PF) algorithm and PROSAIL model to assimilate MODIS LAI products, which were then used to drive a boreal ecosystem productivity simulator model to simulate the bamboo forest carbon cycle. The results showed that the relationship between the assimilated and observed LAI values was very significant, with an R-2 of 0.95 and an RMSE of 0.28, greatly improving the precision of MODIS LAI products. The R-2 values for the gross primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and total ecosystem respiration (TER) simulated by the assimilated LAI values and observed carbon fluxes were 0.65, 0.45 and 0.70, respectively, and the RMSE values were 1.10 g C m(-2) day(-1), 1.00 g C m(-2) day(-1) and 0.35 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Compared with the results of the carbon cycle simulated by nonassimilated LAI, the R-2 values of the GPP, NEE and TER values that were simulated by assimilated LAI increased by 27.5%, 45.2% and 6.1%, and the RMSE values decreased by 29.9%, 23.7% and 22.2%, respectively. Therefore, coupling the PF and PROSAIL models can greatly improve the simulation precision for the large-scale bamboo forest carbon cycle. This study laid the foundation for simulating the carbon cycle over a large-scale bamboo forest based on low-resolution data in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Simple Adaptation of Variable Selection Software for Regression Models to Select Variables in Nested Error Regression Models
T2  - SANKHYA-SERIES B-APPLIED AND INTERDISCIPLINARY STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data users often apply standard regression model selection criteria to select variables in nested error regression models, which are widely used in small area estimation. We demonstrate through a Monte Carlo simulation study that this practice may lead to selection of a non-optimal or incorrect model. To assist data users who wish to use standard regression software, we propose a transformation of the data so that transformed data follow a standard regression model. Thus, variable selection software available for the standard regression model can be directly applied to the transformed data. We illustrate our methodology using survey and satellite data for corn and soybeans in 12 Iowa counties.

TI  - Influence of Variable Selection and Forest Type on Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is a major store of carbon and plays a crucial role in the regional and global carbon cycle. Accurate forest biomass assessment is important for monitoring and mapping the status of and changes in forests. However, while remote sensing-based forest biomass estimation in general is well developed and extensively used, improving the accuracy of biomass estimation remains challenging. In this paper, we used China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data in combination with three algorithms, either the linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), or extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to establish biomass estimation models based on forest type. In the modeling process, two methods of variable selection, e.g., stepwise regression and variable importance-base method, were used to select optimal variable subsets for LR and machine learning algorithms (e.g., RF and XGBoost), respectively. Comfortingly, the accuracy of models was significantly improved, and thus the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Variable selection is very important for improving the performance of models, especially for machine learning algorithms, and the influence of variable selection on XGBoost is significantly greater than that of RF. (2) Machine learning algorithms have advantages in aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, and the XGBoost and RF models significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the LR models. Despite that the problems of overestimation and underestimation were not fully eliminated, the XGBoost algorithm worked well and reduced these problems to a certain extent. (3) The approach of AGB modeling based on forest type is a very advantageous method for improving the performance at the lower and higher values of AGB. Some conclusions in this paper were probably different as the study area changed. The methods used in this paper provide an optional and useful approach for improving the accuracy of AGB estimation based on remote sensing data, and the estimation of AGB was a reference basis for monitoring the forest ecosystem of the study area.

TI  - Monitoring Intra-annual Spatiotemporal Changes in Urban Heat Islands in 1449 Cities in China Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to accurately study the intra-annual spatiotemporal variation in the surface urban heat island intensities (SUHIIs) in 1449 cities in China. First, China was divided into five environmental regions. Then, the SUHIIs were accurately calculated based on the modified definitions of the city extents and their corresponding nearby rural areas. Finally, we explored the spatiotemporal variation of the mean, maximum, and minimum values, and ranges of SUHIIs from several aspects. The results showed that larger annual mean daytime SUHIIs occurred in hot-humid South China and cold-humid northeastern China, and the smallest occurred in arid and semiarid west China. The seasonal order of the SUHIIs was summer > spring > autumn > winter in all the temperate regions except west China. The SUHIIs were obviously larger during the rainy season than the dry season in the tropical region. Nevertheless, significant differences were not observed between the two seasons within the rainy or dry periods. During the daytime, the maximum SUHIIs mostly occurred in summer in each region, while the minimum occurred in winter. A few cold island phenomena existed during the nighttime. The maximum SUHIIs were generally significantly positively correlated with the minimum SUHIIs during the daytime, nighttime and all-day in all environmental regions throughout the year and the four seasons. Moreover, significant correlation scarcely existed between the daytime and nighttime ranges of the SUHIIs. In addition, the daytime SUHIIs were also insignificantly correlated with the nighttime SUHIIs in half of the cases.

TI  - Temporal stage and method selection of tree species classification based on GF-2 remote sensing image
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - It's important to master tree species composition and distribution in forests for the study of forest ecosystems. To promote the application of domestic Gaofen data in the classification of tree species and to explore the effects of different combining images, classification features and classifier on tree species classification results, three kinds of single temporal data and four kinds of multi-temporal data were constructed. Based on three GF-2 images, according to the multi-scale segmentation, C5.0 feature optimization as well as two classifiers including support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), we finished the object-based classification of eight tree species of different temporal and feature dimensions respectively, and finally achieved good results with overall accuracy between 63.5% and 83.5% and the Kappa coefficient between 0.57 and 0.81. The results showed that the choice of temporal stage would affect the classification results. The results based on multi-temporal were generally better than that on single temporal stage. There were obvious precision differences between different image combinations of multi-temporal as well as different single temporal stage. It is notable that feature optimization played a positive role in the improvement of classification accuracy. SVM was relatively stable across different temporal and feature dimensions, which should be given priority when single temporal and classification features are difficult to distinguish tree species directly, while it should be noted that SVM was easy to overfit. RF was not easy to overfit, but it was more dependent on the quality of classification features and would get good results under favorable image combination.

TI  - Estimation of health and economic benefits based on ozone exposure level with high spatial-temporal resolution by fusing satellite and station observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ozone pollution has become more and more serious in China. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated the correlation between short-term ozone exposure and several health risks including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality. In this study, the daily ozone exposure levels with 10 km x 10 km resolution were estimated based on satellite data derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the monitoring data. The health impacts for potential decrease in the daily ozone concentration and the corresponding economic benefits in 2016 were estimated by applying the environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) model. By reducing the daily maximum 8-h average concentration of ozone to 100 mu g/m(3), the estimated avoided all-cause mortalities were 120 x 103 (95% confidence interval (CI): 67 x 10(3), 160 x 10(3)) cases and the correspondingly economic benefits ranged from 36 to 64 billion CNY using amended human capital (AHC) and willingness to pay (WTP) method in 2016. If the daily maximum 8-h average concentration of ozone were rolled back to 70 mu g/m(3), the estimated avoided all-cause mortalities were 160 x 10(3) (95% CI: 98 x 10(3), 230 x 10(3)) cases and economic benefits ranged from 54 to 95 billion CNY based on AHC and WTP methods.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We had developed in preceding study a classification model for the Korean pine and Larch with an accuracy of 98 percent using Hyperion and Sentinel-2 satellite images, texture information, and geometric information as the first step for tree species mapping in the inaccessible North Korea. Considering a share of major tree species in North Korea, the classification model needs to be expanded as it has a large share of Oak(295%), Pine (12.7%), Fir (82%), and as well as Larch (175%) and Korean pine (5.8%). In order to classify 5 major tree species, national forest type map of South Korea was used to build 11,039 training and 2,330 validation data. Scntinel-2 data was used to derive spectral information, and PlanetScope data was used to generate texture information. Geometric information was built from SRTM DEM data. As a machine learning algorithm, Random forest was used. As a result, the overall accuracy of classification was 80% with 0.80 kappa statistics. Based on the training data and the classification model constructed through this study, we will extend the application to Mt. Baekdu and North and South Goseong areas to confirm the applicability of tree species classification on the Korean Peninsula.

TI  - Retrieval and Validation of Cloud Top Temperature from the Geostationary Satellite INSAT-3D
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of cloud top temperature (CTT) and its diurnal variation is highly reliant on high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data, which is lacking over the Indian region. An algorithm has been developed for detection of clouds and retrieval of CTT from the geostationary satellite INSAT-3D. These retrievals are validated (inter-compared) with collocated in-situ (satellite) measurements with specific intent to generate climate-quality data. The cloud detection algorithm employs nine different tests, in accordance with solar illumination, satellite angle and surface type conditions to generate pixel-resolution cloud mask. Validation of cloud mask with cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) shows that probability of detection (POD) of cloudy (clear) sky is 81% (85%), with 83% hit rate. The algorithm is also implemented on similar channels of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides 88% (83%) POD of cloudy (clear) sky, with 86% hit rate. CTT retrieval is done at the pixel level, for all cloud pixels, by employing appropriate methods for various types of clouds. Comparison of CTT with radiosonde and cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations (CALIPSO) shows mean absolute error less than 3%. The study also examines sensitivity of retrieved CTT to the cloud classification scheme and retrieval criteria. Validation results and their close agreements with those of similar satellites demonstrate the reliability of the retrieved product for climate studies.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This data article reports the global datasets of land surface state changes including daily maximum and minimum temperature, diurnal temperature range, surface precipitation, snow cover, soil moisture and outgoing longwave radiation associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which are related to the research article entitled "Variation of Global Diurnal Temperature Range Associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation" published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics by Lin and Qian (2019). The changes of surface air temperature and diurnal temperature range are calculated from two datasets: the Berkeley surface air temperature and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC) surface air temperature. The change of surface precipitation is derived from the NOAA CPC daily surface precipitation. The change of snow cover is calculated from the MODIS satellite data. The change of soil moisture is derived from the European Space Agency combined satellite data. The change of outgoing longwave radiation is calculated from NOAA satellite measurements. All of the data are stored in separate netcdf files and deposited at PANGAEA. These datasets can be used as observational benchmarks for evaluating the MJO simulations in global climate models, and in studies of MJO's impacts on global physical systems, public health, and ecosystems.

AB  - Background We previously reported a prospective study showing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with increased breast skin thickening during and 6 weeks post-radiation therapy (RT), and now report ALND's long-term impact at 1 year. Methods Among 66 women who received whole breast RT after lumpectomy, objective ultrasound measurements of epidermal thickness over four quadrants of the treated breast were measured at five time points: before RT, week 6 of RT, and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-RT. Skin thickness ratio (STRA) was generated by normalizing for corresponding measurements of the contralateral breast. Results A total of 2,436 ultrasound images were obtained. Among 63 women with evaluable data at 1 year, mean STRA significantly increased at 6 months (absolute mean increase of 65%, SD 0.054), and remained elevated at 1 year post-RT (absolute mean increase of 44%, SD 0.048). In multivariable analysis, ALND compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy, longer interval between surgery and RT, increased baseline STRA, and Caucasian race predicted for more severe changes in STRA at 1 year compared to baseline (all P < .05). Conclusions In the setting of whole breast RT, our findings suggest that ALND has long-term repercussions on breast skin thickening.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a common surgical procedure for cutaneous melanoma. Our aim was to evaluate risk factors for early post-operative complications after SLN biopsy and to examine the impact of complications on health care resource utilisation.Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study including all adult patients who underwent a SLN biopsy for cutaneous melanoma in the Stockholm region from 2006 to 2014. Data of patient and tumour characteristics were collected from medical records, as well as information on complications and outpatient visits within 30 days from surgery. Risk factors were evaluated through logistic regression.Results: Out of 886 patients who underwent SLN biopsy during the study period, 109 (12.3%) had one or several post-operative complications. The most common complication was a wound infection (7.7%), followed by seroma (6.4%). The risk of a post-operative complication was increased in patients with diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-24.6), who had inguinal location of SLN (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.3), who were male (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) and who had ulceration of the primary tumour (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.6). Individuals with post-operative complications had more visits to the outpatient clinic (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Complications after SLN biopsy affect 12.3% of patients. Our results suggest that patients with diabetes, who had inguinal SLN biopsy and who were male have increased risk, and this might warrant more intense post-operative surveillance.

TI  - Drift angle compensation-based adaptive line-of-sight path following for autonomous underwater vehicle
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to solve the problem of poor tracking in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) that are operating based on traditional line-of-sight (LOS) method when tracking different paths in a complex marine environment. An adaptive-LOS (ALOS) guidance law with drift angle compensation is proposed, and is employed to calculate the AUV's desired course (direction of velocity) and heading. First, an appropriate look-ahead distance is derived by the ALOS guidance law in consideration of the predefined path curvature, real-time tracking error and speed of the AUV. Subsequently, proper compensation is provided with respect to the actual drift angle. Compared with traditional LOS operation, this method flexibly adjusts to a suitable look-ahead distance while considering many related factors, providing a better path following performance. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of this method.

TI  - Elevation-dependent decline in vegetation greening rate driven by increasing dryness based on three satellite NDVI datasets on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern high-latitude regions, amplified vegetation greening has been observed due to a larger warming rate than the rate at low latitudes. Similarly, on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the warming rate is larger at high elevation than that at low elevation. Our results show that large discrepancies exist in the trends in the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000-2012, indicating the importance of using three satellite-derived NDVI datasets (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and SPOT) in the evaluation of vegetation activity on the TP. Based on three NDVI datasets, during 2000-2012, rising temperature drove the regional vegetation greening across the TP, but the vegetation greening rate contrasted with that of elevation-dependent warming. Here, with simultaneous use of climate observation data, we found that declining water availability with rising elevation may restrict and offset the positive effect of rising temperature on vegetation greening, resulting in the declining rate of vegetation greening as elevation increases on the TP. Our results highlight the significant influence of precipitation on elevation-dependent changes in vegetation activity in rapidly warming mountain ecosystems.

TI  - A Fast, Three-Dimensional, Indirect Geolocation Method Using IAGM and DSM Data without GCPs for Spaceborne SAR Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine the geolocation of a pixel for spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, traditional indirect geolocation methods can cause great computational complexity. In this paper, a fast, three-dimensional, indirect geolocation method without ground control points (GCPs) is presented. First, the Range-Doppler (RD) geolocation model with all the equations in the Earth-centered rotating (ECR) coordinate system is introduced. By using an iterative analytical geolocation method (IAGM), the corner point locations of a quadrangle SAR image on the Earth's surface are obtained. Then, a three-dimensional (3D) grid can be built by utilizing the digital surface model (DSM) data in this quadrangle. Through the proportional relationship for every pixel in the 3D grid, the azimuth time can be estimated, which is the key to decreasing the calculation time of the Doppler centroid. The results show that the proposed method is about 12 times faster than the traditional method, and that it maintains geolocation accuracy. After acquiring the precise azimuth time, it is easy to obtain the range location. Therefore, the spaceborne SAR image can be geolocated to the Earth surface precisely based on the high-resolution DSM data.

TI  - Quantifying PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass concentration and particle radius using satellite data and an optical-mass conversion algorithm
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although satellite-based approaches have been developed and adopted for estimating the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with promising accuracy, few studies have considered mass concentration and particle radius simultaneously, even though particle size is significant for human health impacts. We developed a satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval method using optical-mass relationships via aerosol microphysical characteristics. Satellite data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, combined with parameters from meteorological reanalysis, were processed to calculate particle radii and retrieve PM2.5 mass concentrations over China in 2017. Our study is the first to identify the spatial pattern of mean PM2.5 radius over China, which was validated against observations from AERONET (RMSE = 0.11 pm). Mean particle size over eastern China is smaller than in the west, depicting a clear bifurcation across the country, especially in summertime. This finding is attributed to variations in topography, meteorology, land use and population density, which affects the properties of emitted aerosols as well as their fate and transport. A statistically significant correlation (R = 0.82) was observed between estimated and measured annual PM2.5, with RMSE = 9.25 pg/m(3), MAE = 6.98 pg/m(3), MBE = 1.98 pg/m(3) and RPE = 17.69% (N = 1270). The spatiotemporal distributions of resulting PM2.5 are consistent with previous findings, indicating the effectiveness and applicability of our method. Our approach quantifies PM2.5 mass concentrations without introducing regionally-specific fitting parameters, which can be efficiently applied across various spatial and temporal domains.

TI  - Multi-Layer Abstraction Saliency for Airport Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of airports using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has attracted considerable attention. Traditional methods easily result in inaccurate detection due to the complex scenes and multiplicative speckle noise. Therefore, airport detection from SAR images is still a challenging task. In order to limit the influence of unnecessary and attractive details and noise, we propose a multi-layer abstraction saliency model for airport detection in SAR images in this paper. Specifically, we first obtain airport support regions and superpixels in the first layer. According to the dis-similarity between foreground and background superpixels, airport components are explored by iterative refinement for each airport support region in the second layer. In the third layer, airport adobes are produced by clustering. Based on the characteristics of an airport in SAR images, we propose three saliency cues, including local contrast (LC), adobe deformation (AD), and global uniqueness (GU), to obtain adobe-level saliency. Furthermore, we assign saliency to each pixel by Bayesian inference. Finally, we can explore airport location using integrated saliency map. The proposed approach is tested on an airport data set collected from Gaofen-3, TerraSAR, and RadarSat. Our method achieves 88.89% detection rate. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and outperforms the previously airport detection methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/NengyuanLiu/MyAirportSaliency.

TI  - PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE INFLUENCE OF FY-4 LIGHTNING DATA ASSIMILATION ON PRECIPITATION PREDICTIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the lightning mapping imager on hoard the Fengyun-4 meteorological satellite (FY-4) were used to study the assimilation of lightning data and its influence on precipitation predictions. We first conducted a quality control check on the events observed by the first Fengyun-4 satellite (FY-4A) lightning mapping imager, after which the noise points were removed from the lightning distribution. The subsequent distribution was more consistent with the spatial distribution and range of ground-based observations and precipitation. We selected the radar reflectivity, which was closely related to the lightning frequency, as the parameter to assimilate the lightning data and utilized a large sample of lightning frequency and radar reflectivity data from the eastern United States provided by Vaisala. Based on statistical analysis, we found the empirical relationship between the lightning frequency and radar reflectivity and established a look-up table between them. We converted the lightning event data into radar reflectivity data and found that the converted reflectivity and composite reflectivity of ground-based radar observations showed high consistency. We further assimilated the lightning data into the model, adjusted the model cloud analysis process and adjusted the model hydrometeor field by using the lightning data. A rainstorm weather process that occurred on August 8, 2017 in south China was used for the numerical forecast experiment, and three experiments were designed for comparison and analysis: a control experiment, an experiment without the assimilation of FY-4 lightning data (NoLig), and an experiment with the assimilation of FY-4 lightning data (Lig). The results show that after assimilating the FY-4A lightning data, the accuracies of the intensity, central location and range of the precipitation predicted by the Lig experiment were obviously superior to those predicted by the control and NoLig experiments, and the effect was especially obvious in the short-term (1-2 hour) forecast. The studies in this paper highlight the application value and potential of FY-4 lightning data in precipitation predictions.

TI  - The GA-BPNN-Based Evaluation of Cultivated Land Quality in the PSR Framework Using Gaofen-1 Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and efficient assessment of cultivated land quality (CLQ) using remote sensing technology is of great significance for protecting cultivated land. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate CLQ estimates using the current satellite-driven approaches in the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework, owing to the limitations of linear models and CLQ spectral indices. In order to improve the estimation accuracy of CLQ, this study used four evaluation models (the traditional linear model; partial least squares regression, PLSR; back propagation neural network, BPNN; and BPNN with genetic algorithm optimization, GA-BPNN) to evaluate CLQ for determining the accurate evaluation model. In addition, the optimal satellite-derived indicator in the land state index was selected among five vegetation indices (the normalized vegetation index, NDVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI; modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, MSAVI; perpendicular vegetation index, PVI; and soil-adjusted vegetation index, SAVI) to improve the prediction accuracy of CLQ. This study was conducted in Conghua District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data. The prediction accuracies from the traditional linear model, PLSR, BPNN, and GA-BPNN were compared using observations. The results demonstrated that (1) compared with other models (the traditional linear model: R-2 = 0.14 and RMSE = 91.53; PLSR: R-2 = 0.33 and RMSE = 74.58; BPNN: R-2 = 0.50 and RMSE = 61.75), the GA-BPNN model based on EVI in the land state index provided the most accurate estimates of CLQ, with the R-2 of 0.59 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 56.87, indicating a nonlinear relationship between CLQ and the prediction indicator; and (2) the GA-BPNN-based evaluation approach of CLQ in the PSR framework was driven to map CLQ of the study area using the GF-1 data, leading to an RMSE of 61.44 at the regional scale, implying that the GA-BPNN-based evaluation approach has the potential to map CLQ over large areas. This study provides an important reference for the high-accuracy prediction of CLQ based on remote sensing technology.

TI  - Retrieval of Global Orbit Drift Corrected Land Surface Temperature from Long-term AVHRR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors provide a valuable data source for generating long-term global land surface temperature (LST). However, changes in the observation time that are caused by satellite orbit drift restrict their wide application. Here, a generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm was implemented to retrieve the LST from the time series AVHRR data. Afterwards, a novel orbit drift correction (ODC) algorithm, which was based on the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model and Bayesian optimization algorithm, was also proposed for normalizing the estimated LST to the same local time. This ODC algorithm is pixel-based and it only needs one observation every day. The resulting LSTs from the six-year National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-14 satellite data were validated while using Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) in-situ measurements. The average accuracies for LST retrieval varied from -0.4 K to 2.0 K over six stations and they also depended on the viewing zenith angle and season. The simulated data illustrate that the proposed ODC method can improve the LST estimate at a similar magnitude to the accuracy of the LST retrieval, i.e., the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the corrected LSTs were 1.3 K, 2.2 K, and 3.1 K for the LST with a retrieval RMSE of 1 K, 2 K, and 3 K, respectively. This method was less sensitive to the fractional vegetation cover (FVC), including the FVC retrieval error, size, and degree of change within a neighboring area, which suggested that it could be easily updated by applying other LST expression models. In addition, ground validation also showed an encouraging correction effect. The RMSE variations of LST estimation that were introduced by ODC were within +/- 0.5 K, and the correlation coefficients between the corrected LST errors and original LST errors could approach 0.91.

TI  - Characterization of the Kinematics of Three Bears Landslide in Northern California Using L-band InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision monitoring of landslides is essential for understanding their kinematics and reducing landslide induced damage. The spatiotemporal deformation variations of the Three Bears landslide in northern California have not been systematically monitored and interpreted. In this study, we applied advanced time-series InSAR analysis methods to characterize the kinematics of the landslide covering two periods (2007-2011 and 2015-2017) with multi-track synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from L-band ALOS PALSAR-1/2 satellites. Our results show that the Three Bears landslide has been moving consistently, with the Line of Sight (LOS) deformation rate exceeding 300 mm/yr from 2007 to 2011 and around 250 mm/yr from 2015 to 2017. The east-west and vertical deformation components were inverted by integrating ascending and descending ALOS PALSAR-2 interferograms during the 2015-2017 period, indicating that the landslide was dominated by eastward movement and in a continuous deformation stage. Down-slope landslide motions observed from adjacent satellite tracks with slightly different radar look vectors were used to verify the accuracy of InSAR-derived results. Comparison between linearly detrended InSAR displacements and precipitation records indicate that the landslide tends to accelerate during the wet seasons. The results could allow us to better understand the kinematics of the landslide and provide significant evidence for evaluating the potential for catastrophic failure and the threat posed by such failure to human life and property. Combined with a proper geotechnical/geomechanical model, the results would also facilitate the design and implementation of mitigation measures.

TI  - Investigation on the presence of Dioxins in the Sicilian Sheep's milk
T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Our studies were conducted in 2016 and several sicilian sheep farms were involved. The goal of this research was to evaluate the possible use of sheep as a "sentinel" body to be used as a biological indicator for environmental biomonitoring of dioxins. For the determination of dioxins in sheep's milk was used a method on high-resolution gas chromatography along with a high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) in order to evaluate the existence of dioxins with concentrations exceeding the limits imposed by the EC Regulation 1881/2006. A total of 200 samples were analyzed, of which 14 samples exceeded the limits imposed by the EC Regulation 1881/2006: 3.0 pg/g fat sum of dioxins (WHO.PCDD/F-TEQ). It is conceivable that the proximity to high anthropization areas and industrialization, may have a positive influence on the propagation of dioxins in the environment having been detected values exceeding the allowed limit. The samples with low dioxin concentrations were analyzed, with values not exceeding the prescribed limit.

TI  - MODIS Image-derived ice surface temperature assessment in the Southern Patagonian Icefield
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice surface temperature (IST) is one of the most relevant parameters when it comes to estimating the effects of climate change on glaciers. This study aims to estimate the IST for the Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI) during the 2001-2016 period and, in so doing, to contribute to the assessment of the MOD11A1 product in this area. We evaluated IST performance by comparing it with that of automatic weather stations (AWSs). In addition, the glaciological significance of the results is presented through 1) IST trends, 2) annual IST anomalies, 3) IST behavior at different altitudes and orientations and 4) a comparison with Santa Cruz River flow records. The correlation coefficients obtained between the IST and AWSs ranged between 0.66 and 0.85. In addition, we report on the mean absolute differences between them, ranging between 0.6 +/- 3.6 degrees C and 9.4 +/- 1.9 degrees C. In this sense, we observed the lowest differences at the AWSs that were located in a homogeneous environment. Stated in glaciological terms: 1) only 1% of the pixels had a statically significant IST trend (p-value <= 0.05): between 0.01 and 0.05 degrees C/month; 2) we found that most of the IST anomalies ranged between -1 and 1 degrees C throughout the period of this study; 3) the results suggest that the altimetric gradient was the most influential variable of the IST, mostly in north-oriented glaciers; and 4) the SPI IST showed an annual periodicity, which, in turn, shows a high correlation with the Santa Cruz River flow (R = 0.86). This study is the first in estimating the SPI's IST and contributes to enhance our knowledge of glacier dynamics and, therefore, the management of the water resource. Despite this, some MOD11 filtering is required in regions with high cloud cover frequency.

TI  - How canopy shadow affects invasive plant species classification in high spatial resolution remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant invasions can result in serious threats for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Reliable maps at very-high spatial resolution are needed to assess invasions dynamics. Field sampling approaches could be replaced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to derive such maps. However, pixel-based species classification at high spatial resolution is highly affected by within-canopy variation caused by shadows. Here, we studied the effect of shadows on mapping the occurrence of invasive species using UAV-based data. MaxEnt one-class classifications were applied to map Acacia dealbata, Ulex europaeus and Pinus radiata in central-south Chile using combinations of UAV-based spectral (RGB and hyperspectral), 2D textural and 3D structural variables including and excluding shaded canopy pixels during model calibration. The model accuracies in terms of area under the curve (AUC), Cohen's Kappa, sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were examined in sunlit and shaded canopies separately. Bootstrapping was used for validation and to assess statistical differences between models. Our results show that shadows significantly affect the accuracies obtained with all types of variables. The predictions in shaded areas were generally inaccurate, leading to misclassification rates between 65% and 100% even when shadows were included during model calibration. The exclusion of shaded areas from model calibrations increased the predictive accuracies (especially in terms of sensitivity), decreasing false positives. Spectral and 2D textural information showed generally higher performances and improvements when excluding shadows from the analysis. Shadows significantly affected the model results obtained with any of the variables used, hence the exclusion of shadows is recommended prior to model calibration. This relatively easy pre-processing step enhances models for classifying species occurrences using high-resolution spectral imagery and derived products. Finally, a shadow simulation showed differences in the ideal acquisition window for each species, which is important to plan revisit campaigns.

TI  - Ice Floe Tracker: An algorithm to automatically retrieve Lagrangian trajectories via feature matching from moderate-resolution visual imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of sea ice along marginal ice zones suggest a strong coupling between sea ice transport and the underlying ocean turbulent eddy field. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 in provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Trends in the Sea Surface Temperature in the Sea of Okhotsk and Adjacent Basins Based on the Satellite Data in 1998-2017
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of monthly mean sea surface temperatures in the Sea of Okhotsk and adjacent basins have been formed from 20-year-long satellite measurements (1998-2017). Coefficients of the linear trend are determined in each spatial cell with a size of 2 x 2 km using the method of least squares. Such coefficients are calculated for each month separately, for the annual mean values, and for seasonally average values of the temperature. The relationship of these coefficients with the observed decrease in the ice cover in the Sea of Okhotsk in the last 20 years has been analyzed. It is shown that the temperature of the surface layer in this basin decreases; the most significant decrease is observed in its northern and western parts. This trend is especially pronounced in the spring, which may be due to a decrease in the ice cover and stronger water cooling due to the winter convection when the area of ice cover decreases.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping using Digital Earth Australia
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study establishes the use of the Earth Observation Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM) to generate land cover and change classifications based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and environmental variables (EVs) available within, or accessible from, Geoscience Australia's (GA) Digital Earth Australia (DEA). Classifications representing the LCCS Level 3 taxonomy (8 categories representing semi-(natural) and/or cultivated/managed vegetation or natural or artificial bare or water bodies) were generated for two time periods and across four test sites located in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. This was achieved by progressively and hierarchically combining existing time-static layers relating to (a) the extent of artificial surfaces (urban, water) and agriculture and (b) annual summaries of EVs relating to the extent of vegetation (fractional cover) and water (hydroperiod, intertidal area, mangroves) generated through DEA. More detailed classifications that integrated information on, for example, forest structure (based on vegetation cover (%) and height (m); time-static for 2009) and hydroperiod (months), were subsequently produced for each time-step. The overall accuracies of the land cover classifications were dependent upon those reported for the individual input layers, with these ranging from 80% (for cultivated, urban and artificial water) to over 95% (for hydroperiod and fractional cover). The changes identified include mangrove dieback in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria and reduced dam water levels and an associated expansion of vegetation in Lake Ross, Burdekin. The extent of detected changes corresponded with those observed using time-series of RapidEye data (2014 to 2016; for the Gulf of Carpentaria) and Google Earth imagery (2009-2016 for Lake Ross). This use case demonstrates the capacity and a conceptual framework to implement EODESM within DEA and provides countries using the Open Data Cube (ODC) environment with the opportunity to routinely generate land cover maps from Landsat or Sentinel-1/2 data, at least annually, using a consistent and internationally recognised taxonomy.

TI  - Worldview foundations of Yakut ritual dance "bitii"
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses a ritual dance called "bitii" in the context of mythical, ritual, and worldview ideas of the Yakut people. It studies the semantic of the ritual dance, the symbolic meaning of movements, postures, ritual gestures, all of which are parts a unique language based in the worldview foundations of the people. The article considers the "bitii" dance in its ethnographic and semantic aspects as an inherent part of the ritual complex, and examines the meaning of this dance in the life of the Yakut people. This paper uncovers how a ritual dance is embedded into the inner works of mythological thinking and how this corresponds with religious ideas and worldviews of Eurasian nomads The topic is relevant as it is necessary to preserve archaic examples of the dance folklore of the Yakut, people with a complex multi-ethnic origin and known as the northernmost Turkic people, for future studies and posterity. The article presents a ritual dance as a specific form of plastic and dance manifestations of spiritual legacy of the ethnos.

TI  - Comparison of Aerosol Vertical Distribution Based on CALIPSO Satellite and Ground Observation Data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the vertical distribution characteristics of aerosols in the Langfang city on clean, hazy, and cloudy days based on the ground-based lidar and CALIFSO satellite data and determine the possible sources of pollutants. The analysis results denote that the extinction coefficient profiles of the two lidar inversions arc consistent under clear, hazy, and cloudy conditions and that the correlation coefficient is large. Small amounts of dust aerosols below 2 km can be observed on clear days, with an extinction coefficient of less than 0.2 km(-1), a depolarization ratio concentrated in 0.10-0.30, a color ratio concentrated in 0.5-1.0, high particle non-sphericity, and large particle size. Below 500 m, there exists a collection of fine particles exhibiting high sphericity on hazy days, with a maximum extinction coefficient of greater than 2 km(-1), small depolarization and small color ratios. Additionally, the polluted continental aerosols and the polluted dust arc observed to simultaneously exist. On cloudy clays, the extinction coefficient is large at the vertical height, where cloud layers appear, and the profile shows a sharp peak. The depolarization ratio is mostly less than 0.02, and the color ratio is concentrated at approximately 0.10. Furthermore, a small amount of dust aerosols is distributed under the influence of an updraft below 7 km.

AB  - The spectral sensitivities of FY-4A/GIIRS (Geosynchronous Interferometric Infrared Sounder) in various atmospheric conditions are analyzed using Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM). On that basis, the information contents of temperature, humidity and ozone in FY-4A/GIIRS are measured by Entropy Reduction (ER) and the Degrees of Freedom for Signal (DFS) which could evaluate the retrieve capabilities for atmosphere parameters of FY-4A/GIIRS. The results are shown as follows: (1) The sensitivity of temperature and humidity in long wave band of GIIRS are both varied with atmosphere condition, while there is little difference in the sensitivity of ozone under different atmospheric conditions. (2) The application potential for FY-4A/GIIRS with temperature, humidity and ozone profiles inversion is preliminary revealed. Therefore, temperature information content of FY-4A/GIIRS is the largest, followed by humidity under the US Standard atmosphere. (3) The information content of temperature and water vapor in tropical atmosphere is bigger than middle latitude atmosphere.

TI  - ELEGY IN THE RUSSIAN SINGERS' REPERTOIRE AS A FORM OF EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL MENTALITY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the relationship of the genre of vocal elegy with the Russian mentality. One of the distinctive features of the Russian mentality is its contradictive character and ambivalence of the Russian soul. Concentrating predominantly on sad aspects of life is characteristic of the Russians' worldview. Suffering has a special meaning in the system of their spiritual values. Compassion, sympathy, confessionalism and tenderness are inherent to the Russian national character. The author shows that the distinctive features of the Russian worldview found expression in the genre of elegy, both poetic and musical ones. For many decades, the elegy songs of the Russian composers have been enthralling the audiences of literary-musical salons and concert halls. They are popular among both professional singers and amateurs. A tendency for elegiac pondering is illustrative of the artistic individuality of the great Russian singer Feodor Chaliapin, whose chamber repertoire included elegies of various composers. The genre is neither ignored by the musicians of the 20th-21st cs., as evidenced by various concert programs. The study involved materials from the composer Zara Levina's archive.

TI  - Wetland Loss Identification and Evaluation Based on Landscape and Remote Sensing Indices in Xiong'an New Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a critical role in the environment. With the impacts of climate change and human activities, wetlands have suffered severe droughts and the area declined. For the wetland restoration and management, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of wetland loss. In this study, the Xiong'an New Area was selected as the study area. For this site, we built a new method to identify the patterns of wetland loss integrated the landscape variation and wetland elements loss based on seven land use maps and Landsat series images from the 1980s to 2015. The calculated results revealed the following: (1) From the 1980s to 2015, wetland area decreased by 40.94 km(2), with a reduction of 13.84%. The wetland loss was divided into three sub stages: the wet stage from 1980s to 2000, the reduction stage from 2000 to 2019 and the recovering stage from 2009 to 2015. The wetland area was mainly replaced by cropland and built-up land, accounting for 98.22% in the overall loss. The maximum wetland area was 369.43 km(2) in the Xiong'an New Area. (2) From 1989 to 2015, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and soil moisture monitoring index (SMMI) showed a degradation, a slight improvement and degradation trend, respectively. The significantly degraded areas were 80.40 km(2), 20.71 km(2) and 80.05 km(2) by the detection of the remote sensing indices, respectively. The wetland loss was mainly dominated by different elements in different periods. The water area (NDWI), soil moisture (SMMI) and vegetation (NDVI) caused the wetland loss in the three sub-periods (1980s-2000, 2000-2009 and 2009-2015). (3) According to the analysis in the landscape and elements, the wetland loss was summarized with three patterns. In the pattern 1, as water became scarce, the plants changed from aquatic to terrestrial species in sub-region G, which caused the wetland vegetation loss. In the pattern 2, due to the water area decrease in sub-regions B, C, D and E, the soil moisture decreased and then the aquatic plants grew up, which caused the wetland loss. In the pattern 3, in sub-region A, due to the reduction in water, terrestrial plants covered the region. The three patterns indicated the wetland loss process in the sub region scale. (4) The research integrated the landscape variation and element loss appears potential in the identification of the loss of wetland areas.

TI  - Assessing the Importance of Tree Cover Threshold for Forest Cover Mapping Derived from Global Forest Cover in Myanmar
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive forest cover mapping is essential for making policy and management decisions. However, creating a forest cover map from raw remote sensing data is a barrier for many users. Here, we investigated the effects of different tree cover thresholds on the accuracy of forest cover maps derived from the Global Forest Change Dataset (GFCD) across different ecological zones in a country-scale evaluation of Myanmar. To understand the effect of different thresholds on map accuracy, nine forest cover maps having thresholds ranging from 10% to 90% were created from the GFCD. The accuracy of the forest cover maps within each ecological zone and at the national scale was assessed. The overall accuracies of ecological zones other than tropical rainforest were highest when the threshold for tree cover was less than 50%. The appropriate threshold for tropical rainforests was 80%. Therefore, different optimal tree cover thresholds were required to achieve the highest overall accuracy depending on ecological zones. However, in the unique case of Myanmar, we were able to determine the threshold across the whole country. We concluded that the threshold for tree cover for creating a forest cover map should be determined according to the areal ratio of ecological zones determined from large-scale monitoring. Our results are applicable to tropical regions having similar ecological zones.

TI  - Sociological perspective on the well-being of the elderly Muslim women in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a growing number of studies on the aging society in Malaysia. However, many of those employ quantitative approaches, which yield important data but concentrate more on the experts' standpoint for which researchers' perspectives possibly outweigh the importance of the subjects'. Therefore, this study was an attempt to analyses the meaning of well-being from the viewpoint of elderly Muslim women. The findings revealed that the elders perceived well-being as having the opportunities to learn and to teach. Apart from that, the ability to perform good deeds and to avoid any wrongdoings as ordered by Allah meant that they had gone through well-being. They also believed that they had achieved well-being for which to some elders experiencing happiness and peacefulness as the means to identify it. Finally, in viewing the meaning of well-being to elders, religion could be the most significant dimension. As the subject of religion could be identified throughout the thesis, it shows how religion becomes the part and parcel of elders' personal and collective lived experiences. Subsequently, activity theory rooted in symbolic interactionism and gerotranscendence seemed to be more applicable in explaining elders' interpretations of well-being. In conclusion, the construction of their worldview on well-being would give a better understanding of elders' future needs in the local socio-cultural environment. Thus, the efforts in policy planning and implementation could be expected to be more attentive to and effective for the Malaysian elders' benefits. (C) 2019 The Authors.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive farming has transformed large proportions of Xinjiang's terrestrial surface, which leads to widespread loss and degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity. Mapping croplands at regional scale and in a rapid and less costly approach is becoming increasingly needed. This study explored an integrated approach based on a combined use of multiple remotely sensed data to map croplands in the oasis of northwest China. The Terra MODIS land surface temperature, Enhanced vegetation index, TRMM precipitation and SRTM digital elevation model data products were examined and combined. The Random Forest models were established to estimate fractional croplands at the regional scale. The influences of basin, images and percentage of croplands were all examined on the accuracy of cropland estimation. Moreover, time series analysis of croplands from 2000 to 2017 was conducted across the basin scale. The results are: (1) the integrated approach for cropland mapping at regional scale is promising with the explained variances of fifteen trial models ranging from 58%-93% and two basin scale models ranging from 77.21%-86.10%. (2) The prediction accuracy of croplands in Tarim Basin was much higher than that in Junggar Basin indicated by explained variances. (3) Prediction errors increase and then decrease with the increase of percentage of croplands. (4) EVI and DEM were identified to be the most important variable in Junggar and Tarim basin. (5) During the past 18 years, the area of croplands has been expanding at approximately 641.31cm(2)/year in Junggar Basin and 271.3 km(2)/year in Tarim Basin respectively with no sign of cease. The fastest expansion period and the most dramatic changing area were identified. This study is especially valuable for time series analysis of croplands and its correlation with land degradation in arid region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is one of the most important natural resources which support the human needs and ecological diversity. Groundwater plays a crucial role in the socio-economic development of India. It has also become a major factor for the growth of the agricultural and industrial sectors. Assessing the potential zones of groundwater recharge is necessary for the protection of quality and the management of groundwater systems. Remote sensing and GIS applications provide huge information in least time for the management and planning of groundwater. In this research, remote sensing and GIS applications are used to investigate and demarcate the groundwater potential zones in the parts of Anantapur District, Andhra Pradesh, India. To get accurate integrated information, various thematic layers such as geology, land use/land cover, drainage density, geomorphology, slope, and lineament map were prepared using satellite data and other available data using ArcGIS. All the thematic maps were integrated to delineate the groundwater potential zones using ArcGIS. Weighted overlay analysis of spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS is used to prepare the final integrated map with suitable ranks of the each category of the themes.

AB  - We here describe a case report of a positive precaval sentinel lymph node with negative pelvic sentinel lymph node in a patient with endometrial cancer. A 45-years-old woman was diagnosed with a grade 2 endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium. She was treated with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, associated with dissection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). We detected bilateral external and common bilateral iliac nodes and one precaval node. At pathological examination the pelvic nodes were non-metastatic, but the precaval node was positive. In this patient, sentinel node biopsy improved risk-assessment and adjuvant treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting forest fires burned area and rate of spread from pre-fire multispectral satellite measurements
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational forest fire danger rating systems rely on the recent evolution of meteorological variables to estimate dead fuel condition. Further combining the latter with meteorological and environmental variables, they predict fire occurrence and spread. In this study we retrieved live fuel condition from MODIS multispectral measurements in the near infrared and shortwave infrared. Next, we combined these retrievals with an extensive dataset on actual forest fires in Campania (13,595 km(2)), Italy, to determine how live fuel condition affects the probability distribution functions of fire characteristics. Accordingly, the specific objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a new approach to estimate the probability distribution functions of fire burned area, duration and rate of spread as a function of the Perpendicular Moisture Index (PMI), whose value decreases with decreasing live fuel moisture content (LFMC). To this purpose, available fire data was intersected with MODIS 8-day composited reflectance data so to associate each fire event with the corresponding pre-fire PMI observation. Fires were then grouped in ten decile bins of PMI, and the conditional probability distribution functions of burned area, fire duration and rate of spread were determined in each bin. Distributions of burned area and rate of spread vary across PMI decile bins, while no significant difference was observed for fire duration. Further testing this result with a likelihood ratio test confirmed that PMI is a covariate of burned area and rate of spread, but not of fire duration. We defined an extreme event as a fire whose burned area (respectively rate of spread) exceeds the 95th percentile of the frequency distribution of all observed fire events. The probability distribution functions in the ten decile bins of PMI were combined to obtain a conditional probability distribution function, which was then used to predict the probability of extreme fires, as defined. It was found that the probability of extreme events steadily increases with decreasing PMI. Overall, at the end of the dry season the probability of extreme events is about the double than at the beginning. These results may be used to produce frequently (e.g. daily) updated maps of the probability of extreme events given a PMI map retrieved from e.g. MODIS reflectance data.

TI  - Assessing urban sprawl using remote sensing and landscape metrics: A case study of City of Tshwane, South Africa (1984-2015)
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation is a phenomenon that is of major concern in both developing and developed countries. Uncontrolled urbanisation leads to formal and informal settlements, industrialisation, improvement of transport networks and economic growth. Monitoring, quantifying and mapping urban sprawl as well as establishing the contributors of land cover change are crucial in designing strategies and policies for effective and sustainable land use management. This study determines the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban sprawl in the City of Tshwane (CoT) from 1984 to 2015 using Landsat satellite imagery. Supervised maximum likelihood classification mapped the land cover for the CoT from 1984 to 2015 using archival Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI datasets. Post-classification change detection techniques coupled with landscape metrics helped to assess and quantify trends and patterns of urban sprawl. Change detection and analysis revealed that over the 31 years of study between 1984 and 2015 there was an increase in built-up areas in the CoT by 109% between 1984 and 2015. Landscape metrics confirmed also the increase in built-up areas in the CoT. (C) 2018 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores use the of remotely sensed satellite data for monitoring environmental impact of MSW open dumps on their surroundings using bio-thermal indicators. The study has made use of 66 images of Lansat-8 from January 2014 to December 2017, to monitor main MSW dump of Gujranwala, Pakistan. On average thermally influence zone of the dump has been found extended to 480 m around it. Whereas the seasonal average radius of the influence in the zone is measured as 375 m, 425 m, 450 m, 527 m, 590 m and 600 m for spring, monsoon, wet summer, winter-II, winter-I and dry summer respectively. Extreme temperatures and dry weather conditions increase the range of the zone. The range of the bio-influence zone around the dump has been measured using satellite driven VIs of MSAVI, SAVI and NDVI that averages to 590 m. The seasonal averages measured by averaging results from all three VIs are 326 m, 410 m, 430 m, 620 m, 692 m and 1100 m for spring, monsoon, winter-II, wet summer, winter-I and dry summer respectively. In addition, max-min gap of the measurements has been used to assess operational stability of individual parameters and seasons for the used spatial analysis. Development of bio-thermally influence zone with time and a comparison with previous studies a positive correlation between measured range of bio-thermal influence zone and amount of MSW dumped at sites has been verified.

TI  - Building up or spreading out? Typologies of urban growth across 478 cities of 1 million+
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban form in both two- (2D) and three-dimensions (3D) has significant impacts on local and global environments. Here we developed the largest global dataset characterizing 2D and 3D urban growth for 478 cities with populations of one million or larger. Using remote sensing data from the SeaWinds scatterometer for 2001 and 2009, and the Global Human Settlement Layer for 2000 and 2014, we applied a cluster analysis and found five urban growth typologies: stabilized, outward, mature upward, budding outward, upward and outward. Budding outward is the dominant typology worldwide, per the largest total area. Cities characterized by upward and outward growth are few in number and concentrated primarily in China and South Korea, where there has been a large increase in high-rises during the study period. With the exception of East Asia, cities within a geographic region exhibit remarkably similar patterns of urban growth. Our results show that every city exhibits multiple urban growth typologies concurrently. Thus, while it is possible to describe a city by its dominant urban growth typology, a more accurate and comprehensive characterization would include some combination of the five typologies. The implications of the results for urban sustainability are multifold. First, the results suggest that there is considerable opportunity to shape future patterns of urbanization, given that most of the new urban growth is nascent and low magnitude outward expansion. Second, the clear geographic patterns and wide variations in the physical form of urban growth, within country and city, suggest that markets, national and subnational policies, including the absence of, can shape how cities grow. Third, the presence of different typologies within each city suggests the need for differentiated strategies for different parts of a single city. Finally, the new urban forms revealed in this analysis provide a first glimpse into the carbon lock-in of recently constructed energy-demanding infrastructure of urban settlements.

TI  - Geospatial Patterns and Drivers of Forest Fire Occurrence in Romania
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate spatial explicit forest fire risk assessment and mapping is essential for forest fire prevention and suppression preparedness, firefighting resources allocation, and efficient multi-level fire management policies. This paper describes the application and validation of an approach for forest fire risk analysis and fire risk zoning over Romania in order to identify areas at national scale where fires are most likely to occur and to threat existing values, resources and assets. A modeling approach based on logistic regression using historical fire observations has been developed based on environmental, socio-economic and demographic data availability at national scale. Ignitions were positively related to south-western slopes and occurred mostly in fuel type of xerophyte oaks as well as in areas of heterogeneous (natural/agricultural) landscape. In addition to the human variables the pattern of ignitions was also significantly related to slope and temperature of the driest quarter. The risk zones produced by the multiple logistic regression model presented satisfactory accuracy when compared with historical fire perimeters extracted from MODIS imagery. The findings of this study could be used by fire managers to implement prevention measures at forest areas with high fire risk. Furthermore, attention should be given to areas with high fire ignition probability, where the vulnerability and potential impact is higher.

AB  - Spectral indices are very important for crop identification, health analysis and production estimation. The present study focused on estimations of wheat yield through weather models and further their integration with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor of 250m spatial resolution to develop spectral regression model at two districts viz. Karnal and Hisar representing different agroclimatic zones (eastern and western) in Haryana, India.Rabi season (October-March) MODIS-16 days composite value of NDVI for the period 2000-2017 were obtained from LP DAAC-NASA and wheat yield data for study region were obtained from Haryana statistical abstract. Correlation and regression analysis were performed using weekly weather parameters and NDVI value extract from satellite imagery using ENVI 5.5 software. For accuracy enhancement, the spectral-models were integrated with NDVI values.Agromet models integrated with satellite data based NDVI i.e. MODIS NDVI for both stations exhibited higher accuracy and gave better results as compared to other two models viz. weather models alone (adjusted R-2 was 0.96 and 0.50 for Karnal and Hisar) and integrated with NDVI values available at IARI CREAMS platform (adjusted R-2 was 0.96 and 0.47 for Karnal and Hisar). The adjusted R-2 of new model i.e. MODIS NDVI was 0.97 and 0.58 for Karnal and Hisar and percent deviation ranged 11.2 % and 0.3% respectively. Further, on spatial scales, the Spectral wheat model accuracy was higher in eastern climatic zone as compared to western as later has more climatic and physiographic diversity. The MODIS NDVI values observed to be more effective for wheat yield predication and using this model yield can be predicted two month prior to harvesting. The results concluded that the integration of NDVI enhanced the accuracy of weather based yield prediction for wheat to a considerable extent.

M3  - Review
AB  - Neoadjuvant therapy is an increasing treatment option in the management of breast cancer. The tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy, especially the pathological complete response, is a validated endpoint frequently used in clinical trials. However, there is still a lack of standardization for the surgical specimen management in the neoadjuvant setting. This leads to heterogeneity in the specimen handling and might lead to significant bias for the prognostic assessment of patients or in clinical trials. The GEFPICS group, composed of expert breast cancer pathologists, herein presents guidelines for the management of breast and axillary specimen before treatment (management of biopsy, items of the pathological report) and after neoadjuvant therapy (specimen handling, histological assessment of response, items of the pathological report and response grading systems).

TI  - A Multi-Channel Algorithm for Mapping Volcanic Thermal Anomalies by Means of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), respectively onboard Sentinel-2A/2B and Landsat 8 satellites, thanks to their features especially in terms of spatial/spectral resolution, represents two important instruments for investigating thermal volcanic activity from space. In this study, we used data from those sensors to test an original multichannel algorithm, which aims at mapping volcanic thermal anomalies at a global scale. The algorithm, named Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI), combines two normalized indices, analyzing near infrared (NIR) and short wave infrared (SWIR) radiances, to identify hotspot pixels in daylight conditions. Results, achieved studying a number of active volcanoes located in different geographic areas and characterized by a different eruptive behavior, demonstrated the NHI capacity in mapping both subtle and more intense volcanic thermal anomalies despite some limitations (e.g., missed detections because of clouds/volcanic plumes). In addition, the study shows that the performance of NHI might be further increased using some additional spectral/spatial tests, in view of a possible usage of this algorithm within a known multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis. The low processing times and the straight forth exportability to data from other sensors make NHI, which is sensitive even to other high temperature sources, suited for mapping hot volcanic targets integrating information provided by current and well-established satellite-based volcanoes monitoring systems.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Change and Its Impact on the Hydrology of Kakia and Esamburmbur Sub-Watersheds of Narok County, Kenya
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Narok town is one of the places in Kenya which experience catastrophic floods. Many lives have been lost and valuable property destroyed in recent years. Change in land use/land cover upstream of the town area may have contributed significantly to the severity and frequency of flooding events. Runoff, which contributes to floods in Narok town, comes from Kakia and Esamburmbur sub-catchments of Enkare Narok watershed. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of land use/land cover change on the hydrology of Kakia and Esamburmbur sub-watersheds. To detect land use/land cover change, Landsat satellite images from 1985 to 2019 were used. Using supervised classification in Erdas Imagine 2014, land use of the study area was classified into four classes, i.e., forest, rangeland, agriculture and built-up areas. Five land use maps (1985, 1995, 2000, 2010, and 2019) were developed and used to perform land use change analysis. There was rampart conversion of forest to other land uses. Between 1985 and 2019, the forest and rangeland declined by 40.3% and 25.6% of the study area, respectively, while agriculture and built-up areas increased by 55.2% and 10.6% of the study area respectively. Analysis of soil hydrological properties indicate that the infiltration rate and soil hydraulic conductivity were greatest in forest than in other land use types. The basic infiltration rate in forest land was 89.1 cm/h while in rangeland and agricultural land, it was 7.9 cm/h and 15 cm/h respectively. At the top-soil layer, average soil hydraulic conductivity under forest was 46.3 cm/h, under rangeland, 2.6 cm/h and under agriculture, 4.9 cm/h. The low hydraulic conductivity in rangeland and agriculture was attributed to compaction by farm machinery (tractors) and livestock respectively. An interesting observation was made in rangelands where the top layer (0-20 cm) had a higher bulk density and a lower hydraulic conductivity as compared to the next deeper layer (20-40 cm). This was attributed to the combined impact of compaction and localised pressure by hooves of livestock which only have an impact on the top layer. The findings of this study show that land use has a major impact on soil hydrological properties and imply that the observed land use changes negatively affected the soil hydrological properties of the watershed. The decreased infiltration in the increasing areas of degraded land (mainly agriculture and rangeland) and increase in built-up area in Narok town are the possible causes of the increased flood risk in Narok town. It is recommended that flood risk management strategies in Narok town include watershed management to enhance water infiltration.

T2  - NEW CONTREE
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been many studies on the Voortrekker Centenary of 1938 and the unforeseen consequences it had, including the subsequent surge of Afrikaner nationalism and political developments. As the wagons moved across South Africa, the processions infused Afrikaners with pride in their heroic past. Afrikaner nationalism, the ideology that focused on protecting Afrikaner culture, the striving to regain an independent republic and, importantly, affirmation that they were God's chosen people, were rekindled.The event also generated a widespread sense of connection. It was not only Afrikaners who were swept up in the euphoria of the celebrations, but also many non-Afrikaners were emotionally affected by the event.This article narrows the focus down to George, a small town in the Western Cape Province, where Charles Sayers, the editor of the local newspaper, the George er Knysna Herald, a firm supporter of the United Party and a fierce critic of the Reunited National Party, seems to have been swept up for a short period by the fever of the celebrations. A year later, in 1939, when war broke out in Europe, Sayers loyally approved of the United Party's decision to support the war effort in Europe on the side of the Allies and became harshly critical of Hertzog and those Afrikaners nationalists who refused to join a war on Britain's side.With the George & Knysna Herald as the primary source, this article attempts to determine what led the editor to undergo such an about-turn in his political views in 1938 and to be temporarily supportive of the celebrations that embodied the spirit of Afrikaner nationalism.

TI  - Effects of landcover changes on net primary production (NPP)-based exergy in south-central of Chile
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new indicator for the accounting effect of landcover is defined based on the integration of thermodynamics (exergy analysis) and ecology (net primary production (NPP)). The indicator NPPEX allows quantifying and assessing the impacts of landuse changes, in spatial and temporally dimensions. This study is focused on the effect of landuse changes on NPP-based exergy for the south-central of Chile from 2000 to 2014. The exergy-based spatially characterization factor (NPPEX) was estimated based on the time series of NPP extracted from MODIS and exergy conversion factor. Finally, the dynamic of NPPEX changes by the transition of each landuse type was studied for identifying the driver force influencing on biomass productivity. Results confirmed the important influence of forestry policy on land use changes, in particular, the forest transitions during the two last decade, which exhibit a cover increase of 28% between 1994 and 2014 established mainly on land destined to crops, native forest, and shrubs. In consequences, the highest land efficiency (NPPEX) was obtained for exotic tree plantations (88.25-91.4 MJex m(-2)yr(-1)) during all studied period, due to high carbon stock per square meter associated to its intensive forest management. From the transition of landcover changes point of view, there was produced a positive effect on NPPEX, being the exotic tree plantation expansion the main driver of gains of NPPEX. Nevertheless, this expansion has carried out severe local environmental impacts (i.e., ecosystem fragmentation, biodiversity loss, topsoil compaction, losses of Biobio Basin's morpho-sedimentary regulation capacity, etc.).

TI  - Home range requirements in Bonelli's eagle (<i>Aquila fasciata</i>): prey abundance or trophic stability?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Prey abundance is one of the limiting factors for establishment a home range. In particular, biomass abundance could act as a key element for generalist top predators, with wide prey type spectrum, for establishing their home ranges. We studied if biomass abundance may act as a limiting factor for the establishment of home range in a generalist top predator, Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata). We used GPS satellite data on breeding individuals over a 10-year period to deepen into home range behaviour. To quantify biomass abundance, we performed surveys at different periods of the year cycle for potential prey inside the home ranges and outside them. We checked if differences in biomass were identified between home ranges and potential adjacent areas. Also, annual and seasonal variation in biomass abundance may be recorded. Variations in biomass abundance among home range were detected but no annual or seasonal variation within home range was identified. Differences in biomass abundance were identified between each of the home range and their potential adjacent areas. Although biomass abundance is lower inside the home range, it remains stable throughout the year while strong fluctuations in biomass abundance were detected outside them. Our results show that Bonelli's eagle may establish their home range based on permanent biomass stability (Trophic Stability Hypothesis) rather than great seasonal but unpredictable abundances. This approach may have strong implications for management conservation programs of territorial top generalist predators.

TI  - Analysis and Classification of Natural and Human-Induced Ground Deformations at Regional Scale (Campania, Italy) Detected by Satellite Synthetic-Aperture Radar Interferometry Archive Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high levels of geo-hydrological, seismic, and volcanic hazards in the Campania region prompted full data collection from C-band satellites ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, and RADARSAT within regional (TELLUS) and national (PST-A) projects. The quantitative analysis, interpretation, and classification of natural and human-induced slow-rate ground deformations across a span of two decades (1992-2010) was performed at regional scale (Campania, Italy) by using interferometric archive datasets, based on the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry approach. As radar satellite sensors have a side-looking view, the post-processing of the interferometric datasets allows for the evaluation of two spatial components (vertical and E-W horizontal ones) of ground deformation, while the N-S horizontal component cannot be detected. The ground deformation components have been analyzed across 89.5% of the Campania territory within a variety of environmental, topographical, and geological conditions. The main part (57%) of the regional territory was characterized during 1992-2010 by stable areas, where SAR signals do not have recorded significant horizontal and vertical components of ground deformation with an average annual rate greater than +1 mm/yr or lower than -1 mm/yr. Within the deforming areas, the coastal plains are characterized by widespread and continuous strong subsidence signals due to sediment compaction locally enhanced by human activity, while the inner plain sectors show mainly scattered spots with locally high subsidence in correspondence of urban areas, sinkholes, and groundwater withdrawals. The volcanic sectors show interplaying horizontal and vertical trends due to volcano-tectonic processes, while in the hilly and mountain inner sectors the ground deformation is mainly controlled by large-scale tectonic activity and by local landslide activity. The groundwater-related deformation is the dominant cause of human-caused ground deformation. The results confirm the importance of using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry data for a comprehensive understanding of rates and patterns of recent ground deformation at regional scale also within tectonically active areas as in Campania region.

TI  - Synergistic integration of optical and microwave satellite data for crop yield estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing accurate models of crop stress, phenology and productivity is of paramount importance, given the increasing need of food. Earth observation (EO) remote sensing data provides a unique source of information to monitor crops in a temporally resolved and spatially explicit way. In this study, we propose the combination of multisensor (optical and microwave) remote sensing data for crop yield estimation and forecasting using two novel approaches. We first propose the lag between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) derived from SMAP as a new joint metric combining the information from the two satellite sensors in a unique feature or descriptor. Our second approach avoids summarizing statistics and uses machine learning to combine full time series of EVI and VOD. This study considers two statistical methods, a regularized linear regression and its nonlinear extension called kernel ridge regression to directly estimate the county-level surveyed total production, as well as individual yields of the major crops grown in the region: corn, soybean and wheat. The study area includes the US Corn Belt, and we use agricultural survey data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA-NASS) for year 2015 for quantitative assessment. Results show that (1) the proposed EVI-VOD lag metric correlates well with crop yield and outperforms common single-sensor metrics for crop yield estimation; (2) the statistical (machine learning) models working directly with the time series largely improve results compared to previously reported estimations; (3) the combined exploitation of information from the optical and microwave data leads to improved predictions over the use of single sensor approaches with coefficient of determination R-2 >= 0.76; (4) when models are used for within-season forecasting with limited time information, crop yield prediction is feasible up to four months before harvest (models reach a plateau in accuracy); and (5) the robustness of the approach is confirmed in a multi-year setting, reaching similar performances than when using single-year data. In conclusion, results confirm the value of using both EVI and VOD at the same time, and the advantage of using automatic machine learning models for crop yield/production estimation.

TI  - Studying evidence of land degradation in the Indian Ganga River Basin-a Geoinformatics approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a long-term loss of ecosystem function and productivity which takes place due to a wide variety of land processes, namely soil erosion, soil sodification, green-cover loss, and soil conditions such as soil infertility that leads to productivity loss. About 41% of the land in India is under different forms of land degradation in which a major part lies in the Indian Ganga River Basin (IGRB). In this work, we evaluated the evidence of land degradation in the IGRB by analyzing (i) the changes in the forest cover and land use (FCLU) between 1975 and 2010, (ii) forest fragmentation status for the same time period, and (iii) decline in rain-use efficiency (RUE) during 2000-2010. The FCLU-type mapping for the year 1975 and 2010 was carried out using 216 Landsat satellite scenes that derived 40 vegetation and 7 non-vegetation classes. The highest negative change (loss) was observed in the dry deciduous forest of mixed forest formation (4699.9 km(2)) and gregarious formation (1337.6 km(2)), and a major gain in settlement (5396.3 km(2)) and managed lands (3408.4 km(2)). An increase in forest fragmentation was observed in all the forest classes with the highest rise in the deciduous forest of the central basin. A consistent decline in RUE was observed highest in the South-Western semi-arid IGRB (0.02-0.15) that stretched up to the central basin. All the three analyses showed evidence of active land degradation in the form of green-cover loss, fragmented forests, and declined primary productivity with visual evidence for some of the severely degraded areas. The use of Geoinformatics to analyze land degradation using surface indicators is promising and provide possibilities of further improvements using better resolution data.

TI  - A Hybrid Bio-Optical Transformation for Satellite Bathymetry Modeling Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a new hybrid bio-optical transformation (HBT) method for the rapid modelling of bathymetry in coastal areas. The proposed approach exploits free-of-charge multispectral images and their processing by applying limited manpower and resources. The testbed area is a strait between two Greek Islands in the Aegean Sea with many small islets and complex seabed relief. The HBT methodology implements semi-analytical and empirical steps to model sea-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) and apparent optical properties (AOPs) observed by the Sentinel-2A multispectral satellite. The relationships of the calculated IOPs and AOPs are investigated and utilized to classify the study area into sub-regions with similar water optical characteristics, where no environmental observations have previously been collected. The bathymetry model is configured using very few field data (training depths) chosen from existing official nautical charts. The assessment of the HBT indicates the potential for obtaining satellite derived bathymetry with a satisfactory accuracy for depths down to 30 m.

TI  - Weapons of Resistance: The Material Symbolics of Postclassic Mexican Spinning and Weaving
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Material culture studies demonstrate how objects may act to communicate information regarding social identity. In this study we consider ethnohistorical, ethnographic, and archaeological evidence for Postclassic spinning and weaving as symbols relating to female ideology in ancient Mexico. We then relate a contextual interpretation of texts and images to contemporary symbolism, particularly associated with members of the female earth/fertility deity complex depicted and described in precolumbian and early colonial pictorial manuscripts. For our case study we analyze decorative imagery found on bakedclay spindle whorls from Postclassic Cholula, Mexico. This collection is representative of an iconographic system relating to female ideology. Whorls, as well as other spinning and weaving tools, paralleled male-oriented weapons to create a symbolic equivalence or, as we argue, a usurpation of the male symbols within a female worldview as a form of resistance to male domination. We conclude that the symbolic system used on spindle whorls and in other aspects of female practice created a communication network understood by Postclassic women.

TI  - Fighting Words: Duelling at the Bounds of Class and Culture in Walter Scott's Scotland
T2  - WENSHAN REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Edinburgh of the 1820s saw a change in social order and the cultural modes that policed it. Private adjustment of quarrels through duelling (which had increased at this time of tension) stood against a greater emphasis on the law, and a negotiation of rivalries in a burgeoning and politicized popular press. Walter Scott, with his historical and conservative sensibility, stood at the centre of this change, and often is considered to have been on the side of the past and its mythicized practices. This article focuses on three encounters between 1818 and 1821 one between James Hogg and a Glasgow editor, one between John Gibson Lockhart of Blackwood's and John Scott of the London Magazine, and the third between James Stuart of Dunearn and Sir Alexander Boswell (writing for the Glasgow Sentinel). From these cases, and in the context of Ivanhoe, the article contends that Walter Scott understood the duel as a form of discourse, with all the uncertainties, opportunities and difficulties that this might entail.

TI  - Pathobiology and first report of larval nematodes (Ascaridomorpha sp.) infecting freshwater mussels (<i>Villosa nebulosa</i>, Unionidae), including an inventory of nematode infections in freshwater and marine bivalves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Little information is available on host-parasite relationships between bivalves and larval nematodes. Herein, we describe nematode larvae (likely stage 2) in the infraorder Ascaridomorpha infecting the foot, intestine, and mantle of a freshwater mussel (Alabama rainbow, Villosa nebulosa [Conrad, 1834]) and detail histopathological changes to infected tissues. A total of 43 live mussels from the South Fork of Terrapin Creek, Alabama, were collected between 2010 and 2014, with 14 sectioned for histopathology and 29 dissected. Of the 14 sectioned mussels, 5 appeared to be uninfected, and 7, 1, and 1 had histozoic infections observed in the foot and intestine, intestine only, and mantle edge and foot, respectively. Twenty-three of 29 (79%) of the mussels dissected were infected by live nematodes, and mean nematode abundance was 8.3 (CL = 5.23-13), with 2 mussels infected with > 100 nematodes each. Thus, with a total of 32 of the 43 collected mussels observed with nematodes, overall infection prevalence was 74.4% (CL = 0.594-0.855). The 18S rDNA of this nematode was 99% similar to that of several ascaridids (species of Kathlaniidae Lane, 1914 and Quimperiidae Baylis, 1930) that mature in aquatic/semi-aquatic vertebrates; the recovered 18S phylogenetic tree indicated this nematode from V. nebulosa shares a recent common ancestor with Ichthyobronema hamulatum (Ascaridomorpha: Quimperiidae; GenBank Accession Number KY476351). Pathological changes to tissue associated with these infections comprised focal tissue damage, but a cellular response was not evident. The Alabama rainbow possibly represents an intermediate or paratenic host. Given these results, the nematode is likely not pathogenic under normal stream conditions; however, high intensity infections in the foot could inhibit pedal extension and retraction; which would have demonstrable health consequences to a freshwater mussel. Based on our review of the bivalve mollusc parasite literature, a collective biodiversity of 61 nematodes reportedly exhibit some degree of symbiosis (from commensal to parasitic) with 21 bivalves (28 nematode spp. from 17 marine bivalve spp.; 33 nematode spp. from 4 freshwater bivalve spp.); only four records exist of putatively parasitic nematodes from Unionida. The present study represents the first description of a nematode species that invades the tissues of a Unionidae species.

TI  - Modified Ulaby Model on Backscattering as a Function of Salinity, Frequency and Soil Moisture
T2  - Indian Journal of Agricultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most crucial environmental problems affecting developing countries in arid and semi-arid regions is soil salinity. Its detection using radar imaging systems is one of promising domains of remote sensing research. Due to the components of the mixture and their corresponding dielectric properties, backscattering of these types of soils can be modeled and monitored. Ulaby developed an empirical model that established a non-linear relation between soil moisture and backscattering coefficient. The dielectric properties of the soil depend on soil moisture content along with its salinity, texture and frequency. The radar backscattering from wet soil surface depends upon dielectric properties besides angle of incidence of the Synthetic Aperture Radar. Most previous studies neglected the effect of the presence of salts combined with the other parameters on the backscattering coefficient. In this paper, we present the salinity effect on the calculation of the backscattering coefficient using Modified Ulaby (MU) model. To validate the modeling approach, the secondary data of RADARSAT-1 satellite images in standard modes (C-band) were collected for the area of Wadi El-Natrun, Egypt, where fieldwork was conducted simultaneously with some of the RADARSAT-1 image acquisitions. The results show that the simulated backscattering using MU gives a better fit with measured SAR images. Moreover, the comparison of simulated backscattering using MU gives better correlation with widely accepted Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and Dubois Model (DM). It is suggested that the proposed model will be of interest to agricultural scientists, and applicable to remote sensing of salt-affected areas.

TI  - The Spatial Prediction of Soil Texture Fractions in Arid Regions of Iran
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - To predict the soil texture fractions, 115 profiles were identified based on the Latin hypercube sampling technique, the horizons were sampled, and the clay, sand, and silt contents (in percentages) of soil samples were measured. Then equal-area quadratic spline depth functions were used to derive clay, sand, and silt contents at five standard soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm). Auxiliary variables used in this study include the terrain attributes (derived from a digital elevation model), Landsat 8 image data (acquired in 2015), geomorphological map, and spectrometric data (laboratory data). Artificial neural network (ANN), regression tree (RT), and neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) models were used to make a correlation between soil data (clay, sand, and silt) and auxiliary variables. The results of this study showed that the ANFIS model was more accurate in the prediction of the three parameters of clay, silt, and sand than ANN and RT. Moreover, the ability of ANFIS model to estimate the soil texture fractions in the surface layers was higher than the lower layers. The mean coefficient of determination (R-2) values calculated by 10-fold cross validation suggested the higher prediction performance in the upper depth intervals and higher prediction error in the lower depth intervals (e.g., R-2 = 0.91, concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.90, RMSE = 4.00 g kg(-1) for sand of 0-5 cm depth, and R-2 = 0.68, CCC = 0.60, RMSE = 8.03 g kg(-1) for 60-100 cm depth). The results also showed that the most important auxiliary variables are spectrometric data, multi-resolution, valley-bottom flatness index and wetness index. Overall, it is recommended to use ANFIS models for the digital mapping of soil texture fractions in other arid regions of Iran.

TI  - Estimates of groundwater depletion under extreme drought in the Brazilian semi-arid region using GRACE satellite data: application for a small-scale aquifer
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal and spatial monitoring of groundwater levels is among the most widely used techniques for understanding groundwater reserves, which is essential for the management of regions with drought-related issues. Between 2010 and 2017, the Brazilian semi-arid region suffered a severe drought, presenting intensity and societal impacts undetected in decades. This research aimed to understand how Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data can be used as a tool for monitoring groundwater reserves in one of the most important aquifers in the Araripe Sedimentary Basin (Middle Aquifer System), located in a developing region with scarce amounts of data, and where 84,000,000 m(3) of groundwater is abstracted annually through pumping. Groundwater storage (GWS) in-situ data were related to GWS estimates based on a combination of GRACE-based terrestrial water storage (TWS with both mascon and spherical harmonic solutions) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture (CLM, MOS, NOAH and VIC models were evaluated). Results were analyzed with Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, and showed that the GWS GRACE-based estimate using the Community Land Model (CLM) land-surface model was more suitable for representing aquifer storage variations. Seven wells (58%) demonstrated a NS > 0.50 for both GWS GRACE-based solutions. In conclusion, GWS GRACE-based methodology has potential for monitoring the 1,394-km(2) outcrop area of the Middle Aquifer System.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation indicators for landscape structure dynamics monitoring using dense normalized difference vegetation index time series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are constantly changing at various spatial and temporal scales due to natural and/or anthropogenic factors. It is therefore of great interest to develop effective indicators based on spatio-temporal variations to detect, map, and monitor ecosystem changes on the continental and global scales. In this study, spatio-temporal variation indicators were established to characterize landscape structure changes based on temporal analysis combined with spatial information obtained using dense Landsat time series in Changting County, Fujian, Province, China. All available Landsat images from 1987 to 2017 were collected. The fractal dimension (FD) of the spatial neighbor normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the Landsat images was calculated. Four change patterns (stable, increasing, decreasing, and wave) were explored using the ordinary least-squares method between abrupt change points performed by a Mann-Kendall test on the FD time series to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics. The results showed that 49.98% of the landscape structure in the study area decreased over the 31-year study period. The forest and water were dominated by decreasing patterns (67.00% and 56.27%); the urban land and cropland were dominated by wave patterns (50.07% and 50.95%); bare land regions were dominated by wave patterns and increasing patterns (50.52% and 31.38%). Wide and discontinuous landscape structures with high heterogeneity were replaced by landscape patches. The regional landscape structure heterogeneity increased in the bare land regions and other homogeneous landscape structures, while the decreases may be coupled with internal landscape structure changes. It was concluded that the spatial and temporal variations of the change patterns and change processes determined based on the FD of the NDVI in the spatial neighbor region are systematic indicators and can be used to detect landscape structure changes successfully and provide insights into dynamic trends.

TI  - Assessing the environmental effectiveness of the Spanish Marine Reserve Network using remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy marine ecosystems provide a variety of ecosystem services crucial for human wellbeing. Effectively managed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are increasingly recognized to be an effective measure to protect endangered species and ensuring healthier ecosystems. This study assesses the environmental effectiveness of the Spanish Marine Reserve Network (MRN) with regard to: 1) water quality: chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a), sea surface temperature (SST), and Salinity; and 2) protected species conservation: coverage and density of Posidonia oceanica (P. oceanica), using a Multiple-Paired-Before-After-Control-Impact (MPBACI) research design. Water quality and protected species indicators were compared before and after Marine Reserve (MR) designation, inside MRs and in different outer control areas of 1 km, 5 km, 10 km and equal-area buffers, for the whole MRN (Marine Reserve Network), by marine ecoregions and for some specific MRs. We used Copernicus Marine Monitoring Remote Sensing data to ascertain water quality values and validated their accuracy compared to in-situ data as well as the reliability of Chl-a concentration derived from Sentinel 2 (S2) images. Water quality results reveal significant differences in mean Chl-a and Chl-a range, mean Salinity and SST range between cases (inside MRs) and 5 km-buffer control areas for the entire MRN. Analyses by ecoregion showed no significant differences in water quality between cases and controls in the Western Mediterranean ecoregion or in the Azores, Canaries and Madeira ecoregion, whereas the Alboran Sea ecoregion MRs had higher mean Chl-a concentration and lower mean Salinity, mean SST and SST range than all controls. Results on P. oceanica beds showed a significant increase in P. oceanica density (almost twice) inside Tabarca MR (TBA) compared to outer control cases, but no significant changes in P. oceanica coverage. Validation of Remote Sensing (RS) data using in-situ measurements demonstrated significant differences for Chl-a concentration and no significant differences for SST and Salinity between both techniques. Chl-a concentration by S2 reveals statistically significant differences with in-situ data. Our findings suggest environmental effectiveness of the Spanish MRs and still limited sensitivity of open source medium resolution RS tools to assess MPA effectiveness.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the performance of daily and monthly precipitation data relative to GPM-IMERG, TRMM_3B42 and PERSIANN satellite-based precipitation estimations against historical data for the period 2014-2017 as observed at 70 synoptic stations distributed over Iran. The coefficient of determination (R-squared), root mean square error and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient were used to evaluate the performance of the used data sets against observed precipitation records at the considered stations. The statistics showed that the considered data sets are generally less successful in estimating daily precipitation at nationwide as the estimation errors were found high at almost all the studied stations. The errors of daily precipitation estimation of GPM-IMERG, TRMM_3B42 and PERSIANN-CDR data sets showed that although there is a considerable similarity between the estimated precipitation by the three data sets, especially between the TRMM_3B42 and GPM-IMERG, the accuracy of GPM-IMERG daily precipitation over Iran is higher than that of TRMM_3B42 and PERSIANN-CDR. The highest R-2 value for GPM-IMERG, TRMM_3B42 and PERSIANN-CDR remotely sensed daily precipitation is equal to 0.6, 0.46, and 0.37, respectively. Similarly, on the monthly time scale, the GPM-IMERG, with an average R-2 value of 0.83 over the country, performs better than the other two data sets. The TRMM_3B43 with mean nationwide R-2 = 0.80 also showed comparative performance with GPM-IMERG, but the PERSIANN-CDR data set with an average R-2 value of 0.4 over the stations is not as accurate as the GPM-IMERG and TRMM_3B43.

TI  - Lagrangian Evolution of the Northeast Pacific Marine Boundary Layer Structure and Cloud during CSET
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Flight data from the Cloud System Evolution over the Trades (CSET) campaign over the Pacific stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition are organized into 18 Lagrangian cases suitable for study and future modeling, made possible by the use of a track-and-resample flight strategy. Analysis of these cases shows that 2-day Lagrangian coherence of long-lived species (CO and O-3) is high (r = 0.93 and 0.73, respectively), but that of subcloud aerosol, MBL depth, and cloud properties is limited. Although they span a wide range in meteorological conditions, most sampled air masses show a clear transition when considering 2-day changes in cloudiness (-31% averaged over all cases), MBL depth (+560 m), estimated inversion strength (EIS; -2.2 K), and decoupling, agreeing with previous satellite studies and theory. Changes in precipitation and droplet number were less consistent. The aircraft-based analysis is augmented by geostationary satellite retrievals and reanalysis data along Lagrangian trajectories between aircraft sampling times, documenting the evolution of cloud fraction, cloud droplet number concentration, EIS, and MBL depth. An expanded trajectory set spanning the summer of 2015 is used to show that the CSET-sampled air masses were representative of the season, with respect to EIS and cloud fraction. Two Lagrangian case studies attractive for future modeling are presented with aircraft and satellite data. The first features a clear Sc-Cu transition involving MBL deepening and decoupling with decreasing cloud fraction, and the second undergoes a much slower cloud evolution despite a greater initial depth and decoupling state. Potential causes for the differences in evolution are explored, including free-tropospheric humidity, subsidence, surface fluxes, and microphysics.

TI  - Vegetation mapping through using satellite images of WorldView 2-A case study of Haft Barm, Shiraz
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are regarded one of the main inputs for land use planning and environmental modeling. One of the main reasons of unsuitable spatial array of the urban areas can be related to the rural communities' emigration, which in turn cause complete degradation of the farmlands and rural structures. Such event can be regards as a factor which is responsible for demolishing of the Haft Barm area an important recreational and touristic areas in the vicinity of Shiraz metropolis.Therefore, recognizing the natural conditions of the area, preparing resource maps like land use and land cover, and monitoring their changes during the time is critical issue in the environmental planning and management. To this aim, WorldView 2 images with eight bands were used and mentioned maps were produced. The mapping analysis way was relied on an object-based classification methodology and using a decision tree which was applied in the WorldView 2 images categorization. The process shall be as the following: a) segmentation, b) terrain selecting, c) creating a decision tree for images' classification, and d) ultimate classification and evaluation of the accuracy. The area was divided into 10 user classes. The results indicated successful classes categorization with overall accuracy of 87.45%. The highest accuracy of classification was obtained for water, forest, product, building classes respectively. Planted forests patches as well as natural forests were identified and classified using OBC approach (objectbased method) while additional coastal bands were used to distinguishing among barren and covered lands. Distance to tree and shadow play an important role in identifying buildings.

TI  - Is Clinical Exam of the Axilla Sufficient to Select Node-Positive Patients Who Downstage After NAC for SLNB? A Comparison of the Accuracy of Clinical Exam Versus MRI
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 72nd Annual National Cancer Symposium of the Society-for-Surgical-Oncology (SSO) / SSO Regional Therapy Conference
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Background. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) endorses sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with clinically positive axillary nodes who downstage after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In this study, we compared the accuracy of post-NAC MRI to clinical exam alone in predicting pathologic status of sentinel lymph nodes in cN1 patients.Methods. We identified patients with T0-3, N1 breast cancer who underwent NAC and subsequent SLNB from March 2014 to July 2017. Patients were grouped based on whether a post-NAC MRI was done. MRI accuracy in predicting SLN status was assessed versus clinical exam alone.Results. A total of 450 patients met initial study criteria; 269 were analyzed after excluding patients without biopsy-confirmed nodal disease, palpable disease after NAC, and failed SLN mapping. Median age was 49 years. Post-NAC MRI was done in 68% (182/269). Patients undergoing lumpectomy vs mastectomy more frequently received a post-NAC MRI (88 vs 54%, p < 0.001). All other clinicopathologic parameters were comparable between those who did and did not have a post-NAC MRI. Thirty percent (55/182) had abnormal lymph nodes on MRI. Among these, 58% (32/55) had a positive SLN on final pathology versus 42% (53/127) of patients with no abnormal lymph nodes on MRI and 52% (45/87) of patients who had clinical exam alone (p = 0.09). MRI sensitivity was 38%, specificity was 76%, and overall SLN status prediction accuracy was 58%.Conclusions. Post-NAC MRI is no more accurate than clinical exam alone in predicting SLN pathology in patients presenting with cN1 disease. Abnormal lymph nodes on MRI should not preclude SLNB.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in 105 High-Risk Cutaneous SCCs of the Head and Neck: Results of a Multicenter Prospective Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Regional nodal metastases from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is strongly associated with a poor prognosis, but these metastases are difficult to predict clinically. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been used for a wide range of malignancies to assess for regional nodal metastasis, but is not widely used for cSCC.Methods. Patients presenting with high-risk cSCC of the head and neck with clinically N0 necks were offered SNB at the time of primary cSCC excision or secondary wide local excision. Patients with positive sentinel nodes were offered completion lymph node dissection, and all the patients were followed up at regular intervals for up to 5 years.Results. In this study, 105 lesions underwent SNB, and 10 sentinel nodes (9.5%) were positive. In an additional five patients, regional recurrence developed after a negative sentinel node, with a total subclinical nodal metastasis rate of 14.3%. Nodal metastases were significantly associated with reduced disease-specific survival. The significant predictors of metastasis were four or more high-risk features or tumors with a concurrent invasion deeper than 5 mm and PNI.Conclusion. For high-risk cSCC, SNB is a safe and feasible staging technique. The total number of high risk features and certain combinations of high-risk features predicted metastasis better than individual high-risk features.

TI  - Phenological metrics of the grassland vegetation of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that plant phenology studies allow establishing relationships between phenological patterns of vegetation and changes caused by climate variability, the aim of this study was to obtain phenological metrics for the predominant grassland typologies in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil (latitudes 27 degrees 05' and 33 degrees 45' S and longitudes 49 degrees 43' and 57 degrees 39' W) and to evaluate the spatial-temporal distribution pattern of these metrics under the influence of the subtropical climate variability. The phenological metrics were obtained based on the time series of the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), of the sensor MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), for the period from 2001 to 2014, through the Timesat program. Eleven phenological metrics were extracted, identifying the presence of two spatial distribution patterns of grass-dominated typologies in the Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, one located in the south-central region and the other located in the northeast, along the coast and in the western portion of the state. In addition, it was also observed that the phenological pattern of the grassland vegetation of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is controlled by the seasonality of vegetation, mainly associated with the variations in air temperature.

TI  - Historical Prerequisites for the Formation, Worldview, and Aesthetics of Romanticism: Specificity of the Ukrainian Model
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Romanticism is one of the most interesting phenomena in the history of the spiritual culture of mankind. The emergence of Romanticism in the late 18th - early 19th centuries is called "the romantic revolution in the art culture" by most researchers. The purpose of the study is to determine the socio-cultural prerequisites for the emergence of Romanticism as a global cultural movement. The basic philosophical traits of Romanticism and the theoretical concept of romantic art formed in the circle of German aesthetes are considered. The specificity of Ukrainian Romanticism is defined. The article proves that it is inextricably intertwined with the upholding of the Ukrainian national idea. The research is based on aesthetic-cultural, historical, comparative methods, and the method of system analysis. In terms of style, Romanticism is not only an artistic style but also a broad direction. It is based on the principle of freedom. Human personality with its individuality and uniqueness becomes the highest value. People are considered capable of creating new worlds and inspiring reality. A characteristic feature of the movement is the principle of universalism which combines art, philosophy, and science. Slavic Romanticism in many aspects is similar to Western European, but at the same time, it has pronounced national character and originality. The formation of the Romanticism in Ukraine has contributed to the awakening of national consciousness, the affirmation of cultural traditions, language, and literature. Ukrainian Romanticism is closely linked to the national liberation movement which has defined the themes and motives of this direction. The article systematizes the worldview of European and Ukrainian Romanticism, clarifies the key problems of romantic ethics and aesthetics. An attempt to reveal the conformity of nationally oriented ideas of Ukrainian Romanticism with the modern worldview and the idea of national consciousness of the Ukrainian society was made.

TI  - Assessing climate change and adaptive capacity at local scale using observed and remotely sensed data
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability and change impacts are manifesting through declining rainfall totals and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts, floods and heatwaves. These environmental changes are affecting mostly rural populations in developing countries due to low adaptive capacity and high reliance on natural systems for their livelihoods. While broad adaptation strategies exist, there is need to contextualise them to local scale. This paper assessed rainfall, temperature and water stress trends over time in Capricorn District, South Africa, using Standardized Precipitation Index, Thermal Heat Index, and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy of water stress. Observed rainfall and temperature data from 1960 to 2015 was used to assess climatic variations, and NDVI was used to assess water stress from 2000 to 2019. Results show a marked increase in drought frequency and intensity, decreasing rainfall totals accompanied by increasing temperatures, and increasing water stress during the summer season. Long-term climatic changes are a basis to develop tailor-made adaptation strategies. Eighty-one percent of the cropped area in Capricorn District is rainfed and under smallholder farming, exposing the district to climate change risks. As the intensity of climate change varies both in space and time, adaptation strategies also vary depending on exposure and intensity. A combination of observed and remotely sensed climatic data is vital in developing tailor-made adaptation strategies.

TI  - Accounting for Seasonal Land Use Dynamics to Improve Estimation of Agricultural Irrigation Water Withdrawals
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of water withdrawals for irrigation is essential for managing water resources in cultivated tropical catchments. These water withdrawals vary seasonally, driven by wet and dry seasons. A land use map is one of the required inputs of hydrological models used to estimate water withdrawals in a catchment. However, land use maps provide typically static information and do not represent the hydrological seasons and related cropping seasons and practices throughout the year. Therefore, this study assesses the value of seasonal land use maps in the quantification of water withdrawals for a tropical cultivated catchment. We developed land use maps for the main seasons (long rains, dry, and short rains) for the semi-arid Kikuletwa catchment, Tanzania. Three Landsat 8 images from 2016 were used to develop seasonal land use land cover (LULC) maps: March (long rains), August (dry season), and October (short rains). Quantitative and qualitative observation data on cropping systems (reference points and questionnaires/surveys) were collected and used for the supervised classification algorithm. Land use classifications were done using 20 land use and land cover classes for the wet season image and 19 classes for the dry and short rain season images. Water withdrawals for irrigated agriculture were calculated using (1) the static land use map or (2) the three seasonal land use maps. Clear differences in land use can be seen between the dry and the other seasons and between rain-fed and irrigated areas. A difference in water withdrawals was observed when seasonal and static land use maps were used. The highest differences were obtained for irrigated mixed crops, with an estimation of 572 million m(3)/year when seasonal dynamic maps were used and only 90 million m(3)/year when a static map was used. This study concludes that detailed seasonal land use maps are essential for quantifying annual irrigation water use of catchment areas with distinct dry and wet seasonal dynamics.

TI  - Urban Land Use and Land Cover Change Prediction via Self-Adaptive Cellular Based Deep Learning With Multisourced Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban sustainable development becomes an essential goal presented in "2030 Agenda for Sustainable development" by the United Nations. Urban land use and land cover (LULC) change prediction, which is a significant indicator to evaluate urban construction strategy, urges to be solved. Remote sensing technique and neural network, are two practical tools widely utilized in urban LULC change prediction. Because of the rapid improvement of remote sensing technique, urban data can be periodically captured in a short time interval. A large amount of data cause the conventional neural networks method having bad efficiency in dealing with it. Moreover, as human activities are in high intensity in the urban area, society related factors require to be taken into consideration in urban land change trend prediction. In this article, a self-adaptive cellular-based deep learning analysis method by utilizing the multisourced data is proposed for urban LULC change prediction. Multisourced data, including weather related data, economy related data, construction related data, and remote sensing data, are normalized and formalized by the proposed self-adaptive cellular-based method. Deep learning long short term memory neural network, which is an advanced model of recurrent neural network and has a strong ability in dealing with sequence data, is utilized to urban LULC change prediction. Remote sensing data captured from 1984 to 2016 are utilized to conduct experiments. Experiment results illustrate that the proposed method can effectively and efficiently make LULC change prediction, and the accuracy is up to 93.1%.

TI  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis in Syria: A review of available data during the war years: 2011-2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has historically been reported from Syria. Since 2011, the country has been affected by a war, which has impacted health and health services. Over the same period, an increase in the number of cases of CL has been reported from several areas across the country and by a number of authors. This study aims to provide the first quantitative evidence of the epidemiological evolution of CL in Syria during the war.Materials and methodsData on number of CL cases for the period 2011-2018 were extracted from three different surveillance systems: the Ministry of Health (MoH) routine surveillance system, the MoH/ WHO sentinel-syndromic Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS), and surveillance data collected by the international nongovernmental organization (NGO) the MENTOR Initiative. Data were cleaned and merged to generate the best possible estimates on number of CL cases; incidence of CL was also calculated based on data on resident population. Data reported from the years preceding the conflict (2007-2010) were also added to the analysis for comparative purposes.ResultsThe analysis of data from the three available sources over the period considered indicates that number of reported cases progressively grew from prewar levels to reach a peak in 2015, decreased in 2016, remained stable in 2017, and increased again in 2018. Such a trend was mirrored by changes in incidence of infection. Some governorates, which used to report low numbers of CL cases, started recording higher number of cases after the onset of the war.ConclusionThe war coincided with a major rise in reported number of CL cases and incidence of infection, although an increasing trend was already appreciable before its onset.

TI  - PolSARNet: A Deep Fully Convolutional Network for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has successfully improved the classification accuracy of optical remote sensing images. Recent works attempted to transfer the success of these techniques to the microwave domain to classify Polarimetric SAR data. So far, most deep learning networks separate amplitude and phase as separate input images. In this article, we present a deep fully convolutional network that uses real-valued weight kernels to perform pixel-wise classification of complex-valued images. We evaluated the performance of this network by comparing it with support vector machine, Random Forest, complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN), and a network that uses amplitude and phase information separately as real channels. The evaluation was done on a quad-polarized AIRSAR image and a dual-polarimetric multitemporal Sentinel-1 data acquired over Flevoland, the Netherlands. The proposed method achieved higher accuracy compared to all other networks with the same architecture.

TI  - Structural development following stand-replacing disturbance in a boreal mixedwood forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of forest stand successional pathways, and responses to disturbances, is crucial for improved sustainable management of the resource. Forest structure, one attribute of which is the size and height distribution of trees in a stand (known as the stem size distribution; SSD), is highly sensitive to changes in stand dynamics. However, monitoring changes in SSD can be difficult and costly, especially across large spatial extents and by different disturbance types and species groups. As a result, forest managers increasingly utilise three-dimensional remote sensing such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) as a means of modeling forest structure in a cost-effective and spatially consistent manner. In this study, approximately 7000 ALS-derived SSDs representing a chronosequence of over 50 years of forest disturbance in Alberta, Canada were used to evaluate differences in structural development by species groups and disturbance types. Stands were clustered into three structural development phases based on ALS-derived SSDs. Results showed no difference in SSDs for early development phases, but significantly higher proportions of trees in medium-sized diameter classes (up to 25 cm diameter at breast height) in previously burned stands than in previously harvested stands. For each structural development phase, in both burned and harvested stands, there was no significant difference in modeled SSD among species groups. No difference in SSD for each phase was also seen when comparing previously burned to harvested stands for mixed species and white spruce stands. However, aspen and pine-dominated stands had significantly higher proportions of larger trees in burned stands than harvested stands in the second and third phase of structural development. Results from this study provide valuable insights to the current state of the forest, as well as an improved understanding of the general patterns of structural development following disturbance.

TI  - <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Tilmanocept Versus <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Sulfur Colloid in Lymphoscintigraphy: Sentinel Lymph Node Identification and Patient-Reported Pain
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphoscintigraphy plays a vital role in sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification in oncologic breast surgery. The effectiveness of SLN localization and the degree of patient pain were compared between filtered Tc-99m-sulfur colloid (Tc-99m-SC) and Tc-99m-tilmanocept. Methods: A retrospective review of patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy for breast cancer using (TcSC)-Tc-99m (June 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011) or Tc-99m-tilmanocept (June 1, 2013, to January 31, 2014) was performed. SLN appearance time and uptake, SLN pathology, proportion of positive SLNs removed, and pain scores were compared for each radiopharmaceutical using the chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and unequal variance t test, as appropriate. Results: In total, 76 patients, with 86 evaluated axillae, underwent lymphoscintigraphy: 29 with Tc-99m-SC and 47 with Tc-99m-tilmanocept. The mean SLN appearance time was 11.0 min for Tc-99(m)-SC and 19.3 min for Tc-99m-tilmanocept (P = 0.003). There was no difference in the mean transit uptake percentage: 2.2% for Tc-99m-SC and 1.9% for Tc-99m-tilmanocept (P = 0.55). Tc-99m-tilmanocept identified a greater proportion of intraoperative blue nodes than did Tc-99m-SC (P = 0.03). There was no significant difference between Tc-99m-SC and Tc-99m-tilmanocept in the number of SLNs removed, number of patients with positive SLNs, or pain score. Conclusion: Tc-99m-SC use in lymphoscintigraphy is an acceptable alternative to Tc-99m-tilmanocept for SLN detection in breast cancer, on the basis of the similarity in intraoperative SLN identification and pain scores.

TI  - Total Column Ozone, Precipitable Water Content and Aerosol Optical Thickness Over Atigre Village, a Tropical Station: First Observations
T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we report first-time observations of total column ozone (TCO), aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and precipitable water content (PWC) at five different wavelengths using compact, handheld, multichannel sun photometer (Microtops II ozonometer) at Atigre village (16.74 degrees N latitude, 74.37 degrees E longitude, 604 ms altitude above sea level). The three optical filters at wavelengths 305 nm, 312 nm and 320 nm are used to detect the TCO, while two optical filters 936 nm and 1020 nm are used to detect the PWC and AOT, respectively. We have been collecting data from September 1, 2017, and 122 days are selected from September 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, to present as first observations of TCO, AOD and PWC. The mean values of TCO, AOT and PWC are found to be 261.2 (+/- 9.22) DU, 0.25 (+/- 0.04) and 1.98 (+/- 0.79) cm, respectively, during this period. The TCO measurements taken by the Microtops II ozonometer are compared with the ozone monitoring instrument satellite data over Atigre. We found that PWC and AOT values are negatively correlated (- 0.54) during monsoon season, while they show positive correlation (0.63) during other seasons with 90% significance level. The diurnal variation of TCO, PWC and AOT differ in monsoon and the post-monsoon season.

TI  - Classification of Geophysical Basins Derived From SRTM and Cartosat DEMs via Directional Granulometries
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns from terrestrial surfaces have great potential to better understand the surficial phenomena and processes. This article provides an approach for classification of the hierarchically partitioned basins, subbasins, and watersheds with respect to high-directional granulometric index, low-directional granulometric index, and global granulometric index. Grayscale global and directional granulometric indexes of basin and corresponding watersheds derived from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Cartosat digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Lower Indus subbasin of peninsular India are computed. The end results shown are in the forms of watersheds categorized and classified according to global and high- and low-directional grayscale granulometric indexes. It is interesting to observe that the classification of watersheds derived from SRTM and Cartosat DEMs, respectively, yielded similar results, suggesting it would be worthwhile to explore the potential relationships between the directional granulometric indexes of the watersheds and their resistance to perturbations caused by endogenic and exogenic forces. It is also observed that the orientation of watersheds and the general flow direction within those watersheds are in the direction in which the watersheds yield high-directional granulometric index.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 65-year-old woman was treated with breast-conserving therapy for dissection of the left breast and axillary lymph nodes. Histopathological diagnosis was invasive breast cancer(scirrhous), T1cN2M0, stageⅡB, ER+/PgR+/HER2-. Approximately 4 years later, a mass found in her left breast was confirmed to be ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence(IBTR). Left mastectomy was performed because no clear metastasis was found on whole-body examination. Histopathological diagnosis was invasive breast cancer(solid-tubular), ER-/PgR-/HER2-. IBTR was of a different type, compared to the primary breast cancer. In the follow-up period, multiple axillary lymph node metastases were found in the right axilla. Histopathologically, 20 lymph node metastases were found, and ER-/PgR-/HER2-breast cancer-related lymph node recurrence was diagnosed. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy(PTX, TS-1)was administered. In the 10 years following IBTR, there has been no recurrence, and it is thought to be completely cured. Usually, contralateral axillary lymph node recurrence is treated the same way as distant metastases because they are extra-regional lymph nodes; however, this strategy is not applicable to IBTR. When surgery is performed for IBTR, the contralateral axillary lymph node may become a new sentinel lymph node, and thus, sufficient examination and accurate risk assessment may be necessary before surgery for local control.

TI  - Reconciliation of computational fluid dynamics and observations in complex terrain through conditional resampling
T2  - JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 10-min statistics of the turbulence observed on masts often vary with wind speed. On the other hand, the wind engineering computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis often carried out under adiabatic conditions assumes Reynolds number independence. Provided the prescribed upwind condition of CFD corresponds to the ensemble of strong wind, conditional sampling and averaging the observation may be a feasible process to correlate CFD results with the observation. Using comprehensive observation data obtained from complex terrains and operating a suite of large-eddy simulations with O (10 m) horizontal grid resolution, we demonstrate how observation with ensemble averages and conditional samplings can be reconciled with CFD. We find that selecting a high wind speed (approximately 10 m/s at 60 m above ground level) and taking the average of ten sets of 10-min data (corresponding to a sample of 6000 points at 1 Hz) yields better consistency with CFD results. We demonstrate that conditional sampling is more effective than increasing the ensemble size. This tendency is further confirmed when the ensemble size is evaluated by how many times eddies pass through the observation mast.

TI  - Glacier Flow Dynamics of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago in Russian High Arctic Using the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) Technique
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity is one of the most important parameters to understand glacier dynamics. The Severnaya Zemlya archipelago is host to many glaciers of which four major ice caps encompassing these glaciers are studied, namely, Academy of Sciences, Rusanov, Karpinsky, and University. In this study, we adopted the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) method utilizing ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 datasets, with a temporal resolution of 14 days. The observed maximum velocity for one of the marine-terminating glaciers in the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap was 72.24 cm/day (approximate to 263 m/a). For the same glacier, an increment of 3.75 times the flow rate was observed in 23 years, compared to a previous study. This has been attributed to deformation in the bed topography of the glacier. Glaciers in other ice caps showed a comparatively lower surface velocity, ranging from 7.43 to 32.12 cm/day. For estimating the error value in velocity, we selected three ice-free regions and calculated the average value of their observed movement rates by considering the fact that there is zero movement for ice-free areas. The average value observed for the ice-free area was 0.09 cm/day, and we added this value in our uncertainty analysis. Further, it was observed that marine-terminating glaciers have a higher velocity than land-terminating glaciers. Such important observations were identified in this research, which are expected to facilitate future glacier velocity studies.

TI  - Multi-scale statistical properties of disaggregated SMOS soil moisture products in Australia
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture has a strong impact on climate, hydrology and agronomy at different space scales, from the continent global scale to the local watershed. Passive microwave sensors, like SMOS satellite (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), allow a global study of soil moisture on the entire globe. To have access to kilometric variability, disaggregation algorithms have been developed, such as the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh). This method improves the space resolution of SMOS soil moisture from 40 km to 1 km. To do this, it combines coarse-scale (approximate to 40 km) SMOS products with fine-scale (approximate to 1 km) optical/thermal data. Validation studies on specific scales showed the potential of DisPATCh to enhance the spatio-temporal correlation of disaggregated SM with in-situ measurements, under low-vegetated semi-arid regions. Although the efficiency of the method was revealed in these regions, no studies fully explored its statistical behavior over a continuum of space scales. In this paper, we studied and compared the spatial mull-scale statistics of the different input and output datasets involved in DisPATCh downscaling. To do this, we applied spectral and multifractal analysis on the respective products for the region of southeastern Australia, from June to December 2010. Fractal and multifractal properties (in the framework of the Universal Multifractal model) were observed on inputs of DisPATCh (SMOS soil moisture, MODIS vegetation indices and surface temperature), which confirmed and completed some results reported in existing literature. For the output disaggregated soil moisture, two scaling regimes were observed, with a transition scale observed at about ten kilometers. Considering spectral analysis, at large scales (> 10 km), disaggregated soil moisture was found to have the same scaling as the original SMOS soil moisture. On finer scales (< 10 km), a different behavior was noticed, with a higher value of the slope of the power spectrum. The same scale break was detected on statistical moments, showing that both spectral and multifractal properties of DisPATCh soil moisture are characterized by this twofold scaling signature.

TI  - Structural Building Damage Detection with Deep Learning: Assessment of a State-of-the-Art CNN in Operational Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can provide the basis for timely and efficient building damage maps that are of fundamental importance to support the response activities following disaster events. However, the generation of these maps continues to be mainly based on the manual extraction of relevant information in operational frameworks. Considering the identification of visible structural damages caused by earthquakes and explosions, several recent works have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) outperform traditional methods. However, the limited availability of publicly available image datasets depicting structural disaster damages, and the wide variety of sensors and spatial resolution used for these acquisitions (from space, aerial and UAV platforms), have limited the clarity of how these networks can effectively serve First Responder needs and emergency mapping service requirements. In this paper, an advanced CNN for visible structural damage detection is tested to shed some light on what deep learning networks can currently deliver, and its adoption in realistic operational conditions after earthquakes and explosions is critically discussed. The heterogeneous and large datasets collected by the authors covering different locations, spatial resolutions and platforms were used to assess the network performances in terms of transfer learning with specific regard to geographical transferability of the trained network to imagery acquired in different locations. The computational time needed to deliver these maps is also assessed. Results show that quality metrics are influenced by the composition of training samples used in the network. To promote their wider use, three pre-trained networks-optimized for satellite, airborne and UAV image spatial resolutions and viewing angles-are made freely available to the scientific community.

TI  - Persistence of High In Vivo Efficacy and Safety of Artesunate-Amodiaquine and Artemether-Lumefantrine as the First- and Second-Line Treatments for Uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Malaria 10 Years After Their Implementation in Gabon
T2  - ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) have been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria since 2005 in Gabon. Since 2011, a rebound of malaria morbidity has been observed in this country, while no survey evaluating ACT efficacy was performed. During the same period, parasite resistance against artemisinin has been reported in Asia. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of these two drugs in two sentinel sites of Gabon 10 years after their implementation. Methods Children aged from 12 to 144 months with uncomplicated malaria were recruited at the Regional Hospital of Melen, Libreville and in the Urban Health Center of Franceville between March 2014 and September 2015. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated according to the WHO 2008 protocol of 28-day follow-up and PCR-uncorrected/corrected treatment outcomes were assessed. Results One hundred and eighty-five children (98 ASAQ and 89 AL) were followed up until day 28. The PCR-corrected ACPR was 98.9% for AS-AQ and 96.4% for AL. Late therapeutic failure rate was 3.6% and 1.1% for AL and AS-AQ, respectively (p = 0.2). Adverse events and serious adverse events were rarely observed with both treatments. Conclusion AS-AQ and AL are still efficacious and well-tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Gabonese children.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of ground and satellite-based aerosol for air quality assessment in the Southeast Asia region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations for regional air quality assessment rely on comprehensive spatial coverage, and daily monitoring with reliable, cloud-free data quality. We investigated spatiotemporal variation and data quality of two global satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products derived from MODIS and VIIRS imagery. AOD is considered an essential atmospheric parameter strongly related to ground Particulate Matter (PM) in Southeast Asia (SEA). We analyze seasonal variation, urban/rural area influence, and biomass burning effects on atmospheric pollution. Validation indicated a strong relationship between AERONET ground AOD and both MODIS AOD (R-2 = 0.81) and VIIRS AOD (R-2 = 0.68). The monthly variation of satellite AOD and AERONET AOD reflects two seasonal trends of air quality separately for mainland countries including Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan, Hong Kong, and for maritime countries consisting of Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and Timor Leste. The mainland SEA has a pattern of monthly AOD variation in which AODs peak in March/April, decreasing during wet season from May-September, and increasing to the second peak in October. However, in maritime SEA, AOD concentration peaks in October. The three countries with the highest annual satellite AODs are Singapore, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. High urban population proportions in Singapore (40.7%) and Hong Kong (21.6%) were associated with high AOD concentrations as expected. AOD values in SEA urban areas were a factor of 1.4 higher than in rural areas, with respective averages of 0.477 and 0.336. The AOD values varied proportionately to the frequency of biomass burning in which both active fires and AOD peak in March/April and September/October. Peak AOD in September/October in some countries could be related to pollutant transport of Indonesia forest fires. This study analyzed satellite aerosol product quality in relation to AERONET in SEA countries and highlighted framework of air quality assessment over a large, complicated region.

TI  - Mapping floods in the middle Zambezi Basin using earth observation and hydrological modeling techniques
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lower Middle Zambezi catchment, on the Zimbabwean side, is vulnerable to floods almost every year. In this work, the causes and impacts of floods in the Mbire District of the Middle Zambezi Basin are investigated. An algorithm based on the binary logistic regression is used together with MODIS NDVI images to determine the spatial and temporal variation of flood inundation. The HEC-HMS model is used to simulate rainfall time series at daily time step. The quantified peak flow is given as an input to a mono-dimensional hydraulic model, HEC-RAS. Results from the mapped inundated areas for the period 2005 to 2015 showed that 16 January 2006 had the highest flooded area of 1934 km(2). Factors explaining causes of flooding were distance from surface water bodies. The simulated flooded areas obtained are used to deepen our understanding of the contribution of geomorphic features towards flooding as well as the extent of flooding. Results obtained contribute towards defining new strategies for prompt flood risk management in the District.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to verify the findings of a recent National Cancer Database (NCDB) study that identified factors predicting occult nodal involvement in cutaneous head and neck melanoma (CHNM) while identifying additional predictors of occult nodal metastasis and comparing two distinct cancer databases.METHODS: Cases of CHNM in the SEER database diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 were identified. Demographic information and oncologic data were obtained. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify factors associated with pathologic nodal positivity.RESULTS: There were 34002 patients with CHNM identified. Within this population, 16232 were clinically node-negative, 1090 of which were found to be pathologically node-positive. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of occult nodal metastasis included increasing depth of invasion (stepwise increase in adjusted odds ratio [OR]), nodular histology (aOR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.21-1.80]), ulceration (aOR: 1.74 [95% CI: 1.48-2.05]), and mitoses (aOR: 1.86 [95% CI: 1.36-2.54]). Factors associated with a decreased risk of occult nodal metastasis included female sex (aOR: 0.80 [0.67-0.94]) and desmoplastic histology (aOR: 0.37 [95% CI: 0.24-0.59]). Between the SEER database and the NCDB, factors associated with occult nodal involvement were similar except for nodular histology and female sex, which did not demonstrate significance in the NCDB.CONCLUSION: Regarding clinically node-negative CHNM, the SEER database and the NCDB have similarities in demographic information but differences in baseline population sizes and tumor characteristics that should be considered when comparing findings between the two databases.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - A spatial pattern analysis of forest loss in the Madre de Dios region, Peru
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, the Peruvian Amazon has experienced a rapid change in forest cover due to the expansion of agriculture and extractive activities. This study uses spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in a cloud-computing platform to map forest loss within and outside indigenous territories, protected areas, mining concessions, and reforestation concessions within the Madre de Dios Region in Peru. The study area is focused on key areas of forest loss in the western part of the Tambopata National Reserve and surrounding the Malinowski River. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus surface reflectance data spanning 2013-2018 were analyzed using cloud-based SMA to identify patterns of forest loss for each year. High-resolution Planet Dove (3m) and RapidEye (5m) imagery were used to validate the forest loss map and to identify the potential drivers of loss. Results show large areas of forest loss, especially within buffer zones of protected areas. Forest loss also appears in the Kotsimba Native Community within a 1 km buffer of the Malinowski River. In addition to gold mining, agriculture and pasture fields also appear to be major drivers of forest loss for our study period. This study also suggests that gold mining activity is potentially not restricted to the legal mining concession areas, with 49% of forest loss occurring outside the mining concessions. Overall accuracy obtained for the forest loss analysis was 96%. These results illustrate the applicability of a cloud-based platform not only for land use land cover change detection but also for accessing and processing large datasets; the importance of monitoring not only forest loss progression in the Madre de Dios, which has been increasing over the years, especially within buffer zones, but also its drivers; and reiterates the use of SMA as a reliable change detection classification approach.

TI  - Impact of conservation management on land change: a case study in Guassa Community Conservation Area for the last 31 years (1986-2015)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impact of community conservation on land use and land cover dynamics in Guassa Community Conservation Area (GCCA), located in North Shewa Zone, Amhara Regional State, in Ethiopia. The Guassa community has a long tradition of conserving the locally known GUASSA (Festuca macrophylla) grass, which is important for the livelihoods of the community in the area for roof thatching, household uses and income generation. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and to identify the causes of this change in the GCCA. Satellite data were obtained from LANDSAT satellite images taken in 1986, 2003 and 2015. These images were classified with a maximum likelihood algorithm under a supervised classification method in ERDAS IMAGINE software and LULCC was analyzed using spatial analysis tools of ArcGIS 10.4 software. The local community was surveyed to determine the perception of the local community about LULCC in GCCA. The analysis determined five land cover categories: forest, bare land, farm land, shrubland and grassland. The forest land cover type constituted about 2.12% of the total area of GCCA in 1986 and increased by 1.82% from 1986 to 2003. Bare land increased over the years. Farm land at the border of GCCA decreased from 517.4 ha in 1986 to 495.09 ha in 2003 but increased to 540.8 ha in 2015. Findings from local community survey implied change of government, population growth, agricultural expansion, fire wood collection and settlement and increasing infrastructures as the major causes for the land use change of area. For sustainability of the area, it is important to strengthen and promote the traditional community conservation system which has kept the area for over 400 years.

TI  - Mapping of groundwater potential zones using sentinel satellites (-1 SAR and-2A MSI) images and analytical hierarchy process in Ketar watershed, Main Ethiopian Rift
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important natural resource for drinking and irrigation. Nevertheless, identifying potential sources in Ethiopia still presents a challenge in terms of time and costs for solving water scarcity problems and managing groundwater systems. To address these issues, this study combines optical and microwave remote sensing to identify groundwater potential zones in Ketar watershed, Ethiopia. Two Sentinel families, Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2AMulti-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images, were processed to derive a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and thematic layers (lineament density, soil moisture, land-use/land-cover, drainage density, slope, and geomorphology) for the study area. Secondary data were used to produce geological units, soil texture, and rainfall thematic layers. These nine total layers were considered proxies to signify groundwater occurrence and analyzed in GIS environment with a consistency ratio (CR = 0.013). Since each proxy contributes differently to the occurrence of groundwater, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used to assign individual weights to each factor. These factors were reclassified based on standard criteria and aggregated using Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). Results of a weight comparison show that geological unit, rainfall, soil texture, slope and lineament density are the dominant factors controlling groundwater occurrence. The WLC classifies the area of potential groundwater zones into five classes: very low (607.64 km2), low (942.19), moderate (777.2), high (598.74) and very high (428.23). These zones were validated using 43 existing data points of boreholes, hand-dug wells, and springs and have a correlation coefficient of 0.93. The outcome of this study emphasizes the importance of integrated optical and microwave remote sensing in identifying potential groundwater zones with a better accuracy to address issues of water scarcity in Ethiopia.

TI  - Monte Carlo-based optimization of a gamma probe system for sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard surgical technique to identify sentinel lymph node (SLN) for the staging of early breast cancer. Nowadays, two methods are used for the identification of SLN: blue dye method aiding visually and radioactive dye using gamma detector. A wide range of gamma probe systems with different design and performance are used in intra-operative surgery. The performance of the probes is evaluated by some parameters such as sensitivity, spatial resolution, angular resolution, and shielding efficiency.Methods: In this study, we simulated a gamma probe system, SURGEOGUIDE II based on CsI(Tl) scintillator, a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), and a tungsten collimator, using the MCNP4C Monte Carlo (MC) method and comparing with experimental measurement. Finally we modeled a series of probe with various crystal material, crystal length, and collimator hole length to evaluate the sensitivity and the spatial resolution in order to propose the optimal configuration.Results: The sensitivity of the system was measured as 2040 cps/MBq in 30 mm distance from the source. The spatial resolution and angular resolution were 43 mm and 70.. at the same distance, respectively. Sensitivity at 30 mm distance from the probe head was the highest for BGO crystal and was the lowest for NaI crystals. The sensitivity and spatial resolution have also been changed by increasing the length of the crystal to a certain amount and then remained constant.Conclusion: The results showed that the best choice for crystal was CdTe and CsI and the best length for CsI crystal in this type of the systems was 10 mm long. Also, based on the specific application, special probe should be designed taking the length of the collimator hole into consideration.

TI  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar study of recent eruptive activity at Shrub mud volcano, Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub mud volcano is one of three large mud volcanoes that comprise the Klawasi Group in the Copper River Basin of southcentral Alaska. Except for minor discharges in the mid-1950s when the group was first described, Shrub was dormant prior to its reactivation in summer 1996. From 1997 to 1999, Shrub vigorously erupted more than 5 x 10(5) m(3) of saline mud and CO2-rich gas at temperatures as high as 54 degrees C. Thereafter, activity wared but continued at least through 2015. We analyzed 192 interferograms derived from 106 synthetic apertur radar (SAR) images acquired by the JERS-1 (L-band), ERS-1/2 (C-band), RADARSAT-1 (C-band), and ALOS PALSAR (L-band) satellites to characterize ground deformation at Shrub before, during, and after its reactivation. Collectively, the interferograms span 1992-2000 and 2006-2011. We fit the observations with two deformation sources: a deflating, steeply-dipping, pipe-like body under the summit area and an inflating, shallow-dipping, sill-like body under the southwest flank. Both sources are shallow, with centroids less than 1 km beneath the summit. Prior to reactivation, the flank source inflated similar to 035 x 10(5) m(3)/yr from July 1992 to May 1996. During eruptive activity, the summit source deflated at higher rates that peaked at similar to 8.71 x 10(5) m(3)/yr during May-November 1997 and continued at similar to 0.95 x 10(5) m(3)/yr during the 2006-2011 observation window. Cumulative source-volume loss is comparable to the volume of mud erupted. We interpret the summit source as the volcano's feeder conduit that pressurized prior to the first SAR observation in 1992. Also before 1992, the conduit ruptured to feed a lateral intrusion of mud under the southwest flank, perhaps along a bedding plane in underlying glaciolacustrine deposits. The growing sill caused the southwest flank to inflate while it accommodated the mud supply from depth, which explains why we observed pre-eruptive inflation of the flank but not the summit. The summit began deflating when the conduit ruptured to the surface at the onset of eruptive activity. The flank source did not deflate concurrently because the weight of the thin overburden was insufficient to collapse the silL There is a suggestion in the modem topography that lateral intrusions under Shrub's southwest flank are a common feature of activity there.

TI  - Acceptance of disincentives to driving and pro-environmental transport intentions: the role of value structure, environmental beliefs and norm activation
T2  - TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to facilitate pro-environmental transport mode use it is important to promote acceptance for disincentives to driving and intentions to use public transport. The present study aims to investigate values, environmental beliefs and norm activation as predictors of these psychological cognitions. In addition, we examine gender differences in the psychological constructs entered into the model. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out in a randomized representative sample of the Norwegian population (n = 1043). The results showed that the model was well-suited to explain acceptance of disincentives to driving and, to a lesser extent, intention to use public transport. Biospheric values were strongly related to an elevated ecological worldview, whereas egoistic values were associated with a weaker ecological worldview. The values had indirect relations to acceptance of disincentives to driving and intention to use public transport through the ecological worldview and Norm activation model (NAM) components, but altruistic values were found to be associated with ascription of responsibility. Females reported stronger biospheric and altruistic values, and weaker egoistic and hedonic values than males. Females also reported a stronger ecological worldview and more awareness of consequences and personal norms in the NAM. Policy planners may focus on values, environmental beliefs and norm activation in order to increase the acceptance of disincentives to driving. A broad approach, which accounts for additional factors such as transport availability, spatial factors and 'pull' measures, may be more suitable to promote intentions of public transportation mode use.

TI  - Effects of regional vegetation cover degradation and climate change on dusty weather types
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust sources of west and south west of Iran are mainly from interior lands and neighbouring countries such as Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait which are influenced by climate fluctuations and land use/land cover (LULC) degradation. The aim of this research is to investigate the impacts of regional vegetation cover degradation (RVCD) and climate change on dusty weather types in Zagros Mountain in the west of Iran. The RVCD was evaluated using MODIS satellite image series from 2000 to 2016 and its trend was predicted by Markov chain test for 2030, 2060, and 2100. Daily data of nine climatic variables were used to identify the weather types (WTs) using principle component analysis and cluster analysis in the baseline period. The results showed that four principle components could account for 93 percent of data variances. The extreme temperatures, precipitation, and sunshine hours were predicted using HADCM3 and LARS-WG models under A1B scenario and wind speed and relative humidity computed using Man Kendall test to analyse the WTs from the past to the future. The findings indicated that six WTs could be observed of which about 77% and 84% of dusty days were recorded in Dusty WTs, including WT3 (warm/dry/windy) and WT4 (hot/very dry) during 1982-2000 and 2000-2016, respectively. Moreover, the frequency of Dusty WTs (WT3 and WT4) with the highest temperature and dryness in warm season will increase till 2060.

TI  - Monitoring nest incorporation of anthropogenic debris by Northern Gannets across their range
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic marine debris is a recognised global issue, which can impact a wide range of organisms. This has led to a rise in research focused on plastic ingestion, but quantitative data on entanglement are still limited, especially regarding seabirds, due to challenges associated with monitoring entanglement in the marine environment. However, for seabird species that build substantial surface nests there is the opportunity to monitor nest incorporation of debris that individuals collect as nesting material. Here, we monitored nest incorporation of anthropogenic marine debris by Northern Gannets (Mores bassanus) from 29 colonies across the species' range to determine a) the frequency of occurrence of incorporated debris and b) whether the Northern Gannet is a suitable indicator species for monitoring anthropogenic debris in the marine environment within their range. Using data obtained from visual observations, digital photography and published literature, we recorded incorporated debris in 46% of 7280 Northern Gannet nests, from all but one of 29 colonies monitored. Significant spatial variation was observed in the frequency of occurrence of debris incorporated into nests among colonies, partly attributed to when the colony was established and local fishing intensity. Threadlike plastics, most likely from fishing activities, was most frequently recorded in nests, being present in 45% of 5842 nests, in colonies where debris type was identified. Comparisons with local beach debris indicate a preference for threadlike plastics by Northern Gannets. Recording debris in gannet nests provides an efficient and non-invasive method for monitoring the effectiveness of actions introduced to reduce debris pollution from fishing activities in the marine environment.

TI  - Atmospheric injection of sulfur from the Medusae Fossae forming events
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A plethora of in-situ bulk chemical and mineralogical analyses, remote sensing data, and geochemical models suggest that the Martian crust is sulfur(S)-rich, exceeding the S content of terrestrial basalts by almost an order of magnitude. The main source of crustal S on Mars is the volcanic exhalation of SO2 and H2S gases. Volcanic ash, expelled along with gases, may be a sink for up to 30% of the exhaled S gas species. We analyze the elemental composition of the Martian shallow sub-surface using the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer to find areas that are simultaneously enriched in constituents of major volcanic gases such as S, Cl, and H2O. A large sedimentary deposit of likely pyroclastic origin called the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is located within this region of possibly extensive alteration by volcanic gases. Based on reasonable terrestrial analog estimates that the MFF scavenged, at maximum, 30% of the exhaled S gas species, we find that a significant amount of S (>10(17) kg) would have been delivered to the atmosphere over the time it took for the MFF to be deposited on Mars. The mass of the S emitted from the MFF-forming event(s) is up to 8 orders of magnitude higher than the mass of S emitted from the largest Quaternary volcanic eruption on Earth. Thus, volcanic degassing from the MFF forming events could have significantly affected surface geological processes, climate evolution, and habitability of Mars.

AB  - We report a case of bone marrowmetastases of breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. A 54-year-old woman underwent right partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She declined the endocrine therapy and was lost to follow-up after 3 postoperative years. After 9 postoperative years, she visited our hospital because of backache and an axillary lump. FDG-PET scan, incisional biopsy of the axillary lump, and bone marrowbiopsy revealed multiple bone and bone marrowmetastases of the breast cancer. She was treated with endocrine therapy(fulvestrant: FUL), which effectively decreased the FDG uptake in the metastatic lesions after 6 months. However, tumor markers elevated after 1 year and 6 months, and she is currently under combination therapy with aromatase inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the state of Parana, Brazil, there are no major changes in areas cultivated with annual crops, mainly due to environmental laws that do not allow expansions to new areas. There is a great contribution of the annual crops to the domestic demand of food and economic demand in the exports. Thus, the arca and distribution of annual crops are information of great importance. New methodologies, such as data mining, are being tested with the objective of analyzing and improving their potential use for classification of land use and land cover. This study used the classifiers decision tree and random forest with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal metrics on images from Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8. The results were compared with traditional methods spectral images and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). At first, seven classes were mapped (water bodies, sugarcane, urban area, annual crops, forest, pasture and reforestation areas); then, only two classes were considered (annual crops and other targets). When classifying the seven targets, both methods had corresponding results, showing global accuracy near 84%. NDVI temporal metrics showed producer's and user's accuracy for the annual crop class of 86 and 100%, respectively. However, if considering only two classes, the NDVI temporal metrics reached global accuracy of near 98% and producer's and user's accuracy above 94%.

TI  - Differential response to plant- and human-derived odorants in field surveillance of the dengue vector, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Linalool oxide (LO) and hexanoic acid (HA) represent plant- and human-derived odorants, respectively, previously found as attractants for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigated if a blend of both compounds can improve captures of this mosquito species in field trials in two dengue endemic sites, Kilifi and Busia Counties in Kenya. Ae. aegypti captures were significantly higher in Kilifi than Busia (chi(2)(1,142) = 170.63, P < 0.0001) and varied by treatments (chi(2)(5,137) = 151.19, P = 0.002). We found that CO2-baited BG Sentinel traps combined with a blend of both odorants decreased Ae. aegypti captures about 2- to 4-fold compared to captures with the individual compounds (LO or HA) used as positive controls. This was the case for all blends of LO and HA, irrespective of the doses tested. Our findings indicate that combining plant- and human-derived odors may elicit a masking effect in trapping Ae. aegypti. These results partly corroborate previous findings for malaria mosquitoes which showed that combining lures from both host sources either decreases or increases trap catches depending on the dose. Further investigations in the usefulness of combining plant and animal odorants in mosquito trapping are therefore necessary.

TI  - Wetland shift monitoring using remote sensing and GIS techniques: landscape dynamics and its implications on Isimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various forms of competition for water and amplified agricultural practices, as well as urban development in South Africa, have modified and destroyed natural wetlands and its biodiversity benefits. To conserve and protect wetlands resources, it is important to file and monitor wetlands and their accompanied land features. Spatial science such as remote sensing has been used with various advantages for assessing wetlands dynamic especially for large areas. Four satellite images for 1987, 1997, 2007 (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper) and 2017 (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager) were used in this study for mapping wetland dynamics in the study area. The result revealed that the natural landscapes in the area have experienced changes in the last three decades. Dense vegetation, sparse vegetation and water body have increased with about 14% (5976.495 km(2)), 23% (10,349.631km(2)) and 1% (324.621) respectively between 1987 and 2017. While wetland features (marshland and quag) in the same period experienced drastic decrease with an area coverage of about 16,651.07 km(2) (38%). This study revealed that the shift in the vegetation and water body extents have contributed detrimentally to the drastic declined in the Isimangaliso Wetland Park in recent years. Consequently, this development might have negative effects on the wetland ecosystem and biodiversity and the grave state of the wetland in the study area requires an urgent need for protection of the dregs wetland benefits.

TI  - Features of the Onomasticon Formation in the British Folk Tale
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify and systematise distinctive features of nominations given to creatures in British folk tales. The authors describe the mechanism of nomination and highlight regular patterns along which folk-tale creatures are named. The research is carried out in line with cognitively oriented ethnolinguistics. The subject matter is relevant due to the limited amount of research into the functioning of proper names in the texts of the British folk tale and their role in the creation of literary images. The analysis of onomastic realities helps to clarify specific features of the national worldview which holds them. The material of the study was provided by six collections of English, Scottish and Irish tales and a collection of fairy tales of Great Britain totalling 2,386 pages. Of these, the authors selected names of wizards and magical creatures and established their etymological, semantic and figurative components. Further, the authors drew data from lexicographic sources for the subsequent comparative analysis of the mythonymic nominations represented in the analysed folk tale texts and the mythonyms fixed in dictionaries. The method of continuous sampling, descriptive and comparative methods were used in the research. In addition, the authors carried out the analysis of word-formation and etymology, applied the method of linguocultural reconstruction of the content of nominations as well as some elements of statistical method. The authors analysed two thematic groups of nominations (nominations of wizards and nominations of magical creatures) and established their encyclopedic meaning, function and structural features. The conducted research allowed them to assert that the nominations of Germanic and Celtic origin prevail in both groups, which is explained by the connection of the characters and motifs of the folk tale with pagan rituals and the social and religious way of life of the British. Romanic nominations appeared later, under the influence of knightly novels. The results of the research proved that typification of characters is an inherent feature of folk tales; therefore, common names without additional emotional-aesthetic evaluation predominate among the names of wizards and magical creatures. In addition, the authors came to the conclusion that the folk tale onomastic space tends to be hierarchical. Romanic nominations of wizards and magical creatures are used as generic ones while Germanic and Celtic names act as more specific ones.

TI  - Assimilation of All-Sky SEVIRI Infrared Brightness Temperatures in a Regional-Scale Ensemble Data Assimilation System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble data assimilation experiments were performed to assess the ability of satellite all-sky infrared brightness temperatures and different bias correction (BC) predictors to improve the accuracy of short-range forecasts used as the model background during each assimilation cycle. Satellite observations sensitive to clouds and water vapor in the upper troposphere were assimilated at hourly intervals during a 3-day period. Linear and nonlinear conditional biases were removed from the infrared observations using a Taylor series polynomial expansion of the observation-minus-background departures and BC predictors sensitive to clouds and water vapor or to variations in the satellite zenith angle. Assimilating the all-sky infrared brightness temperatures without BC degraded the forecast accuracy based on comparisons to radiosonde observations. Removal of the linear and nonlinear conditional biases from the satellite observations substantially improved the results, with predictors sensitive to the location of the cloud top having the largest impact, especially when higher-order nonlinear BC terms were used. Overall, experiments employing the observed cloud-top height or observed brightness temperature as the bias predictor had the smallest water vapor, cloud, and wind speed errors, while also having less degradation to temperatures than occurred when using other predictors. The forecast errors were smaller during these experiments because the cloud-height-sensitive BC predictors were able to more effectively remove the large conditional biases for lower brightness temperatures associated with a deficiency in upper-level clouds in the model background.

TI  - Improving Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation of <i>Pinus densata</i> Forest in Yunnan of Southwest China by Spatial Regression using Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties in forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates resulting from over- and underestimations using remote sensing data have been widely studied. The uncertainties may occur due to the spatial effects of the plot data. In this study, we collected AGB data from a total of 147 Pinus densata forest sample plots in Yunnan of southwestern China and analyzed the spatial effects on the estimation of AGB. An ordinary least squares (OLS) and four spatial regression methods were compared for the estimation using Landsat 8-OLI images. Through the spatial analysis of AGB and residuals of model predictions, it was found that the spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity of the plot data could not be ignored. Compared with the OLS, the impact of the spatial effects on AGB estimation could be reduced slightly by the spatial lag model (SLM) and the spatial error model (SEM) and greatly reduced by the linear mixed effects model (LMM) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on the distributions of prediction residuals, global Moran's I, and Z score. The spatial regression models had better performance for model fitting and prediction because of the reduction in overestimations and underestimations for the forests with small and large AGB values, respectively. However, the reductions in the overestimations and underestimations varied depending on the spatial regression models. The GWR provided the most accurate predictions with the largest R-2 (0.665), the smallest root mean square error (34.507), and mean relative error (-9.070%) by greatly reducing the AGB interval for overestimations occurring and significantly increasing the threshold of AGB from 150 Mg/ha to 200 Mg/ha for underestimations. Thus, GWR offered the greatest potential of improving the estimation of Pinus densata forest AGB in Yunnan of southwestern China.

TI  - Environmental Surveillance Can Dynamically Track Ecological Changes in Enteroviruses
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental surveillance can be used to trace enteroviruses shed from human stool using a sewer network that is independent of symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. In this study, the local transmission of enteroviruses was analyzed using two wastewater treatment plants, which were relatively close to each other (15 km), designated as sentinels. Influent was collected at both sentinels once a month from 2013 to 2016, and viruses were isolated. Using neutralizing tests with type-specific polyclonal antisera and molecular typing, 933 isolates were identified as enteroviruses. Our results showed that the frequency of virus isolation varied for each serotype at the two sentinels in a time-dependent manner. Because echovirus 11 (Echo11) and coxsackievirus B5 isolates showed a high frequency and were difficult to distinguish, they were further grouped into various lineages based on the VP1 amino acid sequences. The prevalence of each lineage was visualized using multidimensional scaling. The results showed that Echo11 isolates of the same lineage were isolated continuously, similar to coxsackievirus B5 isolates of three lineages. Conversely, Echo1, Echo13, Echo18, Echo19, Echo20, Echo29, and Echo33 were isolated only once each. Our findings suggested that if an enterovirus is imported into the population, it may result in small-scale transmission, whereas if there are initially many infected individuals, it may be possible for the virus to spread to a wide area, beyond the local community, over time. In addition, our findings could provide in-sights into risk assessment of transmission for importation of poliovirus in polio-free countries and regions.IMPORTANCE In this study, we showed that environmental enterovirus surveillance can be used to monitor the propagation of nonpolio enteroviruses in addition to poliovirus detection. Since epidemiological studies of virus transmission based on the past were performed using specimens from humans, there were limitations to research design, such as specimen collection for implementation on a large-scale target population. However, environmental monitoring can dynamically track the ecological changes in enteroviruses in the region by monitoring viruses in chronological order and targeting the population within the area by monitoring viruses over time. We observed differences in the transmission of echovirus 11 and coxsackievirus B5 in the region according to lineage in a time-dependent manner and with a multidimensional scaling pattern.

TI  - Loggerhead sea turtles as sentinels in the western Mediterranean: antibiotic resistance and environment-related modifications of Gram-negative bacteria
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea turtles possess relevant characteristics to serve as sentinel species for monitoring the health of marine ecosystems, which is currently threatened. This study examined 35 loggerhead turtles from the western Mediterranean, focusing on the oral and cloacal prevalence of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, their antibiotic resistance and the influence of several variables linked both to the animal and the environment (i.e. estimated life stage; area, season and cause of recovery; plastic ingestion). Conventional bacteriology methods led to the isolation of bacterial families commonly regarded as opportunistic pathogens (i.e. Aeromonadaceae; Enterobacteriaceae; Pseudomonadaceae; Shewanellaceae; Vibrionaceae), but pointing out sea turtles as carriers of potential zoonotic agents. The high rates of antibiotic resistance, here detected, raise important concerns on the dissemination of this phenomenon in marine environments. Moreover, several of the examined variables showed a significant influence on the prevalence of bacterial families, strengthening the role of sea turtles as mirrors of their ecosystems.

TI  - Differing Sensitivities to Fire Disturbance Result in Large Differences Among Remotely Sensed Products of Vegetation Disturbance
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in high-performance computing (HPC) have promoted the creation of standardized remotely sensed products that map annual vegetation disturbance through two primary methods: (1) conventional approaches that integrate remote sensing-derived vegetation indices with field data and other data on disturbance events reported by public agencies on a year-to-year basis, and (2) "big'' data approaches using HPC to automate algorithms and workflows across an entire time series. Given the recent proliferation of these annual products and their potential utility for understanding vegetation dynamics, it is important for product end users (that is, practitioners and researchers in domains other than remote sensing) to understand the differences in their representations of disturbance and the conditions under which they report it. We use fire in California as a case study to compare reported disturbance across three widely used vegetation disturbance products-LANDFIRE (representing the conventional approach), Hansen Global Forest Change (GFC), and North America Forest Dynamics (NAFD), the latter two created from automated approaches. Using Google's Earth Engine, we compared their total and annual amounts of fire and non-fire disturbance for 2001-2010 and examined the products' reported disturbance across different environmental and burn conditions. We found that GFC and NAFD reported similar amounts of disturbance that were consistently much lower than LANDFIRE's reported disturbance across all years, regions, and habitats. We also found that despite the differences in amounts of reported disturbance, the products identified disturbance in similar ranges of bioclimatic conditions and habitat types, and thus, differing environmental conditions in areas reported as disturbed were not the drivers of the difference. Rather, we found that lower sensitivity to fire disturbance for GFC and NAFD, as compared to LANDFIRE, was a key driver of the overall differences in the amounts and locations of reported disturbance; both GFC and NAFD reported much lower amounts of fire disturbance than LANDFIRE across all burn conditions. Furthermore, the difference in reported disturbance between LANDFIRE and GFC/NAFD was greater for fire disturbance than for non-fire disturbance; LANDFIRE reported more than double the total amounts of fire disturbance of GFC and NAFD in the study period. Based on our results, we encourage end users to choose the appropriate disturbance product based not only on spatial extent and habitat but also on the disturbance type of interest (that is, fire and non-fire). Overall, rather than focusing on accuracy, our study quantifies the extent to which the products exhibited differences in the amounts and locations of reported disturbance to provide insight into these products' representations of disturbance and help end users evaluate and choose the most appropriate product for their needs.

TI  - Using Landsat-8 to Remotely Estimate and Observe Spatio-Temporal Variations of Total Suspended Matter in Zhoushan Coastal Regions
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is one of the important parameters for ocean water quality and aquatic environment assessment. Zhoushan Islands is located on the edge of Hangzhou Bay, where sediments present very high concentration and TSM shows suspended status for long-term. The distribution and variation of TSM in Zhoushan Islands have great impacts on its coastal water quality, ferry, fishery and tourism. Because of its high spatial resolution and open access, Landsat-8 imagery has been widely used for ocean color studies and hence providing good spectral information for observing variations of TSM in Zhoushan coastal regions. This study used in-situ measured TSM absorption coefficient (a(p) (440), m(-1)) and water surface spectra to develop the TSM remote sensing model based on Landsat-8 imagery, and results show that the S-function using blue and nearinfrared bands of Landsat-8 performed better than the other functions. The S-function is with the form a(p)= 3. 72/(0. 009+ e(-5.249B5/B2)). This function overcomes the shortcomings of previous inversion functions (e. g., linear, logarithmic, and exponential functions) which performed well for modeling datasets, but often failed when they were applied to real satellite images since spectral values in images are often much larger than those in the modeling dataset. Another problem of coastal and inland water color remote sensing is the atmospheric correction. The previous studies usually used a specific atmospheric correction method, but it might not return the best results. In this study, we tested and compared three types of atmospheric corrections models, FLAASH, 6S, and ACOLITE, and found that ACOLITE was better than the other two methods for ocean color remote sensing using Landsat-8, especially in blue band, where ACOLITE performed better than the FLAASH and 6S methods. The S-model was used to a series of Landsat-8 images covering the Zhoushan Islands from 2013 to 2018. The field measured and image-derived results show that TSM absorption coefficients in Zhoushan Islands were extremely high, ranging from 1. 64 to 417. 04 m(-1), with mean 118. 47 m(-1), which account for more than 90% of total water absorption coefficients. The measured above-surface spectra demonstrated typical spectral signatures of complex turbid coastal water, with two peaks within green and red bands and relatively high reflectance within red and near-infrared bands. Due to the high concentrations of the riverine discharged TSM, remote sensing reflectance in estuarine and coastal regions were much higher than those in open sea. TSM concentrations illustrated a clear downward gradient from Hangzhou Bay to open sea, and TSM in coastal areas such as Qushan, Yangshan and Ningbo were much higher than those in open sea area such as Dongji and Shengsi. TSM distribution pattern in coastal regions were usually more complex than those in offshore regions. TSM concentrations in winter were usually much higher than those in summer, where the highest was found in December with value of 413. 32 m(-1), and the lowest was found in August with value of 3. 69 m(-1). There are also local peaks of TSM during May and October. Our results indicate that the TSM spatio-temporal variations in Zhoushan Islands are not only controlled by many natural environmental factors, such as currents, tides, typhoons, monsoons, but also are significantly influenced by many human activities, such as ferry, ocean shipping, harbor projects and island tourism.

TI  - Deep learning classifiers for hyperspectral imaging: A review
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Advances in computing technology have fostered the development of new and powerful deep learning (DL) techniques, which have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of applications. Particularly, DL methods have been successfully used to classify remotely sensed data collected by Earth Observation (EO) instruments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a hot topic in remote sensing data analysis due to the vast amount of information comprised by this kind of images, which allows for a better characterization and exploitation of the Earth surface by combining rich spectral and spatial information. However, HSI poses major challenges for supervised classification methods due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples. These issues, together with the high intraclass variability (and interclass similarity) often present in HSI data-may hamper the effectiveness of classifiers. In order to solve these limitations, several DL-based architectures have been recently developed, exhibiting great potential in HSI data interpretation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current-state-of-the-art in DL for HSI classification, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used classifiers in the literature. For each discussed method, we provide quantitative results using several well-known and widely used HSI scenes, thus providing an exhaustive comparison of the discussed techniques. The paper concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to HSI classification. The source codes of the methods discussed in this paper are available from: https://github.com/mhaut/hyperspectral_deeplearning_review.

TI  - Next Generation Mapping: Combining Deep Learning, Cloud Computing, and Big Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of satellites orbiting the planet is generating massive amounts of data for Earth science applications. Concurrently, state-of-the-art deep-learning-based algorithms and cloud computing infrastructure have become available with a great potential to revolutionize the image processing of satellite remote sensing. Within this context, this study evaluated, based on thousands of PlanetScope images obtained over a 12-month period, the performance of three machine learning approaches (random forest, long short-term memory-LSTM, and U-Net). We applied these approaches to mapped pasturelands in a Central Brazil region. The deep learning algorithms were implemented using TensorFlow, while the random forest utilized the Google Earth Engine platform. The accuracy assessment presented F1 scores for U-Net, LSTM, and random forest of, respectively, 96.94%, 98.83%, and 95.53% in the validation data, and 94.06%, 87.97%, and 82.57% in the test data, indicating a better classification efficiency using the deep learning approaches. Although the use of deep learning algorithms depends on a high investment in calibration samples and the generalization of these methods requires further investigations, our results suggest that the neural network architectures developed in this study can be used to map large geographic regions that consider a wide variety of satellite data (e.g., PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8).

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network Model with Weighted Combination of Multi-scale Spatial Features for Crop Classification
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an advanced crop classification model that combines a procedure for weighted combination of spatial features extracted from multi-scale input images with a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. The proposed model first extracts spatial features from patches with different sizes in convolution layers, and then assigns different weights to the extracted spatial features by considering feature-specific importance using squeeze-and-excitation block sets. The novelty of the model lies in its ability to extract spatial features useful for classification and account for their relative importance. A case study of crop classification with multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI images in Illinois, USA was carried out to evaluate the classification performance of the proposed model. The impact of patch sizes on crop classification was first assessed in a single-patch model to find useful patch sizes. The classification performance of the proposed model was then compared with those of conventional two CNN models including the single-patch model and a multi-patch model without considering feature-specific weights. From the results of comparison experiments, the proposed model could alleviate misclassification patterns by considering the spatial characteristics of different crops in the study area, achieving the best classification accuracy compared to the other models. Based on the case study results, the proposed model, which can account for the relative importance of spatial features, would be effectively applied to classification of objects with different spatial characteristics, as well as crops.

TI  - Development of Satellite-based Drought Indices for Assessing Wildfire Risk
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the factors that can cause wildfires. Drought is related to not only the occurrence of wildfires but also their frequency, extent and severity. In South Korea, most wildfires occur in dry seasons (i.e. spring and autumn), which are highly correlated to drought events. In this study, we examined the relationship between wildfire occurrence and drought factors, and developed satellite-based new drought indices for assessing wildfire risk over South Korea. Drought factors used in this study were high-resolution downscaled soil moisture, Normalized Different Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Different Drought Index (NDDI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Drought indices were then proposed through weighted linear combination and one-class support vector machine (One-class SVM) using the drought factors. We found that most drought factors, in particular, soil moisture, NDWI, and PCI were linked well to wildfire occurrence. The validation results using wildfire cases in 2018 showed that all five linear combinations produced consistently good performance (> 88% in occurrence match). In particular, the combination of soil moisture and NDWI, and the combination of soil moisture, NDWI, and precipitation were found to be appropriate for representing wildfire risk.

TI  - Maximum UV Index Records (2010-2014) in Quito (Ecuador) and Its Trend Inferred from Remote Sensing Data (1979-2018)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To prevent adverse health effects, the World Health Organization promotes the diffusion of the ultraviolet radiation index (UVI), with messages promoting precautionary behaviors, through a scale that considers extreme UVI values to be larger than 11.0. This scale came from a proposal from Canada, a country with a mostly light-skinned population, which experiences maximum UVI values up to 10.0. A modified scale was proposed, adapted to the skin types and the UVI levels in South America, which considers extreme values larger than 16.0. The records from 2010 to 2014 indicated that UVI is frequently larger than 11.0 (40.0-76.1% of the days per month) in Quito (Ecuador). The number of days per month with levels larger than 16.0 varied between 0.7% and 32.0%. We found that the maximum UV index levels do not occur necessarily around the local solar noontime. As the basis for a self-warning system in Quito and based on their skin type and UVI levels, people should know the exposure time before damage can take place. The Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) computed the UVI at local solar noontime and under clear-sky conditions. The records from 2010 to 2014 were congruent with the corresponding TEMIS values. We did not identify any trend of the daily TEMIS UVI values during 1979 to 2018, which, used as a proxy, suggested the real UVI levels in Quito during 2010 to 2018 varied in a range similar to 1979-2009.

TI  - Building Footprint Extraction from Multispectral, Spaceborne Earth Observation Datasets Using a Structurally Optimized U-Net Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprint detection and outlining from satellite imagery represents a very useful tool in many types of applications, ranging from population mapping to the monitoring of illegal development, from urban expansion monitoring to organizing prompter and more effective rescuer response in the case of catastrophic events. The problem of detecting building footprints in optical, multispectral satellite data is not easy to solve in a general way due to the extreme variability of material, shape, spatial, and spectral patterns that may come with disparate environmental conditions and construction practices rooted in different places across the globe. This difficult problem has been tackled in many different ways since multispectral satellite data at a sufficient spatial resolution started making its appearance on the public scene at the turn of the century. Whereas a typical approach, until recently, hinged on various combinations of spectral-spatial analysis and image processing techniques, in more recent times, the role of machine learning has undergone a progressive expansion. This is also testified by the appearance of online challenges like SpaceNet, which invite scholars to submit their own artificial intelligence (AI)-based, tailored solutions for building footprint detection in satellite data, and automatically compare and rank by accuracy the proposed maps. In this framework, after reviewing the state-of-the-art on this subject, we came to the conclusion that some improvement could be contributed to the so-called U-Net architecture, which has shown to be promising in this respect. In this work, we focused on the architecture of the U-Net to develop a suitable version for this task, capable of competing with the accuracy levels of past SpaceNet competition winners using only one model and one type of data. This achievement could pave the way for achieving better performances than the current state-of-the-art. All these results, indeed, have yet to be augmented through the integration of techniques that in the past have demonstrated a capability of improving the detection accuracy of U-net-based footprint detectors. The most notable cases are represented by an ensemble of different U-Net architectures, the integration of distance transform to improve boundary detection accuracy, and the incorporation of ancillary geospatial data on buildings. Our future work will incorporate those enhancements.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring of glacier areal changes using multispectral and elevation data: A case study over Chhota-Shigri glacier
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Glacier studies are important for monitoring the hydrological cycle as well as the impact of climate change. Recent studies indicate that the glacier area-shrinking rate is accelerating specifically in the Himalayan glaciers. In this study, an integrated approach based on semi-automatic method has been used over the Chhota-Shigri glacier. The combination of multispectral (Landsat data from 1989 to 2015) and elevation data is used for delineation of glacier features. This comprehensive approach has integrated the remote sensing indices, thermal information and morphometric parameters generated using elevation data to delineate the glacier into three categories i.e. clean ice, ice mixed with debris (IMD) and debris. Results indicate that the areal extent of clean ice has significantly decreased whereas the IMD and debris cover area has increased from 1989 to 2015. The accuracy assessment is performed using a pan-sharpened image and field data. The overall accuracy obtained about 90.0% with a 0.895 kappa coefficient for the adopted approach. This glacier areal change information can be used for flow velocity measurements, hazard caused by glaciers, and the impact of climate change on glaciers.

TI  - Potential distribution model of <i>Leontochir ovallei</i> using remote sensing data
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the potential distribution of short-lived species with a narrow natural distribution range is a difficult task, especially when there is limited field data. The possible distribution of L. ovallei was modeled using the maximum entropy approach. This species has a very restricted distribution along the hyperarid coastal desert in northern Chile. Our results showed that local and regional environmental factors define its distribution. Changes in altitude and microhabitat related to the landforms are of critical importance at the local scale, whereas cloud cover variations associated with coastal fog was the principal factor determining the presence of L. ovallei at the regional level. This study verified the value of the maximum entropy in understanding the factors that influence the distribution of plant species with restricted distribution ranges.

TI  - Characterizing the influence of Atlantic water intrusion on water mass formation and phytoplankton distribution in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm water intrusion into Arctic fjords is increasingly affecting polar ecosystems. This study investigated how Atlantic water intrusion and tidewater glacial melting impacted water mass formation and phytoplankton distribution in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Field data were collected over a 2-week period during the height of the melt season in August 2014 and were contextualized within an 18-year regional MODIS satellite record. Since 1998, intruding waters have warmed by 4-5.5 degrees C, which has prevented sea ice formation and changed the characteristics of fjord bottom waters. Modeled light fields suggest that suspended sediment in this glacial meltwater has reduced the euphotic zone close to the ice face, contributing to lower phytoplankton concentrations in both persistent and intermittently sediment-laden meltwater plumes. However, measurements collected close to terrestrially terminating glaciers indicate that turbidity is significantly lower in the meltwater plumes, resulting in deep euphotic zones and high phytoplankton concentrations. The results of this study support a three-part conceptual model of the effects of warm-water intrusion on water mass formation and primary production within 10 km of tidewater glaciers. Initially, warm water intrusion reduces sea ice coverage, which increases the euphotic depth and increases phytoplankton biomass. Warm water intrusions may also result in increased melting of tidewater glaciers, enhanced sediment release, reduction in euphotic depth and reduction in phytoplankton biomass. Ultimately, as tidewater glaciers retreat and become terrestrially terminating, the sediment load decreases, the euphotic zone again increases, and phytoplankton biomass increases.

TI  - Dense DSM and DTM Point Cloud Generation Using CARTOSAT-2E Satellite Images for High-Resolution Applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this study is to provide a methodology to generate a dense point cloud of digital surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DTM) from 0.6 m GSD stereo images acquired by CARTOSAT-2E satellite of the Indian Space Research Organization. These products are required for many high-resolution applications such as mapping of watersheds and watercourses; river flood modeling; analysis of flood depth, landslide, forest structure, and individual trees; design of highway and canal alignment. The proposed method consists of several processes such as orienting the stereo images, DEM point cloud extraction using the semi-global matching, and DSM to DTM filtering. The stereo model is built by performing aero triangulation and block adjustment using the ground control points. The semi-global matching algorithm is used on the epipolar images to generate the DSM in the form of dense point cloud corresponding to one height point for each pixel. The planimetric and height accuracies are evaluated using orthoimages and DSM and found to be within 3-pixel (~ 2 m) range. A method for extracting DTM by ground point filtering, to discriminate the probable ground points and the non-ground points, is provided by using discrete cosine transformation interpolation. This robust method uses a weight function to differentiate the noise points from the ground points. The overall classification efficiency kappa (kappa) value averages at 0.92 for ground point classification/DTM extraction. The results of benchmarking of the GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation GPS receiver by operating it over IGS station, in static mode for collecting the checkpoints, also are presented.

TI  - Volcanic structures investigation through SAR and seismic interferometric methods: The 2011-2013 Campi Flegrei unrest episode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations from satellites provide high-resolution images of ground deformation allowing to infer deformation sources by developing advanced modeling of magma ascent and intrusion processes. Nevertheless, such models can be strongly biased without a precise model of the internal structure of the volcano. In this study, we jointly exploited two interferometric techniques to interpret the 2011-2013 unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc). The first is the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique, which provides highly-resolved spatial and temporal images of ground deformation. The second is the Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT), which images subsurface structures, providing the constraints necessary to infer the depth of the shallow source at CFc (between 0.8 and 1.2 km). We applied for the first time a tool to delineate the deformation source boundaries from the observed deformation maps: the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD) technique. The THD processes the vertical component of the ground deformation field detected through InSAR applied to COSMO-SkyMed data. The patterns retrieved by applying the THD technique show consistent spatial correlations with (1) the seismic group-velocity maps achieved through the ANT and (2) the distribution of the earthquakes nucleated during the unrest at similar to 1 km. High-velocity anomalies, the retrieved geometrical features of the deformation field, and the spatial distribution of seismicity coincide with extinct volcanic vents in the eastern part of the caldera (Solfatara/Pisciarelli and Astroni). Such a coincidence hints at a significant role of the extinct plumbing system in either constraining or channeling the eastward propagation of magmatic fluids. Here, we demonstrated that a joint analysis of the InSAR patterns, seismic structures, and seismicity allows us to model in space and time the characteristics and nature of the shallow deformation source at CFc. Using published literature, we show that the effects of structural heterogeneities at shallow depths may have a more significant early-stage impact on the evolution of the surface displacement signals than deeper magmatic sources: these secondary structural effects may produce local amplification in the deformation records which can be mistakenly interpreted as early signals of impending eruptions. The achieved results are particularly relevant for the understanding of the origin of deformation signal at volcanoes where magma propagation within sills is expected, as at CFc.

TI  - Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia as a Rare Side Effect of a Therapy with Pembrolizumab for Metastatic Melanoma
T2  - AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Checkpointinhibitors such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab or ipilimumab are indispensable substances in the treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma. By activation of cytotoxic T-cells they cause an antitumoral response and in many cases a multitude of autoimmune mediated side effects such as colitis, pneumonitis, thyreoiditis or hypophysitis that can usually be recognized quickly. However, there are rare side effects that are not recognized directly because they are not initially interpreted as such. We report the case of a 66-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma on her left lower leg in 2015 (nodular melanoma, tumor thickness 3 mm, BRAF, NRAS and c-kit wildtype). Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the ipsilateral groin was positive, a subsequent performed lymphadenectomy showed no further metastases. Six months later she developed lymph nodes metastases in the left groin and several cutaneous metastases on her left leg that could be treated by surgery and an adjuvant radiation (45 Gy). Only a few weeks later she developed a progression of disease with skin and lymph node metastases on her left leg and groin. As a complete surgical removal could not be attained a therapy with pembrolizumab was begun in November 2016. After 12 cycles of this therapy the patient developed of normochromic and normocytic anemia and a drop of haemoglobin (8.4 mg/dl) that needed to be treated with packed red blood cells. Gastric or intestinal bleeding could be ruled out by gastroscopy and coloscopy. A bone marrow biopsy could rule out the infiltration of the bone marrow by melanoma cells as well as a pure red cell anaplasia. Elevated lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) values, decreased values for haptoglobin and reticulocytes in combination with a positive direct Coombs test for c3d an autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with involvement of all precursors of the red cell line could be diagnosed. Subsequently, a therapy with methylprednisolone was initiated and led to a rapid improvement of lab values. Each attempt of a re-challenge with pembrolizumab led to a drop of haemoglobin again (6 mg/dl). Therefore, the therapy with pembrolizumab was stopped after 15 cycles, the patient showed no evidence of disease at time of termination. However, some months later the patient showed progression of disease and due to the non-existence of a BRAF-mutation we decided to begin a therapy with nivolumab. The patient did not develop a relapse of her AIHA. The development of an anemia is a rare side effect of therapies with checkpointinhibitors. In these cases either an AIHA or an aplastic anemia may be causative. Up to date there are only a few cases of anemia published that developed under treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. In most cases, anemia developed early after start of therapy and responded only hesitantly to treatment with corticosteroids. According to our knowledge there are only few cases published in which a re-exposure was possible without the development of a new episode of anemia. Some of the cases reported showed a fatal outcome. This elucidates the need of regularly performed lab controls during and even after stop of therapies with checkpointinhibitors. Fortunately, in our case AIHA did not reoccur during treatment with nivolumab. Whether this was due to the fact that pembrolizumab was replaced by nivolumab must currently remain to be unanswered.

TI  - Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration in Fragmented Mediterranean Areas by the Spatio-Temporal Fusion of NDVI Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration Actual evapotranspiration (ETA) is a fundamental component of the landwater cycle that can be predicted by the combination of meteorological data and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) observations. The proficient application of this approach to the retrospective study of fragmented areas, however, depends on the preliminary use of spatio-temporal fusion (STF) methods capable of integrating different satellite datasets. One of thesemethods is the Spatial Enhancer of Vegetation Index image Series (SEVIS), which has been recently developed to improve the annual NDVI datasets based on one or a few high spatial resolution images. This STF method is currently applied to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and TM/ETM+/OLI imagery taken over three fragmented areas in Tuscany (Central Italy), representative of different Mediterranean ecosystems, i.e., an urban grassland, a tomato field, and an olive grove. The performance of SEVIS is evaluated by comparing the ET A estimates obtained from the original (MODIS) and synthetic (MODIS plus TM/ETM+/OLI) NDVI datasets to ground ET A observations. The experimental results indicate that the original MODIS NDVI data cannot properly characterize the seasonal vegetation evolutions of the three study sites, which negatively affects the performance of ET A simulation. In contrast, such evolutions are reasonably reproduced by the synthetic NDVI datasets, which improves the accuracy of the ETA estimates both in terms of correlation and errors. The improvements are particularly evident during the summer dry period when theMODIS images are incapable of characterizing the actual vegetation response to water stress.

TI  - The July/August 2019 Lava Flows at the Sciara del Fuoco, Stromboli-Analysis from Multi-Sensor Infrared Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 July 2019 a rapid sequence of paroxysmal explosions at the summit craters of Stromboli (Aeolian-Islands, Italy) occurred, followed by a period of intense Strombolian and effusive activity in July, and continuing until the end of August 2019. We present a joint analysis of multi-sensor infrared satellite imagery to investigate this eruption episode. Data from the Spinning-Enhanced-Visible-and-Infra Red-Imager (SEVIRI) was used in combination with those from the Multispectral-Instrument (MSI), the Operational-Land-Imager (OLI), the Advanced-Very High-Resolution-Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Visible-Infrared-Imaging-Radiometer-Suite (VIIRS). The analysis of infrared SEVIRI-data allowed us to detect eruption onset and to investigate short-term variations of thermal volcanic activity, providing information in agreement with that inferred by nighttime-AVHRR-observations. By using Sentinel-2-MSI and Landsat-8-OLI imagery, we better localized the active lava-flows. The latter were quantitatively characterized using infrared VIIRS-data, estimating an erupted lava volume of 6.33 x 10(6) +/- 3.17 x 10(6) m(3) and a mean output rate of 1.26 +/- 0.63 m(3)/s for the July/August 2019 eruption period. The estimated mean-output-rate was higher than the ones in the 2002-2003 and 2014 Stromboli effusive eruptions, but was lower than in the 2007-eruption. These results confirmed that a multi-sensor-approach might provide a relevant contribution to investigate, monitor and characterize thermal volcanic activity in high-risk areas.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A technology for extracting along-track altimeter data collocated with space-irregular buoy measurements and data on the numerical simulation of waves is developed using AVISO altimetry data for the period 2013-2016. Data on the numerical simulation of waves are obtained on a regular spacetime grid for two wave models: WAM and its modified version, WAM-M. Satellite data are calibrated jointly and separately for each satellite using a system of 41 buoys. Both calibrations are then used to estimate mean-square-root deviations (RMSDs) of the Indian Ocean wind-wave height simulation data from their corresponding calibrated altimetry data. It is found that the calibration type does not significantly affect the studied RMSDs, but the RMSD values themselves have significant spatial variability. It is shown that it is possible to determine the advantages of some numerical models over others in terms of RMSD values in different zones of the Indian Ocean and the ocean in general. The reasons for the intermittency of RMSD values for the considered models depending on the Indian Ocean zone are discussed.

TI  - Approximation of the High-Temperature Fire Zone Based on Terra/MODIS Data in the Problem of Subpixel Analysis
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, an improved approach of the pixel-based analysis of the Terra/MODIS imagery is proposed. The approach allows us to improve the accuracy in estimating characteristics of the combustion zone when detecting thermal anomalies. The investigation is carried out based on the imagery of active vegetation fires in Siberian forests by the MODIS radiometer in the spectral ranges of 3930 to 3990 and 10780 to 11280 mu m (bands 21 and 31, respectively). It is proposed to describe the approximation of the temperature profile of the fire front using an exponential function. Using the nonuniform approximation of the temperature distribution on the surface in the vicinity of the active combustion zone allows us to determine the portion of the active pixel of the Terra/MODIS image with the given temperature excess over the background temperature in it. This improves the accuracy in extracting active combustion zones and classifying the heat release rate at the subpixel level. This approach is applicable to monitoring fire development phases in the near real time mode.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study is based on the processing of satellite imagery in the wave range 3.93-3.99 mu m (Terra/Modis satellite) and numerical simulation results. It has been found for combustion conditions in Siberian forests that the observed fire radiative power (FRP) is 15% of the total fire power. Variations between 10 and 30% depend on both the fire development scenario (specific burnup rate of 0.01-0.1 kg/m(2) s and fire front velocity of 0.01-0.1 m/s) and the conditions for remote imaging. Instrumental estimates for the ratio of fire areas by given intensity quantiles for Siberian forests are presented. The share of low-, medium-, and high-intensity fires is 41.2-58.9, 35.0-46.5, and 6.10-13.44% of the total area. Refined estimates of fire emissions have been obtained taking into account the amount of biomass burnt and variable burning intensity. The proposed method allows the mass of burned forest fuel materials (FFM) and direct fire emissions to be estimated quantitatively at a level 14-21% lower than the values calculated with the help of standard approaches. The estimates of direct carbon emissions in the given time interval of 2002-2016 were 83 +/- 21 Tg/year on average, which is 17% lower than the value 112 +/- 25 Tg/year obtained with the standard method.

TI  - When are assumptions shaken? A prospective, longitudinal investigation of negative life events and worldviews in a national sample
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Theorists maintain that negative life events (NLE) can alter worldviews, but evidence for this idea has been lacking. We present a model that raises three questions: (1) Do different types of NLE engender different types of worldview change? (2) Do factors that facilitate positive reappraisals of NLE buffer against worldview change? (3) Does change in stability of worldviews occur independent of change in worldview content? These questions were examined in data from a national U.S. sample of adults surveyed prospectively over a three-year period (N = 2138). NLE were reported by 91.6% of the sample. Each question was answered at least in part in the affirmative. Exposure to NLE may affect worldviews and thereby individual well-being and social behavior. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A State-of-the-Art Review Highlighting Medical Overuse in Dermatology, 2017-2018 A Systematic Review
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Importance Emerging efforts to recognize and combat medical overuse are important solutions to mitigate patient morbidity from unnecessary health care interventions. Objectives To identify and highlight important original investigations on medical overuse in dermatology from 2017 to 2018. Evidence Review The PubMed and Embase databases coupled with articles published in 8 major dermatology and medical journals from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, were searched to identify articles related to medical overuse in dermatology. Findings Of 1941 candidate articles identified through the database search and 41 through the manual journal review, 38 were deemed relevant to medical overuse in dermatology by 2 independent reviewers. Twenty-eight of these articles were determined to be high priority based on scoring for quality of methods, magnitude of clinical effect, and number of patients potentially affected. After expert reviewer scoring, 10 articles were selected for analysis based on highest scores and greatest clinical significance. Selected articles covered topics such as dermatology consultation for cellulitis, management of dysplastic nevi, prognostic utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy, laboratory monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, and safe medication prescribing. For cellulitis management, dermatology consultation is important for reducing misdiagnosis, unnecessary hospitalization, and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Findings related to common dermatologic procedures revealed that clinical observation is safe for dysplastic nevi and that sentinel lymph node biopsy may not have prognostic utility over Breslow thickness. In monitoring for terbinafine and isotretinoin, patient education on clinical symptoms is likely more effective than standard laboratory test result monitoring. Finally, dermatologists should reconsider the use of cyclosporine in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis and reevaluate the use of perioperative narcotics for patients. Conclusions and Relevance This review notes actionable, evidence-based practices to reduce medical overuse in dermatology. This work may help to facilitate management changes to emphasize high-value care in dermatology while promoting awareness and further evaluation of overuse in medicine.This review highlights important original investigations on medical overuse in dermatology from 2017 to 2018.Question What recent evidence exists to inform physician practice to decrease medical overuse in dermatology? Findings This systematic review of 10 articles identified several practices commonly performed but with limited prognostic value and therapeutic benefit to the patient. Meaning This systematic review highlights relevant areas of dermatologic overuse that may signify actionable means by which dermatologists can change practices.

TI  - Snow Cover Evolution in the Gran Paradiso National Park, Italian Alps, Using the Earth Observation Data Cube
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous regions are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the impacts are already extensive and observable, the implications of which go far beyond mountain boundaries and the environmental sectors. Monitoring and understanding climate and environmental changes in mountain regions is, therefore, needed. One of the key variables to study is snow cover, since it represents an essential driver of many ecological, hydrological and socioeconomic processes in mountains. As remotely sensed data can contribute to filling the gap of sparse in-situ stations in high-altitude environments, a methodology for snow cover detection through time series analyses using Landsat satellite observations stored in an Open Data Cube is described in this paper, and applied to a case study on the Gran Paradiso National Park, in the western Italian Alps. In particular, this study presents a proof of concept of the preliminary version of the snow observation from space algorithm applied to Landsat data stored in the Swiss Data Cube. Implemented in an Earth Observation Data Cube environment, the algorithm can process a large amount of remote sensing data ready for analysis and can compile all Landsat series since 1984 into one single multi-sensor dataset. Temporal filtering methodology and multi-sensors analysis allows one to considerably reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of snow cover area using high-resolution sensors. The study highlights that, despite this methodology, the lack of available cloud-free images still represents a big issue for snow cover mapping from satellite data. Though accurate mapping of snow extent below cloud cover with optical sensors still represents a challenge, spatial and temporal filtering techniques and radar imagery for future time series analyses will likely allow one to reduce the current cloud cover issue.

TI  - Damage assessment of chilli thrips using high resolution multispectral satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology offers an effective, rapid and reliable tool for assessing pest severity in vegetation. Ground based hyperspectral radiometry studies revealed significant difference in the reflectance spectra between healthy and thrip damaged vegetation. Space borne multispectral reflectance from Sentinel 2A satellite data of chilli thrip infested canopy has significant differences in red region (Band 4 - 664.6 nm), NIR region (Bands 5, 6, 7, 8 & 8A having central wavelengths at 704.1, 740.5, 782.8 & 832.8 nm, respectively) and SWIR region (Bands 11 & 12 having central wavelengths at 1613.7 and 2202.4 nm). In this study, an attempt was made to discriminate healthy and pest affected chilli crop in the multispectral satellite imagery using several multispectral vegetation indices. Of these, land surface water index, LSWI (p=0.018) and normalized difference water index, NDWI (p=0.001) were found significant. These indices were used to classify chilli fields in the satellite imagery into severe, moderate and healthy classes. Superior performance of LSWI over NDWI with overall accuracy of 93.80 and Kappa Coefficient of 0.89 was observed. Moran's Index was used to study the spatial distribution of chilli thrips and observed strong clustering (I= 0.9073, p=0.0001).

TI  - Remote Sensing of Human-Environment Interactions in Global Change Research: A Review of Advances, Challenges and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The role of remote sensing and human-environment interactions (HEI) research in social and environmental decision-making has steadily increased along with numerous technological and methodological advances in the global environmental change field. Given the growing inter- and trans-disciplinary nature of studies focused on understanding the human dimensions of global change (HDGC), the need for a synchronization of agendas is evident. We conduct a bibliometric assessment and review of the last two decades of peer-reviewed literature to ascertain what the trends and current directions of integrating remote sensing into HEI research have been and discuss emerging themes, challenges, and opportunities. Despite advances in applying remote sensing to understanding ever more complex HEI fields such as land use/land cover change and landscape degradation, agricultural dynamics, urban geography and ecology, natural hazards, water resources, epidemiology, or paleo HEIs, challenges remain in acquiring and leveraging accurately georeferenced social data and establishing transferable protocols for data integration. However, recent advances in micro-satellite, unmanned aerial systems (UASs), and sensor technology are opening new avenues of integration of remotely sensed data into HEI research at scales relevant for decision-making purposes that simultaneously catalyze developments in HDGC research. Emerging or underutilized methodologies and technologies such as thermal sensing, digital soil mapping, citizen science, UASs, cloud computing, mobile mapping, or the use of "humans as sensors" will continue to enhance the relevance of HEI research in achieving sustainable development goals and driving the science of HDGC further.

TI  - Challenges for remote sensing of the Sustainable Development Goal SDG 15.3.1 productivity indicator
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Progress towards combatting land degradation as intended by Sustainable Development Goal 15.3.1 will be monitored using three sub-indicators, of which productivity of vegetation is one. This indicator is to be measured using trends in a remotely-sensed vegetation index. The use of vegetation indices is well-established and remotely-sensed data are readily available. However, their uses for monitoring production that is relevant to sustainable livelihoods have received little attention. This review identifies four areas in the currently-proposed monitoring methodology that are in need of further development. The first is the derivation of primary production from vegetation indices, which requires attention to physiological processes such as light-use efficiency and plant respiration. The second concerns the subsequent steps, in which ecological processes transform the net production into production of goods and services, such as crop products. The third is the need for explicit baselines or reference conditions that specify the productivity in the absence of anthropogenic degradation. The fourth, and most difficult, is to distinguish anthropogenic causes of degradation from potentially similar effects of natural environmental processes. Some of these issues are difficult to tackle with remote sensing alone, although several improvements are available, and others are in development. However, the current use of vegetation indices alone to remotely-sense degradation of ecosystem services does not provide an adequate SDG 15.3.1 productivity indicator.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the possible impact of the Chornobyl accident on the incidence of breast cancer in the female population of Ukraine as a whole and in some affected groups.OBJECT OF THE STUDY: The female population of Ukraine as a whole and in separate groups of victims - women par- ticipating in the clean-up works in 1986-1987, evacuaees from the exclusion zone and inhabitants of the territo- ries most contaminated with radionuclides.METHODS: Statistical, mathematical, cartographic.RESULTS: This study, covering a significant period of time (1976-2016), revealed a steady temporal and territorial agglomeration of regions with a higher incidence of breast cancer in the southern and south-eastern regions of Ukraine. Lower - in the western and northern regions. There is a steady increase in the incidence rate, but in recent years this growth has slowed down. The epidemiological situation regarding the incidence of breast cancer in the female population of Ukraine during the 30 years after the Chornobyl accident is generally stable. At the same time, a marked increase in the frequency of this pathology in the groups of the affected population, especially in women, participated in clean-up works in 1986-1987.CONCLUSIONS: A stable agglomeration of regions with high levels of incidence in the south and south-east, and low in the west and north of the country is determined. The dynamics of breast cancer in Ukraine as a whole is characterized by steady growth, although in recent years its pace has slightly decreased. Among the individual population groups affected by the Chornobyl catastrophe (female liquidators, evacuated women from the exclusion zone, residents of the most contaminated with radionuclides territories) only among female liquidators of 1986-1987 the significant in- crease was observed in the incidence of breast cancer, which exceeds the national indicators at 1.3-1.6 times.

TI  - The "Russian" Edmund Spenser: Points of Departure in Research of English Renaissance Poetry Reception
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article addresses facts of Edmund Spenser's poetry reception in Russian literature. Spenser studies in Russia (N. Pianova, L. Dorofeeva, A. Gorbunov, I. Burova, N. Ten- Chagai, et al.) mainly focus on the imagery and plot of his poetry, as well as on its stylistic and linguistic aspects. Issues of reception have never been addressed in all their complexity. The article aims to bring together isolated translations and critical accounts and present a complete overview of Spenser's history in Russia. The research is based on periodicals, collected works of 19th-century poets and editors, critical works of the 19th-20th centuries, translations of Spenser's poetry, Internet resources. The methods used in the research are as follows: cultural-historical and comparative methods, reception theory, and literary text analysis. Firstly, the article describes the earliest mentions of Spenser in Russian periodicals (O. Somov, Ph. Chasles) and focuses on the Russian edition of Taine's Histoire de la Litterature Anglaise, which contained first prosaic translations of The Faerie Queene and other poems. Secondly, the article examines the works of Gerbel and Zotov (largely based on those of Taine and Gatschenberger). The study of their perception of Spenser reveals that, although they both recognised his poetic talent and the role he played in the English literature, his poetry was too "ideal" to be relevant. Its lack of realism was viewed as a major flaw. Gerbel's translation of several stanzas from "Epithalamion" as well as a short verse presented as a translation by Mikhailov (later disproved) would not give an adequate understanding of Spenser's poetry and by and large were not in accordance with the critical overview. Thirdly, the article states that, while in the late 19th century the exploration of Spenser's poetry was determined by the ideas of historicist criticism, during the soviet era it occurred in the context of cultural enlightenment. Spenser was viewed as an important part of Renaissance background. Purishev and his translators were the first to present an integral, although fragmentary, view of Spenser's poetry in translation. Post-war anthologies (by Alekseev, Solonovich, Samarin) continued that line, giving all the more nuanced understanding of Spenser's poetry. Important as they might be, soviet translations remained fragmentary and served as an illustration. Finally, the article briefly touches upon a modern-day re-discovery of Spenser. Poets often turn to full translation of one of Spenser's works and interpret it in accordance with their worldview. In conclusion, it is stated that, although Spenser's history in Russia is quite indicative, English Renaissance poetry is a complex phenomenon, and its reception cannot be understood through a study of one author. The further exploration requires exposure of its perception in Russia throughout time.

TI  - Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for DNA Biosensors-How Far Are We?
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - A sensitive and accurate identification of specific DNA fragments (usually containing a mutation) can influence clinical decisions. Standard methods routinely used for this type of detection are PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction, and its modifications), and, less commonly, NGS (Next Generation Sequencing). However, these methods are quite complicated, requiring time-consuming, multi-stage sample preparation, and specially trained staff. Usually, it takes weeks for patients to obtain their results. Therefore, different DNA sensors are being intensively developed by many groups. One technique often used to obtain an analytical signal from DNA sensors is Raman spectroscopy. Its modification, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), is especially useful for practical analytical applications due to its extra low limit of detection. SERS takes advantage of the strong increase in the efficiency of Raman signal generation caused by a local electric field enhancement near plasmonic (typically gold and silver) nanostructures. In this condensed review, we describe the most important types of SERS-based nanosensors for genetic studies and comment on their potential for becoming diagnostic tools.

TI  - Identification and complete-genome phylogenetic analysis of an epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 7 strain isolated in China
T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) strain designated YN09-04 was isolated from sentinel cattle in China. The length of its complete genome was 19,344 bp in total, consisting of 10 segments ranging in size from 810 bp (S10) to 3942 bp (S1). Based on phylogenetic analysis of the S2 sequence, YN09-04 clusters with EHDV serotype 7 (EHDV-7) strains form a distinct, well-supported subgroup, indicating that YN09-04 belongs to EHDV-7. However, the origin of the YN09-04 genome is very complex. The S2 and S6 of YN09-04 cluster with those of Japanese EHDV-7 strains, whereas the S1, S3, S4, S5 and S7 of YN09-04 share high nucleotide sequence identity and a close relationship with those of Japanese Ibaraki viruses, and the S8, S9 and S10 nucleotide sequences of YN09-04 are more similar to those of some Australian EHDV strains than to those of other isolates. These results suggest that the genome of YN09-04 likely originated from a reassortment event between EHDV strains that were similar to the current Japanese and Australian strains and that YN09-04 and some EHDVs from Japan and Australia share the same ancestors. This is the first report of the isolation, identification and complete-genome phylogenetic analysis of an EHDV-7 strain from China.

TI  - Detection and attribution of vegetation greening trend across distinct local landscapes under China's Grain to Green Program: A case study in Shaanxi Province
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the largest payment for ecosystem service programs in the world, China's Grain to Green Program has been proved to generate an unambiguous greening trend across the country. A critical knowledge gap still exists in the understanding of the spatial disparity of vegetation dynamics and the relative contributions of the program versus other anthropogenic and natural drivers, especially at local scale. This study took Shaanxi Province as a case study, used a panel dataset of MODIS NDVI, multi-station surface meteorological observations, and socio-economic statistics for detecting the disparity among three distinct landscapes. Meanwhile a fixed-effects model was applied for attribution. Spatial disparity in vegetation change was evident among the three distinct landscapes. Although the afforestation efforts generally produced positive and lagged effects on vegetation recovery, local conditions dominated the disparity. Growing population pressures, intensified industrial activities, and perverse strategic behaviors of affected farmers effectively deterred the success of the program. To consolidate the implementation achievements of the program, more locally adapted measures such as human resettlement, technical assistance, and creating more employment opportunities should be encouraged. Furthermore, supervision and evaluation should be strengthened.

TI  - Impact of AMSU-A Data Assimilation over High Terrains on QPFs Downstream of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the atmospheric conditions over it strongly affect downstream regional weather. Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) brightness temperature observations provide temperature sounding information and have long been successfully assimilated for numerical weather prediction. AMSU-A brightness temperatures observed from the polar-orbiting NOAA-15 and 18 satellites during July and August 2016 were collected. During these months, the equator crossing time of these particular satellites was approximately 0600 local time. Observations collected within the 3-h periods centered at 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC, covering the TP, were assimilated. The weighting coefficients for mid-tropospheric AMSU-A channels 6 and 7 were significantly reduced over areas with terrain heights greater than 2 km and 4 km, respectively, in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation system. The assimilation of AMSU-A observations was improved to better exploit the role of AMSU-A channels 6 and 7 over the TP. This was achieved by not decreasing the weighting coefficients of the two channels over the grassy surface of the TP's high terrain such that they were consistent with the inverse error variances. This modification produced larger positive impacts of satellite data assimilation on the 48-h forecasts of the mid-tropospheric trough, water vapor, and quantitative precipitation forecasts downstream of the TP. This study also suggests the importance of AMSU-A observations from early-morning satellite orbits for numerical weather prediction downstream of the TP.

TI  - Pelagic seabirds as biomonitors of persistent organic pollutants in the Southwestern Atlantic
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are accumulated through time and can exert different effect on ecosystems. POPs and Chlorpyrifos, a current use pesticide, were assessed in body feathers of males and females of Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris, BBA) and Cape petrels (Daption capense, CAP) during their non-breeding seasons at the Patagonian Shelf, Argentina. Chlorpyrifos showed the highest values among all pollutants in both species (49.56-84.88 ng g(-1)), resulting from current agricultural practices. The pattern OCPs > PCBs > PBDEs was observed in both species, and CAP showed higher concentrations than BBA probably as a consequence of higher lipid mobilization and pollutants availability during dispersion. Non-significant differences between sexes about POPs levels were found; however a slight tendency was observed, females > males in CAP, and males > females in BBA. More attention and further studies are needed to understand seabirds' physiology and its relationship with the pollutants distribution in their tissues and considering breeding season.

TI  - Technical Aspects of Endosurgical Extraperitoneal Aortic Lymph Node Dissection in Gynaecologic Oncology
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Laparoscopic aortic node dissection can be performed using extraperitoneal techniques. The surgical technique has been made much easier by the development of multifunction instruments, combining sophisticated bipolar thermal fusion and sharp incision, or using harmonic hemostasis. These instruments improve ergonomy, and may reduce the lymphocyst formation rate, the more frequent complication of extraperitoneal lymph node dissection. Robotic assistance is feasible and safe, but that does not provide significant improvement in perioperative outcomes. Laparoscopic or robot-assisted single port has been used by several investigators, which led to the same conclusions. Interestingly, the left lateral extraperitoneal approach can be extended to the left pelvic sidewall, allowing to resect suspicious nodes, sentinel nodes or to complete left pelvic lymph node dissection. Materials and Methods In this paper, a review of the technical aspects including surgical steps, instrumentation, and comparative studies of perioperative outcomes has been carried out. A PubMed search was carried out from the year 1995, including the terms "extraperitoneal" "aortic" "lymph node dissection". Comparative studies investigating the benefits of the extraperitoneal approach compared to the transperitoneal approach were carefully screened. One animal randomized study and one clinical randomized study are available, along with meta-analyses or reviews of retrospective comparative studies. Results No difference was observed in terms of duration of the surgery, blood loss, postoperative complications, hospital stay, and node yield. The extraperitoneal technique overall generates less adhesions, and the intraoperative complication rate is significantly lower than in the transperitoneal approach. The proportion of patients in whom the operation can be satisfactorily completed by this approach is over 90%. The advantages of the extraperitoneal approach are more in obese patients, in relation to the absence of interference of the bowel loops in the operative field, and a higher feasibility. Conclusion The extraperitoneal endosurgical approach is an indispensable tool which must be mastered by gynaecologic oncologists. Extraperitoneal aortic lymph node dissection can be used as a staging procedure, or a part of a full endoscopic operation encompassing intraperitoneal steps like omentectomy and hysterectomy in the surgical staging of endometrial and ovarian cancer.

TI  - Assessment of the Biomass Productivity Decline in the Lower Mekong Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to delineate the geographic hotspots of negative trends in biomass productivity in the Lower Mekong Basin countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand) and identify correlated regional environmental and anthropogenic factors. A long-term time-series (1982-2015) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index at a resolution of approximately 9.16 km x 9.16 km was used to specify the areas with significant decline or increase in productivity. The relationships between vegetation changes and land attributes, such as climate, population density, soil/terrain conditions, and land-cover types, were examined. Rainfall time-series maps were used to identify areas that might have been affected by land degradation from those correlated with rainfall. Most of the detected potentially degraded areas were found in Cambodia, the Northwest and the Highland of Vietnam, the Northern Mountains of Thailand and Laos, and the mountainous border between Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. About 15% of the total land area of these four countries experienced a reduction in biomass productivity during the 34-year study period. The map of hotspots of changes in productivity can be used to direct further studies, including those at finer spatial resolution that may support policy makers and researchers in targeting the strategies for combating land degradation.

TI  - Environmental Reservoirs of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>: Challenges and Opportunities for Ocean-Color Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The World Health Organization has estimated the burden of the on-going pandemic of cholera at 1.3 to 4 million cases per year worldwide in 2016, and a doubling of case-fatality-rate to 1.8% in 2016 from 0.8% in 2015. The disease cholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that can be found in environmental reservoirs, living either in free planktonic form or in association with host organisms, non-living particulate matter or in the sediment, and participating in various biogeochemical cycles. An increasing number of epidemiological studies are using land- and water-based remote-sensing observations for monitoring, surveillance, or risk mapping of Vibrio pathogens and cholera outbreaks. Although the Vibrio pathogens cannot be sensed directly by satellite sensors, remotely-sensed data can be used to infer their presence. Here, we review the use of ocean-color remote-sensing data, in conjunction with information on the ecology of the pathogen, to map its distribution and forecast risk of disease occurrence. Finally, we assess how satellite-based information on cholera may help support the Sustainable Development Goals and targets on Health (Goal 3), Water Quality (Goal 6), Climate (Goal 13), and Life Below Water (Goal 14).

TI  - Targeting management practices for rice yield gains in stress-prone environments of Myanmar
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice in Myanmar is grown in diverse environments, including inland dry zone and salt-affected coastal deltas. This study evaluated management options that could improve productivity and reduce risks of rice crop in stressprone areas of the country. We selected four sites from two regions in the central dry zone (Wundwin) and the Ayeyarwady delta (Labutta, Bogale and Mawlamyinegyun). We used experimental and survey datasets on farmers' practices and rice yields from 2012 to 2014 to run the ORYZA model to simulate the climatic yield potential (YP; yield without stress) and the attainable yield under rainfed conditions (YW; yield limited by water), saline conditions (YS; yield limited by salinity), and under conditions of current farmers' practices (YF; yield in farmers' practices). Simulated yield responses to different management practices showed spatial variability within and among the selected sites. YP ranged from 5.4 to 11.1 t ha(-1), YW ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 t ha(-1 ) and YF ranged from 2.2 to 4.2 t ha(-1). In salt-affected areas, average YS ranged from less than 0.1 t ha(-1) to 5.6 t ha(-1). Yield gains with the choice of an improved variety and adjusted sowing date were estimated at up to 53% above YF. Changing the time of sowing and using improved rice varieties provided the greatest yield gains in salt-affected and drought-prone areas where YF was the least. In areas where YF was greater, the improvement of nitrogen management provided larger benefits than in areas with lower YF. We conclude that an integrated approach using remote-sensing technologies, crop modeling, and a geographic information system is valuable for targeting the best management options to close the yield gap in unfavorable rice environments in Asia.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Assessment in Bangladesh Using Machine Learning and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes a new approach by integrating statistical, machine learning, and multi-criteria decision analysis, including artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Dependent (flood inventory) and independent variables (flood causative factors) were prepared using remote sensing data and the Mike-11 hydrological model and secondary data from different sources. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into training and testing datasets, where 334 flood locations (70%) were used for training and the remaining 141 locations (30%) were employed for testing. Using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), predictive power of the model was tested. The results revealed that LR model had the highest success rate (81.60%) and prediction rate (86.80%), among others. Furthermore, different combinations of the models were evaluated for flood susceptibility mapping and the best combination (C-11) was used for generating a new flood hazard map for Bangladesh. The performance of the C-11 integrated models was also evaluated using the AUROC and found that integrated LR-FR model had the highest predictive power with an AUROC value of 88.10%. This study offers a new opportunity to the relevant authority for planning and designing flood control measures.

TI  - Potential generation sites of internal solitary waves and their propagation characteristics in the Andaman Sea-a study based on MODIS true-colour and SAR observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of large-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs or solitons) is quite common in the Andaman Sea, located in the north-eastern Indian Ocean basin. ISWs are known to induce strong vertical velocities which can play an essential role in the mixing transport of nutrients and are proven hazardous to offshore oil platforms. The surface signatures of ISWs can be detected using remote sensing instruments like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and sunglint true-colour images. The present study makes an effort to delineate as well as detect the possible potential generation locations of mode-1 long living ISWs in the Andaman Sea using remote sensing observations. To accomplish this, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true-colour images of Terra/Aqua satellites for the months of March and April during 2014-2016 are used to map the distribution and propagation characteristics of ISWs. These maps along with SAR imgaes from ENVISAT and TerraSAR-X are used to detect the possible generation locations of ISWs. The study considers the possible generation location of ISW as the circumcentre of each wave packet as they radially propagate along a two-dimensional frame. The analysis reveals five potential ISW generation hotspots that are distributed along the Northern Andaman Sea, as well as locations in the discontinuities off the Nicobar Islands and the great passage. The ISWs that form over these regions are hitting the continental shelf within the Andaman Sea. Interestingly, the waves from two potential generation sites between the Nicobar Islands appear to radiate waves in two opposite directions, towards the Andaman Sea and the southern Bay of Bengal.

TI  - Micro level analyses of environmentally disastrous urbanization in Bangalore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian metropolitan (tier I) cities have been undergoing rapid urbanization during the post-globalization era with the unprecedented market interventions, which have led to the rapid land cover changes affecting the ecology, climate, hydrology, and local environment. The unplanned urbanization has given way to the dispersed, haphazard growth at the city outskirts with the lack of basic amenities and infrastructure as the planners lack advance information of sprawl regions. This has necessitated understanding and visualization of urbanization patterns for planning towards sustainable cities. The analyses of urban dynamics during 19732017 using temporal remote sensing data reveal 1028% increase in urban area with the decline of 88% vegetation and 79% of water bodies. Consequences of the unplanned urbanization are the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, decline in vegetation cover, loss of groundwater table (from 28 to 300 m), contamination of water sources, increase in land surface temperature, increase in disease vectors, etc. An attempt is made to understand the implications of unplanned growth at the micro level by considering the prime growth poles such as Peenya Industrial Estate (PIE), Whitefield (WF), Bangalore South Region (BSR). The spatial analyses reveal the decline of vegetation and open spaces with intense urbanization of 86.35% (in BSR), 87.39% (PIE) and 81.61% (WF) in 2017. WF witnessed the drastic transformation from agrarian ecosystem to a concrete jungle during the past four decades. Spatial patterns of urbanization were assessed through the landscape metrics and rule-based modeling which confirms intense urbanization with single class dominance. Specifically, NP metrics depicts PIE region had sprawl growth till 2003 with numerous patches and is transformed by 2017 it has become to a single dense urban patch. This necessitates appropriate planning strategies to mitigate further erosion of environmental resources and ensure clean air, water, and environment to all residents.

TI  - Analysis of sequence earthquake of Lombok Island, Indonesia
T2  - PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On August 5, 2018, Lombok Island, an island off the eastern part of Bali Island, Indonesia experienced a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. To provide a reliable measure to estimate the intensity of earthquake impact, this study observes land deformation after the event using Differential SAR (DinSAR) Interferometry algorithmthat is applied to Sentinel-1 satellite imageries. The semi-automatic classification method is developed to produce infrastructure-damage-level estimation map in the study area. For accuracy assessment, multi-sensor dataset of PlanetScope and Google Earth images, as well as data fromfield survey is utilised. The results reveal consistent locations of damaged area caused by the earthquake, both from the SAR and optical datasets. Accuracy of infrastructure damage classification is relatively low for small-sized destruction (<3m), which is due to the limited spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Yet for largesized destruction, themethod provides high accuracy. In longer-term, the method to identify and classify infrastructure damage that is developed in this study can help to build a historical database of earthquake impact in a vulnerable area, and support the organization of a robust mitigation system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare locomotor activity profiles of Brazilian topclass female soccer players competing at distinct age brackets (under 17 [U17], under [U20], and senior). External match load of 14 U17, 14 U20, and 17 senior female soccer players competing in 6-7 full official international matches were assessed using global positioning systems. Total distance covered, distance covered in high intensity (15.6-20 km.h(-1)), distance covered in sprints (sprint: >20 km.h(-1)), number of accelerations (Acc) >1 m.s(-2), decelerations (Dec) >(-1) m.s(-2), and Player Load generally increased across the age brackets (U17 < U20 <senior). For all playing positions, senior athletes presented greater total distance, accelerations, and decelerations than U20 players. For high-intensity distance and sprints, only central defender and midfielder senior players presented greater values than U20 players. Senior players demonstrated higher values in all locomotor activities in comparison to U17 players, irrespective of playing positions. Except for central defenders who presented similar total distance, sprint distance, and number of accelerations between U20 and U17, most match external loads evaluated in all playing positions were greater in U20 than in U17 players. These results provide useful information for player development and should be used to establish appropriate match-specific conditioning drills according to age categories.

TI  - Visual and statistical comparison of ASTER, SRTM, and Cartosat digital elevation models for watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate delineation of watershed and drainage networks is crucial for hydrological and geomorphological models, water resource management, change of floodplains, flood risk management, and surface water mapping. Since high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are often not available, it is necessary to evaluate open source products. Various statistical measures were used to estimate the vertical accuracy of these freely available DEMs. Moreover, DEM products from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Cartosat data were also compared. The study areas are located in the Vadodara district of Gujarat State of India. A comparison of SRTM-, ASTER-, and Cartosat-derived DEMs allowed a qualitative assessment of the vertical component of the error, whereas statistical measurements were used to estimate their vertical accuracy. In order to compare the frequency histograms of the elevation distributions in the DEMs in the study area, skewness and kurtosis were determined. Further, to obtain the degree of relationship between the DEMs, scatterplots, as well as correlation coefficients, were used. The results showed that all DEMs have imperfections in the delineation of a small river like Vishwamitri, and the comparison showed that SRTM 30 m and ASTER 30 m failed to delineate proper main drainage for the river. Cartosat 30 m DEM exhibited better results. The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated as 7.21 m for ASTER and 3.24 m for SRTM. The correlation value of 0.94 indicates the existence of a strong positive linear correlation between SRTM and Cartosat. The study shows that for the study area ASTER elevation data were highly underestimated, whereas SRTM elevation data were slightly overestimated.

TI  - Estimating daily average surface air temperature using satellite land surface temperature and top-of-atmosphere radiation products over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced rapid warming in recent decades. However, the meteorological stations of the TP are scarce and mostly located at the eastern and southern parts of the TP where the elevation is relatively low, which increases the uncertainty of regional and local climate studies. Recently, the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has been used to estimate the surface air temperature (SAT). However, the thermal infrared based LST is prone to cloud contamination, which limits the availability of the estimated SAT. This study presents a novel all sky model based on the rule-based Cubist regression to estimate all sky daily average SAT using LST, incident solar radiation (ISR), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The model is trained using station data of the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) and corresponding satellite products. The output is evaluated using independent station data with the bias of -0.07 degrees C and RMSE of 1.87 degrees C. Additionally, the 25-fold cross validation shows a stable model performance (RMSE: 1.6-2.8 degrees C). Moreover, the all sky Cubist model increases the availability of the estimated SAT by nearly three times. We used the all sky Cubist model to estimate the daily average SAT of the TP for 2002-2016 at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees. We compared our all sky Cubist model estimated daily average SAT with three existing data sets (i.e., GLDAS, CLDAS, and CMFD). Our model estimation shows similar spatial and temporal dynamics with these existing data sets but outperforms them with lower bias and RMSE when benchmarked against the CMA station data. The estimated SAT data could be very useful for regional and local climate studies over the TP. Although the model is developed for the TP, the framework is generic and may be extended to other regions with proper model training using local data.

AB  - Distributed Hydrological Models (DHMs) with the capability of simulating catchment-scale water and energy budgets as well as rainfall-runoff-inundation processes are essential tools for Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as well as Water-related Disaster Risk Reduction (WDRR) under changing climate. This research developed a new DHM, the Water and Energy Budget-based Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (WEB-RRI) model, by integrating the RRI model's diffusive wave flow equations into a land surface model (hydro-SiB2) to incorporate water and energy budget processes, land-vegetation-atmosphere interactions, soil moisture dynamics, and 2-D lateral water flows to improve interception, evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture, runoff, and inundation processes. The performance of the new model was assessed using river discharge data, MODIS and GLEAM ET data, and ground as well as satellite inundation extents in the Kalu (wet) and Mundeni (dry) River basins in Sri Lanka. The model was well calibrated and validated (Nash > 0.9) and confirmed to be highly capable of reproducing the long-term (similar to 20 years) observed river discharges (Nash > 0.89) and hydrological flow regime properties for both basins. Particularly, the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak discharges during the flood, as well as their timings, coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins, which indicates that the model is capable of reproducing soil and vegetation water storages reasonably well, and therefore it can be used for real-time and forecasting applications with the re-starting capability. The modelsimulated basin averaged ET fluxes and their trends agreed better with GLEAM (RMSE: similar to 0.7-0.95 mm/day, correlation: similar to 0.35-(139) than with MODIS (RMSE: similar to 0.96-1.04 mm/day, correlation: similar to 0.14-0.25). The simulated inundation extents were also consistent with the ground- and MODIS-driven inundation extents. The future focus of this research will be on expanding the model applicability for basin-wide IWRM and WDRR, including flood- and drought-related risk assessments, by employing the model to operational applications (e.g., flood forecasting and seasonal flow prediction) and long-term applications (e.g., catchment responses to past and future climatology, water cycle variability, hydrological extremes, and land-use changes).

TI  - Multimodal therapeutical-rehabilitative approches in a complex case of pathology including possibly evolving discariotic type- case report
T2  - BALNEO RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Having the patient's consent and The Teaching Emegency Hospital "Bagdasar-Arseni" Ethics Committeee N.O 20270 from 26.06.2019, the current case report presents the case of a female patients with both hemiplegia following a thalamic vascular accident and a long history of neglected auricular melanoma. The management of a patient diagnosed with melanoma is a complex one, involving wide local excisions with safety margins, with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Auricular melanomas have recently evolved from radical procedures involving the amputation of the involved organ, to much less radical procedures, which help save more of the patient's tissue and functionality. (1) Another important factor that threatens the rehabilitation process in the case of hemiplegic patients is the presence of clinical depression, both as a pre-existing comorbidity and as a common psychiatric complication of stroke. (2) Depression jeopardizes the patient's quality of life and increases mortality. (2) There is also relevant date supporting the hypotheses that depression history is associated with melanoma risk, although no effect on survival was observed. (3) Materials and Methods A 70 years old pacient, which suffered right thalamic vascular accident in december 2018 was admitted in our Neuromuscular clinic division with the following comorbidities: basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), diagnosed 20 years ago, with slow evolution. When admittedin our division, the pacient presented with a moderately large ulcerated tumor in the temporal region and the left auricular pavilion - with surgical indication. She was also diagnosed with arterial hypertension stage III, chronic, cardiac insufficiency class III NYHA, chronic cervicalgia and lumbosacralgia, class II obesity, clinical depression. She was admitted into our clinic for hemiplegic motor deficit, sensibility disorders, severe locomotor and self-grooming dysfunction. Results The patient improved on most of the assessment scales/scores implemented in our Clinic's Division Motor FIM (Functiona Independence Measure) from 35/91 to 38/91, FAC(Functional Ambulation Categories) from 0/5 to 1/5, GOS-E (The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale) from 4/8 to 5/8. The most important improvemet in our patent's evolution was her ability to start walking again. During her admission into our Clinic, she was also briefly admitted into the hospital's Plastic Survery Divison, where she received the necessary surgical trateament for the melanoma. Conclusions Following a complex neuro-recovery program developed by a multidisciplinary team made of doctors, kinesio-therapists, middle and allied health personnel, the patient had an extremely good evolution (during a short period of time) - attested on the scales and also - on a psychocognitive and behavioral level.

TI  - Identification and characterization of spatio-temporal hotspots of forest fires in South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is considered as one of the major threats to global biodiversity and a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Rising temperatures, weather conditions, and topography promote the incidences of fire due to human ignition in South Asia. Because of its synoptic, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal nature, remote sensing data can be a state of art technology for forest fire management. This study focuses on the spatio-temporal patterns of forest fires and identifying hotspots using the novel geospatial technique "emerging hotspot analysis tool" in South Asia. Daily MODIS active fire locations data of 15 years (2003-2017) has been aggregated in order to characterize fire frequency, fire density, and hotspots. A total of 522,348 active fire points have been used to analyze risk of fires across the forest types. Maximum number of forest fires in South Asia was occurring during the January to May. Spatial analysis identified areas of frequent burning and high fire density in South Asian countries. In South Asia, 51% of forest grid cells were affected by fires in 15 years. Highest number of fire incidences was recorded in tropical moist deciduous forest and tropical dry deciduous forest. The emerging hotspots analysis indicates prevalence of sporadic hotspots, followed by historical hotspots, consecutive hotspots, and persistent hotspots in South Asia. Of the seven South Asian countries, Bangladesh has highest emerging hotspot area (34.2%) in forests, followed by 32.2% in India and 29.5% in Nepal. Study results offer critical insights in delineation of fire vulnerable forest landscapes which will stand as a valuable input for strengthening management of fires in South Asia.

TI  - Using Random Forest to Classify Vegetation Communities in the Southern Area of Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia
T2  - Mongolian Journal of Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, enabling scientists to study ecological phenomena with methods previously unavailable. Freely available satellite imagery in finer resolutions has increased, making it possible and more economical to analyze and monitor the Earth's ecosystems. Software and on-line platforms make it easier to investigate conservation areas of concern. Yet, remote areas such as Mongolia do not have freely available data, such as land cover and climate variables, at a fine scale in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Scientists depend on individual efforts and products produced for remote areas and the sharing of these data. In this paper, we report our findings in using Random Forest, a machine learning tree classifier, to categorize vegetative communities in the southern portion of Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in Mongolia. Our results produced 6 different vegetation community classes from a Landsat 8 image using 7 bands and collected on September 13, 2013. The vegetation communities are: ephemeral water, dense rock, low-density shrub/short grasses and forbs, short grasses and forbs, semi-shrub, and tall grasses. Our results provide a foundation for ecological studies in the region, such as those focusing on habitat selection by wildlife, and can inform broader-scale landscape planning.

TI  - Microplastics in wild mussels (<i>Mytilus</i> spp.) from the north coast of Spain
T2  - SCIENTIA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastic content (MPs) in mussels (Mytilus spp.) from two areas of the north coast of Spain was measured for the first time. Additionally, a comparison of microplastic levels observed in mussels digested with nitric acid and with potassium hydroxide was carried out. The average microplastic concentration in mussels digested with nitric acid was significantly lower than that observed in mussels digested with potassium hydroxide (p<0.05). The average concentration of microplastics in mussels from the Cantabrian Sea (2.55 +/- 2.80 MPs g(-1) WW) was slightly higher than that in mussels from the Ria of Vigo (1.59 +/- 1.28 MPs g(-1) WW). Both in the Ria of Vigo and in the Cantabrian Sea the observed pattern of pollution was fitted to the one expected. Consequently, mussels have been confirmed as suitable sentinel organisms for microplastic pollution.

TI  - Disruption as worldview change: A Kuhnian analysis of the digital music revolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Why is it that technology-enabled industry disruptions appear entirely inevitable with hindsight, yet practitioners in disrupted businesses typically struggle to detect and respond appropriately to disruption while it is unfolding? We term this surprising contradiction 'interpretive discontinuity' and use it to problematize the established understanding of disruption in the literature. We suggest that the contradiction at the heart of interpretive discontinuity holds an important key to what exactly changes during disruption and why. By juxtaposing an empirical case of disruption in the music industry with theoretical resources sensitive to the nature of radical change - Thomas Kuhn's work in the unrelated field of scientific practice - we demonstrate that it is productive to understand disruption as a Kuhnian paradigm shift. We are then able to trace interpretive discontinuity to the gestalt switch in worldview that accompanies such a paradigm shift. This insight sheds new light on both what is actually 'disruptive' about disruption and also on the limitations of prior work theorizing disruption. Our work is important because it adds to the literature on disruptive innovation important yet overlooked conceptual tools in Kuhn's work - the role of exemplars, the worldview aspect of a paradigm, and paradigm incommensurability.

TI  - THE MORPHOMETRICAL INITIATION STAGE OF THE PIEZOMETRIC STRUCTURAL COMPARTMENT USING SATTELITE IMAGERY IN THE SOUTHERN SLOPE OF MERAPI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area is on the southern slope of Merapi Mountain in Yogyakarta, and focus on the relation of satellite imagery with piezometric and structure compartment. The preliminary geological study of satellite imagery is using a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 data extraction. The morphometry initiation is used to get the structure lineaments compartment, and it came from morphometry quantification value to indicating the implication of geological structure controls to the groundwater level distribution. The methods emphasize the quantitative descriptive approach form morphometry equation. Thus quantitative morphometry methods are then follow up by statistical and hierarchical cluster analysis of piezometric. The result of morphometry variable shows the structural lineament creates and control by active tectonics, and it implacable to the piezometric spatial distribution besides the implication of volcanic deposit variation, uplifting and asymmetric river mature form. The statistical analysis represents a relation between structure lineament with the piezometric, and the analysis result imaging on the digitized maps for each compartment compares with the trends of piezometric. The result of this study emphasizes that the initiation of morphometry is needed to use to compartmentation the structure lineaments, and the compartment becomes the controller of piezometric distribution.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the correlation between the Sentinel 1 radar data in the C band and the soil temperature and moisture measured at seven ground-based stations in France and Germany for the period of 2014-2016. The results of ground-based measurements of the soil temperature and moisture are available on the International Soil Moisture Network website. It has been shown that there are both positive and negative correlations between the backscattering coefficient (BSC) and the soil temperature and moisture measured on the ground. According to our results, the correlation depends on the soil texture and surface roughness. For strongly correlated variables, the regression relationships of the BSC with the soil parameters have been obtained.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is focused on the problem of distinguishing between thawed and frozen soils in the 5-cm upper layer at meteorological stations of Belaya Gora (Sakha) (68.5 degrees N) and Anadyr (Chukotka) (64.78 degrees N) with the use of the Sentinel 1 C-band radar data for the period of 2014-2016. The state of a frozen soil is determined in three ways: (i) by a significant difference (3-5 dB) in the backscattering coefficient sigma(0) (BSC) during the transition of a soil between frozen and thawed states observed in multitemporal radar data, (ii) by a threshold value of at which the temperature in the upper soil layer falls below 0 degrees C, and (iii) by textural features for one-channel images. Diagrams of the air-freezing index (AFI) and its trend for the 2012-2018 period have been constructed from the archive data containing the air temperature for the study areas.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPEATED SPRINT ABILITY, AEROBIC CAPACITY, INTERMITTENT ENDURANCE, AND HEART RATE RECOVERY IN YOUTH SOCCER PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate the relationship between repeated sprint ability (RSA) and several aerobic and anaerobic-related soccer-performance indicators, 45 youth soccer players (age 16.8 +/- 0.1 years) were classified into "high" (HAF) or "low" aerobic fitness (LAF) ((V)over dotO(2)max >= or <60 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), respectively) and completed an RSA test measuring best (RSA(best)), mean (RSA(mean)), total sprint time ( RSAtotal), and percent sprint decrement (Sdec). A laboratory (V)over dotO(2)max test (LabTest) together with anaerobic threshold (VT) and peak speed was measured (vLabTest). In addition, a 20-m multistage shuttle run test (MSRT) and a soccer-specific test (TIVRE-Soccer test-TST) were completed. Heart rate (HR) and HR recovery (HRR) were measured during all tests. High aerobic fitness presented greater (p <= 0.05) performance in LabTest, MSRT and TST, at maximal effort, at VT, as well as faster HRR. RSA was similar between HAF and LAF. Contrary to HAF, LAF showed negative correlation between vLabTest with RSA(mean) (r = -0.6, p = 0.000) and Sdec (r = 20.4, p = 0.044). Also, LAF showed negative correlation between TST end speed (vTST) and RSA(mean) (r = -0.5, p = 0.005) and Sdec (r = -0.5, p = 0.003). In LAF, RSA was strongly correlated with locomotor factors (e.g., vTST; VT) in both laboratory and field tests. Athletes with high total HRR (>12.5%) in TST presented better (p <= 0.05) Sdec in the RSA test. The multiple regression revealed that the LAF vLabTest explained 44.9, 40.0, and 13.5% of the variance in RSA(best), RSA(mean), and Sdec, respectively. Practitioners may consider these findings to optimize youth athletes' assessment and preparation processes.

AB  - Adjuvant radiotherapy is a key treatment in early-stage breast cancer. The meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialist's Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) has demonstrated a decreased risk of locoregional relapse and death after whole-breast radiotherapy. Prophylactic lymph nodes irradiation in breast cancer has also proven to be beneficial in several therapeutic trials. At a time when three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy has become the standard procedure and with the development of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, defining nodal volumes is essential and practices should be harmonized to assess and compare the efficiency and toxicity of radiotherapy. Furthermore, the indication of lymph nodes irradiation has to take into account the risk/benefit balance as expanding the irradiated volume can increase radio-induced toxicity. Selection of patients receiving this treatment is essential. The aim of this update is to define nodal volumes, to precise the indications of their irradiation and to present the expected benefits as well as the potential side effects.

AB  - The results of a comparative analysis of the underlying surface brightness temperature obtained from the SMOS satellite and calculated with the use of ground-based measurements of moisture and the laboratory measurements of dielectric characteristics of samples of saline soils and saline water from test sites of the Kulunda Steppe are presented. The values of the underlying surface brightness temperatures calculated with the use of ground investigations and the laboratory studies correlate satisfactorily with the values of brightness temperatures measured from the SMOS satellite. The deviations can be caused by the seasonal drying of highly mineralized shallow lakes, which results in a significant change in the areas occupied by lakes and the appearance (instead of a water surface) of wetlands with a high content of mineral salts, whose radio emission characteristics differ from the characteristics of the water surface and the soil cover.

TI  - Dielectric Behavior of Sodic Solonchak at 1.41 GHz in the South of Western Siberia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline soils, characterized by low biological productivity, bring the threat to food security in many countries of the world. An urgent task is to develop and improve methods of remote microwave sensing of saline soils. The accuracy and reliability of microwave methods are achieved by studying the behavior of dielectric properties of saline soils under variations of their physical and chemical parameters. This paper presents the results of the study of moisture and temperature influence on the dielectric properties of sodic solonchak. Samples of saline soil were taken from the surface of sodic solonchak on the Kulunda steppe, in the south of Western Siberia. The dielectric properties of saline soils were measured at a frequency of 1.41 GHz. From the results of chemical and granulometric analyses, it follows that solonchak contains bound water adsorbed by the surface of soil particles, crystallization water stored in crystalline hydrates of mineral salts, and soil solution (SS) of mineral salts. A refractive model is used to describe the dependence of refractive index and absorption factor on moisture. Based on this model, the dielectric properties of different phases of water present in sodic solonchak are estimated. The simulation of the temperature dependence of refractive index and absorption factor for two different values of moisture is carried out. By using the model as the base, the dependences of solonchak emissivity on temperature conforming to the experimental data are established. The results obtained can be used in the development of algorithms to increase the accuracy of remote microwave sensing of saline soils, consideration of solonchak influence on microwave radiation of the underlying surface, the interpretation of satellite data of microwave sensing.

TI  - Landscape-scale cropping changes in the High Plains: economic and environmental implications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A global transformation in semi-arid cropping systems is occurring as dryland (non-irrigated) farmers in semi-arid regions shift from crop rotations reliant on year-long bare fallows, called summer fallow, to more intensively cropped systems. Understanding the rate of cropping system intensification at the landscape scale is critical to estimating the economic and environmental implications of this movement. Here, we use high-resolution satellite data to quantify dryland cropping patterns from 2008 to 2016 in the US High Plains. We use these estimates to scale up our previous field-level research in this region on soil carbon, herbicide use, yields, and profitability. Over the nine year study period, the High Plains witnessed a profound shift in cropping systems, as the historically dominant wheat-fallow system was replaced by more intensified rotations as the dominant systems by land area. Out of the 4 million hectares of non-irrigated cropland in the study area, this shift coincided with a 0.5 million-hectare decline in summer fallow and a concurrent increase in alternative (non-wheat) crops. We estimate that, from 2008 to 2016, these patterns resulted in a 0.53 Tg (9%) increase in annual grain production, 80 million USD (10%) increase in annual net farm operating income, substantial reductions in herbicide use, and an increase in C sequestration that corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 0.32 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year (MMTCO(2)e yr(-1)). We project each of these implications to a scenario of potential maximum 100% intensification and estimate that, relative to 2016 levels, herbicide use would be reduced by more than half, grain production would increase by 25%, net operating income would increase by 223 million USD (26%), and greenhouse gases would be reduced by an additional 0.8MMTCO(2)e yr(-1). The scale of cropping intensification in the High Plains and its environmental and economic impacts has important implications for other regions undergoing similar transformations, and for policy that can either support or hinder these shifts toward more sustainable cropping systems.

TI  - Towards the Determination of Driving Factors of Varying LST-LCZ Relationships - a Case Study over 25 Cities
T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed to prove the existence of a significant relation between land surface temperature (LST) and local climate zones (LCZs) and its possibility to be generalized to all cities around the world with different climatic zones and characteristics. The further step in this regard was to find the effective climatic and geographical variables affecting this potential relation. For that, 25 cities all around the world with various climatic conditions were selected based on the availability of appropriate satellite images and level zero data on the World Urban Database and Portal Toot (WUDAPT). After acquiring both LST and LCZ maps the comparison between them was made with the Wilcoxon rank sum test indicating the existence of any meaningful pattern. Then, 8 climatic and geographical variables and all possible combinations thereof were assessed to determine the effective drivers on the LST-LCZ relationship. The results showed that the combination of the latitude, mean and maximum annual temperature affected this connection more than any other considered variables.

TI  - Delineating groundwater prospect zones in a region with extreme climatic conditions using GIS and remote sensing techniques: A case study from central India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable groundwater management of an extreme climatic region is very important from both social and economic point of view. This study attempts to delineate the groundwater potential zones of Sonepur district, Odisha, which falls under an extreme climatic region, using remote sensing, geographical information system and Saaty's analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Different ancillary data, multiple data sets obtained from LANDSAT 8 OLI and ASTER Level-1T were used in conjunction with Cartosat-1 imagery to study the detailed physical attributes of the study area and to prepare the groundwater prospect map using a weighted overlay method in ArcGIS 10.4 software. The AHP technique was used for determining the weights of each layer. From the groundwater prospect map, it was found that 52% of the area belongs to the moderate groundwater prospect zone followed by good to very good, very good to excellent (32%) and poor (16%) groundwater prospect zones. Statistical analysis of the number of existing wells in each of these water potential zones and their water level was used to verify the accuracy of the water potentiality estimated in this study. The groundwater potentiality map prepared as a part of this study would serve as an important tool for identifying suitable zones for rainwater harvesting and also for managing groundwater abstraction for a safe and sustainable water supply.

TI  - Utility and Practicality of Multi-level Sectioning and Upfront Unstained Slide Cutting in Head and Neck Biopsies: A Critical Analysis
T2  - HEAD & NECK PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Upfront interval sectioning (cutting unstained slides between H&E levels) is used at our institution for biopsies at all sites except the gastrointestinal tract. Very limited data exists in the literature for the need for interval sectioning, and we are aware of no data at all for the head and neck. Biopsies from the larynx, oral cavity, pharynx, and sinonasal tract at our institution have had 5 levels cut. Levels 1, 3, and 5 or levels 2 and 5 had been stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), depending on the subsite, and the remaining slides saved for possible later use. We retrospectively evaluated the use of unstained slides at these sites for clinical utility and efficiency by analyzing 3 years of cases from 1/1/2014 to 12/30/2016. A cutoff of 10% utilization was considered justification for continued upfront unstained slide cutting. We collected 706 larynx, 572 oral cavity, 184 pharynx, and 85 sinonasal tract biopsies over 3 years. The overall rate of unstained slide usage was 18.2%. Usage rates were significantly different by site: 7.8% (55/706) for larynx, 21.9% (125/572) for oral cavity, 30.6% (26/85) for sinonasal tract and 40.8% (75/184) for pharynx (p < 0.0001). The most common stain ordered in the pharynx was p16 immunohistochemistry (59.7%), but it was Grocott methenamine silver staining in the larynx (74.5%), oral cavity (70.4%), and sinonasal tract (35.1%). Usage of unstained slides was lowest for the larynx, and review of the biopsies with unstained slides utilized showed that the lesion was present on the 3rd H&E level in all cases. Removing this practice would have translated to saving 1,378 unstained slides. Upfront interval sectioning makes practical sense for biopsies from most sites in the head and neck, especially the pharynx, but our data suggests it can reasonably be forgone at least for biopsies of the larynx.

TI  - PERSIANN-CNN: Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely precipitation estimates are critical for monitoring and forecasting natural disasters such as floods. Despite having high-resolution satellite information, precipitation estimation from remotely sensed data still suffers from methodological limitations. State-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, renowned for their skill in learning accurate patterns within large and complex datasets, appear well suited to the task of precipitation estimation, given the ample amount of high-resolution satellite data. In this study, the effectiveness of applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) together with the infrared (IR) and water vapor (WV) channels from geostationary satellites for estimating precipitation rate is explored. The proposed model performances are evaluated during summer 2012 and 2013 over central CONUS at the spatial resolution of 0.08 degrees and at an hourly time scale. Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS), which is an operational satellite-based product, and PERSIANN-Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (PERSIANN-SDAE) are employed as baseline models. Results demonstrate that the proposed model (PERSIANN-CNN) provides more accurate rainfall estimates compared to the baseline models at various temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, PERSIANN-CNN outperforms PERSIANN-CCS (and PERSIANN-SDAE) by 54% (and 23%) in the critical success index (CSI), demonstrating the detection skills of the model. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the rainfall estimates with respect to the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Stage IV gauge-radar data, for PERSIANN-CNN was lower than that of PERSIANN-CCS (PERSIANN-SDAE) by 37% (14%), showing the estimation accuracy of the proposed model.

TI  - Epidemiology and genetic variability of respiratory syncytial virus in Portugal, 2014-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality since it is a predominant viral agent causing respiratory tract infections in infants, young children and the elderly. Considering the availability of the RSV vaccines in the coming years, molecular understanding in RSV is necessary.Objective: The objective of the present study was to describe RSV epidemiology and genotype variability in Portugal during the 2014/15-2017/18 period.Material and methods: Epidemiological data and RSV-positive samples from patients with a respiratory infection were collected through the non-sentinel and sentinel influenza surveillance system (ISS). RSV detection, subtyping in A and B, and sequencing of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of G gene were performed by molecular methods. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and p-distance model on MEGA 7.0.Results: RSV prevalence varied between the sentinel (2.5%, 97/3891) and the non-sentinel ISS (20.7%, 3138/ 16779), being higher (P < 0.0001) among children aged < 5 years. Bronchiolitis (62.9%, 183/291) and influenza-like illness (24.6%, 14/57) were associated (P < 0.0001) with RSV laboratory confirmation among children aged < 6 months and adults 65 years, respectively. The HVR2 was sequenced for 562 samples. RSV-A (46.4%, 261/562) and RSV-B (53.6%, 301/562) strains clustered mainly to ON1 (89.2%, 233/261) and BA9 (92%, 277/301) genotypes, respectively, although NA1 and BA10 were also present until 2015/2016.Conclusion: The sequence and phylogenetic analysis reflected the relatively high diversity of Portuguese RSV strains. BA9 and ON1 genotypes, which have been circulating in Portugal since 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 respectively, predominated during the whole study period.

TI  - Identification of soil erosion-susceptible areas using fuzzy logic and analytical hierarchy process modeling in an agricultural watershed of Burdwan district, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a natural process; it adversely impacts natural resources, agricultural activities, ecological systems, and environmental quality as it degrades landscapes and water quality, disrupts ecosystems, and intensifies hazards. Management strategies are needed that protect soil erosion in agricultural watersheds to achieve the sustainable land-use planning. This study maps soil erosion susceptibility using two GIS-based machine-learning approaches-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic modeling in the Kunur River Basin, West Bengal, India. Fifteen soil erosion conditioning variables were integrated with the modeling methods, remote sensing data, and GIS analysis. The relative importance of the conditioning variables was assessed for their capacities to predict susceptibility of locations to soil erosion. The soil erosion susceptibility maps generated from the two models used 70% of surveyed soil erosion sites. These models' maps were validated with the characteristics of the remaining 30% of the soil erosion sites to produce a receiver operating characteristics curve. The results indicated that the fuzzy logic model has the higher prediction accuracy; the area under the curve (AUC) value was 91.4%. The AUC value of the AHP model was 89.7%. Both models indicated that study area contains regions of high to severe soil erosion susceptibility. Logistic regression was used to discern the variables' importance in the assessment. Relief, NDVI, distance from a river, rainfall erosivity, and soil types were the most important variables. TWI, SPI, aspect, and a sediment transportation index were of least importance. Fuzzy-logic-generated SESMs can be effective tools to guide protective actions and land managers' measures during the primary stages of soil erosion to control the development of soil degradation.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Colon Cancer: an Institutional Experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node staging is a major prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and remains to be the most important criterion for selecting patients for adjuvant therapy. The standard approach for lymph node evaluation is based on manual dissection and histological evaluation of HE-stained slides. For stage III disease (node positive), adjuvant chemotherapy increases the survival rate, while in node-negative stage II disease, in most cases, the chemotherapy is contraindicated due to increased morbidity without real benefit. Up to 30% of patients with node-negative colon cancer staged by standard pathologic techniques ultimately suffer disease recurrence and tumour-related mortality following potentially curative primary resection. Variations in outcome among patients with node-negative early-stage disease may reflect inadequate nodal resection and inaccuracies of pathologic staging. Hence, an accurate pN stage becomes essential. It is seen that classic pathological exam sometimes fails to identify lymph node micrometastases or isolated tumour cells, which might explain local or distant relapses in stage II patients. Sentinel lymph node study has the potential to detect micrometastases and lead to upstaging the disease which is crucial for planning adjuvant therapy and follow-up in these patients. In our study, we carried out SLNB in 40 clinically stage II patients operated for colon cancer. We used peritumoural injection of dye at the time of surgery to detect SLN(s) and analysed them using both microsectioning and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Our results show that SLNB can improve the accuracy of pTNM staging.

TI  - Erosion-deposition and land use/land cover of the Brahmaputra river in Assam, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brahmaputra is a unique dynamic river in the world with intense braiding and critical bank erosion. Both erosion and deposition are continuous processes in the river in an attempt to reach a new equilibrium in channel geometry and morphology by the ever dynamic nature of flow. Erosion and deposition of the river have link to land use and land cover (LULC) as the land cover is under constant change in a dynamic landscape constantly shaped by continuous erosion and deposition. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the extent of erosion and deposition along the Brahmaputra river and change in the LULC of the Brahmaputra river in Assam, India. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques were utilised to extract information from Landsat images. Total area of erosion and deposition during 1973-2014 was 1557 and 204 km(2), respectively. Increase in area (28%) of the Brahmaputra during 1973-2014 is not solely due to bank erosion, but also for the bifurcation of streams without the loss of land. LULC study has revealed that 29% area was occupied by active channels and 71% was occupied by bars in 2014. Maximum reaches experienced reduction of the submerged part in 2014 compared to 1994 in the post-monsoon months with an overall decrease from 37% to 29%. A reduction in natural grassland and forest has been observed with a corresponding increase in agricultural practices in different bars and islands of the Brahmaputra in Assam during 1994-2014.

AB  - We report different treatment effects between local and distant lesions based on oncotype DX in a patient with breast cancer administered neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman. Ultrasound(US)showed a mass 16*11*11mm in diameter in the C area of her right breast. Histological examination revealed invasive ductal carcinoma positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2(HER2), and a Ki-67 index of 38%. The recurrence score(RS)calculated from the core needle biopsy was 4(low-risk group)with a predicted 10-year risk of distant recurrence of 4% after 5 years of endocrine therapy. Oncotype DX showed that this patient would not benefit from chemotherapy. We administered neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. However, the tumor size increased to 26*18*15mm 1 month after treatment initiation. Therefore, right breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histopathologically, the effect of the endocrine therapy was grade 0 and the surgical margins were negative. Even though RS was low in the breast, the effect of endocrine therapy differed between local and distant lesions such as circulating tumor cells.

TI  - Methyl Salicylate Increases Attraction and Function of Beneficial Arthropods in Cranberries
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl salicylate (MeSA) is an herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) known to attract the natural enemies of herbivores in agro-ecosystems; however, whether this attraction leads to an increase in natural enemy functioning, i.e., predation, remains largely unknown. Here, we monitored for 2 years (2011-2012) the response of herbivores and natural enemies to MeSA lures (PredaLure) by using sticky and pitfall traps in cranberry bogs. In addition, European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, egg masses were used to determine whether natural enemy attraction to MeSA leads to higher predation. In both years, MeSA increased adult hoverfly captures on sticky traps and augmented predation of O. nubilalis eggs. However, MeSA also attracted more phytophagous thrips and, in 2012, more plant bugs (Miridae) to sticky traps. Furthermore, we used surveillance cameras to record the identity of natural enemies attracted to MeSA and measure their predation rate. Video recordings showed that MeSA lures increase visitation by adult lady beetles, adult hoverflies, and predatory mites to sentinel eggs, and predation of these eggs doubled compared to no-lure controls. Our data indicate that MeSA lures increase predator attraction, resulting in increased predation; thus, we provide evidence that attraction to HIPVs can increase natural enemy functioning in an agro-ecosystem.

TI  - Histopathological risk scoring system as a tool for predicting lymph nodal metastasis in penile squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Penile cancer is an aggressive neoplasm and nodal metastasis is a key factor in determining the outcome. While there is a paucity of tools predicting nodal metastasis, an elective groin node dissection (GND) may cause severe morbidity. We aimed to devise a histopathology-based risk stratification system to predict the risk of nodal metastasis in penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients.In this retrospective clinicopathological analysis, consecutive penile SCC patients who had undergone primary surgical treatment with GND from 2007 to 2012 were included. Histopathology slides were reviewed and a histopathological risk scoring system (ranging from 3 to 9) was devised by adding the values assigned to the following pathological variables: tumour grade (1-3); anatomical level of infiltration (1-3); and tumour infiltration pattern (1-3). Three risk groups were created based on histopathological risk scores. Final scores and risk groups were correlated with nodal metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). We also validated the earlier described prognostic index score (PIS) on our set of patients and compared it to our proposed scoring system.A total of 162 cases of primary penile resections with unilateral or bilateral groin node dissection were identified during the study period. Sixty-two of 68 patients (91.17%) and 58 of 94 patients (61.7%) had nodal metastasis on upfront and follow-up nodal basin surgeries, respectively. Chances of nodal metastasis for each risk group were as follows: low risk (score 3 and 4) 14.3%; intermediate risk (score 5) 52.6%; and high risk (scores 6-9) 83.7%. Follow-up was available in 145 patients (89.5%). Median follow-up was 21 months (1-96 months). The histopathological scoring system (p=0.04) and risk groups (p=0.005) had a statistically significant correlation with DFS but not with OS. Logistic regression model demonstrated that this stratification system was a good predictor of nodal metastasis. Further, this scoring system had better predictive sensitivity for detecting true node-negative cases and marginally better accuracy in detecting nodal metastasis as compared to the PIS.Our study demonstrates that the histopathological risk stratification can predict nodal metastasis and aid in planning management of penile cancer patients with judicious implementation of the morbid procedure of GND.

TI  - Dynamic simulation of urban expansion based on Cellular Automata and Markov Chain Model: a case study in Siliguri Metropolitan Area, West Bengal
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a process of population concentration, horizontal and as well as vertical expansion of city, such expansion creates stress on local resource and the environment. With the increase of economic functionality, rapid rate of population concentration in Metropolitan city Siliguri and associated urban expansion has been observed. This outward expansion led rapid rate of land-use transformation and environmental decay. Therefore, it is very essential to monitor urban dynamics-related ecological transformation. The present investigation has been selected to model urban dynamics with the help of Markov Chain base simulation model for the prediction of future urban growth pattern and direction. Simulated outputs show that from 1991 to 2033, there will be considerable decay in the agricultural and forest land because of the rapid urban expansion. Sprawling tendency has been observed from 2001, and the expansion is continuously growing in south west direction. The major transformation has occurred with a growth in the amount of built area, from 1991 to 2017, and the amount of built lands increased by 11.2%, green land decreased by 11.5%, and the water body has been decrease by 3.7%. These changes reveal the encroachment of green lands and open lands as two important and ecological infrastructures.

TI  - External dose evaluation based on detailed air dose rate measurements in living environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method was devised to estimate the realistic external doses of residents expected to return to their homes after evacuation orders are lifted. For 196 residents expected to return to six towns and villages, surveys were administered in FY 2014-2016. After interviewing residents about their expected life patterns after their return, detailed air dose rate measurements were taken along their reported personal routes representing patterns of movement in their daily life. The maximum and average annual additional external effective dose were estimated at 4.9 mSv and 0.86 mSv, respectively. Although the mean values and dispersion of external effective doses differed depending on the level of evacuation, for 93.3% of all residents, the estimated annual additional external effective doses were less than 2 mSv. Measuring air dose rates inside houses was found to be important to obtain a realistic evaluation of the external exposure dose because our research revealed that the average time spent indoors was 87% of the total living time. Moreover, the average exposure dose at home accounted for 66.8% of the annual exposure dose.

TI  - Improving the RST-OIL Algorithm for Oil Spill Detection under Severe Sun Glint Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the risk related to oil spill accidents has significantly increased due to a global growth in offshore extraction and oil maritime transport. To ensure sea safety, the implementation of a monitoring system able to provide real-time coverage of large areas and a timely alarm in case of accidents is of major importance. Satellite remote sensing, thanks to its inherent peculiarities, has become an essential component in such a system. Recently, the general Robust Satellite Technique (RST) approach has been successfully applied to oil spill detection (RST-OIL) using optical band satellite data. In this paper, an advanced configuration of RST-OIL is presented, and we aim to extend its applicability to a larger set of observation conditions, referring, in particular, to those in the presence of severe sun glint effects that generate some detection limits to the RST-OIL standard algorithm. To test such a configuration, the DeepWater Horizon platform accident from April 2010 was selected as a test case. We analyzed a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images that are usually significantly affected by sun glint in the Gulf of Mexico area. The accuracy of the achieved results was evaluated for comparison with a well-established satellite methodology based on microwave data, which confirms the potential of the proposed approach in identifying the oil presence on the scene with good accuracy and reliability, even in these severe conditions.

TI  - Melanoma-specific survival in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes: Relevance of sentinel tumor burden
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The tumor burden within the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is not included in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) melanoma classification. Therefore, we analysed the prognostic relevance of the SLN tumor burden in the stage III subgroups.Patients and methods: A total of 736 patients with melanoma with positive SLN and long-term follow-up (mean, 64.4 months; median, 59.0 months) were assessed. SLN tumor burden was evaluated by the maximum diameter of the largest deposit in all patients.Results: By univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses, melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of patients in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC and lower sentinel tumor burden ( cut-offs <= 0.5 mm and <= 1 mm) was significantly better than that in patients with higher sentinel tumor load (>0.5 mm and >1 mm).By multivariate analysis using the Cox model, the maximum diameter of the largest deposit (cut-off <= 0.5 mm versus >0.5 mm and cut-off <= 1 mm as continuous variables) represented an independent prognostic parameter for MSS in stage III patients. Cut-off of 0.5 mm showed a slightly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC = 0.617) when than the cut-off of 1 mm (AUC = 0.599).Conclusion: The prognosis of patients with stage III melanoma can be determined more precisely if the SLN tumor burden is considered, also within the existing AJCC subgroups. Thus, this parameter should be included in future classifications, and our study provides benchmarks in estimating prognosis and counselling patients with melanoma with positive sentinel nodes beyond the 8th AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. The optimal cut-off remains for SLN tumor burden remains to be determined, but our results suggest that a cut-off lower than 1 mm is preferable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - EpiExploreR: A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Animal Disease Data
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are a significant public and animal health threat. In some zoonosis, the early detection of virus spread in animals is a crucial early warning for humans. The analyses of animal surveillance data are therefore of paramount importance for public health authorities to identify the appropriate control measure and intervention strategies in case of epidemics. The interaction among host, vectors, pathogen and environment require the analysis of more complex and diverse data coming from different sources. There is a wide range of spatiotemporal methods that can be applied as a surveillance tool for cluster detection, identification of risk areas and risk factors and disease transmission pattern evaluation. However, despite the growing effort, most of the recent integrated applications still lack of managing simultaneously different datasets and at the same time making available an analytical tool for a complete epidemiological assessment. In this paper, we present EpiExploreR, a user-friendly, flexible, R-Shiny web application. EpiExploreR provides tools integrating common approaches to analyze spatiotemporal data on animal diseases in Italy, including notified outbreaks, surveillance of vectors, animal movements data and remotely sensed data. Data exploration and analysis results are displayed through an interactive map, tables and graphs. EpiExploreR is addressed to scientists and researchers, including public and animal health professionals wishing to test hypotheses and explore data on surveillance activities.

TI  - Onchocerciasis in Burkina Faso: a Re-Emerging Vector-Borne Endemic Disease
T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Burkina Faso, like other countries, reported a focal interruption of onchocerciasis transmission and was thus placed under post-therapeutic surveillance. However, the country seems to be experiencing a resurgence of the disease according to recent surveys at certain sentinel sites and data from various surveys. The aim of our study is to take stock of the evolution of the current epidemiological situation of onchocerciasis in Burkina Faso. For data collection, in addition to the scientific articles, we have used data from different epidemiological and entomological surveys conducted by the National Program for the Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (PNLMTN) through its onchocerciasis elimination unit in Burkina Faso. Prior to implementation of the Onchocerciasis Control Program in West Africa (OCP), Burkina Faso had onchocerciasis prevalence between 60% and 80%. In 2002, the maximum prevalence dropped to 15%. However, in 2010 and 2011, epidemiological surveys indicated that some villages in the Comoe River basin had prevalence rate ranging from 0.7% to 71%. Thirteen (13) villages had prevalence rates above the tolerable threshold of 5%. Despite the implementation of the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) since 2011, recent surveys show a tendency for a recrudescence of the disease in some sites, yet covered by the TIDC. This suggests that the elimination of onchocerciasis requires the integration of new control strategies. Thus, an essential condition for the elimination of onchocerciasis is the analysis of the situation in each focus in order to define the most cost-effective strategy for permanently interrupting the transmission of the parasite. National onchocerciasis elimination committees put in place will play a key role in determining the best strategy.

TI  - Land-Cover Dependent Relationships between Fire and Soil Moisture
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - For this study, we characterized the dependence of fire counts (FCs) on soil moisture (SM) at global and sub-global scales using 15 years of remote sensing data. We argue that this mathematical relationship serves as an effective way to predict fire because it is a proxy for the semi-quantitative fire-productivity relationship that describes the tradeoff between fuel availability and climate as constraints on fire activity. We partitioned the globe into land-use and land-cover (LULC) categories of forest, grass, cropland, and pasture to investigate how the fire-soil moisture (fire-SM) behavior varies as a function of LULC. We also partitioned the globe into four broadly defined biomes (Boreal, Grassland-Savanna, Temperate, and Tropical) to study the dependence of fire-SM behavior on LULC across those biomes. The forest and grass LULC fire-SM curves are qualitatively similar to the fire-productivity relationship with a peak in fire activity at intermediate SM, a steep decline in fire activity at low SM (productivity constraint), and gradual decline as SM increases (climate constraint), but our analysis highlights how forests and grasses differ across biomes as well. Pasture and cropland LULC are a distinctly human use of the landscape, and fires detected on those LULC types include intentional fires. Cropland fire-SM curves are similar to those for grass LULC, but pasture fires are evident at higher SM values than other LULC. This suggests a departure from the expected climate constraint when burning is happening at non-optimal flammability conditions. Using over a decade of remote sensing data, our results show that quantifying fires relative to a single physical climate variable (soil moisture) is possible on both cultivated and uncultivated landscapes. Linking fire to observable soil moisture conditions for different land-cover types has important applications in fire management and fire modeling.

TI  - Assessment of Categorical Triple Collocation for Sea Ice/Open Water Observations: Application to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the sea ice cover is important for both climate studies and ice operations, such as shipping. It is challenging to validate even basic essential variables, such as the sea ice extent, due to a lack of appropriate validation data. Instead of focusing on validation, this paper looks at the use of categorical triple collocation (CTC) for the task of quantitatively comparing three colocated data sets. CTC has been developed and used in earlier studies to rank binary data sets. In this paper, we extend earlier studies and bring in recent results from the binary classification community to estimate the class imbalance (the relative proportion of each class, ice or water). We then use this class imbalance to obtain quantitative estimates of the proportion correct of ice (sensitivity) and the proportion correct of water (specificity). The methodology is first tested using toy data, after which three data sets from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the east coast of Canada, are used. These data sets are from an iceocean model, a passive microwave sea ice concentration retrieval, and a sea ice concentration retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). By looking at both the sensitivity and the specificity, it is found that the passive microwave data have difficulty in recognizing ice during freeze-up, but they perform well at obtaining the correct water observations. This distinction cannot be made by ranking the data sets. The CTC method is compared with, and found to be complementary to, a validation using ice/water states from the interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system.

T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary iron minerals associated with acid mine drainage (AMD) such as copiapite, jarosite, schwertmannite, goethite, ferrihydrite, and hematite can be generated from pyrite oxidation. This study was an effort to determine the AMD potential of the Darrehzar mine, a porphyry copper mine in the Kerman Cenozoic magmatic arc, using remote sensing and field data. The spectral angle mapper method was applied on Sentinel 2a images to identify AMD minerals and classify the study area. The produced map was verified by field surveys and laboratory analysis of rocks and sediments as well as pH and electrical conductivity measurements of water samples. Jarosite-clay group minerals were detected in the mine pit and in an active waste dump, and jarosite-goethite and goethite-hematite group minerals were identified in inactive waste dumps. Moreover, acidic water was observed in the pit, while the neutral water was where it arrives and discharges from the mine.

TI  - Validation of Physical Radiative Transfer Equation-Based Land Surface Temperature Using Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery and SURFRAD in-situ Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key criterion in the physics of the Earth surface that controls the interactions between the land and atmosphere. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of physics-based Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) method on LST retrieval using Landsat 8 satellite imagery and simultaneous in-situ LST data. In order to validate the satellite-based LST, in-situ LST measurements were obtained from Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) stations simultaneous with satellite data acquisitions. In the study, four SURFRAD stations (BND, FPK, TBL and GWN) and five images for each SURFRAD station, totally twenty cloud-free images, were used for RTE-based LST validation. RTE method uses the atmospheric parameters acquired from radiosounding data simultaneous with satellite pass; however, these parameters were retrieved from NASA's atmospheric correction parameter calculator since radiosounding data are not available every time. Thus, this situation is another contribution of this study. As a result of the validation process of all data, the statistical measures, namely, coefficient of determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) were calculated as 0.96, 3.12 K, 2.30 K and 0.33, respectively. However, the accuracy of RTE method on LST retrieval increased (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 2.17 K, MAE = 1.44 K and RSR = 0.25) after removing TBL station from the analysis, since LST differences in this station were high for all scenes. RSR (ranging from 0 to high positive vlues) is an important measure for model evaluation, and the lower RSR value means high performance of the model. The obtained results revealed that physics-based RTE method is an effective and practical way for LST retrieval from Landsat 8 data despite using interpolated atmospheric parameters instead of radiosounding data.

TI  - Pre-Processing of Panchromatic Images to Improve Object Detection in Pansharpened Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many techniques of fusion of multi-sensors satellite images have been developed. This article focuses on examining and improvement the usability of pansharpened images for object detection, especially when fusing data with a high GSD ratio. A methodology to improve an interpretative ability of pansharpening results is based on pre-processing of the panchromatic image using Logarithmic-Laplace filtration. The proposed approach was used to examine several different pansharpening methods and data sets with different spatial resolution ratios, i.e., from 1:4 to 1:60. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach significantly improves an object detection of fused images, especially for imagery data with a high-resolution ratio. The interpretative ability was assessed using qualitative method (based on image segmentation) and quantitative method (using an indicator based on the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) detector). In the case of combining data acquired with the same sensor the interpretative potential had improved by a dozen or so per cent. However, for data with a high resolution ratio, the improvement was several dozen, or even several hundred per cents, in the case of images blurred after pansharpening by the classic method (with original panchromatic image). Image segmentation showed that it is possible to recognize narrow objects that were originally blurred and difficult to identify. In addition, for panchromatic images acquired by WorldView-2, the proposed approach improved not only object detection but also the spectral quality of the fused image.

TI  - Integration of Soil Electrical Conductivity and Indices Obtained through Satellite Imagery for Differential Management of Pasture Fertilization
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland pastures in the Alentejo region, located in the south of Portugal, normally occupy soils that have low fertility but, simultaneously, important spatial variability. Rational application of fertilizers requires knowledge of spatial variability of soil characteristics and crop response, which reinforces the interest of technologies that facilitates the identification of homogeneous management zones (HMZ). In this work, a pasture field of about 25 ha, integrated in the Montado mixed ecosystem (agro-silvo-pastoral), was monitored. Surveys of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) were carried out in November 2017 and October 2018 with a Veris 2000 XA contact sensor. A total of 24 sampling points (30 x 30 m) were established in tree-free zones to allow readings of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Historical time series of these indices were obtained from satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) in winter and spring 2017 and 2018. Three zones with different potential productivity were defined based on the results obtained in terms of spatial variability and temporal stability of the measured parameters. These are the basis for the elaboration of differentiated prescription maps of fertilizers with variable application rate technology, taking into account the variability of soil characteristics and pasture development, contributing to the sustainability of this ecosystem.

TI  - Long-Term Change of the Secchi Disk Depth in Lake Maninjau, Indonesia Shown by Landsat TM and ETM plus Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the lakes in Indonesia are facing environmental problems such as eutrophication, sedimentation, and depletion of dissolved oxygen. The water quality data for supporting lake management in Indonesia are very limited due to financial constraints. To address this issue, satellite data are often used to retrieve water quality data. Here, we developed an empirical model for estimating the Secchi disk depth (SD) from Landsat TM/ETM+ data by using data collected from nine Indonesian lakes/reservoirs (SD values 0.5-18.6 m). We made two efforts to improve the robustness of the developed model. First, we carried out an image preprocessing series of steps (i.e., removing contaminated water pixels, filtering images, and mitigating atmospheric effects) before the Landsat data were used. Second, we selected two band ratios (blue/green and red/green) as SD predictors; these differ from previous studies' recommendation. The validation results demonstrated that the developed model can retrieve SD values with an R-2 of 0.60 and the root mean square error of 1.01 m in Lake Maninjau, Indonesia (SD values ranged from 0.5 to 5.8 m, n = 74). We then applied the developed model to 230 scenes of preprocessed Landsat TM/ETM+ images to generate a long-term SD database for Lake Maninjau during 1987-2018. The visual comparison of the in situ-measured and satellite estimated SD values, as well as several events (e.g., algal bloom, water gate open, and fish culture), showed that the Landsat-based SD estimations well captured the change tendency of water transparency in Lake Maninjau, and these estimations will thus provide useful data for lake managers and policy-makers.

TI  - Validation of the LACE readmission and mortality prediction model in a large surgical cohort: Comparison of performance at preoperative assessment and discharge time points
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: The LACE index (Length of stay, admission Acuity, Charlson comorbidity index, and Emergency department visits within 6 months of current admission) is a practical tool designed to predict the risk of readmission or mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge. We sought to validate and examine its performance in a large surgical population at both the preoperative assessment and discharge time points.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: We identified all admissions with a surgery or procedure at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between 2010 and 2015.Patients: A total of 192,670 admissions (age >= 18) were included in the study.Interventions: None.Measurements: LACE scores were calculated and analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Discrimination was assessed with the c-statistic, calibration was assessed with calibration plots, and overall performance evaluated with the Brier score. Four models were created: admissions with any surgery or procedure, surgical admissions using actual length of stay (ALOS), surgical admissions using estimated length of stay (ELOS) and non-surgical procedural admissions.Main results: 192,670 admissions were included. The all admissions model c-statistic was 0.77 with a Brier score of 0.13. Surgical admissions with ALOS and ELOS had a c-statistic of 0.80, 0.82 and a Brier score of 0.10, 0.08 respectively. Non-surgical procedural admissions had a c-statistic of 0.76 and a Brier score of 0.14. Calibration for all models was adequate.Conclusions: The LACE model for surgical and procedural admissions had good discrimination and adequate calibration. Analysis of the model applied to surgical admissions using ELOS demonstrated slightly better overall performance than ALOS, suggesting that LACE could be utilized for readmission risk stratification at the time of preoperative assessment.

TI  - Ecological environment quality assessment based on remote sensing data for land consolidation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological transformation is inevitable in development of land consolidation (LC) in China. An appropriate approach for assessing ecological environmental quality (EEQ) is fundamental for the analysis of LC efficiency. However, previous studies generally rely on statistical data or land use data, and the objectivity of these data and research periods are generally limited at the project scale. Based on the remote sensing data 6 years before and after LC, this study developed the RS-based theoretical research framework, provided a contrastive analysis between Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) and Ecological Index (EI) and expanded spatio-temporal pattern study to assess EEQ in a typical land consolidation project area (LCPA) of China, with the application of RSEI method. Results suggested that RSEI and EI showed strong comparability in the ecological sense, and RSEI can reflect the changes in EEQ in LCPA more effectively than El. Wetness and greenness indicators had positive effects on EEQ promotion, while heat and dryness indicators had negative effects, and the effect of dryness indicator was more significant than that of other indicators. Before, during, and after LC, EEQ decreased first, increased later, and decreased overall, with the characteristics of degenerating during the construction period, improving during the restoration period, as well as degenerating in the overall process. LC caused persistent disturbance to EEQ but there was a lag for restoration for more than 5 years. Prediction indicated that the selected indicators were the key indicators of EEQ among which wetness and greenness were essential for EEQ improvement. This study provides certain theoretical guidance and method reference for the scientific, objective, direct, and long-term comprehensive monitoring and assessment of EEQ at the project scale.

TI  - Photoacoustic imaging depth comparison at 532-, 800-, and 1064-nm wavelengths: Monte Carlo simulation and experimental validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) provides high-resolution and high-optical-contrast imaging beyond optical diffusion limit. Further improvement in imaging depth has been achieved by using near-infrared window-I (NIR-I, 700 to 900 nm) for illumination, due to lower scattering and absorption by tissues in this wavelength range. Recently, near-infrared window-II (NIR-II, 900 to 1700 nm) has been explored for PAI. We studied the imaging depths in biological tissues for different illumination wavelengths in visible, NIR-I, and NIR-II regions using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and validated with experimental results. MC simulations were done to compute fluence in tissue, absorbance in blood vessel, and in a spherical absorber (mimicking sentinel lymph node) embedded at different depths in breast tissue. Photoacoustic tomography and acoustic resolution photoacoustic microscopy experiments were conducted to validate the MC results. We demonstrate that maximum imaging depth is achieved by wavelengths in NIR-I window (similar to 800 nm) when the energy density deposited is same for all wavelengths. However, illumination using wavelengths around 1064 nm (NIR-II window) gives the maximum imaging depth when the energy density deposited is proportional to maximum permissible exposure (MPE) at corresponding wavelength. These results show that it is the higher MPE of NIR-II window that helps in increasing the PAI depth for chromophores embedded in breast tissue. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of land use change and its effect on soil carbon stock using multitemporal satellite data in semiarid region of Rajasthan, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Land use change plays a vital role in global carbon dynamics. Understanding land use change impact on soil carbon stock is crucial for implementing land use management to increase carbon stock and reducing carbon emission. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine land use change and to assess its effect on soil carbon stock in semi-arid part of Rajasthan, India. Landsat temporal satellite data of Pushkar valley region of Rajasthan acquired on 1993, 2003, and 2014 were analyzed to assess land use change. Internal trading of land use was depicted through matrices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock was calculated for soil to a depth of 30 cm in each land use type in 2014 using field data collection. The SOC stock for previous years was estimated using stock change factor. The effect of land use change on SOC stock was determined by calculating change in SOC stock (t/ha) by deducting the base-year SOC stock from the final year stock of a particular land use conversion. Results The total area under agricultural lands was increased by 32.14% while that under forest was decreased by 23.14% during the time period of 1993-2014. Overall land use change shows that in both the periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2014), 7% of forest area was converted to agricultural land and about 15% changes occurred among agricultural land. In 1993-2003, changes among agricultural land led to maximum loss of soil carbon, i.e., 4.88 Mt C and during 2003-2014, conversion of forest to agricultural land led to loss in 3.16 Mt C. Conclusion There was a continuous decrease in forest area and increase in cultivated area in each time period. Land use change led to alteration in carbon equity in soil due to change or loss in vegetation. Overall, we can conclude that the internal trading of land use area during the 10-year period (1993-2003) led to net loss of SOC stock by 8.29 Mt C. Similarly, land use change during 11-year period (2003-2014) caused net loss of SOC by 2.76 Mt C. Efforts should be made to implement proper land use management practices to enhance the SOC content.

TI  - Evaluation of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Aerosol Algorithm for Himawari-8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), is a new generation geostationary satellite that provides remote sensing data to retrieve atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) at high spatial (1 km) and high temporal (10 min) resolutions. The Geostationary-National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth exchange (GeoNEX) project recently adapted the multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm, originally developed for joint retrieval of AOD and surface anisotropic reflectance with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, to generate Earth monitoring products from the latest geostationary satellites including Himawari-8. This study evaluated the GeoNEX Himawari-8 similar to 1 km MAIAC AOD retrieved over all the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) sites between 6 degrees N-30 degrees N and 91 degrees E-127 degrees E. The corresponding JMA Himawari-8 AOD products were also evaluated for comparison. We only used cloud-free and the best quality satellite AOD retrievals and compiled a total of 16,532 MAIAC-AERONET and 21,737 JMA-AERONET contemporaneous pairs of AOD values for 2017. Statistical analyses showed that both MAIAC and JMA data are highly correlated with AERONET AOD, with the correlation coefficient (R) of similar to 0.77, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of similar to 0.16. The absolute bias of MAIAC AOD (0.02 overestimation) appears smaller than that of the JMA AOD (0.05 underestimation). In comparison with the JMA data, the time series of MAIAC AOD were more consistent with AERONET AOD values and better capture the diurnal variations of the latter. The dependence of MAIAC AOD bias on scattering angles is also discussed.

TI  - Refinement of Landslide Susceptibility Map Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry in Areas of Intense Mining Activities in the Karst Region of Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incremental vertical ground movements due to coal mining can increase landslide susceptibility greatly in a short time and have thus triggered a large number of geological disasters, especially in the Karst Region, where a lot of steep slopes are on fractured rocks. Therefore, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) in Karst Region should be updated regularly. This paper presents an efficient methodology to update and refine LSM by using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data directly. First, an original LSM was produced by using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and the distribution of coal mining was considered a crucial factor to generate the LSM. Then, the Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique was implemented to retrieve displacement time-series. Finally, the landslide displacement map, produced by the PSInSAR analysis, was projected to the direction of the steepest slope and resampled to the same cell in the LSM, to update the original LSM. This methodology is illustrated with the case study of Bijie in the Karst Region of Southwest China, wherein the ascending RADARSAT-2 and descending Sentinel-1 datasets are processed for the period of 2017-2019. The results show that the susceptibility degree increased in 56.41 km(2) of the study area, and 80 percent of the increased susceptibility degree was caused by coal mining. The comparison between original and refined LSM in two specific areas revealed that the proposed method can produce more-reliable landslide susceptibility maps in areas of intense mining activities in the Karst Region.

TI  - Stimulus-specificity in the Responses of Immune Sentinel Cells.
T2  - Current opinion in systems biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Innate immune sentinel cells must initiate and orchestrate appropriate immune responses for myriad pathogens. These stimulus-specific gene expression responses are mediated by combinatorial and temporal coding within a handful of immune response signaling pathways. We outline the scope of our current understanding and indicate pressing outstanding questions. The innate immune response is a first-line defense against invading pathogens and coordinates the activation and recruitment of specialized immune cells, thereby initiating the adaptive immune response. While the adaptive immune system is capable of highly pathogen-specific immunity through the process of genetic recombination and clonal selection, innate immunity is frequently viewed as a catch-all system that initiates general immune activation. In this review, we are re-examining this view, as we are distinguishing between immune sentinel functions mediated by macrophages and dendritic cells and innate immune effector functions mediated by cells such as neutrophils, NK cells, etc. Given pathogen diversity, including modes of entry, replication cycles, and strategies of immune evasion and spread, all successive waves of the immune response ought to be tailored to the specific immune threat, leading us to postulate that immune sentinel functions by macrophages and dendritic cells ought to be highly stimulus-specific. Here we review the experimental evidence for stimulus-specific responses by immune sentinel cells which initiate and coordinate immune responses, as well as the mechanisms by which this specificity may be achieved.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents investigation data on the seasonal dynamics of productivity, status, and species composition of vegetation on fallow lands in the Krasnoyarsk forest steppe (Middle Siberia) obtained from terrain and satellite materials from 2017. The results of the study of grass plant communities on the basis of geobotanical descriptions and terrain spectrometry were have been used for a more accurate interpretation of cosmic photographs of moderate and low resolution. For studying vegetation on fallow lands, we analyze the seasonal dynamics of various vegetative indices (NDVI, EVI, LSWI, and LAI) and parameters (NPP, FPAR, and LST (land surface temperature)) obtained from MODIS satellite images. Our analysis of satellite data shows the absence of evidences of plowing and mowing in the studied area. A positive correlation is revealed between vegetation indices of biomass (NDVI, EVI, LAI, and NPP) and parameters of hydrothermal conditions (LSWI, FPAR, and LST).

TI  - The Spatial Pattern of Urban Settlement in China from the 1980s to 2010
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic urbanization process of China has stimulated a massive growth of urban settlements in the past few decades. With the development of remote sensing technology and the release of the long-time Landsat archive, spatial characteristics of urban settlement are gradually analyzed on a large scale, and various patterns are developed for describing and analyzing it. However, the urban settlement patterns were mainly quantified by the landscape metrics in existing studies, the underlying features shaping urban settlement pattern were always neglected. In this study, we establish a systematic and comprehensive 'urban development index system' for describing China's urban settlement pattern and its evolutions during the end of the 1980s through to 2010 by using a series of statistical methods. Results show that (1) urban settlement pattern in 2010 is quantified comparatively simpler and more completely than in the end of the 1980s; (2) urban settlements in western and eastern regions present integrated pattern and homogeneous attributes, while urban settlements in central and northeastern regions present relatively complex pattern and various attributes; (3) urban settlements with the most variable pattern are accompanied by the most dynamic population and economic capacity, followed by landscape dispersion. Topographic complexity of urban settlements generally remained unchanged or with slight fluctuations, therefore, it has limited influence on settlement pattern evolution.

TI  - A comprehensive evaluation of disturbance agent classification approaches: Strengths of ensemble classification, multiple indices, spatio-temporal variables, and direct prediction
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series images are used for the detection of forest disturbance and the classification of causal agents. Various studies have classified disturbance agents with respect to forest disturbance detected using Landsat time series images. However, the accuracy of the finally classified disturbance agents in different approaches is rarely evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of using ensemble classification, and multiple spectral and spatio-temporal information for the accuracy of the classification of disturbance agents in two-stage prediction (i.e., disturbance agents are classified with respect to the detected disturbance) and direct prediction (i.e., disturbance agents are directly classified from Landsat temporal information). Predictor variables were derived from the results of the trajectory-based temporal segmentation of five spectral indices using an annual Landsat time series (2000-2018). We compared six approaches of classifying disturbance agents. For two-stage prediction, we investigated four disturbance detection approaches: threshold-based detection with a single spectral index, random forest (RF) model with a single spectral index, RF model with multiple spectral indices, and RF model with spatio-temporal variables. The detected disturbance pixels were aggregated to disturbance patches and classified into disturbance agents. For direct prediction, two RF models one with only temporal variables and the other with spatio-temporal variables were constructed to classify pixel-based disturbance agents. The overall accuracy of the RF model using spatio-temporal variables for direct prediction was 92.4% and significantly higher than that of the RF model for two-stage prediction (90.9%). The use of an RF model based only on a single spectral index in disturbance detection was not effective for improving accuracy compared with threshold-based detection; however, the use of an RF model based on multiple spectral indices in disturbance detection improved the accuracy of the final classification of disturbance agents. Introducing spatial variables in RF models was effective for improving the overall classification accuracy in pixel-based direct prediction. However, it was not necessary in two-stage prediction because of spatial information contained in the patches. Although a spatially discontinuous appearance was observed for the RF model for directly classifying disturbance agents, this could be an alternative approach to two-stage prediction when considering the relative classification performance and simplicity of implementation.

TI  - Analysis of Availability of High-resolution Satellite and UAV Multispectral Images for Forest Burn Severity Classification
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Damage of forest fire should be investigated quickly and accurately for recovery, compensation and prevention of secondary disaster. Using remotely sensed data, burn severity is investigated based on the difference of reflectance or spectral indices before and after forest fire. Recently, the use of high resolution satellite and UAV imagery is increasing, but it is not easy to obtain an image before forest fire that cannot be predicted where and when. This study tried to analyze availability of high-resolution images and supervised classifiers on the bum severity classification. Two supervised classifiers were applied to the KOMPSAT-3A image and the UAV multispectral image acquired after the forest fire. The maximum likelihood (MLH) classifier use absolute value of spectral reflectance and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) classifier use pattern of spectra. As a result, in terms of spatial resolution, the classification accuracy of the UAV image was higher than that of the satellite image. However, both images shown very high classification accuracy, which means that they can be used for classification of burn severity. In terms of the classifier, the maximum likelihood method showed higher classification accuracy than the spectral angle mapper because some classes have similar spectral pattern although they have different absolute reflectance. Therefore, burn severity can be classified using the high resolution multispectral images after the fire, but an appropriate classifier should be selected to get high accuracy.

TI  - Arctic Greening Caused by Warming Contributes to Compositional Changes of Mycobiota at the Polar Urals
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term influence of climate change on spatio-temporal dynamics of the Polar mycobiota was analyzed on the eastern macro slope of the Polar Urals (Sob River valley and Mountain Slantsevaya) over a period of 60 years. The anthropogenic impact is minimal in the study area. Effects of environmental warming were addressed as changes in treeline and forest communities (greening of the vegetation). With warming, permafrost is beginning to thaw, and as it thaws, it decomposes. Therefore, we also included depth of soil thawing and litter decomposition in our study. Particular attention was paid to the reaction of aphyllophoroid fungal communities concerning these factors. Our results provide evidence for drastic changes in the mycobiota due to global warming. Fungal community composition followed changes of the vegetation, which was transforming from forest-tundra to northern boreal type forests during the last 60 years. Key fungal groups of the ongoing borealization and important indicator species are discussed. Increased economic activity in the area may lead to deforestation, destruction of swamps, and meadows. However, this special environment provides important services such as carbon sequestration, soil formation, protecting against flood risks, and filtering of air. In this regard, we propose to include the studied territory in the Polarnouralsky Natural Park.

TI  - Axillary evaluation is not warranted in patients preoperatively diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ by core needle biopsy
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by core needle biopsy (CNB) have a great chance of upstaging to invasive cancer. Positive axillary status can be found in these patients. This study sought to identify clinicopathological factors associated with upstaging and axillary metastasis in patients preoperatively diagnosed with DCIS by CNB.Materials and Methods: This study identified 604 patients (cT1-3N0M0) with pre-operative diagnosis of pure DCIS by CNB who had undergone axillary evaluation from August 2006 to December 2015 at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC). Predictors of upstaging and axillary lymph nodes metastasis were analyzed, respectively.Results: Of all 604 patients, 121 (20.03%) and 193 (31.95%) patients were upstaged to DCIS with microinvasion (DCISM) and invasive breast cancer (IBC). Positive axillary lymph nodes were identified in 41 (6.79%) patients. Predictors of upstaging included tumor size on ultrasonography (>2 cm) (OR 1.786, P = .002) and ER+HER2+ status (OR 1.874, P = .022) in multivariate analysis. Factors associated with axillary lymph nodes metastasis included tumor size on pathology (OR 2.336, P = .038) and number of lesions (OR 3.354, P = .039) in multivariate analysis. In addition, upstaging on final pathology had a significant influence on axillary lymph nodes status (P <.001).Conclusion: Axillary evaluation was recommended in patients with larger tumor size (>2 cm), multifocal lesions or ER+HER2+ status. Despite of a 51.98% upstaging rate, the rate of axillary metastasis in these patients was relatively low, supporting the omission of axillary evaluation in selected patients with low risk of upstaging or axillary metastasis.

TI  - Long-term (2006-2015) variations and relations of multiple atmospheric pollutants based on multi-remote sensing data over the North China Plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this analysis, the Aqua/MODIS aerosol optical thickness (AOD), Aura/OMI tropospheric NO2 and SO2 column concentration from 2006 to 2015 were used to statistically analyze the spatial distribution characteristics and variation trends of three polluted parameters from three temporal scales of monthly, seasonal and annual average. The results showed that the minimum values of NO2 and SO2 column concentrations both appeared in July and August, and the maximum values appeared in December and January, which was contrary to the variations in AOD. The highly polluted levels were mainly distributed in Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Yancheng cities of Hebei Province, and gradually transported to Zhengzhou, Henan Province, north and southwest of Shandong Province, and Tianjin, along the main line of Taiyuan-Linyi, Shanxi Province. AOD and NO2 had significant differences on the seasonal average scale, whereas SO2 had little changes. These pollutants had declined year by year since 2011, in the 10-year period, AOD and SO2 respectively decreased by 17.14% and 10.57%, and only NO2 rose from 8.69 x 10(15) molecules/cm(2) in 2006 to 9.10 x 10(15) molecules/cm(2) in 2015 with the increase rate of 4.79%. Integrated with MODIS-released fire products and the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), high AOD values in summer were usually accompanied by frequent biomass burning, and heavy heating demand of coal burning led to largest NO2 and SO2 levels in winter. Both inter-annual variations of MEIC NOx and OMI-observed NO2 responded to emission reductions of vehicle exhaustions positively, but vehicle population in Henan and Shandong provinces need to be further controlled. The significant decline of SO2 is mainly attributed to the enforcement of de-sulfurization devices in power plants. Our study found that in the treatment of complex atmospheric pollution, in addition to strict control of common sources of emissions from AOD, NO2 and SO2, it is also necessary to consider their individual characteristics.

TI  - The Utility of the Upcoming HyspIRI's Simulated Spectral Settings in Detecting Maize Gray Leafy Spot in Relation to Sentinel-2 MSI, VENμS, and Landsat 8 OLI Sensors
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the high maize yield loses caused by incidences of disease, as well as incomprehensive monitoring initiatives in crop farming, there is a need for spatially explicit, cost-effective, and consistent approaches for monitoring, as well as for forecasting, food-crop diseases, such as maize Gray Leaf Spot. Such approaches are valuable in reducing the associated economic losses while fostering food security. In this study, we sought to investigate the utility of the forthcoming HyspIRI sensor in detecting disease progression of Maize Gray Leaf Spot infestation in relation to the Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI spectral configurations simulated using proximally sensed data. Healthy, intermediate, and severe categories of maize crop infections by the Gray Leaf Spot disease were discriminated based on partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) algorithm. Comparatively, the results show that the HyspIRI's simulated spectral settings slightly performed better than those of Sentinel-2 MSI, VEN mu S, and Landsat 8 OLI sensor. HyspIRI exhibited an overall accuracy of 0.98 compared to 0.95, 0.93, and 0.89, which were exhibited by Sentinel-2 MSI, VEN mu S, and Landsat 8 OLI sensor sensors, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed that the visible section, red-edge, and NIR covered by all the four sensors were the most influential spectral regions for discriminating different Maize Gray Leaf Spot infections. These findings underscore the potential value of the upcoming hyperspectral HyspIRI sensor in precision agriculture and forecasting of crop-disease epidemics, which are necessary to ensure food security.

TI  - Evaluation of crop water demand for sustainable crop production using geospatial tools in a canal command of West Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector is the primary consumer of water resources around the world, and the need for additional food production for growing population further exerts more pressure on water resources. In this study, crop water demand was assessed spatially and temporally for a case study area, Damodar Canal Command (DCC) using geospatial techniques. Crop evapotranspiration was estimated for all the crop seasons using reference evapotranspiration and Fraction of Vegetation cover (FV) that was used as a surrogate for crop coefficient. The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method. FV was computed based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from MODIS satellite imagery and its value ranges from 0 to 1. The maximum and minimum reference evapotranspiration values were estimated as 8.44 and 1.88 mmday(-1 )in May and September, respectively during the normal year 2004. The average monthly crop water demand was maximum in May i.e. 8.08 mmday(-l). Among all crop seasons, Boro season has the maximum crop water demand followed by Aus and Aman seasons with maximum ET(c )as 496, 438 and 328 mm, respectively. Total annual crop water demand for normal year, 2004 was estimated at 1237 mmyr(-1) in the study area. Spatially and temporally distributed crop water demand estimates help the irrigation planners to devise the strategies for effective irrigation management.

TI  - WAVEFORM RETRACKING ANALYSES OF ALTIMETRY SATELLITE DATA AROUND GULF, SMALL ISLANDS, AND DEEP WATERS IN HALMAHERA SEA
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of sea surface height (SSH) estimation from altimeter satellites is strongly influenced by waters condition and coastal land. In general, SSH estimations in offshore are accurate. However, in coastal waters, SSH estimation are inaccurate due to the reflection of signal from land. The study purpose was to retrack the waveform of Altimeter satellites in a complex the Halmahera Sea. The data used for this study were the waveform Sensor Geophysical Data Record type D (SGDR-D) of Jason-2 and Jason-3 of 2017. To retrack waveform, we used several algorithms i.e., Offset Centre of Gravity (OCOG), Iced, Threshold, and Improved Threshold. All retrackers provided significant improvement in SSH estimations except OCOG. The best retracker used in Halmahera Sea for the shallow and narrow bay was Threshold 10%, for the deep and wide bay was Threshold 50%, and for small islands waters were Threshold 10% and Threshold 20%. In general, Non-Brown waveforms were more common in the shallow and narrow bay waters (average=63.49%) vs. the deep and wide bay waters (average=11.51%) and small island waters (average=9.57%). However, the improvement percentage of SSH estimations in the shallow and narrow bay waters was higher than the deep and wide bay waters and small islands waters. The best retrackers in the Halmahera Sea was the Threshold 10% algorithm with the IMP value of 96.71% on Jason-2 pass 164.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modifications of algorithms for the classification of single-layer, vertical development clouds, and multilayer clouds based on a probabilistic neural network and a neuro-fuzzy classifier are proposed. Clouds are classified into 16 types according to the meteorological standard, including the combined subtypes of stratus, altocumulus, cirrus, and cirrostratus clouds. The article uses a description of clouds based on information about the texture of their images on satellite images from MODIS and its products with data on the physical parameters of clouds. The structure of classification algorithms is described. The results of the use of statistical models of image texture and physical parameters of clouds for initializing membership functions for a neural-fuzzy classifier are presented. Systems of effective classification characteristics for different classification algorithms are formed based on the GRAD modified truncated search method. The recognition results of single-layer, vertical development clouds, and multilayer clouds based on the corresponding test samples and full-size sets of MODIS satellite data with different spatial resolution are discussed.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote Sensing of Operational Platform Produced Water Releases
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill detection services based on satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) frequently detect oil slicks close to platforms due to legal releases of produced water. Separating these slicks from larger releases, e.g., due to accidental leakage is challenging. The aim of this work is to investigate the SAR characteristics of produced water, including the typical appearance in HH/VV data, possible variations with oil volume, and limitations on detectability. The study is based on dual-polarization TerraSAR-X data collected with constant imaging geometry over one platform in the North Sea. Despite the low oil content (volume percentage of 0.001%-0.002% in this data set), produced water is clearly detectable, with median damping ratios around 3-9 dB. Produced water is detected here in wind speeds of 2-12 m/s, with reduced detectability above ca 9 m/s. Hourly average release volumes with an oil component as low as 0.003 m(3) are detected. The damping ratio, polarization difference, and co-polarization power ratio are investigated and show no clear correlation with released oil volume. However, some indications of trends such as increasing signal damping with oil volume should be further investigated when data over larger release volumes are available. When comparing the properties of the entire slick with the most recently released part, similar or slightly higher damping ratios were found in the full slick case.

AB  - This article provides a constructive reading of Barth's interpretation of Romans 2 in the Romerbrief in conversation with his treatment of the sinful human attempt to construct a worldview in opposition to the saving activity of Jesus in Church Dogmatics IV/3. I argue that dialectical theology provides Western Christianity with a hermeneutical approach against whiteness grounded in a Reformational theology of justification by faith alone. In this way, dialectical theology is a resource for constructing Christian identity free of whiteness as well as for carving out new space for a decolonial option within Christian theology.

TI  - Comparative characteristics of the images of Russia and Belarus in the winds of students of both countries
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of an ethnopsychological study of the perception of their national characteristics by Belarusian and Russian students and the formation in their minds of the image of both countries. The modern relations of the two Slavic countries of Russia and the Republic of Belarus are at a new stage of development, which consists in creating a single union state. The level of mutual understanding between the two independent states largely depends on how young generations adequately represent each other's national character, value priorities and worldview positions of their peers living in a neighboring country. The problems of establishing mutual understanding of young people are complicated by the fact that both countries are the heirs to a unified Soviet past, but experience certain difficulties in the process of its modernization. On the other hand, representatives of the "z" generation, born at the turn of the millennium, form their own values and development guidelines, which also affects the search for mutual understanding between the two countries.

TI  - An Assessment of the Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Soil Salinity in Combination with Field and Satellite Data: A Case Study in Sujawal District
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a serious environmental issue that significantly influences crop yield and soil fertility, especially in coastal areas. Numerous studies have been conducted on the salinity status in Pakistan. Information about the geospatial and temporal distribution of salinity in the Sujawal district is still lacking. The present study examines the soil salinity status and the impact of seawater intrusion in the entire district from 1990 to 2017 using field and remote sensing (RS) data. In addition, 210 soil samples at different depths (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) were collected from randomly selected locations for lab measurements of physiochemical properties. The results showed that the soil texture classes were mainly fine to medium particles. The samples collected at the 0-20 cm depth were mostly dominated by three textural classes of soil: clay at 19.5%, clay loam at 25.6%, and loam at 32.9%. The electrical conductivity (EC) of 65.7% soil samples collected from the top layer exceeded the normal range. The quantitative results indicated that the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) ranged between 1.38 and 64.58, and 72.2% of the top layer soil samples had ESP >15, while 81.5% of soil samples were in the normal range of soil pH. Furthermore, the results indicated that the vegetation decreased by 8.6% from 1990 to 2017, while barren land and water bodies increased significantly, by approximately 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively. The extreme and high salinity classes were characterized by high contents of soluble salt on the surface in the Jati and Shah Bandar subdistricts. In addition, the soil EC values at the 0-20 cm depth were significantly correlated with the salinity index (S1). Therefore, it was concluded that more than 50% of the top layer of soil was affected by salinity due to seawater intrusion, low rainfall, climate change, and erratic river flow. It is suggested that remote sensing (RS) data are more suitable for the detection of the soil salinity status of a region and impose a lower cost compared to other conventional approaches. However, this study could provide significant knowledge to land managers, policymakers, and government officials to allow them to take action to implement salinity control measures in the study area.

AB  - Results of research of the identification of flooding as a result of groundwater table fluctuations on the example of the valley of the River Vistula, with the use of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images from the years 2017-2018 are presented. An analysis of indexes of water use, calculated on the basis of green, red and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, for extraction of water objects and flooded areas was carried out. Based on the analyses conducted, a mapping method was developed, using three water indexes (MNDWI Modified Normalised Difference Water Index, NDTI Normalised Difference Index and NDPI Normalised Difference Pond Index). Results show that the 10 metre false colour composite R(NDTI)G(NDPI)B(MNDWI) obtained significantly improved submerged extractions more than did individual water indexes. Moreover, the 10-m-images of MNDWI and NDPI, obtained by the sharpening High Pass Filter (HPF), may represent more detailed spatial information on floods than the 20-m-MNDWI and NDPI, obtained from original images.

TI  - Practice Patterns and Prognostic Value of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Thick Melanoma: A National Cancer Database Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been somewhat controversial for patients with a diagnosis of thick (> 4 mm) melanoma. This study aimed to characterize the national practice pattern in performing SLNB for this patient population and to determine the predictors and prognostic value of nodal positivity using population-level data.Methods. Patients with a diagnosis of clinically nodenegative, thick melanoma (2010-2015) were identified using the National Cancer Database. Factors associated with performing regional nodal evaluation were characterized. Predictors of nodal positivity were determined using multivariable logistic regression. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using standard statistical methods.Results. Of 9847 study patients, 7513 (76.3%) underwent SLNB. The patients who underwent nodal evaluation were younger (median age, 66 vs 81 years; P < 0.001), less likely to have comorbid conditions (19.6% vs 26.0%; P < 0.001), more often privately insured (40.4% vs 16.4%; P < 0.001), and more frequently treated at an academic center (49.5% vs 43.9%; P < 0.001). Among those who underwent nodal evaluation, 25.5% had metastatic nodes. Multivariable regression identified age, Charlson-Deyo score, primary location, ulceration, mitoses, vertical growth phase, and lymphovascular invasion as independent predictors of nodal positivity, but with only moderate predictive accuracy (optimism-adjusted area under the curve, 0.684). Furthermore, compared with node negativity, node positivity was significantly associated with decreased OS (hazard ratio, 2.05; P < 0.001).Conclusion. Although nodal status provides important prognostic information, at a national level, nearly one fourth of patients with clinically node-negative, thick melanoma do not undergo SLNB. Appropriate pathologic staging would allow these high-risk patients to be candidates for effective adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Comparison of Lake Optical Water Types Derived from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters play a critical role in our drinking water supply. Additionally, they are important providers of food and recreation possibilities. Inland waters are known to be optically complex and more diverse than marine or ocean waters. The optical properties of natural waters are influenced by three different and independent sources: phytoplankton, suspended matter, and colored dissolved organic matter. Thus, the remote sensing of these waters is more challenging. Different types of waters need different approaches to obtain correct water quality products; therefore, the first step in remote sensing of lakes should be the classification of the water types. The classification of optical water types (OWTs) is based on the differences in the reflectance spectra of the lake water. This classification groups lake and coastal waters into five optical classes: Clear, Moderate, Turbid, Very Turbid, and Brown. We studied the OWTs in three different Latvian lakes: Burtnieks, Lubans, and Razna, and in a large Estonian lake, Lake Vortsjarv. The primary goal of this study was a comparison of two different Copernicus optical instrument data for optical classification in lakes: Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 and Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2. We found that both satellite OWT classifications in lakes were comparable (R-2 = 0.74). We were also able to study the spatial and temporal changes in the OWTs of the study lakes during 2017. The comparison between two satellites was carried out to understand if the classification of the OWTs with both satellites is compatible. Our results could give us not only a better overview of the changes in the lake water by studying the temporal and spatial variability of the OWTs, but also possibly better retrieval of Level 2 satellite products when using OWT guided approach.

T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer of young women has medico-psychological issues, particularly in the perspective of "after cancer" period. The objective of the study was to analyze the changes in management, in a decade including the publication of Cancer Plans I and II.Methods: This retrospective unicentric study involved two populations of women aged 40 and treated at the "Institut de cancerologie de Lorraine" in 2002-2004 (P1) and 2012-2014 (P2). Epidemiological-demographic, histological, diagnostic and therapeutic sequences were analyzed.Results: 216 patients were included. The mean age was 35.7 years (range 22-40), with no significant epidemiological difference, except for an increased rate of obesity in P2. Preoperative biopsies became almost systematic and the pre-therapeutic are plan rate increased over the decade from 3.8% to 8% (p < 0.001). The rate of breast-conserving treatment remained stable. The sentinel lymph node rate increased from 4.4% in P1 to 31.9% in P2 (p < 0.001), while the rate of lymph node dissection decreased (p < 0.001) between the two periods. Resort to breast nurses, psycho-oncologists, fertility experts and oncogenetic consultations has also increased.Conclusion: There is an improvement in the care and management of young women under 40 because of the first Cancer Plans. A study about the impact on the prognosis and a reflection to improve the experience of illness for these women are to lead.

AB  - The past 5 years have witnessed the results of many practice-changing studies that have dramatically improved the landscape of adjuvant therapy in patients with resected, high-risk melanoma. After a 20-year era of adjuvant interferon, the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and MAPK-directed targeted therapy brought a revolution into the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. These results came along with the practice-changing results of two large multicenter studies showing no benefit in terms of overall survival for completion lymph node dissection after positive sentinel node biopsy.In this review, we summarized the current state of the art of the adjuvant treatment of high-risk melanoma, with a view on future perspectives.

TI  - Testing Luminescence Dating Methods for Small Samples from Very Young Fluvial Deposits
T2  - METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impetus behind this study is to understand the sedimentological dynamics of very young fluvial systems in the Amazon River catchment and relate these to land use change and modern analogue studies of tidal rhythmites in the geologic record. Initial quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating feasibility studies have concentrated on spit and bar deposits in the Rio Tapajos. Many of these features have an appearance of freshly deposited pristine sand, and these observations and information from anecdotal evidence and LandSat imagery suggest an apparent decadal stability. The characteristics of OSL from small (similar to 5 cm) sub-samples from similar to 65 cm by similar to 2 cm diameter vertical cores are quite remarkable. Signals from medium-sized aliquots (5 mm diameter) exhibit very high specific luminescence sensitivity, have excellent dose recovery and recycling, essentially independent of preheat, and show minimal heat transfer even at the highest preheats. These characteristics enable measurement of very small signals with reasonable precision and, using modified single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) approaches, equivalent doses as low as similar to 4 mGy can be obtained. Significant recuperation is observed for samples from two of the study sites and, in these instances, either the acceptance threshold was increased or growth curves were forced through the origin; recuperation is considered most likely to be a measurement artefact given the very small size of natural signals. Dose rates calculated from combined inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry/inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-MS/ICP-OES) and high-resolution gamma spectrometry range from similar to 0.3 to 0.5 mGya(-1), and OSL ages for features so far investigated range from 13 to 34 years to several 100 years. Sampled sands are rich in quartz and yields of 212-250 mu m or 250-310 mu m grains indicate high-resolution sampling at 1-2 cm intervals is possible. Despite the use of medium-sized aliquots to ensure the recovery of very dim natural OSL signals, these results demonstrate the potential of OSL for studying very young active fluvial processes in these settings.

TI  - An Observational Cohort Study Investigating Risk of Malnutrition Using the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool in Patients with Stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malnutrition in patients hospitalized with a stroke have been assessed using different nutritional screening methods but there is a paucity of data linking risk of malnutrition to clinical outcomes using a validated tool. Aims: To identify the prevalence of malnutrition risk in patients after a stroke and assess the predictive value of the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) on clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods: Using data from electronic records and the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (January 2013 and March 2016), patients aged more than 18 years with confirmed stroke admitted to a tertiary care stroke unit were assessed for risk of malnutrition. The association between malnutrition risk and clinical outcomes was investigated and adjusted for confounding variables. Results: Of 1101 patients, 66% were screened at admission. Most patients (n = 571, 78.5%) were identified as being at low risk, 4.1% (n = 30) at medium risk, and 17.4% (n = 126) at high risk of malnutrition. Compared with low risk, patients with medium or high risk of malnutrition were more likely to have a longer hospital stay (IRR 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.58), and had greater risk of mortality (10.9% versus 3.5%, 95% CI .03, .13). Conclusions: Prevalence of malnutrition assessed by MUST in patients after a stroke was relatively low, but nearly a third of patients were not screened. Patients classified as being at medium or high risk of malnutrition were more likely to experience negative outcomes. Early identification of this population may improve outcome if appropriate care is provided.

TI  - Long-Tailed Macaque Response to Deforestation in a <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>-Endemic Area
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes can impact infectious disease transmission by increasing spatial overlap between people and wildlife disease reservoirs. In Malaysian Borneo, increases in human infections by the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi are hypothesised to be due to increasing contact between people and macaques due to deforestation. To explore how macaque responses to environmental change impact disease risks, we analysed movement of a GPS-collared long-tailed macaque in a knowlesi-endemic area in Sabah, Malaysia, during a deforestation event. Land-cover maps were derived from satellite-based and aerial remote sensing data and models of macaque occurrence were developed to evaluate how macaque habitat use was influenced by land-use change. During deforestation, changes were observed in macaque troop home range size, movement speeds and use of different habitat types. Results of models were consistent with the hypothesis that macaque ranging behaviour is disturbed by deforestation events but begins to equilibrate after seeking and occupying a new habitat, potentially impacting human disease risks. Further research is required to explore how these changes in macaque movement affect knowlesi epidemiology on a wider spatial scale.

TI  - Midterm Fire Danger Prediction Using Satellite Imagery and Auxiliary Thematic Layers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires constitute a significant environmental pressure in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean countries. The prediction of fire danger is essential for sustainable forest fire management since it provides critical information for designing effective prevention measures and for facilitating response planning to potential fire events. This study presents a new midterm fire danger index (MFDI) using satellite and auxiliary geographic data. The proposed methodology is based on estimations of a dry fuel connectivity measure calculated from the Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) time-series data, which are combined with biophysical and topological variables to obtain accurate fire ignition danger predictions for the following eight days. The index's accuracy was assessed using historical fire data from four large wildfires in Greece. The results showcase that the index predicted high fire danger (>= 3 on a scale within [1,4]) within the identified fire ignition areas, proving its strong potential for deriving reliable estimations of fire danger, despite the fact that no meteorological measurements or forecasts are used for its calculation.

TI  - Why Does Bergson Understand Religion From the Perspective of Mysticism?
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL FOR RELIGION AND TRANSFORMATION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In his book Bergson makes first of all the distinction between closed societies, with a static religion, and open societies with the dynamic religion. In fact those dynamic religions are the world religions, and they are understood from the perspective of mysticism. Bergson does not accept the opposition between a mystical and a technical worldview. To the contrary, they are related to each other, especially in Christianity, by the virtue of charity. Charity, and therefore technics, is the practical dimension of mysticism. From the perspective of the mystical experience, an intuition of unity with the totality, Bergson tries to rethink the proof of the existence of God, the immortality of man and the theodicy. Modern man, as a technical man represents a special phase in the history of the evolution of nature and its divine 'elan vital'. It is a phenomenon in which nature shows a new dimension of itself. Because the technical dimension enlarges man's capacity of transcendence of the sense of given reality, it creates new possibilities for mystical experience. Modern man needs this mysticism because only mysticism can be the soul within the body of the technical world created by man.

TI  - Optimal Assimilation of Daytime SST Retrievals from SEVIRI in a Regional Ocean Prediction System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploiting the potential of space-borne oceanic measurements to characterize the sub-surface structure of the ocean becomes critical in areas where deployment of in situ sensors might be difficult or expensive. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) observations potentially provide enormous amounts of information about the upper ocean variability. However, the assimilation of daytime SST retrievals, e.g., from infrared sensors into ocean prediction systems, requires a specific treatment of the diurnal cycle of skin SST, which is generally under-estimated in current ocean models due to poor vertical resolution at the air-sea interface and lack of proper parameterizations. To this end, a simple off-line bias correction scheme is proposed, where the bias predictors include, among others, the warm layer and cool skin warming/cooling deduced from a prognostic model. Furthermore, a localization procedure that limits the vertical penetration of the SST information in a hybrid variational-ensemble data assimilation system is formulated. These two novelties are implemented and assessed within a regional ocean prediction system in the Ligurian Sea for the assimilation of daytime SST data retrieved with hourly frequency from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the geostationary satellite Meteosat-10. Experiments are validated against independent measurements collected by gliders, moorings, and drifters during the Long-term Glider Missions for Environmental Characterization (LOGCMEC17) sea trial. Results suggest that the simple bias correction scheme is effective in improving both the sea surface and mixed layer accuracy, correctly thinning the mixed layer compared to the control experiment, outperforming experiments with night-only data assimilation, and improving the forecast skill scores. Localization further improves the prediction of the mixed layer depth. It is therefore recommended that sophisticated bias correction and localization procedures are adopted for fruitfully assimilating daytime SST data in operational oceanographic analysis systems.

TI  - Associations of wildfire smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure with cardiorespiratory events in Colorado 2011-2014
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Substantial increases in wildfire activity have been recorded in recent decades. Wildfires influence the chemical composition and concentration of particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). However, relatively few epidemiologic studies focus on the health impacts of wildfire smoke PM2.5 compared with the number of studies focusing on total PM2.5 exposure.Objectives: We estimated the associations between cardiorespiratory acute events and exposure to smoke PM2.5 in Colorado using a novel exposure model to separate smoke PM2.5 from background ambient PM2.5 levels. Methods: We obtained emergency department visits and hospitalizations for acute cardiorespiratory outcomes from Colorado for May-August 2011-2014, geocoded to a 4 km geographic grid. Combining ground measurements, chemical transport models, and remote sensing data, we estimated smoke PM2.5 and non-smoke PM2.5 on a 1 km spatial grid and aggregated to match the resolution of the health data. Time-stratified, case-crossover models were fit using conditional logistic regression to estimate associations between fire smoke PM2.5 and non-smoke PM2.5 for overall and age-stratified outcomes using 2-day averaging windows for cardiovascular disease and 3-day windows for respiratory disease.Results: Per 1 mu g/m(3) increase in fire smoke PM2.5, statistically significant associations were observed for asthma (OR = 1.081 (1.058, 1.105)) and combined respiratory disease (OR= 1.021 (1.012, 1.031)). No significant relationships were evident for cardiovascular diseases and smoke PM2.5. Associations with non-smoke PM2.5 were null for all outcomes. Positive age-specific associations related to smoke PM2.5 were observed for asthma and combined respiratory disease in children, and for asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and combined respiratory disease in adults. No significant associations were found in older adults.Discussion: This is the first multi-year, high-resolution epidemiologic study to incorporate statistical and chemical transport modeling methods to estimate PM2.5 exposure due to wildfires. Our results allow for a more precise assessment of the population health impact of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure in a changing climate.

AB  - Rice cultivation has been recognized as one of the major anthropogenic source for CH 4 emissions. A rule-based classification approach and parameter selection approach is available for rice mapping in which the rules and parameters are derived from agronomic knowledge of the rice crop and its management. SAR-based operational mapping of rice crop across a diverse range of environments is possible with the increasing availability multi-temporal Sentinel 1A satellite data at VV polarisation with 20m spatial resolution was acquired and processed using MAP scape-RICE software. Precise estimation of methane emission from rice fields at regional scale depends on accurate assessment of rice area and MODIS derived LST T factors were used for spatial estimation of methane emission from Tiruchirapalli district and compared with field level estimates. The total rice area in Tiruchirapalli district was 36127 hectare during rabi season 2015-16. The rate of LST based methane emission ranged from 35.36 to 48.17 kg/ha in Tiruchirapalli district. The total methane emission from Tiruchirapalli district based on LST based T factor was 1.5706Gg during the season. MODIS derived LST T factor along with SAR based rice area can be used as a tool for precise and near real time assessment of methane emission at regional or country level.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Heat Islands Effect and Land Surface Temperature of Noida, India by Using Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanisation is a process of change in land use by construction activities. Therefore, during construction, uses of low albedo materials give rise in heat absorption capacity that becomes the primary cause of alteration of local climate. Additionally, alteration of land use, viz. conversion of vegetation/forested land into urban built-up land and establishment of heavy industrial units contributes pertinently in local heat budget which leads to the formation of urban heat islands (UHIs). Therefore, the adverse impact of UHIs affected not only ecology and local climate but also socioeconomic setups. In the present work, spatial distribution of UHIs and their causal relationship with land use over NOIDA (New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) city has reported. The data pertaining to study was collected from Landsat-8 OLI-TIRS (operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor) sensor. The results show that two clusters were developed in north and mid-east part of the city due to concentration of high-density building and industrial units. It is recommended that development authority should take environmental concern into consideration before planning industrial land use.

TI  - EXPRESSION OF CULTURE THROUGH PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS (ON THE EXAMPLE OF BASHKIR LANGUAGE)
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phraseologisms in their semantics reflect the process of historical development of the people. They manifest cultural traditions and customs that have been transmitted from generation to generation for centuries. The phraseology of the Bashkir language is studied mainly in the semantic aspect. Systematization was carried out according to the semantic content and grammatical structure of phraseological units. The study of phraseological units using cultural codes is carried out for the first time. The study of phraseological units in the cultural-linguistic aspect, makes it possible to more deeply study the life, culture and worldview of the Bashkir people. The figurative basis of most phraseological units is associated with ancient beliefs. The relevance of the above problems outlined the purpose of this article the implementation of the linguoculturological description of phraseological units through cultural codes, recorded and embodied in phraseological units. The codes of culture correspond with archetypal representations, since it is precisely in them that the "naive" representations of the universe are fixed. We have identified the following main cultural codes: somatic, biomorphic, subject, mythological. A significant role in the formation of phraseological units of the Bashkir language, as it turned out, was played by somatisms of bash 'head', 'Kul 'hand', yernk 'heart', ky) 'eye', wolaic 'ears', ayah / bot 'leg', bodies 'language', beat / yo) 'face', kendek 'navel', wan 'blood', yon / kyfiel / lc from 'soul', beat 'lower back'. The mythological code of culture allowed us to identify phraseological units with the components of the `seven', alip / alap / alp 'hero', 'hero', 'giant', ay 'month, moon', icoyash / ken 'sun', kyk `heaven'. The biomorphic code of culture explains the origin of phraseological units with the components of at nomajb horse ', dilbeg o reins, tarty ogloblya, dyye camel, et co6axa dog', demon, cat ', aryclan neu lion', etc. The cultural subject code allowed detect reflection in Bashkir phraseological units of such Bashkir household items as Utyn 'firewood', byrono 'log', komo 'boat', yx 'arrow', Balta 'ax', tyrmon 'mill', mustache 'fire, bonfire, hearth', NOM 'sand', 'Kigali 'cauldron, cauldron', flak 'sieve', ena 'needle', kyldak 'dress', kyn' souk of 'Sabat' sandals', and others.The practical significance of the work lies in the fact that the materials analyzed in this work can be used for in-depth study of phraseological units in the Turkic, including the Bashkir language.

TI  - Impact of urbanisation on urban heat island intensity during summer and winter over Indian metropolitan cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial and economic development along with the rapid growth in urban population over the global cities is generating a warmer inner core in comparison to the surrounding natural landscape, the common feature of the phenomena of urban heat island (UHI). In the earlier part of the study, the spatial relationship of the changes in the land cover types and land surface temperature (LST) is analysed for metropolitan cities of India during winter season using remote sensing techniques. In the present study, an attempt has been made to estimate the UHI intensities over the metropolitan cities of India during summer season. The LST estimated using the Landsat 7 ETM+ images reveals the presence of a unique form of surface UHIs in the dense built-up areas of different cities. The intensities of UHIs over these cities during summer season are noticed to be in the range of 10.5-14 degrees C. Delhi possesses the highest UHI intensity in the range of 13.4-14.0 degrees C, and Kolkata possessed the lowest UHI intensity in the range of 10.5-11.7 degrees C. Higher-temperature zones (hotspots) are noticed to be increasing within the builtup areas and barren lands. The temperature of hotspots for the northern cities Delhi and Jaipur is observed to be in the range of 45-50 degrees C and is highest among the cities under consideration. On comparison with the winter results, the LST ranges, UHI intensities and the hotspot ranges for summer season are found be noticeably higher. The LST distribution and the UHI pattern of these cities are found to different during summer season in comparison to the winter season.

TI  - Identification and assessment of the factors driving vegetation degradation/regeneration in drylands using synthetic high spatiotemporal remote sensing Data-A case study in Zhenglanqi, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation degradation is a direct distinguishing feature of land degradation in drylands and seriously affects the ecological balance and sustainable development of drylands. Existing assessment methods of vegetation degradation at the regional scale based on long-time-series data have many shortcomings, including coarse resolution and a diversity of vegetation indicators that are typically complex. In the present study, net primary productivity (NPP) was selected as a primary vegetation indicator. Taking Zhenglanqi in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the study area, a technical process for the assessment of vegetation degradation/regeneration and analysis of the associated driving forces was proposed at a medium-high resolution scale. First, integrating the high spatial resolution advantage of Landsat data and the high temporal resolution advantage of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, a time series annual NPP dataset from 2001 to 2016 at 30 m resolution was constructed by applying the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Then, the areas of vegetation degradation and regeneration from 2001 to 2016 were identified and determined by annual NPP trend analysis using the Sen + Mann-Kendall method. Overall, vegetation in Zhenglanqi was generally characterized by regeneration, with the degraded and recovered areas being 0.8% and 11.4%, respectively. Nearly 20% of the areas covered by sandy land showed a significant trend of vegetation regeneration, which indicated that the sand-drifting control measures introduced in the Otindag sandy land and its surroundings had achieved significant results. Next, the driving forces of vegetation degradation and regeneration in Zhenglanqi were distinguished over the past 16 years through proposed multiple and partial regression methods. Human activities were the main driver of vegetation degradation and regeneration (68.6% for degradation, 59.9% for regeneration), and the combination of human activities and climate variation also played an important role in vegetation degradation and regeneration (29.3% for degradation, 39.4% for regeneration), which indicated that the significant improvement of vegetation was related to the implemented eco-restoration projects, and visually proved by comparison of high resolution satellite images taking in different years. This research is expected to provide technical support and scientific reference data for ecological protection and land management in the study area, as well as the development of ecological engineering strategies in the drylands of northern China.

TI  - A Two-Stage Spatiotemporal Fusion Method for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a two-stage spatiotemporal fusion method for obtaining dense remote sensing images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. Considering the large resolution differences between fine- and coarse-resolution images, the proposed method is implemented in two stages. In the first stage, the input fine- and coarse-resolution images are preprocessed to the same intermediate resolution images, respectively. Then, a linear interpolation model is introduced to fuse these resampled images for predicting preliminary fusion results. In the second stage, a residual dense network is used to learn the nonlinear mapping between the preliminary fusion results and the real fine-resolution data to reconstruct the final fine-resolution data. Two data sets with different land surface types are employed to test the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is advantageous in such areas with phenological changes, and even for the data sets with land cover changes being the main type, it still has a good ability to predict spatial structure information of images.

TI  - Spectral vegetation indices of wetland greenness: Responses to vegetation structure, composition, and spatial distribution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land conversion and fragmentation threaten the resilience and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems which makes the future of their services to humans uncertain. Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM +. We tested two annually aggregated metrics maximum and median greenness- for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil. This study represents a first-time effort to study relationships between the on-site properties of wetlands and their spectral characteristics at a national scale.

TI  - On the Adequacy of Representing Water Reflectance by Semi-Analytical Models in Ocean Color Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterministic or statistical inversion schemes to retrieve ocean color from space often use a simplified water reflectance model that may introduce unrealistic constraints on the solution, a disadvantage compared with standard, two-step algorithms that make minimal assumptions about the water signal. In view of this, the semi-analytical models of Morel and Maritorena (2001), MM01, and Park and Ruddick (2005), PR05, used in the spectral matching POLYMER algorithm (Steinmetz et al., 2011), are examined in terms of their ability to restitute properly, i.e., with sufficient accuracy, water reflectance. The approach is to infer water reflectance at MODIS wavelengths, as in POLYMER, from theoretical simulations (using Hydrolight with fluorescence and Raman scattering) and, separately, from measurements (AERONET-OC network). A wide range of Case 1 and Case 2 waters, except extremely turbid waters, are included in the simulations and sampled in the measurements. The reflectance model parameters that give the best fit with the simulated data or the measurements are determined. The accuracy of the reconstructed water reflectance and its effect on the retrieval of inherent optical properties (IOPs) is quantified. The impact of cloud and aerosol transmittance, fixed to unity in the POLYMER scheme, on model performance is also evaluated. Agreement is generally good between model results and Hydrolight simulations or AERONET-OC values, even in optically complex waters, with discrepancies much smaller than typical atmospheric correction errors. Significant differences exist in some cases, but having a more intricate model (i.e., using more parameters) makes convergence more difficult. The trade-off is between efficiency/robustness and accuracy. Notable errors are obtained when using the model estimates to retrieve IOPs. Importantly, the model parameters that best fit the input data, in particular chlorophyll-a concentration, do not represent adequately actual values. The reconstructed water reflectance should be used in bio-optical algorithms. While neglecting cloud and aerosol transmittances degrades the accuracy of the reconstructed water reflectance and the retrieved IOPs, it negligibly affects water reflectance ratios and, therefore, any variable derived from such ratios.

TI  - Surface water connectivity of seasonal isolated lakes in a dynamic lake-floodplain system
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic of surface water connectivity along floodplains can be complex, and is of great significance to such ecological functions as flood protection, sediment transportation, nutrient retention, and the provision of wildlife habitats. However, connectivity quantification is currently incipient due to the scarcity of high spatial-temporal resolution observations and suitable connectivity metrics. This study generated a 30-m and 8-day surface water series of the Poyang Lake National Natural Reserve (PLNNR) in China by fusing Landsat and MODIS imagery. A geostatistical analysis was applied to quantify the surface water connectivity based on wet/dry binary state data derived from the fused images. The results demonstrate that the geostatistical method based on remote sensing is reliable and objective for quantifying the surface water connectivity in a complex lake-floodplain system. The highest connectivity function occurred around the flood peak, and lasted longest in the typical flood year. The seasonal isolated lakes, rivers, and main lake were interconnected via channelized and overbank flow paths at different stage thresholds. Under the combined effect of flood pulse and surface water connectivity, a seasonal isolated lake expanded more quickly after connection than before during the rising period, and shrank more slowly after isolation than before during the receding period. This study provides a novel insight into quantifying surface water connectivity, which helps policymakers understand floodplain behavior, both for this particular event and in general.

TI  - Vegetation Changes in T H e Poyang Lake Wetland Linked to the Three Gorges Dam: an Assessment Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Observations from 2000 to 2012
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation changes in the Poyang Lake wetland related to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and climate change have received increasing attention in recent decades. However, due to the high spatial heterogeneity, the changes in wetland vegetation have not been well quantified at a large spatial scale. We addressed this challenge by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2012. Using a Mann-Kendall (MK) test, statistically significant decreasing trends were found in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) at the upper edge of the Poyang Lake wetland. In contrast, the vegetation distributed at lower elevations experienced a significant increasing trend during the study period. Downward boundaries of wetland vegetation in response to declining water levels could partially explain the increases in vegetation coverage. Vegetation colonized the non-vegetation area more quickly after the implementation of the TGD due to the earlier recession of the lake level during the recession period. Our findings suggested that hydrological changes caused by the lake decline might be the main factors driving the vegetation area changes. The information provided in this study is critical for future conservation and restoration efforts in the Poyang Lake wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Analysis of land surface temperature trend and climate resilience challenges in Tehran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island is one of the most important consequences of climate change in cities. Various factors accelerate temperature increase in urban surfaces. Widespread use of impermeable materials with high heat capacity; albedo and trapping of incoming solar radiation in urban structure which prevents reflection; reduction in cooling at night due to increased building heights; and changes in the complex urban geometry are among these factors. The aim of this study is to investigate the surface temperature of Tehran in a 30-year period (1984-2014). The required images and land surface temperature maps were prepared using a split-window algorithm on thermal bands of landsat images for four periods. All images had been taken at 11:00-14:00 in summer. Temperature factors were calculated for different neighborhoods, and two patterns were obtained. One pattern showed the formation of urban heat island in barren lands, large workshop areas, and areas with military land use, and the other one showed the formation of urban heat island in dense building population areas with limited green space. The results indicate an increase in the area of the regions with a higher temperature in the city. In 1984, the smallest area belonged to the above 48 degrees C temperature category (1.8 ha), while in 2014 the below 25 degrees C category had the smallest area (0 ha). It was observed that the area of the former category reached over 1740 ha in 2014. Neighborhood temperature factors show that 17 Shahrivar and Khajeh Nasir-Hoghoughi neighborhoods are the hottest neighborhoods in Tehran. The findings in this study may persuade urban managers scientifically to make preparations for changing the life style focusing on urban macro-scale planning which is a widely emerging issue resulted from recent effects on Tehran's climate resilience. Considering the importance of urban planning priorities in urban ecosystem services, it is essential to make use of all urban elements and fill the empty gap between urban ecosystem services production and their consumption in the city by wise and smart urban management.

TI  - Monitoring Changes in Vegetation Cover of Bhitarkanika Marine National Park Region, Odisha, India Using Vegetation Indices of Multidate Satellite Data
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of Odisha extends from Balasore in the north to Ganjam in the south spreading 480 km. It exhibits a depositional terrain formed by the action of fluvio-marine, lacustrine, estuarine and aeolian agents. The river system coupled with marine action help in generating diversified physiographic and dynamic coastal features. Over the period, the coastal tract also witnesses the vagary of nature. Vast alluvial plain, meandering pattern of rivers, low lying swamps and swamp forests, sand dunes, beach ridges, beaches and swales are typical landforms associated with the coastal tract. The Bhitarkanika Marine National Park region, the study area is situated on the northern part of the coast which mostly exhibit swampy habitat due to large fine clastic deposits by riverine action. Mangroves on the swampy region occupy around 18,348 ha and regarded as the second largest mangrove formation in the subcontinent. Besides, the coastal tract also exhibits a congenial place for mass nesting of sea turtles coming from Pacific Ocean. The study area is now under stress due to various natural as well as anthropogenic pressure. The degradation of mangroves is mainly due to human encroachment and reclamation of land for aquaculture practices. It is observed that the occurrence of vegetation cover decreases continuously from 1973 to 2017. Dense vegetation cover is recorded as 35.23 % (1973) which decreased to 22.43 % (2017). On the southern end of the study area lies an all-weather port named Paradeep and on the northern side one emerging new port called Dhamra port. Their activities and impact as well as blooming aquaculture practices have bearing on the ecosystem of the mangroves. The assessment of vegetation vigor of the region portrays the condition of the environment shaped after years of degradation activities due to natural as well as anthropogenic activities induced from 595 villages having 50,6930 population.The objective of the study is to analyze the changes of vegetation vigor using NDVI from multi date satellite data and record the changes for better monitoring of the area. It may be inferred that the existing conservation measures and protection plans are inadequate to hold the coastal natural resources intact. The community participation and public awareness are not sufficient to abate the brittle coastal environment. Public participation, education programme, awareness initiatives are the foundation of success of any sustainable development in the sensitive coastal region.

TI  - Coastline dynamics of the northern Lower Casamance (Senegal) and southern Gambia littoral from 1968 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Lower Casamance and southern Gambia's beaches, just like those of West Africa, are subject to significant morpho-sedimentary dynamics characterized by coastline mobility. Such mobility, combined with significant variations in different places, is characterized by some globally erosive trend (- 1.2-6 m/year, in sandy areas extending from Senegal to Sierra Leone and -1 to -15 m/year from Ivory Coast to Nigeria). The purpose of this article is to analyze the coastline evolution in Lower Casamance and southern Gambia based on a diachronic survey (1968-2017). The reference line used to demonstrate the variation of the coastline is the vegetation boundary.The results obtained are based on the digital processing of geospatial data (aerial photographs, Landsat and Google Earth images).The different variations of the coastline are obtained through the calculation of two indexes considered as the most relevant ones. The first one, the End Point Rate (EPR) index, helped measure the difference between two successive coastlines and the second one, the Linear Regression Rate (LRR) index, allows assessing the ability to estimate the evolution of each segment over the entire period considered. These mobility indexes (EPR and LRR) show some variable dynamics of the coastline, featured by two trends: the first one, under accretion in the 1968-1986 period and the other one, globally erosive during 1986-2017 period.

TI  - Normalized Projection Models for Geostationary Remote Sensing Satellite: A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis (January 2019)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nominal grid data of geostationary remote sensing satellites are fundamental for generating the subsequent products. It can be obtained by normalized projection models, mainly based on the imaging mode. However, there are only definitions and primary descriptive equations for the normalized geostationary projection (NGP) model in the existing literature, while the corresponding imaging mode and the physical interpretation are missing, thus hindering the understanding of the produced nominal grid dataset as well as the subsequent products based on the grid. This paper first derived the imaging mode for NGP based on the limited literature. In addition, another new imaging mode was introduced and analyzed based on NGP. The corresponding projection model [nonstandard normalized geostationary projection (NNGP)] was proposed, which is entirely consistent with the situation of Americas Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) and Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A). Furthermore, this paper proposed a novel nominal projection model for frame imaging, which is consistent with the imaging mode of Chinas Gaofen-4. Finally, extensive experiments were designed to comparatively analyze the three nominal grids and demonstrate a detailed difference. By providing a theoretical basis for nominal grid selection, this research is highly significant for the efficient near-real-time production and further applications of geostationary images, as well as the conversion between different datasets resulting from different nominal grid data. In addition, our models are sufficiently tested during the on-orbit running of FY-4A, the first satellite of Chinas second-generation three-axis stabilized geostationary meteorological satellite series. The algorithms provide the technical support for the high-precision image navigation and registration and play a significant role in robustly producing the meteorological data with similar quality to those from GOES-R.

TI  - ASTER Cloud Coverage Assessment and Mission Operations Analysis Using Terra/MODIS Cloud Mask Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument cannot detect clouds accurately for snow-covered or nighttime images due to a lack of spectral bands, Terra/MODIS cloud mask (MOD35) products have been alternatively used in cloud assessment for all ASTER images. In this study, we evaluated ASTER cloud mask images generated from MOD35 products and used them to analyze the mission operations of ASTER. In the evaluation, ASTER cloud mask images from different MOD35 versions (Collections 5, 6, and 6.1) showed a large discrepancy in low- or high-latitude areas, and the rate of ASTER scenes with a high uncertain-pixel rate (>= 30%) showed to be 2.2% in daytime and 12.0% in nighttime. In the visual evaluation with ASTER browse images, about 2% of cloud mask images showed some problems such as mislabeling and artifacts. In the mission operations analysis, the cloud avoidance function implemented in the ASTER observation scheduler showed a decrease in the mean cloud coverage (MCC) and an increase in the rate of clear scenes by 10% to 15% in each. Although 19-year-old time-series of MCC in five areas showed weather-related fluctuations such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), they indicated a small percent reduction in MCC by enhancement of the cloud avoidance function in April 2012. The global means of the number of clear ASTER scenes were 15.7 and 6.6 scenes in daytime and nighttime, respectively, and those of the success rate were 33.3% and 40.4% in daytime and nighttime, respectively. These results are expected to contribute not only to the ASTER Project but also to other optical sensor projects.

TI  - Spatial Distribution and Tree Cover of Hillside and Ravine Forests in Uruguay: the Challenges of Mapping Patchy Ecosystems
T2  - AGROCIENCIA URUGUAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping and monitoring of forest ecosystems on a national scale is key to their management and conservation. Native forests in Uruguay are considered given their importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate the spatial distribution of the land cover class `hillside and ravine forest'-a subclass of native forest characterized by patches and transition zones with native grasslands-using Landsat images (30 x 30 m) from 2014 and 2015 and high-resolution images from Google Earth. To evaluate spatial heterogeneity within hillside forests, we then used highresolution SPOT images of 1 km(2) from 1998-2012 to evaluate differences in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) among canopy coverage categories. The hillside and ravine forest class were characterized as a composite cover class with an average canopy coverage of 69 +/- 23%, variability of wich was reflected in NDVI values. The total area of this class in 2015 was estimated as 334,480 ha, somewhat less than an earlier 2008 estimate (384,240 ha). Among the potential errors in delineating hillside forests using Landsat images, there was the classification of "forest" in areas characterized by grassland and a tree canopy cover <25 %. This potential error in delimitation at broader scales led to the overestimation of hillside and ravine forest area in southeastern Uruguay, but an underestimation in northern Uruguay. Our study highlights the large discrepancies in the estimation of the distribution of hillside and ravine forest at different spatial scales, and also indicates the potential of NDVI to evaluate the heterogeneity of this forest within the same cover class.

TI  - Assessing Spatiotemporal Drought Dynamics and Its Related Environmental Issues in the Mekong River Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major natural disaster that creates a negative impact on socio-economic development and environment. Drought indices are typically applied to characterize drought events in a meaningful way. This study aims at examining variations in agricultural drought severity based on the relationship between standardized ratio of actual and potential evapotranspiration (ET and PET), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface temperature (LST) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform. A new drought index, called the enhanced drought severity index (EDSI), was developed by applying spatiotemporal regression methods and time-series biophysical data derived from remote sensing. In addition, time-series trend analysis in the 2001-2018 period, along with the Mann-Kendal (MK) significance test and the Theil Sen (TS) slope, were used to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental parameters (i.e., LST, EVI, ET, and PET), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was subsequently applied in order to analyze the local correlations among them. Results showed that a significant correlation was discovered among LST, EVI, ET, and PET, as well as their standardized ratios (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.8, p < 0.01). Additionally, a high performance of the new developed drought index, showing a strong correlation between EDSI and meteorological drought indices (i.e., standardized precipitation index (SPI) or the reconnaissance drought index (RDI)), measured at meteorological stations, giving r > 0.7 and a statistical significance p < 0.01. Besides, it was found that the temporal tendency of this phenomenon was the increase in intensity of drought, and that coastal areas in the study area were more vulnerable to this phenomenon. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of EDSI and the potential application of integrating spatial regression and time-series data for assessing regional drought conditions.

TI  - Investigating the contribution of climate variables to estimates of net primary productivity in a tropical deciduous forest in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the impact of climate variables on net primary productivity is crucial to evaluate the ecosystem health and the status of forest type response to climate change. The objective of this paper is (1) to estimate spatio-temporal patterns of net primary productivity (NPP) during 2001 to 2010 in a tropical deciduous forest based on the input variable dataset (i.e.meteorological and biophysical) derived from the remote sensing and other sources and (2) to investigate the effects of climate variables on NPP during 2001 to 2010. The study was carried out in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary that forms a part of a tropical forest and is situated in Uttar Pradesh, India, along the Indo-Nepal border. Mean annual NPP was observed to be highest during 2007 with a value of 878 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 781.25 g C m(-2) year(-1) for sal and teak respectively. A decline in mean NPP during 2002-2003, 2005 and 2008-2010 could be attributed to drought, increased temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The time lag correlation analysis revealed precipitation as the major variables affecting NPP, whereas combination of temperature and VPD showed dominant effect on NPP as revealed by generalized linear modelling. The carbon gain in NPP in sal forest was observed to be marginal higher than that of teak plantation throughout the study period. The decrease in NPP was observed during 2010, pertaining to increased VPD. Contribution of different climatic variables through some link process was revealed in statistical analysis and clearly indicated the co-dominance of all the variables in explaining NPP.

TI  - Comparison of Hydrographic Survey and Satellite Bathymetry in Monitoring Kerkini Reservoir Storage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates two mapping methods for Kerkini reservoir bottom, in order to study the morphology and the evolution of deposits at the reservoir. The methods are the hydrographic and the satellite bathymetry. The hydrographic method incorporates the geodetic satellite technology with sonar system for mapping the bottom relief, while the satellite bathymetry extracts the depths using the information from the spectral bands of a satellite image. The satellite Worldview-2 was used in this study. The milestones for the Kerkini reservoir were the years 1952 and 1982, where the construction of the west dike changed the hydrological regime. After these changes, bottom surveys of the reservoir were carried out in 1962 and 1984 and charts were produced. Based on these diagrams, deposition rates are calculated and volumes are compared over the years till the recent mapping in 2014. The digital bathymetry models, obtained from the implementation of hydrography and satellite bathymetry, are compared to each other. Furthermore, the development of new methods for the determination of volume and deposition rate can contribute to the optimal management of such water systems and the creation of a sustainability index for the reservoir.

TI  - The Influence of Rainfall and Land Use/Land Cover Changes on River Discharge Variability in the Mountainous Catchment of the Bagmati River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in rainfall and land use/land cover (LULC) can influence river discharge from a catchment in many ways. Homogenized river discharge data from three stations and average rainfall records, interpolated from 13 stations, were examined for long-term trends and decadal variations (1970-2017) in the headwater, upper and middle catchments of the Bagmati River. LULC changes over five decades were quantified using multitemporal Landsat images. Mann-Kendall tests on annual time series showed a significant decrease in river discharge (0.61% per year) from the entire Bagmati catchment, although the decrease in rainfall was statistically insignificant. However, declines in river discharge and rainfall were both significant in upper catchment. Decadal departures from long-term means support these trend results. Over tenfold growth in urban area and a decrease in agricultural land were observed in the upper catchment, while forest cover slightly increased in the entire catchment between 1975 and 2015. Correlation analysis showed a strong association between surface runoff, estimated using the curve number method, observed river discharge and rainfall in the upper catchment, while the relationship was weaker in the headwater catchment. These results were also supported by multiple regression analysis, suggesting that human activities together with climate change have contributed to river discharge changes in the Bagmati catchment.

T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A sequence of very bright noctilucent clouds (NLC) was observed in central Russia during the last decade of June 2018. It followed the meteorite impact 300 km southwards from Moscow in the morning of June, 21. Polarization measurements of NLC in a wide range of scattering angles allowed finding the mean size of ice particles forming the clouds, that appeared to be about 70 nm, twice a normal value. Analysis of satellite data on gravity waves, temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio during these days shows that large size of particles can be the result of mesopause cooling and shifting down to 80-82 km. Large size of particles is sufficient explanation of unusual brightness of clouds and thus does not imply the additional amount of meteoric dust.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of systematic (2003-2017) measurements of the total content and height-averaged relative volume concentration of CO at st. Novolazarevskaya with a spectrometer with a resolution of 0.2 cm(-1) are presented. The inverse problem of determining the total content of CO as well as interfering gases (H2O and N2O) was solved using the SFIT4 software package. A data analysis indicated that during the measurements the average total CO content at st. Novolazarevskaya was (8 +/- 2) 10(17) molecules/cm(2) and the height-averaged volume concentration was (37 +/- 8) ppb. The resulting data were compared with variations in the total CO content at st. Arrival-Heights, MOPITT satellite data, and CO surface concentrations at st. Syowa. The maximum and minimum values of CO were observed in September and January-February, respectively. For all the data series considered, the trends are insignificant; in this case, an increased CO content was observed in 2010, and an increasing trend of the minimum values of CO was observed in recent years (2014-2017). Both stations (Novolazarevskaya and Arrival-Heights) are characterized by an excess of satellite data over ground-based measurement data (19% and 14%, respectively); here, a seasonal dependence of the deviation was observed with minimal deviations in December-January. Data of surface measurements of the total content at st. Novolazarevskaya and Arrival-Heights are rather well consistent, and the average deviation since 2010 was 2.4%. The average concentration of CO at st. Syowa (51 ppb) is higher than the height-averaged concentration at st. Novolazarevskaya. According to spectral, wavelet, and composite analyzes, all data series considered include oscillations in the range of 6-45 months with almost identical periods and phase relationships.

TI  - Structural weakening of the colonic mucus barrier is an early event in ulcerative colitis pathogenesis
T2  - GUT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The colonic inner mucus layer protects us from pathogens and commensal-induced inflammation, and has been shown to be defective in active UC. The aim of this study was to determine the underlying compositional alterations, their molecular background and potential contribution to UC pathogenesis.Design In this single-centre case-control study, sigmoid colon biopsies were obtained from patients with UC with ongoing inflammation (n=36) or in remission (n=28), and from 47 patients without colonic disease. Mucus samples were collected from biopsies ex vivo, and their protein composition analysed by nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mucus penetrability and goblet cell responses to microbial stimulus were assessed in a subset of patients.Results The core mucus proteome was found to consist of a small set of 29 secreted/transmembrane proteins. In active UC, major structural mucus components including the mucin MUC2 (p<0.0001) were reduced, also in non-inflamed segments. Active UC was associated with decreased numbers of sentinel goblet cells and attenuation of the goblet cell secretory response to microbial challenge. Abnormal penetrability of the inner mucus layer was observed in a subset of patients with UC (12/40; 30%). Proteomic alterations in penetrable mucus samples included a reduction of the SLC26A3 apical membrane anion exchanger, which supplies bicarbonate required for colonic mucin barrier formation.Conclusion Core mucus structural components were reduced in active UC. These alterations were associated with attenuation of the goblet cell secretory response to microbial challenge, but occurred independent of local inflammation. Thus, mucus abnormalities are likely to contribute to UC pathogenesis.

TI  - Analyzing the Effects of Temporal Resolution and Classification Confidence for Modeling Land Cover Change with Long Short-Term Memory Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change (LCC) is typically characterized by infrequent changes over space and time. Data-driven methods such as deep learning (DL) approaches have proven effective in many domains for predictive and classification tasks. When applied to geospatial data, sequential DL methods such as long short-term memory (LSTM) have yielded promising results in remote sensing and GIScience studies. However, the characteristics of geospatial datasets selected for use with these methods have demonstrated important implications on method performance. The number of data layers available, the rate of LCC, and inherent errors resulting from classification procedures are expected to influence model performance. Yet, it is unknown how these can affect compatibility with the LSTM method. As such, the main objective of this study is to explore the capacity of LSTM to forecast patterns that have emerged from LCC dynamics given varying temporal resolutions, persistent land cover classes, and auxiliary data layers pertaining to classification confidence. Stacked LSTM modeling approaches are applied to 17-year MODIS land cover datasets focused on the province of British Columbia, Canada. This geospatial data is reclassified to four major land cover (LC) classes during pre-processing procedures. The evaluation considers the dataset at variable temporal resolutions to demonstrate the significance of geospatial data characteristics on LSTM method performance in several scenarios. Results indicate that LSTM can be utilized for forecasting LCC patterns when there are few limitations on temporal intervals of the datasets provided. Likewise, this study demonstrates improved performance measures when there are classes that do not change. Furthermore, providing classification confidence data as ancillary input also demonstrated improved results when the number of timesteps or temporal resolution is limited. This study contributes to future applications of DL and LSTM methods for forecasting LCC.

TI  - Heidegger and Husserl on the Technological-Scientific Worldview
T2  - HUMAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the relation between the later Husserl and the later Heidegger regarding their criticisms of modern science and technology. It is suggested that the overlap between both accounts is more significant than is standardly acknowledged. The paper first explores Heidegger's ideas about the 'essences' of science and technology, how they allegedly determine the contemporary worldview, conceal our relation to being, and how Heidegger warrants his critical attitude toward this. It then discusses Husserl's philosophical-historical assessment of the 'idea' of modern science, which Husserl believed resulted in the decapitation of philosophical questioning. Although key differences in method, aims, and their proposed solution to the dominance of the technological-scientific worldview should not be overlooked, the paper suggests that core aspects of Heidegger's analyses can be traced back to Husserl.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since March 16, 2017, the National Forest Conservation Program for Climate Change Mitigation (PNCBMCC) of Peru's Ministry of the Environment (MINAM) has been implementing a methodology to detect early warning alerts of humid tropical forest cover loss in Peru using data from the Landsat 7 and 8 satellites. The method uses Direct Spectral Unmixing (DSU) to detect forest loss as small as 25% of a pixel. Between March 16 and December 25 of 2017, 500 Landsat images have been used to detect 137,143 hectares of humid tropical forest cover loss, including deforestation for agricultural expansion and illegal or informal extractive activities, such as the opening of roads for selective logging. Natural forest loss was also detected, produced by windstorms and landslides in mountainous areas, among others. The results were verified with high-resolution satellite images and the accuracy was evaluated using a stratified random sample, showing a high level of both user's and producer's accuracy. The early warning alerts are distributed and available through the Geobosques platform (http://geobosques.minam.gob.pe).

TI  - Kharif crop characterization using combination of SAR and MSI Optical Sentinel Satellite datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the differences in the kharif crop reflectance at varied wavelength regions and temporal SAR backscatter (at VV and VH polarizations) during different crop stages were analyzed to classify crop types in parts of Ranchi district, East India using random forest classifier. The spectral signature of crops was generated during various growth stages using temporal Sentinel-2 MSI (optical) satellite images. The temporal backscatter profile that depends on the geometric and di-electric properties of crops were studied using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The spectral profile exhibited distinctive reflectance at the NIR (0.842 mu m) and SWIR (1.610 mu m) wavelength regions for paddy (Oryza sativa; similar to 0.25 at NIR, similar to 0.27 at SWIR), maize (Zea mays; similar to 0.24 at NIR, similar to 0.29 at SWIR) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana, similar to 0.26 NIR, similar to 0.31 at SWIR) during pre-sowing season (mid-June). Similar variations in crop's reflectance at their different growth stages (vegetative to harvesting) were observed at various wavelength ranges. Further, the variations in the backscatter coefficient of different crops were observed at various growth stages depending upon the differences in sowing-harvesting periods, field conditions, geometry, and water presence in the crop field, etc. The Sentinel-1 SAR based study indicated difference in the backscatter of crops (i.e., similar to-18.5dB (VH) and similar to-10dB (VV) for paddy, similar to-14dB (VH) and similar to-7.5dB (VV) for maize, similar to-14.5dB and similar to-8dB (VV) for finger millet) during late-July (transplantation for paddy; early vegetative for maize and finger millet). These variations in the reflectance and backscatter values during various stages were used to deduce the best combination of the optical and SAR layers in order to classify each crop precisely. The GLCM texture analysis was performed on SAR for better classification of crop fields with higher accuracies. The SAR-MSI based kharif crop assessment (2017) indicated that the total cropped area under paddy, maize and finger millet was 24,544.55, 1468.28 and 632.48ha, respectively. The result was validated with ground observations, which indicated an overall accuracy of 83.87% and kappa coefficient of 0.78. The high temporal, spatial spectral agility of Sentinel satellite are highly suitable for kharif crop monitoring. The study signifies the role of combined SAR-MSI technology for accurate mapping and monitoring of kharif crops.

TI  - Spatio-temporal monitoring and modelling of birch pollen levels in Belgium
T2  - AEROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Belgium, ~ 10% of the people is estimated to suffer from allergies due to pollen emitted by the birch family trees. Timely information on forthcoming pollen exposure episodes using a forecasting system can allow patients to take preventive measures. To date, the only available information on pollen concentrations in Belgium comes from five stations that monitor daily airborne birch pollen concentrations, but real-time and detailed spatial information is lacking. Pollen transport models can both quantify and forecast the spatial and temporal distribution of airborne birch pollen concentrations if accurate and updated maps of birch pollen emission sources are available and if the large inter-seasonal variability of birch pollen is considered. Here we show that the SILAM model driven by ECMWF ERA5 meteorological data is able to determine airborne birch pollen levels using updated maps of areal fractions of birch trees, as compared to the pollen observations of the monitoring stations in Belgium. Forest inventory data of the Flemish and Walloon regions were used to update the default MACCIII birch map. Spaceborne MODIS vegetation activity combined with an updated birch fraction map and updated start and end dates of the birch pollen season were integrated into SILAM. The correlation (R-2) between SILAM modelled and observed time series of daily birch pollen levels of 50 birch pollen seasons increased up to ~ 50%. The slopes of the linear correlation increased on average with ~ 60%. Finally, SILAM is able to capture the threshold of 80 pollen grains m(-3) exposure from the observations.

TI  - Long-Term Water Surface Area Monitoring and Derived Water Level Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) at Altevatn, a Medium-Sized Arctic Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water storage in lakes and reservoirs is critical to water resource management, especially in a changing climate. Satellite microwave remote sensing offers a weather and light-independent solution for mapping water cover over large scales. We have used 13 years of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from three different sensors (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR)) to develop a method for mapping surface water cover and thereby estimating the lake water extent (LWE). The method uses the unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm together with specific post-processing techniques to create binary maps of the water area. We have specifically tested and validated the method at Altevatn, a medium-sized arctic lake in Northern Norway, by using in-situ measurements of the water level. The multi-sensor SAR LWE time series were used in conjunction with the water level measurements to derive the lake hypsometry while at the same time quantifying the accuracy of our method. For Altevatn lake we estimated LWE with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.89 km(2) or 1.4% of the mean LWE, while the inferred lake water level (LWL) was associated with an RMSE of 0.40 m, or 2.5% of the maximum annual variation. We foresee that there is potential to further develop the algorithm by generalizing its use to other lakes worldwide and automating the process such that near real-time monitoring of LWE may be possible.

TI  - Modeling of the Morphological Pattern Development for Thermokarst Plains with Fluvial Erosion Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to present the results of mathematical modeling of the morphological pattern development for thermokarst plains with fluvial erosion based on the approaches of the mathematical morphology of landscapes and using remote sensing data. The theoretical analysis has resulted in the model of the morphological pattern development for thermokarst plains with fluvial erosion, which has been empirically tested at a few key sites. The analysis has allowed us to conclude that the theoretical results on the exponential distribution of khasyrei areas are confirmed empirically in different physicogeographical, geological, and geocryological environments and that the distribution of the areas of thermokarst lakes within thermokarst plains with fluvial erosion obey both gamma- and lognormal distributions. It is shown that the distribution of average radii and diameters of the khasyreis should be the Rayleigh distribution. This analysis indicates that the variant of the synchronous start of thermokarst processes is the most common at the sites under consideration. The model also allows us to assess dynamic parameters of the processes using the landscape metrics of a single time slice.

TI  - <i>CoastSat</i>: A Google Earth Engine-enabled Python toolkit to extract shorelines from publicly available satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables the user to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any sandy coastline worldwide from 30+ years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery. The toolkit exploits the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to efficiently retrieve Landsat and Sentinel-2 images cropped to any user-defined region of interest. The resulting images are pre-processed to remove cloudy pixels and enhance spatial resolution, before applying a robust and generic shoreline detection algorithm. This novel shoreline detection technique combines a supervised image classification and a sub-pixel resolution border segmentation to map the position of the shoreline with an accuracy of similar to 10 m. The purpose of CoastSat is to provide coastal managers, engineers and scientists a user-friendly and practical toolkit to monitor and explore their coastlines. The software is freely-available on GitHub (https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat) and is accompanied by guided examples (Jupyter Notebook) plus step-by-step README documentation.

TI  - Tree Cover for the Year 2010 of the Metropolitan Region of SAo Paulo, Brazil
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Mapping urban trees with images at a very high spatial resolution (<= 1 m) is a particularly relevant recent challenge due to the need to assess the ecosystem services they provide. However, due to the effort needed to produce these maps from tree censuses or with remote sensing data, few cities in the world have a complete tree cover map. Here, we present the tree cover data at 1-m spatial resolution of the Metropolitan Region of SAo Paulo, Brazil, the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the world. This dataset, based on 71 orthorectified RGB aerial photographs taken in 2010 at 1-m spatial resolution, was produced using a deep learning method for image segmentation called U-net. The model was trained with 1286 images of size 64 x 64 pixels at 1-m spatial resolution, containing one or more trees or only background, and their labelled masks. The validation was based on 322 images of the same size not used in the training and their labelled masks. The map produced by the U-net algorithm showed an excellent level of accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 96.4% and an F1-score of 0.941 (precision = 0.945 and recall = 0.937). This dataset is a valuable input for the estimation of urban forest ecosystem services, and more broadly for urban studies or urban ecological modelling of the SAo Paulo Metropolitan Region.

TI  - Using the U-net convolutional network to map forest types and disturbance in the Atlantic rainforest with very high resolution images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest types and tree species at regional scales to provide information for ecologists and forest managers is a new challenge for the remote sensing community. Here, we assess the potential of a U-net convolutional network, a recent deep learning algorithm, to identify and segment (1) natural forests and eucalyptus plantations, and (2) an indicator of forest disturbance, the tree species Cecropia hololeuca, in very high resolution images (0.3 m) from the WorldView-3 satellite in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest region. The networks for forest types and Cecropia trees were trained with 7611 and 1568 red-green-blue (RGB) images, respectively, and their dense labeled masks. Eighty per cent of the images were used for training and 20% for validation. The U-net network segmented forest types with an overall accuracy >95% and an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.96. For C. hololeuca, the overall accuracy was 97% and the IoU was 0.86. The predictions were produced over a 1600 km(2) region using WorldView-3 RGB bands pan-sharpened at 0.3 m. Natural and eucalyptus forests compose 79 and 21% of the region's total forest cover (82 250 ha). Cecropia crowns covered 1% of the natural forest canopy. An index to describe the level of disturbance of the natural forest fragments based on the spatial distribution of Cecropia trees was developed. Our work demonstrates how a deep learning algorithm can support applications such as vegetation, tree species distributions and disturbance mapping on a regional scale.

TI  - Kaihekengaru: Maori Surfers' and a Sense of Place
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique relationship that Maori have with nature and the environment is a topic that has received much interest. There is however a lack of investigation into the oceanscape, and in particular to surfing and a sense of place among Maori wave riders (Kaihekengaru). Kaihekengaru provide a unique perspective of 'place', as surfing involves direct engagement with nature and intimate human interactions with diverse coastal environments and peoples.This study involved an online survey and key informant interviews with Maori who regularly surf their local surfbreaks. The results suggest that for some Maori surfers a deep sense of place prevails with the environment in Aotearoa New Zealand, and that this sense of place manifests an array of thoughts and feelings related to spiritual, affective, familial, physical and cognitive perceptions. A sense of place for the participants in this study drew on Matauranga Maori and a Maori worldview. Underpinning these experiences of place was the concept of whakapapa and its influence on environmental attachments, Atua engagements, and ancestral connections. In a wider sense, the implications of these findings highlight the need to ensure that these oceanscapes, surfbreaks, and associated landmarks are maintained for the future benefit of all New Zealanders'.

TI  - Phenology Patterns Indicate Recovery Trajectories of Ponderosa Pine Forests After High-Severity Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-fire recovery trajectories in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwestern United States are increasingly shifting away from pre-burn vegetation communities. This study investigated whether phenological metrics derived from a multi-decade remotely sensed imagery time-series could differentiate among grass, evergreen shrub, deciduous, or conifer-dominated replacement pathways. We focused on 10 fires that burned ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA before the year 2000. A total of 29 sites with discernable post-fire recovery signals were selected within high-severity burn areas. At each site, we used Google Earth Engine to derive time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager data from 1984 to 2017. We aggregated values to 8- and 16-day intervals, fit Savitzky-Golay filters to each sequence, and extracted annual phenology metrics of amplitude, base value, peak value, and timing of peak value in the TIMESAT analysis package. Results showed that relative to post-fire conditions, pre-burn ponderosa pine forests exhibit significantly lower mean NDVI amplitude (0.14 vs. 0.21), higher mean base NDVI (0.47 vs. 0.22), higher mean peak NDVI (0.60 vs. 0.43), and later mean peak NDVI (day of year 277 vs. 237). Vegetation succession pathways exhibit distinct phenometric characteristics as early as year 5 (amplitude) and as late as year 20 (timing of peak NDVI). This study confirms the feasibility of leveraging phenology metrics derived from long-term imagery time-series to identify and monitor ecological outcomes. This information may be of benefit to land resource managers who seek indicators of future landscape compositions to inform management strategies.

TI  - An Object-Based Hierarchical Compound Classification Method for Change Detection in Heterogeneous Optical and SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images is an important but challenging task because of the incommensurable appearances of the heterogeneous images. In order to solve the change detection problem in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, this paper proposes an improved method that combines cooperative multitemporal segmentation and hierarchical compound classification (CMS-HCC) based on our previous work. Considering the large radiometric and geometric differences between heterogeneous images, first, a cooperative multitemporal segmentation method is introduced to generate multi-scale segmentation results. This method segments two images together by associating the information from the two images and thus reduces the noises and errors caused by area transition and object misalignment, as well as makes the boundaries of detected objects described more accurately. Then, a region-based multitemporal hierarchical Markov random field (RMH-MRF) model is defined to combine spatial, temporal, and multi-level information. With the RMH-MRF model, a hierarchical compound classification method is performed by identifying the optimal configuration of labels with a region-based marginal posterior mode estimation, further improving the change detection accuracy. The changes can be determined if the labels assigned to each pair of parcels are different, obtaining multi-scale change maps. Experimental validation is conducted on several pairs of optical and SAR images. It consists of two parts: comparison on different multitemporal segmentation methods and comparison on different change detection methods. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the changes in heterogeneous images, with low false positive and high accuracy.

TI  - Sequential InSAR Time Series Deformation Monitoring of Land Subsidence and Rebound in Xi'an, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series deformation monitoring plays an important role in revealing historical displacement of the Earth's surface. Xi'an, China, has suffered from severe land subsidence along with ground fissure development since the 1960s, which has threatened and will continue to threaten the stability of urban artificial constructions. In addition, some local areas in Xi'an suffered from uplifting for some specific period. Time series deformation derived from multi-temporal InSAR techniques makes it possible to obtain the temporal evolution of land subsidence and rebound in Xi'an. In this paper, we used the sequential InSAR time series estimation method to map the ground subsidence and rebound in Xi'an with Sentinel-1A data during 2015 to 2019, allowing estimation of surface deformation dynamically and quickly. From 20 June 2015 to 17 July 2019, two areas subsided continuously (Sanyaocun-Fengqiyuan and Qujiang New District), while Xi'an City Wall area uplifted with a maximum deformation rate of 12 mm/year. Furthermore, Yuhuazhai subsided from 20 June 2015 to 14 October 2018, and rebound occurred from 14 October 2018 to 17 July 2019, which can be explained as the response to artificial water injection. In the process of artificial water injection, the rebound pattern can be further divided into immediate elastic recovery deformation and time-dependent visco-elastic recovery deformation.

TI  - Classification of the global Sentinel-1 SAR vignettes for ocean surface process studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide finely-resolved (meters-scale) images of ocean surface roughness day-or-night in nearly all weather conditions. This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Initially designed for the measurement of directional ocean wave spectra, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes are small 20 km scenes that have been collected globally since 2014. Recent WV data exploration reveals that many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are also well captured, but not yet employed by the scientific community. However, expanding applications of this whole massive dataset beyond ocean waves requires a strategy to automatically identify these geophysical phenomena. In this study, we propose to apply the emerging deep learning approach in ocean SAR scenes classification. The training is performed using a hand-curated dataset that describes ten commonly-occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. Our model evaluation relies on an independent assessment dataset and shows satisfactory and robust classification results. To further illustrate the model performance, regional patterns of rain and sea ice are qualitatively analyzed and found to be very consistent with independent remote sensing datasets. In addition, these high-resolution WV SAR data can resolve fine, sub-km scale, spatial structure of rain events and sea ice that complement other satellite measurements. Overall, such automated SAR vignettes classification may open paths for broader geophysical application of maritime Sentinel-1 acquisitions.

TI  - Meandering-anabranching river channel change in response to flow-sediment regulation: Data analysis and model validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anabranching river has been recognized as an independent river pattern. A variety of investigations have attempted to disclose the formation of anabranching rivers, however, most previous studies mainly focused on the controls of anabranching channels formation. The mechanism of transition among sub-channels with varying flow-sediment regime in anabranching rivers has been poorly understood. In this study, we used multi-source data sets to investigate the changes in river channels and island (Wugui Island, about 7 km(2)) along the 27-km long Jianli Reach (Tashiyi-Tianziyihao) in the middle Yangtze River. Nine Landsat images (1987, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2014) with 30 m spatial resolution were used to map the channel planform dynamics. Obvious changes in channel width and morphology of the island were observed during 1987-2014. The width of the left branch had reduced from 1041 m to 340 m, while the width of the right branch had increased from 632 m to 1531 m. During 1994-1996, the main river channel shifted from the left branch to the right. During the period of 1987-2014, the total width of the compound cross-section increased, and the mean length-width ratio of the island increased from 159 to 4.32. The mean annual flow discharge increased about 9%, and mean annual suspended sediment concentration and sediment transport coefficient (the ratio of mean annual suspended sediment concentration to mean annul flow discharge) decreased about 75% and 76% respectively from 1951 to 2009, in response to the operation of Gezhouba Dam and Three Gorges Dam. The meandering-anabranching channel planform adjusted by narrowing the island width and enlarging compound cross-section in response to upstream water-sediment regime. The shift of the main river channel from left branch to the right may resulted from the increase in flow discharge and decrease in sediment transport coefficient since 1980s. The adjustment has been intensified by the changes in the sediment transport rate after 1995. After the main channel was switched from left branch to right branch, the flow-sediment diversion capacity was kept stable with a diversion percentage of 90% in right branch. Due to the persistent influence of the Three Gorges Dam, the right branch will function as the main channel for a long time before the meandering-anabranching system achieves equilibrium. The shift and stability of main channel was closely related with the relative magnitude of flow-sediment partition in each branch. The significance of this study is that we successfully manifested the main channel shift process of anabranching river with the support of direct hydromorphological observation and theoretical verification.

TI  - High-Spatial-Resolution Population Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> Pollution Based on Multi-Satellite Retrievals: A Case Study of Seasonal Variation in the Yangtze River Delta, China in 2013
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the health risk of PM2.5, it is necessary to accurately estimate the actual exposure level of the population to PM2.5. However, the spatial distribution of PM2.5 may be inconsistent with that of the population, making it necessary for a high-spatial-resolution and refined assessment of the population exposure to air pollution. This study takes the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) Region as an example since it has a high-density population and a high pollution level. The brightness reflectance of night-time light, and MODIS-based (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation index, elevation, and slope information are used as independent variables to construct a random-forest (RF) model for the estimation of the population spatial distribution, before any combination with the PM2.5 data retrieved from MODIS. This enables assessment of the population exposure to PM2.5 (i.e., intensity of population exposure to PM2.5 and population-weighted PM2.5 concentration) at a 3-km resolution, using the year 2013 as an example. Results show that the variance explained for the RF-model-estimated population density reaches over 80%, while the estimated errors in half of counties are < 20%, indicating the high accuracy of the estimated population. The spatial distribution of population exposure to PM2.5 exhibits an obvious urban-suburban-rural difference consistent with the population distribution but inconsistent with the PM2.5 concentration. High and low PM2.5 concentrations are mainly distributed in the northern and southern YRD Region, respectively, with the mean proportions of the population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations > 35 mu g/m(3) close to 100% in all four seasons. A high-level population exposure to PM2.5 is mainly found in Shanghai, most of the Jiangsu Province, the central Anhui Province, and some coastal cities of the Zhejiang Province. The highest risk of population exposure to PM2.5 occurs in winter, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest in summer, consistent with the PM2.5 seasonal variation(.) Seasonal-averaged population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations are different from PM2.5 concentrations in the region, which are closely related to the urban-exposed population density and pollution levels. This work provides a novel assessment of the proposed population-density exposure to PM2.5 by using multi-satellite retrievals to determine the high-spatial-resolution risk of air pollution and detailed regional differences in the population exposure to PM2.5.

TI  - Sentinel-2A Image Fusion Using a Machine Learning Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multispectral instrument (MSI) carried by Sentinel-2A has 13 spectral bands with various spatial resolutions (i.e., four 10-m, six 20-m, and three 60-m bands). A wide range of applications requires a 10-m resolution for all spectral bands, including the 20- and 60-m bands. To achieve this requirement, previous studies used conventional pansharpening techniques, which require a simulated 10-m panchromatic (PAN) band from four 10-m bands [blue, green, red, and near infrared (NIR)]. The simulated PAN band may not have all the information from the original four bands and may have no spectral response function that overlaps the 20- or 60-m bands to be sharpened, which may degrade fusion quality. This paper presents a machine learning method that can directly use the information from multiple 10-m resolution bands for fusion. The method first learns the spectral relationship between the 20- or 60-m band to be sharpened and the selected 10-m bands degraded to 20 or 60 m using the support vector regression (SVR) model. The model is then applied to the selected 10-m bands to predict the 10-m-resolution version of the 20- or 60-m band. The image degradation process was tuned to closely match the Sentinel-2A MSI modulation transfer function (MTF). We applied our method to three data sets in Guangzhou, China, New South Wales, Australia, and St. Louis, USA, and achieved better fusion results than other commonly used pansharpening methods in terms of both visual and quantitative factors.

TI  - The role of land cover change in Arctic-Boreal greening and browning trends
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have used time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices to identify so-called greening and browning trends across the northern high-latitudes and to suggest that the productivity of Arctic-Boreal ecosystems is changing in response to climate forcing at local and continental scales. However, disturbances that alter land cover are prevalent in Arctic-Boreal ecosystems, and changes in Arctic-Boreal land cover, which complicate interpretation of trends in vegetation indices, have mostly been ignored in previous studies. Here we use a new land cover change dataset derived from Landsat imagery to explore the extent to which land cover and land cover change influence trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over a large (3.76 M km(2)) area of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment, which spans much of northwestern Canada and Alaska. Between 1984 and 2012, 21.2% of the study domain experienced land cover change and 42.7% had significant NDVI trends. Land cover change occurred in 27.6% of locations with significant NDVI trends during this period and resulted in greening and browning rates 48%-128% higher than in areas of stable land cover. While the majority of land cover change areas experienced significant NDVI trends, more than half of areas with stable land cover did not. Further, the extent and magnitude of browning and greening trends varied substantially as a function of land cover class and land cover change type. Forest disturbance from fire and timber harvest drove over one third of statistically significant NDVI trends and created complex mosaics of recent forest loss (as browning) and post-disturbance recovery (as greening) at both landscape and continental scale. Our results demonstrate the importance of land cover changes in highly disturbed high-latitude ecosystems for interpreting trends of NDVI and productivity across multiple spatial scales.

AB  - Mongolia is in the hinterland of the Mongolian Plateau, which has a varied, fragile, and sensitive geographical environment. Understanding its land cover pattern and change is of great significance for the resources, environment, ecology, and sustainable development of the Mongolia Plateau and Northeast Asia. In this study, land cover products of Mongolia in 1990 and 2010 were obtained via Landsat thematic mapper remote sensing images using an object-oriented classification method. The overall classification accuracies were 82.26% and 92.34%, respectively. Based on the products, the land cover patterns of Mongolia in 2010 and the land cover changes from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed. The spatial pattern presented an obvious regional difference and a land cover type transition from forests, real steppes, and desert steppes to barren from north to south. The provinces with the highest grassland and forest cover were Dornod in Eastern Mongolia and Selenge in Northern Mongolia. From 1990 to 2010, the area of forest, real steppe, cropland, and sand presented a decreasing trend and decreased by 27337.47, 24071.44, 5256.6, and 3868.16 km(2), respectively. The area of meadow steppe, desert steppe, bare land, and desert showed an increasing trend and increased by 2943.32, 27815.71, 27721.03, and 2110.26 km(2). Our results indicate that the vegetative cover of Mongolia showed a decreasing trend, and the desertification was severe. These changes could be attributed to a combination of climate change, increased livestock grazing and natural disasters, socioeconomic shifts, and exhaustive exploitation of natural resources.

TI  - Health care utilization pattern prior to maltreatment among children under five years of age in Taiwan
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several studies have hypothesized that the pattern of health care utilization among maltreated children differ from others without the experience. However, the conclusions have not been consistent.Objective: The study aims to examine whether the pattern of health care utilization among children 0-5 years old with maltreatment different from their counterparts without maltreatment in Taiwan.Subjects and Setting: All children born in 2007 in Taiwan.Method: This is a population-based and case-controlled study. Cases are children under five years of ago with maltreatment-related diagnosis in the claims data of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan during the 2007-2013 period. For each case, there were 10 birth date-matched controls. Exposure variables include the number of injury or non-injury-related outpatients, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalization. Multivariate models were employed, with adjustment for sex, urbanization level, and comorbidities of children.Results: Of children born in 2007, 382 had maltreatment-related diagnosis during the age of 0-5. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for having two or more ED visits with or without injury-related diagnosis is 3.52 (95% CI 1.75-7.07) and 2.0-0 (95% CI 1.47-2.72), respectively. Children with maltreatment also had significantly higher number of hospitalization without injury-related diagnosis and aOR for those having two more hospitalizations stands at 2.47 (95% CI 1.59-3.83).Conclusions: Children with maltreatment when 0-5 years old had higher number of ED visits with injury-related diagnosis, as well as hospitalization without injury-related diagnosis. Recognition of the health care utilization is conducive to early identification of children with risk for maltreatment.

TI  - A Distributed Storage and Access Approach for Massive Remote Sensing Data in MongoDB
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of earth-observation technology, the amount of remote sensing data has increased exponentially, and traditional relational databases cannot satisfy the requirements of managing large-scale remote sensing data. To address this problem, this paper undertakes intensive research of the NoSQL (Not Only SQL) data management model, especially the MongoDB database, and proposes a new approach to managing large-scale remote sensing data. Firstly, based on the sharding technology of MongoDB, a distributed cluster architecture was designed and established for massive remote sensing data. Secondly, for the convenience in the unified management of remote sensing data, an archiving model was constructed, and remote sensing data, including structured metadata and unstructured image data, were stored in the above cluster separately, with the metadata stored in the form of a document, and image data stored with the GridFS mechanism. Finally, by designing different shard strategies and comparing MongoDB cluster with a typical relational database, several groups of experiments were conducted to verify the storage performance and access performance of the cluster. The experimental results show that the proposed method can overcome the deficiencies of traditional methods, as well as scale out the database, which is more suitable for managing massive remote sensing data and can provide technical support for the management of massive remote sensing data.

TI  - Inversion of Heavy Metals Content in Soil Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery in Daxigou Mining Area of Shaanxi
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of low efficiency and higher cost exists in the traditional method mainly on "field-work point sampling then indoor experimental analysis". Also the problem that how to choose the optimal factors indicating the content of heavy metals in soils is difficult to solve for the quantitative inversion of high precision using multispectral remote sensing technology. Using Landsat8/OLI satellite imagery, DEM data and soil samples data, the paper performed the analysis indicators of heavy metals in soil and the quantitative inversion of the content of heavy metals in soil in order to achieve an improved accuracy, taking a study case of a mountainous and forestry mining area called Daxigou mineral of Shaanxi in China. The work was as follows: A soil sampling scheme considering terrain and geomorphology characteristics was designed and evenly sampled in both sides along main topographic feature lines in the study area and 45 soil samples were acquired. Furthermore, a mixed samples from 45 samples were analyzed in laboratory so as to choose the most interested metals (i.e. Cu, Zn, As) as our focus according to both the degree of metals content bigger than that of national authoritative statistics and the type of mineral. Secondly, the paper suggested three types of factors including six spectral reflectivity from band two to seven of Landsat8/OLI imagery, and several spectral indices such as CMR, MNDWI, DVI, EVI etc., derived from Landsat8 image and also slope and aspect factors derived from DEM data were adopted to indicate the characteristics of the spatial distribution of the content of the three metals candidates considering land use and terrain circumstances in the study area. Subsequently, a correlation analysis of the content of three interested metals individually with six spectral reflectivity data, eight spectral indices and three terrain indicators was done using Least Squares principle. According to the consequence of the correlation analysis, the paper introduced the rule-based M5 model tree in the form of piecewise linear model which was used to estimate the content of Cu, Zn, As three metals in the principle of minimizing error rate. And an inversion model for the content of the three metals was constructed through the simulation, smoothing and pruning of the model tree with an input of all three types and 17 indicators mentioned above and 80% training samples. Also, a set of optimal indicators focusing on spectrum for the inversion were determined according to the principle of minimizing RMSE. Finally, the inversion results using 20% random samples were verified, showing that our suggested method achieved a decrease of RMSE value by 27.3%, 24.6%, 20.9%, and an improvement in confidence level for Cu and As, compared to that of the three interested metals using ordinary linear regression model. Also the thematic images showing the spatial distribution were mapped using the model. Then, the comparisons between the estimated value of the content of three metals and the background value published by Chinese government in 1990 were made. Furthermore, the statistical distribution rules of the three metals were concluded and verified using field survey results.

TI  - Multi-Scale Validation of MODIS LAI Products Based on Crop Growth Period
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important canopy structure parameters utilized in process-based models of climate, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. In order to determine the reliability and applicability of satellite LAI products, it is critical to validate satellite LAI products. Due to surface heterogeneity and scale effects, it is difficult to validate the accuracy of LAI products. In order to improve the spatio-temporal accuracy of satellite LAI products, we propose a new multi-scale LAI product validation method based on a crop growth cycle. In this method, we used the PROSAIL model to derive Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LAI data and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) for the study area. The Empirical Bayes Kriging (EBK) interpolation method was used to perform a spatial multi-scale transformation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI products, GF-1 LAI data, and ASTER LAI data. Finally, MODIS LAI satellite products were compared with field measured LAI data, GF-1 LAI data, and ASTER LAI data during the growing season of crop field. This study was conducted in the agricultural oasis area of the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China and the Conghua District of Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. The results suggest that the validation accuracy of the multi-scale MODIS LAI products validated by ASTER LAI data were higher than those of the GF-1 LAI data and the reference field measured LAI data, showing a R-2 of 0.758 and relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 28.73% for 15 m ASTER LAI and a R-2 of 0.703 and RRMSE of 30.80% for 500 m ASTER LAI, which imply that the 15 m MODIS LAI product generated by the EBK method was more accurate than the 500 m and 8 m products. This study provides a new validation method for satellite remotely sensed products.

TI  - Correlation Analysis between UBD and LST in Hefei, China, Using Luojia1-01 Night-Time Light Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is one of the essential phenomena of the modern urban climate. In recent years, urbanization in China has gradually accelerated, and the heat island effect has also intensified as the urban impervious surface area and the number of buildings is increasing. Urban building density (UBD) is one of the main factors affecting UHI, but there is little discussion on the relationship between the two. This paper takes Hefei as the research area, combines UBD data estimated by Luojial-01 night-time light (NTL) imagery as the research object with land surface temperature (LST) data obtained from Landsat8 images, and carries out spatial correlation analysis on 0.5 x 0.5 km to 2 x 2 km resolution for them, so as to explore the relationship between UBD and UHI. The results show the following: (1) Luojial-01 data have a good ability to estimate UBD and have fewer errors when compared with the actual UBD data; (2) At the four spatial scales, UBD and LST present a significant positive correlation that increases with the enlargement of the spatial scale; and (3) Moreover, the fitting effect of the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model is better than that of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model.

TI  - Estimation and Climate Factor Contribution of Aboveground Biomass in Inner Mongolia's Typical/Desert Steppes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland biomass is an essential part of the regional carbon cycle. Rapid and accurate estimation of grassland biomass is a hot topic in research on grassland ecosystems. This study was based on field-measured biomass data and satellite remote sensing data from the Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the aboveground biomass (AGB), dynamic changes, and relevance of climatic factors of the typical/desert steppe in Inner Mongolia during the growing seasons from May 2009 to October 2015. The results showed that: (1) The logarithmic function model with the ratio vegetation index (RVI) as the independent variable worked best for the typical steppe area in Inner Mongolia, while the power function model with the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) as the independent variable worked best for the desert steppe area. The R-2 values at a spatial resolution of 250 m were higher than those at a spatial resolution 500 m. (2) From 2009 to 2015, the highest values of AGB in the typical steppe and desert steppe of Inner Mongolia both appeared in 2012, and were 41.9 Tg and 7.0 Tg, respectively. The lowest values were 30.7 Tg and 5.8 Tg, respectively, in 2009. (3) The overall spatial distribution of AGB decreased from northeast to southwest. It also changed considerably over time. From May to August, AGB at the same longitude increased from south to north with seasonal variations; from August to October, it increased from north to south. (4) A variation partitioning analysis showed that in both the typical steppe and desert steppe, the combined effect of precipitation and temperature contributed the most to the aboveground biomass. The individual effect of temperature contributed more than precipitation in the typical steppe, while the individual effect of precipitation contributed more in the desert steppe. Thus, the hydrothermal dynamic hypothesis was used to explain this pattern. This study provides support for grassland husbandry management and carbon storage assessment in Inner Mongolia.

TI  - Do Ecosystem Service Value Increase and Environmental Quality Improve due to Large-Scale Ecological Water Conveyance in an Arid Region of China?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the economy and the intensification of human activities, ecological systems have been degraded, especially in arid areas. The lower reaches of the Tarim River represent a typical arid area in China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has been heavily investing in the protection and restoration of the natural ecological environment of the lower reaches of the Tarim River. In this study, we aimed to resolve two key scientific issues: (1) reveal the changing characteristics of land-use in the region and identify the changes in ecosystem service value caused by these land-use changes and (2) evaluate whether the environmental quality has improved or worsened. The objective of this study is to verify whether the ecological water conveyance project promotes an increase in the ecosystem service value, with an improvement in the ecological environment, to thereby provide references for the evaluated effects of ecological water conveyance for the management of water resources. In this way, economic development can support environmental protection. Thus, the economy can be sustainably developed. Hence, based on the remote sensing data of land-use in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2016, with the value coefficients proposed by Constanza in 1997 and changing characteristics in the land-use, the ecological service value, and environmental conditions from 1990 to 2016 were analysed. According to our results, from 1990 to 2016, the ecosystem service value has increased substantially, indicating that the benefits of ecological water conveyance were significant. The environmental condition index increased by 21.14%, showing that the ecological environment has improved. However, the environmental quality remained low. In the future, we should formulate plans for reasonable land-use that control the replacement of woodlands and grasslands with farmlands and construction. The results of this study provide a scientific basis and practical guide for restoring inland river ecosystems in arid regions.

TI  - Surface Shortwave Net Radiation Estimation from Landsat TM/ETM plus Data Using Four Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface shortwave net radiation (SSNR) flux is essential for the determination of the radiation energy balance between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. The satellite-derived intermediate SSNR data are strongly needed to bridge the gap between existing coarse-resolution SSNR products and point-based measurements. In this study, four different machine learning (ML) algorithms were tested to estimate the SSNR from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and other ancillary information (i.e., clearness index, water vapor) at instantaneous and daily scales under all sky conditions. The four ML algorithms include the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT). Collected in-situ measurements were used to train the global model (using all data) and the conditional models (in which all data were divided into subsets and the models were fitted separately). The validation results indicated that the GBRT-based global model (GGM) performs the best at both the instantaneous and daily scales. For example, the GGM based on the TM data yielded a coefficient of determination value (R-2) of 0.88 and 0.94, an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 73.23 W.m(-2) (15.09%) and 18.76 W.m(-2) (11.2%), and a bias of 0.64 W.m(-2) and -1.74 W.m(-2) for instantaneous and daily SSNR, respectively. Compared to the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) daily SSNR product, the daily TM-SSNR showed a very similar spatial distribution but with more details. Further analysis also demonstrated the robustness of the GGM for various land cover types, elevation, general atmospheric conditions, and seasons

TI  - Measuring Risks of Confirming Warehouse Financing from the Third Party Logistics Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Confirmation warehouse financing is an important model in supply chain finance. This type of financing has special characteristics due to the existence of the reverse repurchase link, and it increases the risk commitment of the core enterprise at a certain level. Previous research on supply chain financial risk mostly settled in 'all-industry, multi-model', ignoring the special risks of single mode. To supplement the vacancies in the current research, the special risks of supply chain finance should be identified under a single model. On this basis, a measurement index system for confirmation warehouse financing risk is created. The article uses a Back Propagation (BP) neural network to build a Third Party Logistics (3PL) perspective of the risk measurement model for confirmation warehouse financing. The said network is combined with the 24 sets of actual cases from ZY Logistics. MATLAB is used to train the sample data. Results show that the absolute errors-0.042998, -0.011102, 0.020514 and 0.039448-between the training value and the predicted value are smaller than the preset error value. Among the 24 cases, high-risk businesses reached 41.7%, whereas low-risk businesses only accounted for 29.2%. The ZY enterprise confirms that warehouse financial business risk is high, and this situation should be revised. Research shows that the risk measurement indicator system has good risk prediction ability. This study establishes and verifies the rationality of the risk measurement index system and provides a reliable reference for 3PL risk aversion in supply chain finance.

TI  - Understanding tidal marsh trajectories: evaluation of multiple indicators of marsh persistence
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust assessments of ecosystem stability are critical for informing conservation and management decisions. Tidal marsh ecosystems provide vital services, yet are globally threatened by anthropogenic alterations to physical and biological processes. A variety of monitoring and modeling approaches have been undertaken to determine which tidal marshes are likely to persist into the future. Here, we conduct the most robust comparison of marsh metrics to date, building on two foundational studies that had previously and independently developed metrics for marsh condition. We characterized pairs of marshes with contrasting trajectories of marsh cover across six regions of the United States, using a combination of remote -sensing and field -based metrics. We also quantified decadal trends in marsh conversion to mudflat/open water at these twelve marshes. Our results suggest that metrics quantifying the distribution of vegetation across an elevational gradient represent the best indicators of marsh trajectories. The unvegetated to vegetated ratio and flood -ebb sediment differential also served as valuable indicators. No single metric universally predicted marsh trajectories, and therefore a more robust approach includes a suite of spatially-integrated, landscape -scale metrics that are mostly obtainable from remote sensing. Data from surface elevation tables and marker horizons revealed that degrading marshes can have higher rates ofvertical accretion and elevation gain than more intact counterparts, likely due to longer inundation times potentially combined with internal recycling of material. A high rate of elevation gain relative to local sea -level rise has been considered critical to marsh persistence, but our results suggest that it also may serve as a signature of degradation in marshes that have already begun to deteriorate. This investigation, with rigorous comparison and integration of metrics initially developed independently, tested at abroad geographic scale, provides a model for collaborative science to develop management tools for improving conservation outcomes.

TI  - Automating field boundary delineation with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the extent and location of cultivated fields are critical for agricultural monitoring, food security planning and commodity trading. The increased observational capacity of remotely sensed data, such as Sentinel-2 imagery, constitutes a major advantage over in situ methods, particularly for agricultural applications that require frequent updates. However, the development of fully automated cultivated field delineation methods remains a challenge. In this study an existing object-based image analysis (OBIA) methodology, called Canny edge-detection in conjunction with watershed segmentation (CEWS), was modified to automatically identify and delineate agricultural fields from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery in five diverse agricultural landscapes. The robustness of the technique was evaluated by comparing its outputs to those of standard perpixel, supervised classifications. Reference field boundaries were manually digitised and used for quantitative accuracy assessments. Area and edge metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of the extracted boundaries. Results show that, on average, CEWS produced significantly higher field boundary accuracies than the supervised per-pixel approach in terms of both mean absolute error (MAE) (similar to 31 m lower) and overall accuracy (similar to 13.8% higher). The closed field boundaries produced by CEWS, as well as its capability to operate without any a priori knowledge, was found to be its main strengths for integration into operational workflows. However, in complex landscapes (e.g. Swartland and Mooketsi) it was found that some fields had weak boundaries due to the homogeneity between adjacent fields, making edge detection problematic. The incorporation of higher resolution imagery into the edge detection process is proposed, particularly in agricultural areas with very small and irregularly shaped fields. Despite these challenges, it was concluded that the multi-temporal CEWS approach will perform well in most agricultural areas and is suitable for operational implementation.

TI  - Enhanced Aerosol Estimations From Suomi-NPP VIIRS Images Over Heterogeneous Surfaces
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) is a new-generation polar-orbiting satellite imaging sensor. It has generated a variety of operational products similar to the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. However, there are high uncertainties in official VIIRS aerosol products based on our previous validations, and a reduction in these uncertainties is needed before they can be used with confidence. To this end, we developed a revised high-spatial-resolution aerosol retrieval algorithm which can considerably improve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimations. The improvements mainly arise from: 1) correction of the surface bidirectional reflectance using the RossThick-LiSparse model with parameters obtained from the MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/Albedo products; 2) finer customized monthly aerosol types assumed from the historical Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements of optical properties; and 3) improved cloud screening with the revised dynamic threshold cloud detection algorithm. The new 750-m AOD retrievals are validated against AERONET AOD measurements and compared with the official VIIRS AOD products from 2014 to 2017 over the BeijingTianjinHebei region in China. The results illustrated that the retrievals are highly consistent with ground measurements ($R = 0.926$ ), with 72 of them falling within the expected error of [(0.05 20)] on a regional scale. The mean absolute error is 0.082 and the root-mean-square error is 0.120. The new algorithm can significantly reduce the overestimations and improve the aerosol estimations over heterogeneous urban surfaces compared to the official aerosol products, especially in winter. This new VIIRS AOD product will thus be more useful for air pollution studies over medium- or small-scale areas.

TI  - Patterns of Axillary Management in Stages 2 and 3 Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer by Initial Treatment Approach
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Data regarding axillary management after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) are lacking. This study examined axillary management of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patients based on initial treatment with NET, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), or upfront surgery.Methods. Patients with stage 2 or 3 HR+/HER2- breast cancer treated between 2012 and 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Database. The study examined axillary surgery [sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), SLNB followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), or upfront ALND] by initial treatment stratified by cN0/N1 using pairwise comparisons and multivariable logistic regression.Results. Of 92,204 eligible patients, 2138 (2.3%) received NET, 11,014 (12%) received NAC, and 79,052 (85.7%) received surgery. Among 60,998 cN0 patients, attempted SLNB was more likely for surgery patients (86.2%, 47,159/54,684) and NET patients (85.8%, 1342/1564) than for NAC patients (79.9%, 3793/4750) (both p < 0.001). Among 31,206 cN1 patients, attempted SLNB was more likely for the surgery patients (46.0%, 11,201/24,368) than for the NET patients (41.8%, 240/574; p = 0.05) or the NAC patients (39.8%, 2491/6264; p < 0.0001). The differences between surgery and NET did not persist in the adjusted analyses. Among both the cN0 patients (n = 13,856) and the cN1 patients (n = 8688) with pN1 disease shown by SLNB, the NET patients were treated with ALND less frequently than those receiving NAC or surgery (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). In the multi-variate analysis, for the patients with pN1 disease shown by SLNB, NET use was associated with increased odds of undergoing SLNB alone [cN0 patients: odds ratio (OR), 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.64; cN1 patients: OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.00-2.10].Conclusions. For stages 2 and 3 HR+/HER2- patients, SLNB use after NET was similar to that for upfront surgery. Among those with pN1 disease, the NET patients were less likely to undergo ALND. Additional outcomes data are needed to guide axillary management after NET.

TI  - A time of peace Divergent temporalities in Jewish-Palestinian peace initiatives
T2  - HAU-JOURNAL OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the conflicting temporal models of peace among Jewish Israelis, specifically between liberal Zionists who populate the traditional peace camp, and the broader population that largely ignores or opposes such initiatives. We compare the mainstream peace process with budding alternative non-liberal peace initiatives on one issue-the relative importance of a signed peace agreement-to explore diverging visions of temporal progression as they relate to the shared value of peace. The article claims that peace initiatives emerging from the liberal worldview reflect a vision in which the transition to peace will be a concrete temporal event, and that the horizon of peace is achievable, qualitative, and permanent. By contrast, the non-liberal initiatives reflect a belief that peace is modular and relative, that the transition to peace is inherently gradual, never to be fully achieved, dynamic, and impermanent.

TI  - The Petawawa Research Forest: Establishment of a remote sensing supersite
T2  - FORESTRY CHRONICLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The pace of technological change in forest inventory and monitoring over the past 50 years has been remarkable, largely as a result of the increased availability of various forms of remotely sensed data. Benchmarking sites, with the requisite reference and baseline data for evaluating the capacities of new technologies, algorithms, and approaches, can be extremely valuable for sparking innovation, as well as for enabling transparent and scientifically sound assessments of technologies, new data streams, and associated information outcomes. Herein we describe the establishment of a remote sensing supersite at the Petawawa Research Forest (PRF) in southern Ontario, Canada, and summarize the open access datasets that have been compiled and made available to the public. The PRF is approximately 10 000 ha in size and represents a complex assemblage of tree species and forest structures. More than 1900 data records, including multiple airborne laser scanning datasets and associated derivatives (i.e., digital terrain model, canopy height model), airborne imagery, satellite remote sensing time series, and ground plot data, among others, have been made openly available for download from Canada's National Forest Information System. We identify issues and present opportunities associated with the establishment of a remote sensing supersite at the PRF, as well as share some of the lessons learned to foster the establishment and open data sharing for other national and international remote sensing supersites. The PRF supersite can be accessed from the following link: https://opendata.nfis.org/mapserver/PRF.html.

TI  - Monitoring spatial pattern of land surface thermal characteristics and urban growth: A case study of King Williams using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is currently experiencing unprecedented urban growth, industrialization, and the perceived higher standard of living that is often associated with access to better infrastructure. "Surface Heat Island (SHI) is a phenomenon where urban areas experience higher surface temperatures compared to the surrounding rural areas. The presence of the SHI in urban areas in most cases has a negative impact not only on city dwellers, but also on the environment and the economy. This study aimed at evaluating SHI in King Williams Town by studying the relationship between land surface temperatures, land cover and land cover indices. The derived indices are the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), these indices were selected because they are representative of the land surface features." This study was conducted for the King Williams Town (KWT) study area between the years 1995 and 2018, the land surface temperature was derived from Landsat ETM + high thermal band data. The findings from this study provided an idea on the correlation between satellite derived land surface temperature and the land modification, which occurred during the urbanization of King Williams Town during 23-year period between 1995 and 2018. The built-up land category proved to be the most influential or significant in the development of high land surface temperature levels, while vegetation had an opposite effect as a series of data sets illustrated that vegetated areas had a cooling effect on the surface. Water bodies in the study area had insignificant effect on the surface temperature levels while the grass lands were not as cooling as the vegetation but did provide for a cooling environment on the study area.

TI  - Reducing Native Ant Abundance Decreases Predation Rates in Midwestern Grasslands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diverse and robust predator communities are important for effective prey suppression in natural and managed communities. Ants are ubiquitous components of terrestrial systems but their contributions to natural prey suppression is relatively understudied in temperate regions. Growing evidence suggests that ants can play a significant role in the removal of insect prey within grasslands, but their impact is difficult to separate from that of nonant predators. To test how ants may contribute to prey suppression in grasslands, we used poison baits (with physical exclosures) to selectively reduce the ant population in common garden settings, then tracked ant and nonant ground predator abundance and diversity, and removal of sentinel egg prey for 7 wk. We found that poison baits reduced ant abundance without a significant negative impact on abundance of nonant ground predators, and that a reduction in ant abundance decreased the proportion of sentinel prey eggs removed. Even a modest decrease (similar to 20%) in abundance of several ant species, including the numerically dominant Lasius neoniger Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), significantly reduced sentinel prey removal rates. Our results suggest that ants disproportionately contribute to ground-based predation of arthropod prey in grasslands. Changes in the amount of grasslands on the landscape and its management may have important implications for ant prevalence and natural prey suppression services in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The 'ecosystem service scarcity path' to forest recovery: a local forest transition in the Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Andean forests decreased in area over the past decade, and communities throughout the Andes are experiencing environmental degradation and soil fertility loss. But amid deforestation, forests returned to some Andean regions, producing local 'forest transitions', or net increases in forest cover. The mechanisms that drive these local transitions - often in part the actions of residents - are still little studied, but hold key information for creating successful forest and landscape restoration interventions. This paper investigates cloud forest cover dynamics in Intag, a region in northwest Andean Ecuador where people were actively reforesting by planting trees. We used remote sensing analysis of LANDSAT imagery (from 1991, 2001, and 2010) and household surveys and oral histories with residents of four communities. Results from remote sensing show that prior to reforestation projects (before 2001), deforestation rates were high (> 3%/year). But from 2001 to 2010 forest recovery surpassed deforestation - a local forest transition (net 3% forest cover). But although deforestation rates slowed precipitously (< 2%) people continued to clear forests in the highlands even as forests regrew around communities. This change in clearing rates and spatial redistribution of forest cover reflects people's reasons for planting trees - to restore water and other key ecosystem services perceive to be 'scarce'. The results point to a new 'path' by which forest transitions occur - the ecosystem service scarcity path - in which local demand for forest ecosystem services drive forest recovery.

TI  - Developing a New Spectral Index for Detecting Cadmium-Induced Stress in Rice on a Regional Scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In natural farmland ecosystems, cadmium (Cd) pollution in rice has attracted increasing attention because of its high toxicity, relative mobility, and high water solubility. This study aims to develop a spectral index for detecting Cd stress in rice on a regional scale. Three experimental sites are selected in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. The hyperspectral data, chlorophyll (Chl) content, leaf area index, average leaf angle, Cd concentration in soil, and Sentinel-2A images from 2017 and 2018 are collected. A new spectral index sensitive to Cd stress in rice is established based on the global sensitivity analysis of the radiative transfer model PROSPECT + SAIL (commonly called PROSAIL) model with the auxiliary of the field-measured data. The heavy metal Cd stress-sensitive spectral index (HCSI) is devised as an indicator of the degree of Cd stress in rice. Results indicate that (1) the HCSI developed based on Chl is a good indicator of rice damage caused by Cd stress, that is, low values of HCSI occur in rice subject to relatively high pollution; (2) compared with common spectral indices, such as red-edge position and red-edge Chl index, HCSI is more sensitive to Chl content with higher Pearson correlation coefficients with respect to Chl content, ranging from 0.85 to 0.95; (3) HCSI is successfully applied in Sentinel-2A images from the two different years of monitoring rice Cd stress on a regional scale. Cd stress levels in rice stabilized, and the largest area percentage of each pollution levels of Cd decreased in the following order: No pollution (i.e., 40%), low pollution (i.e., 35%), and high pollution (i.e., 25%). This study indicates that a combination of simulation data from the PROSAIL model and measured data appears to be a promising method for establishing a sensitivity spectral index to heavy metal stress, which can accurately detect regional Cd stress in crops.

TI  - Oncoplastic technique using a lateral mammary adipofascial flap for the breast-conserving reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving satisfactory cosmetic results after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) can be difficult for breast cancer patients with large tumors. To avoid breast asymmetries and deformation, we present a case of breast reconstruction after BCS with a lateral mammary adipofascial flap, which was dissociated along the sentinel lymph node biopsy incision. During the procedure, the pedicled flap was transferred into the residual tumor cavity through a tunnel between them and then matched the residual cavity. The sufficient blood supply of the transferred flap was observed in ultrasound at follow-up. The operative is straightforward to perform and less invasive. No operative complications were observed. The cosmetic results were found to be good with a natural shape, volume, and symmetry, and with which the patient has reported high satisfaction. This procedure offers a new possibility in breast reconstruction and is worth considering as a new option for immediate repair after BCS.

TI  - Cloud-based typhoon-derived paddy rice flooding and lodging detection using multi-temporal Sentinel-1&2
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice production in China's coastal areas is frequently affected by typhoons, since the associated severe storms, with heavy rain and the strong winds, lead directly to the rice plants becoming flooded or lodged. Long-term flooding and lodging can cause a substantial reduction in rice yield or even destroy the harvest completely. It is therefore urgent to obtain accurate information about paddy rice flooding and lodging as soon as possible after the passing of the storm. This paper proposes a workflow in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping the flooding and lodging area of paddy rice in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang, following super typhoon Maria (Typhoon No.8 in 2018). First, paddy rice in the study area was detected by multi-temporal Sentinel-1 backscatter data combined with Sentinel-2-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Random Forests (RFs) algorithm. High classification accuracies were achieved, whereby rice detection accuracy was calculated at 95% (VH + NDVI-based) and 87% (VV + NDVI-based). Secondly, Change Detection (CD) based Rice Normalized Difference Flooded Index (RNDFI) and Rice Normalized Difference Lodged Index (RNDLI) were proposed to detect flooding and lodged paddy rice. Both RNDFI and RNDLI were tested based on four different remote sensing data sets, including the Sentinel-1-derived VV and VH back-scattering coefficient, Sentinel-2-derived NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Overall agreement regarding detected area between the each two different data sets was obtained, with values of 79% to 93% in flood detection and 64% to 88% in lodging detection. The resulting flooded and lodged paddy rice maps have potential to reinforce disaster emergency assessment systems and provide an important resource for disaster reduction and emergency departments.

TI  - An Online Deep Convolutional Model of Gross Primary Productivity and Net Ecosystem Exchange Estimation for Global Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a universal data-driven model to acquire FLUXNET-consistent annual forest gross primary productivity and net ecosystem exchange globally. The model is developed based on a deep-learning network with a time series of seven ecological and climatic parameters as inputs. To avoid tedious data downloading for large-area studies, we build this model on the Google earth engine platform with all of the input data available online. A multidimensional convolutional block is adopted to detect meaningful variation patterns between forest growth and the environment. The patterns are then encoded and adjusted with forest attributes to obtain the final estimation through a multilayer perceptron. This special working mechanism enables the model to understand and adapt to different modes of forest carbon dynamics. The new model behaves more like a human than conventional machine-learning models, which directly retrieve estimations from raw input variables. Multistep transfer learning is implemented to make the model robust to a large portion of data gaps and to obtain a balanced performance for different climates and ecological zones. The experimental results demonstrate that the model can achieve estimations that are highly consistent with the FLUXNET records. By visualizing the activation outputs of intermediate layers in the convolutional block, we show that the model can reasonably reflect key influence factors in different periods of a year for various forest types. This result means that we may be able to better understand forest carbon absorption by learning how this model works to obtain correct estimations.

TI  - Impacts and Contributors of Representativeness Errors of In Situ Albedo Measurements for the Validation of Remote Sensing Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of remote sensing albedo products involves comparisons between point-scale in situ observations and footprint-scale satellite retrievals. However, the observed differences between product and in situ observations are not only attributable to intrinsic errors of satellite products but also to inadequate spatial representativeness of in situ observations. Here, representativeness errors of in situ observations and their effects on validation results were quantitatively explored. Furthermore, the contributors and their influences on representativeness errors were quantified. In the case of large representativeness errors, validation result errors are mainly controlled by representativeness errors. When representativeness errors are small, validation result errors are likely affected by other factors and can be so large that cannot be ignored. Surface heterogeneity is most positively related to representativeness errors, followed by the deviation distance of in situ site from the pixel center. The representative area surrounding in situ sites only shows a weak negative correlation with representativeness errors. The range seems to be not a good indicator of spatial representativeness of in situ sites since there is almost no relationship between them. When these factors are combined, surface heterogeneity contributes more to representativeness errors on the 500-m pixel scale, while quantitative impacts of the representative area and location deviation of in situ sites are not fully understood because magnitudes of these effects are dependent on the choice of high-resolution data set. These findings enhance our understanding about spatial representativeness of in situ observations and improve the quality of validation results based on single in situ observations.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA stress signalling protects the nuclear genome
T2  - NATURE METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The mammalian genome comprises nuclear DNA (nDNA) derived from both parents and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that is maternally inherited and encodes essential proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation. Thousands of copies of the circular mtDNA are present in most cell types that are packaged by TFAM into higher-order structures called nucleoids(1). Mitochondria are also platforms for antiviral signalling(2) and, due to their bacterial origin, mtDNA and other mitochondrial components trigger innate immune responses and inflammatory pathology(2,3). We showed previously that cytoplasmic release of mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway resulting in interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression that promotes antiviral immunity(4). Here, we find that persistent mtDNA stress is not associated with basally activated NF-kappa B signalling or interferon gene expression typical of an acute antiviral response. Instead, a specific subset of ISGs that includes Parp9 remains activated by the unphosphorylated form of ISGF3 that enhances nDNA damage and repair responses. In cultured primary fibroblasts and cancer cells, the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin causes mtDNA damage and release, which leads to cGAS-STING-dependent ISG activation. In addition, mtDNA stress in TFAM-deficient mouse melanoma cells produces tumours that are more resistant to doxorubicin in vivo. Finally, Tfam(+/-) mice exposed to ionizing radiation exhibit enhanced nDNA repair responses in spleen. Therefore, we propose that damage to and subsequent release of mtDNA elicits a protective signalling response that enhances nDNA repair in cells and tissues, suggesting that mtDNA is a genotoxic stress sentinel.

TI  - Sub-Annual Calving Front Migration, Area Change and Calving Rates from Swath Mode CryoSat-2 Altimetry, on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the time-variable calving front location (CFL) of Antarctic ice shelves is important for estimating the freshwater budget, as an indicator of changing ocean and structural conditions or as a precursor of dynamic instability. Here, we present a novel approach for deriving regular and consistent CFLs based on CryoSat-2 swath altimetry. The CFL detection is based on the premise that the shelf edge is usually characterized by a steep ice cliff, which is clearly resolved in the surface elevation data. Our method applies edge detection and vectorization of the sharp ice edge in gridded elevation data to generate vector shapefiles of the calving front. To show the feasibility of our approach, we derived a unique data set of ice-front positions for the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) between 2011 and 2018 at a 200 m spatial resolution and biannual temporal frequency. The observed CFLs compare well with independently derived ice front positions from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery and are used to calculate area change, advance rates, and iceberg calving rates. We measure an area increase of 810 +/- 40 km(2) a(-1) for FRIS and calving rates of 9 +/- 1 Gt a(-1) and 7 +/- 1 Gt a(-1) for the Filchner and Ronne Ice Shelves, respectively, which is an order of magnitude smaller than their steady-state calving flux. Our findings demonstrate that the "elevation-edge" method is complementary to standard CFL detection techniques. Although at a reduced spatial resolution and less suitable for smaller glaciers in steep terrain, it enables to provide CFLs at regular intervals and to fill existing gaps in time and space. Moreover, the method simultaneously provides ice thickness, required for mass budget calculation, and has a degree of automation which removes the need for heavy manual intervention. In the future, altimetry data has the potential to deliver a systematic and continuous record of change in ice shelf calving front positions around Antarctica. This will greatly benefit the investigation of environmental forcing on ice flow and terminus dynamics by providing a valuable climate data record and improving our knowledge of the constraints for calving models and ice shelf freshwater budget.

TI  - A Method for Road Network Extraction from High-Resolution SAR Imagery Using Direction Grouping and Curve Fitting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads are an important recognition target in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image interpretation. Although a considerable number of high-quality SAR images are now available, the method of road extraction is lagging. To extract the road network with low missed and false rates, this paper proposed a road network extraction approach which includes line detection, road segmentation, road network extraction and optimization. First, the linear feature response and direction map are obtained from the SAR intensity image using the multiplicative Duda operation. Then, the backscattering coefficient and coefficient of variation are combined using a support vector machine to eliminate the linear structures of non-roads, and the binary image of road candidates is subsequently achieved by morphological profiles of path openings. Next, with the obtained direction map, a novel thinning method based on binary image decomposition and curve fitting is presented to obtain line segments of the road network. Finally, a series of measures which involve overlap, continuity, and junction optimization are proposed to construct the road network. In the experiments, the proposed method was applied to Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X high-resolution images. The experimental results showed that the proposed method had an excellent performance in terms of both completeness and correctness.

TI  - Mapping and analyzing China's wetlands using MODIS time series data
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gathering accurate information on wetland distribution and changes is of key importance for wetland management. However, wetland mapping using single-date imagery is challenging due to high seasonal and intra-annual hydrodynamic variations, especially for seasonal wetlands. Although time series of satellite images are effective for improving the accuracy of land cover mapping, they have been rarely employed in large-scale wetland mapping. In this study, we used MODIS time series data at 250-m resolution to develop China's wetland maps, and we analyzed the changes from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that: (1) The method yields good results; the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of all wetland maps for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were above 80% and 0.79, respectively. (2) In 2015, the total area of wetlands in China was 5.37 x 10(5) km(2). Paddy fields accounted for more than 60% of the wetlands, and these fields were mainly located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Northeast China. Less than 40% were natural wetlands, which were mainly located in the Tibetan Plateau, Northwest China, and Northeast China. Seasonal marshes were mainly located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. (3) From 2000 to 2015, wetland area decreased by 2.50 x 10(4) km(2). Among all wetlands, permanent marshes are the most degraded and seasonal wetlands the most fragile. This is a major cause for concern. This study proposes a method to automatically generate large-scale wetlands maps, which could contribute immensely to nationwide wetland monitoring and protection.

TI  - Robust Line Detection of Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Based on Vector Radon Transformation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Line detection on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is still challenging due to the existence of strong speckles. This article proposes a novel line detection method for SAR images based on vector Radon transform (VRT). First, the ratio of exponentially weighted averages operator is determined to calculate the edge map. Then, the VRT is proposed to transform the edge map into the parameter map and decompose the parameter map along the angle of projection into two mutually perpendicular components, i.e., parallel component and vertical component, which strips off part of the random edge information and ensures the sharpness of the peaks (local extremum). Peaks are detected in the parallel component. Finally, the intersection analysis technique is adopted to remove the redundant lines. Experiments are carried out with six amplitude-format SAR images of various bands, resolutions, and polarizations from Chinese airborne SAR systems, GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite, and TerraSAR-X satellite. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method. Furthermore, a road edge detection scheme is designed based on the proposed line detection method. The experimental results of the road edge detection further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and show its potential for practical use.

TI  - Classifying Forest Dominant Trees Species Based on High Dimensional Time-Series NDVI Data and Differential Transform Methods
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring the accuracy of forest trees species recognition based on remote sensing spectral detail information has strong practical significance and value in forestry resources monitoring and management, which is also an important scientific issue to be settled. The time-series remotely sensed data with high resolution can distinguish small canopy spectrum variation caused by different phenological growth characteristics of different forest tree species effectively, which is expected to solve the common problem of the isomorphism in multispectral recognition of tree species. To clarify this situation, we study the Wangyedian forest farm in Chifeng of Inner Mongolia, northeast China, by using a total of 36 scenes covering the whole year medium-high resolution satellite observations (at 16 m spatial resolution) which were supported with GF-1 WFV (wide field view) to extract various time series of NDVI reflectance data. The data contain all the seasonal phases and phenological growth stages of different tree species and are propitious for the fine recognition of forest types. Five dominant forest types of Pinus tubulueformis Larix gmelinii Populus duvidiana, Betula platyphylla, and Quercus rnongolica forest were classified and recognized using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier at different time scales (single season, every quarter, month-to-month and every ten-days). We also explore the effects of different time scales of NDVI reflectance data and differential transformation methods on the recognition of regional forest dominant tree species, based on the original sequence spectrum and the first, second and third order differential transformation, respectively. The results showed that Autumn is the best single season to identify the dominant tree species in the study area (p<0. 05), and the largely improved recognition accuracy of forest tree species can be obtained from different time series data than single season data across all different seasons (p<0. 05). Compared with the single data of spring, summer and autumn, the overall accuracy (OA) based on the every quarter data improved, which increased by 7. 67%, 6. 64% and 3. 6% respectively, indicating the importance of phenological information contained in time series data images for discriminating different forest types. Besides, the results of spectral recognition based on month-to-month and every quarter data were significantly lower than those based on every ten-days and every quarter (p<0. 05), and the spectrum recognition results based on the whole seasonal phase were the lowest in these time series data (p<0. 05), which showed that the denser time series spectral information is more beneficial to the improvement of the accuracy of regional tree species identification (p<0. 05). In addition, combined appropriately with spectrum differential transformation increased classification accuracy using time series multispectral imagery (p<0. 05), for the overall accuracy of tree species created with the combined data was higher than that from results of time series NDVI spectral alone in the study area. After combined with the optimal spectrum differential transformation method, the best overall accuracies occurred in every ten-days and month-to-month data were 82. 1% and 78. 74%, and the corresponding rates of increase reached 3. 38% and 2. 95%, respectively. The results indicated that adding spectral derivative analysis was more effective in improving the tree species recognition accuracy from every ten-days to month-to-month time series NDVI data (p<0.05), which provided an effective reference and foundation for related researches focusing on fine recognition of forest types with multispectral remote sensing.

TI  - An increase in nighttime light detected for protected areas in mainland China based on VIIRS DNB data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas, a globally accepted conservation strategy, play a fundamental role in biodiversity and species conservation. There are increasing concerns about the ecological influence of nighttime light within protected areas due to the emergence of more light-related ecological issues. Previous approaches for detecting nighttime light mainly used the traditional data source released by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), but its coarse spatial resolution and limited radiometric resolution dramatically hamper prompt detection. In this study, we used data from a new source, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day-Night Band (VIIRS DNB) to detect nighttime light disturbance within protected areas of mainland China. Protected areas extracted from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI-TIRS) images served as ground truths to assess detection accuracy. We found that the VIIRS DNB data provided more and better details compared with the traditional DMSP/OLS data. Pixel-based trend analysis clearly indicated that within the protected areas lighted pixels existed extensively and increased significantly from 2012 to 2017. This study provides a new solution to better understand human activities within protected areas.

TI  - Satellite Altimetry and Tide Gauge Observed Teleconnections between Long-Term Sea Level Variability in the US East Coast and the North Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising sea levels amplify the threat and magnitude of storm surges in coastal areas. The U.S. east coast region north of Cape Hatteras has shown a significant sea level rise acceleration and is believed to be a "hot-spot" for accelerating tidal flooding. To better understand the forcing mechanism of long-term regional sea level change, in order to more efficiently implement local sea level rise adaptation and mitigation measures, this work investigated the teleconnections between low-frequency sea level variability in the coastal region north of Cape Hatteras and the subpolar/tropical North Atlantic Ocean by using tide gauge measurements, satellite altimetry data and a sea level reconstruction dataset. The correlation analysis demonstrates that the tide-gauge measured sea level variability in the area north of Cape Hatteras is highly and positively correlated with that observed by satellite altimetry in the subpolar and tropical North Atlantic between 1993 and 2002. Over the following decade (2003-2012), the phase of the teleconnection in the subpolar region was reversed and the spatio-temporal correlation in the tropical North Atlantic was enhanced. Furthermore, the positive correlation in the region north of Cape Hatteras's near shore area is strengthened, while the negative correlation in the Gulf Stream front region is weakened. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which affect variations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Gulf Stream, were shown to have significant impacts on the decadal changes of the teleconnections. Coherent with satellite altimetry data, the reconstructed sea level dataset in the 20th century exhibits similar spatial correlation patterns with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indices.

TI  - A time-series classification approach based on change detection for rapid land cover mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-Use/Land-Cover Time-Series Classification (LULC-TSC) is an important and challenging problem in terrestrial remote sensing. Detecting change-points, dividing the entire time series into multiple invariant sub-sequences, and classifying the subsequences can improve LULC classification efficiency. Therefore, we have proposed a Time-Series Classification approach based on Change Detection (TSCCD) for rapid LULC mapping that uses the Prophet algorithm to detect the ground-cover change-points and perform time-series segmentation in a time dimension and the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm to classify the sub-time series. Since we can assume that the ground cover remains unchanged in each subsequence, only one time-training sample selection and one LULC classification are needed, which greatly improves the work efficiency. Prophet can accurately detect large and subtle changes, capture change direction and change rate, and is strongly robust for handling noise and missing data. DTW is mainly used to improve the accuracy of time-series classification and to resolve the time misalignment problems of ground-cover series data caused by irregular observations or missing values. The results of comparative experiments with BFAST, LandTrendR, and CCDC using simulated time-series showed that TSCCD can detect large and subtle changes and capture change direction and change rate, performing substantially better than the other three contrasting algorithms overall in time-series change detection. Finally, the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) time-series images of Wuhan City from 2000 to 2018 were selected for TSCCD, and the results of China's national land-use surveys in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2015 were used for cross-validation. The results showed that the classification accuracy of each tested subsequence was higher than 90% and that most Kappa coefficients were greater than 0.9. This means that the proposed TSCCD approach can effectively solve real LULC-TSC problems and has high application value. It can be used for large-area, long time-series LULC classification, which is of great guiding significance for studying global environmental changes, forest-cover changes, and conducting land-use surveys.

AB  - Aim: To characterize the epidemiology of appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma. Methods: Prognostic factors were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. The results were used to generate a nomogram. Results: The incidence of appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma showed a significant upward trend. Multivariate Cox analysis identified 11 independent prognostic factors. The nomogram was based on independent risk factors that were significant in multivariate Cox analysis, and the concordance-index for overall survival and cancer-specific survival were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71-0.79) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70-0.79), respectively. Conclusion: Advanced age, single relationship status, male sex, black race, the presence of distant and regional lymph node metastases, poor differentiation or lack of differentiation, advanced SEER extent of disease, cancer-directed surgery and chemotherapy were independently associated with prognosis.

TI  - Application of UAV-Based Multi-angle Hyperspectral Remote Sensing in Fine Vegetation Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain a high-accuracy vegetation classification of high-resolution UAV images, in this paper, a multi-angle hyperspectral remote sensing system was built using a six-rotor UAV and a Cubert S185 frame hyperspectral sensor. The application of UAV-based multi-angle remote sensing in fine vegetation classification was studied by combining a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for multi-angle remote sensing and object-oriented classification methods. This method can not only effectively reduce the classification phenomena that influence different objects with similar spectra, but also benefit the construction of a canopy-level BRDF. Then, the importance of the BRDF characteristic parameters are discussed in detail. The results show that the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the vertical observation reflectance based on BRDF extrapolation (BRDF_0 degrees) (63.9%) was approximately 24% higher than that based on digital orthophoto maps (DOM) (39.8%), and kappa using BRDF_0 degrees was 0.573, which was higher than that using DOM (0.301); a combination of the hot spot and dark spot features, as well as model features, improved the OA and kappa to around 77% and 0.720, respectively. The reflectance features near hot spots were more conducive to distinguishing maize, soybean, and weeds than features near dark spots; the classification results obtained by combining the observation principal plane (BRDF_PP) and on the cross-principal plane (BRDF_CP) features were best (OA = 89.2%, kappa = 0.870), and especially, this combination could improve the distinction among different leaf-shaped trees. BRDF_PP features performed better than BRDF_CP features. The observation angles in the backward reflection direction of the principal plane performed better than those in the forward direction. The observation angles associated with the zenith angles between -10 degrees and -20 degrees were most favorable for vegetation classification (solar position: zenith angle 28.86 degrees, azimuth 169.07 degrees) (OA was around 75%-80%, kappa was around 0.700-0.790); additionally, the most frequently selected bands in the classification included the blue band (466 nm-492 nm), green band (494 nm-570 nm), red band (642 nm-690 nm), red edge band (694 nm-774 nm), and the near-infrared band (810 nm-882 nm). Overall, the research results promote the application of multi-angle remote sensing technology in vegetation information extraction and provide important theoretical significance and application value for regional and global vegetation and ecological monitoring.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature Using Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Over Heterogeneous Landscapes in Wuhan, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deficiency of fine-resolution satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) has impeded the meticulous exploration of the urban thermal environment at micro spatial scales. Although the LST downscaling methods are well-documented, the scale dependence between LST and environmental factors has been rarely considered in the regression establishment. This article proposes a new method (MGWRK) coupling multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) and area-to-point kriging (ATPK) to generate fine-resolution LST maps over heterogeneous landscapes. Technically, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and albedo are selected using random forests (RF) as scale factors. First, the spatial and temporal robustness of MGWRK is evaluated by downscaling aggregated Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor images (1000-m) into finer resolutions of 500, 400, 300, 200, and 100-m in different seasons (spring, summer, and winter). Results reveal that MGWRK is superior to GWR and DisTrad methods for spatial details improvement (SSIM > 0.93) and LST fidelity (> 0.91) under all scales and in the seasons. Second, MGWRK is utilized to downscale the synchronous 1000-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST map into 100-m. The quantitative and qualitative result substantiates that MGWRK obtains ideal performance when applied on MODIS data with few LST distortion (RMSE = 1.607 K) and obvious spatial information enrichment (SSIM = 0.903).

TI  - Surface meltwater runoff on the Greenland ice sheet estimated from remotely sensed supraglacial lake infilling rate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface runoff constitutes a large percentage of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss at present but is difficult to measure directly. This study provides a novel method to estimate surface runoff through remote sensing of supraglacial lake volumes. Because terminal, non-draining (consistently expanding during the melt season) lakes impound runoff from their surrounding contributing catchments, such changes reflect runoff produced within the catchment. To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments (similar to 10 km(2)) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8-31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 - 123%. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 - 55%. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance.

TI  - On the value of corner reflectors and surface models in InSAR precise point positioning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To correctly interpret the estimated displacements in InSAR point clouds, especially in the built environment, these need to be linked to real-world structures. This requires the accurate and precise 3D positioning of each point. Artificial ground control points (GCPs), such as corner reflectors, serve this purpose, but since they require efforts and resources, there is a need for criteria to assess their usefulness. Here we evaluate the value and necessity of using GCPs for different scenarios, concerning the required efforts, and compare this to alternatives such as digital surface models (DSM) and advanced (geo) physical corrections. We consider single-epoch as well as multi-epoch GCP deployment, reflect on the number of GCPs required in relation to the number of SAR data acquisitions, and compare this with digital surface models of different quality levels. Analyzing the geolocation performance using TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 data, we evaluate the pros and cons of various deployment options and show that the multi-epoch deployment of a GCP yields optimal geolocalization results in terms of precision, accuracy, and reliability.

TI  - Surface Deformation from Sentinel-1A InSAR: Relation to Seasonal Groundwater Extraction and Rainfall in Central Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting groundwater for agricultural, aquacultural, and industrial use in central Taiwan has caused large-scale land subsidence that poses a threat to the operation of the Taiwan High Speed Railway near Yunlin County. We detected Yunlin subsidence using the Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) by the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) method from April 2016 to April 2017. We calibrated the initial InSAR-derived displacement rates using GPS measurements and reduced the velocity difference between the two sensors from 15.0 to 8.5 mm/a. In Yunlin's severe subsidence regions, cumulative displacements from InSAR and GPS showed that the dry-season subsidence contributed 60%-74% of the annual subsidence. The InSAR-derived vertical velocities matched the velocities from leveling to better than 10 mm/a. In regions with few leveling measurements, InSAR increased the spatial resolution of the vertical velocity field and identified two previously unknown subsidence spots over an industrial zone and steel factory. Annual significant subsidence areas (subsidence rate > 30 mm/a) from leveling from 2011 to 2017 increased with the declining dry-season rainfalls, suggesting that the dry-season rainfall was the deciding factor for land subsidence. A severe drought in 2015 (an El Nino year) dramatically increased the significant subsidence area to 659 km(2). Both InSAR and leveling detected similarly significant subsidence areas in 2017, showing that InSAR was an effective technique for assessing whether a subsidence mitigation measure worked. The newly opened Hushan Reservoir can supply surface water during dry seasons and droughts to counter rain shortage and can thereby potentially reduce land subsidence caused by groundwater extraction.

TI  - Capability of <i>Fengyun-3D</i> Satellite in Earth System Observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - From the viewpoint of earth system science, this paper discusses the observation capability of the second-generation of Chinese polar-orbiting, sun-synchronous operational meteorological satellite observation systems, Fengyun-3 (FY-3), based on the function and performance test results from the FY-3D satellite observation system in orbit. The FY-3 series of satellites have numerous remote sensing instruments and a wide range of imaging and sounding electromagnetic spectrometers onboard. These instruments can obtain reflectivity data for land surface, soil, vegetation, water body, snow cover, ocean color, and sea ice on earth's surface over a wide spectral range, as well as information on the absorption and scattering radiative transfer of molecules and particles (clouds and aerosols) in earth's atmosphere. All of these data can be used to retrieve physical and chemical information about the land, ocean, and atmosphere of the earth system. Comprehensive observation of the earth system by the FY-3 meteorological satellites is preliminarily realized.

TI  - Simple prosthesis versus prosthesis plus titanium-coated polypropylene mesh for implant-based immediate breast reconstruction after total mastectomy for breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Our study compares the cosmetic effects, postoperative complications, and quality of life of immediate breast reconstruction with simple prosthesis or prosthesis plus titanium-coated polypropylene mesh (TCPM) after total mastectomy for breast cancer.Methods: In total, 69 patients who underwent total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and immediate prosthetic breast reconstruction from January 2015 to December 2018 in our hospital were selected, and their cosmetic effects, complications, and quality of life after reconstruction were recorded immediately after surgery and 6 months after surgery.Results: Of these 69 patients, 29 were in the simple prosthesis group and 40 in the prosthesis + TCPM group. The incidence of surgical complications was 17.2% in the simple prosthesis group (5/29; including 4 cases of capsular contracture and 1 case of infection) 15.0% in the prosthesis + TCPM group (6/40; 1 case of flap necrosis, 2 cases of poor wound healing, 2 cases of hematomas, and 1 case of inadequate blood supply to nipple). The complications were successfully managed after symptomatic treatment in both groups. No prosthesis loss was noted. The incidence of postoperative complications showed there to be no significant differences between these two groups (P=0.06, chi(2)=0.80). The satisfaction rate of patients on cosmetic effects was 95.0% (38/40) in the prosthesis + TCPM group, significantly higher than that in the simple prosthesis group (75.90%, 22/29) (P=0.05, chi(2)=3.87). The quality of life in the simple prosthesis group at 2 weeks and six months after the operation was significantly lower than that in the prosthesis + TCPM group. The incidence rate of arm pain and fatigue at 2 weeks after operation was significantly higher than that in the prosthesis + TCPM group (P=0.04, chi(2)=4.42). The satisfaction of family life and sexual interest 6 months after the operation was also significantly lower in the simple prosthesis group than in the prosthesis + TCPM group (P=0.03, chi(2)=4.95).Conclusions: Breast reconstruction with prosthesis combined with TCPM does not increase surgical complications and has a good cosmetic effect and high patient satisfaction. Thus, it is a safe and reconstruction method.

T2  - SELCUK UNIVERSITESI TURKIYAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-SELCUK UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN TURCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The language as a unique entity of human being is the most important reflector and carrier of culture from past to future. Language carries traces of the geography and the nation that lives on this geography. It is possible to have an idea about nation's lifestyle, worldview and their culture by looking at the vocabulary of language. Change on the vocabulary means the change on lifestyle, the way of perceiving the world and the culture. Every element comes into use in daily life brings new voices to the vocabulary, and every element that comes out of our life causes the words corresponding to it to extinct. Turkish word "saban" [plow] is one of the most typical example of this situation. As a tool for soil cultivation, the plow has been used as a plowing tool in agriculture until recently, but with the development of technology today it has come out of great use and left its place to more mechanical tools. This development has accelerated the process of extinction from the language of our word about plowing and plowing elements. In this context, the Compilation Dictionary [Derleme Skill:gil] prepared by the Turkish Language Institute is an important resource in terms of accommodating the forgotten words which are not used in standard written language today. In this study, after giving information about the etymology of the "saban" and its state in historical and contemporary dialects, the general nomenclature about "saban" in the Anatolian dialects and the lexical about the naming forms related to the basic parts and parts forming the plow (saban) have been tried to be revealed.

TI  - Landslide Detection of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data Based on Deep Learning With Constrains
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and monitoring landslides are hot topics in remote sensing community, particularly with the development of remote sensing technologies and the significant progress of computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, no study focused on deep learning-based methods for landslide detection on hyperspectral images. We proposes a deep learning framework with constraints to detect landslides on hyperspectral image. The framework consists of two steps. First, a deep belief network is employed to extract the spectral-spatial features of a landslide. Second, we insert the high-level features and constraints into a logistic regression classifier for verifying the landslide. Experimental results demonstrated that the framework can achieve higher overall accuracy when compared to traditional hyperspectral image classification methods. The precision of the landslide detection on the whole image, obtained by the proposed method, can reach 97.91%, whereas the precision of the linear support vector machine, spectral information divergence, and spectral angle match are 94.36%, 84.50%, and 86.44%, respectively. Also, this article reveals that the high-level feature extraction system has a significant potential for landslide detection, especially in multi-source remote sensing.

TI  - A Prospective Study of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for Endometrial Cancer: Is It Effective in High-Risk Subtypes?
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The efficacy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for high-risk endometrial cancer remains unclear. This prompted us to evaluate the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and false-negative (FN) rate of cervical injection of indocyanine green (ICG) SLN mapping in patients with endometrial cancer.Materials and Methods This prospective interventional study was performed at a single university teaching hospital. Consecutive patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who underwent laparoscopic surgical staging were included. Cervical injection of ICG and near-infrared SLN identification and biopsy were performed for all study patients followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy, whereas para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients with high-risk histologies. SLN detection rates, sensitivity, NPV, and FN rates were calculated.Results Between July 2016 and July 2018, 131 patients were enrolled. The overall SLN detection rate was 93.1%, with a bilateral detection rate of 61.8%. Four positive SLNs were identified in four patients. Lymph node metastasis was observed in four additional patients without positive SLNs. These four patients belonged to a group of patients with a high-risk subtype. Three of the four patients had isolated para-aortic node metastases. In low-risk endometrial cancers, the sensitivity of the SLN technique to identify nodal metastatic disease was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31.0-100), with an NPV and FN rate of 100% (95% CI 95.1-100) and 0%, respectively. In high-risk endometrial cancers, the sensitivity, NPV, and FN rate were 20% (95% CI 1.0-70.1), 83.3% (95% CI 61.8-94.5), and 80%, respectively.Conclusion Cervical injection of ICG and SLN mapping yielded a low sensitivity and a high FN rate for the identification of node metastasis in endometrial cancer with high-risk histologies.Implications for Practice The efficacy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for high-risk endometrial cancer remains unclear. This study enrolled 131 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who underwent cervical injection of indocyanine green SLN mapping followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The key result was that SLN mapping yielded a low sensitivity and a high false-negative rate for the identification of node metastasis in endometrial cancer with high-risk histologies. The SLN strategy in these patients may increase the risk of missed diagnosis of isolated para-aortic node metastases and seems to be unacceptable in clinical practice.

TI  - Estimation and analysis of along-track attitude jitter of ZiYuan-3 satellite based on relative residuals of tri-band multispectral imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many high-resolution optical satellites suffer from the issue of attitude jitter that restricts the geometric quality and imaging performance. Recently, detection and estimation of spacecraft attitude jitter from imaging sensors has attracted extensive attentions because of its convenience and flexibility. Due to the existence of other impacting factors such as topographic effect, the image-based attitude jitter estimation in the along-track direction is a more challenging task and thus has been less concerned than that in the cross-track direction. This paper proposes a novel along-track jitter estimation method based on relative residuals of tri-band multispectral imagery, which effectively removes the influence of topographic effect and integration time variation. The relative residuals without the influence of topographic information are firstly acquired from a three-line parallax observation system using a precise dense matching scheme with subpixel phase correlation. The influence of integration time variation is analyzed and removed through the specific processing. Finally, the along-track attitude jitter is estimated from the relative residuals according to the harmonic addition theorem in the spatial domain rebuilding method, and by means of Fourier transform and nonlinear optimization in the frequency-domain rebuilding method. Experiments were carried out with ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) multispectral imagery. The comparisons with the conventional method and the attitude measurement data validate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method, and the topographic parallax analysis after distortion correction demonstrates the performance of jitter compensation using the estimated results. in addition, a further multitemporal analysis confirms the discovery of attitude jitter with a new frequency component of around 0.2 Hz in the along-track direction and reveals the varying trends for the along-track attitude jitter of ZY-3 satellite.

TI  - Assessing regional-scale variability in deforestation and forest degradation rates in a tropical biodiversity hotspot
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are major drivers of global environmental change and tropical forests are subjected to unprecedented pressures from both. For most tropical zones, deforestation rates are averaged across entire countries, often without highlighting regional differentiation. There are also very few estimates of forest degradation, either averaged or localized for the tropics. We quantified regional and country-wide changes in deforestation and forest degradation rates for Madagascar from Landsat temporal data (in two intervals, 1994-2002 and 2002-2014). To our knowledge, this is the first country-wide estimate of forest degradation for Madagascar. We also performed an intensity analysis to categorize the magnitude and speed of transitions between forest, vegetation matrix, cultivated land and exposed surface. We found significant regional heterogeneity in deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation rates decreased annually in lowland evergreen moist forest by -0.24% and in all other vegetation zones. Forest degradation rates had annual increases in the same period in lowland evergreen moist forest (0.09%), littoral forest (0.06%) but decreased in medium altitude moist evergreen forest (-0.25%), dry deciduous forest (-0.23%) and scelrophyllous woodland (-0.61%) in the same period. Despite these regional differences, higher rates of deforestation and forest degradation were consistently driven by rapid and large-sized conversions of largely intact forest to cultivated lands and exposed surfaces, most of which occurred between 1994 and 2002. These results suggest that while targeted conservation projects may have reduced forest degradation rates in some areas (e.g. medium altitude moist evergreen forest), the drivers of land cover change remain intense in relatively neglected regions. We advocate a more balanced approach to future conservation initiatives, one recognizing that deforestation and forest degradation, particularly in tropical Africa, are often driven by region-specific conditions and therefore require conservation policies tailored for local conditions.

TI  - Monitoring the Water Quality of Small Water Bodies Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can reinforce the abilities of water resources researchers and decision-makers to monitor water quality more effectively. In the past few decades, remote sensing techniques have been widely used to measure qualitative water quality parameters. However, the use of moderate resolution sensors may not meet the requirements for monitoring small water bodies. Water quality in a small dam was assessed using high-resolution satellite data from RapidEye and in situ measurements collected a few days apart. The satellite carries a five-band multispectral optical imager with a ground sampling distance of 5 m at its nadir and a swath width of 80 km. Several different algorithms were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients for electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved soils (TDS), water transparency, water turbidity, depth, suspended particular matter (SPM), and chlorophyll-a. The results indicate strong correlation between the investigated parameters and RapidEye reflectance, especially in the red and red-edge portion with highest correlation between red-edge band and water turbidity (r(2) = 0.92). Two of the investigated indices showed good correlation in almost all of the water quality parameters with correlation higher than 0.80. The findings of this study emphasize the use of both high-resolution remote sensing imagery and red-edge portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for monitoring several water quality parameters in small water areas.

TI  - Metaheuristic pansharpening based on symbiotic organisms search optimization
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a metaheuristic pansharpening (MP) method, which performs in a Synthetic Variable Ratio (SVR)-like manner. The proposed method introduced the Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) algorithm, an advanced nature-based optimization algorithm, to estimate a weight for each multispectral (MS) band to achieve the optimum intensity. The SVR pansharpening formula was used as the objective function and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric was used as the fitness function of the SOS algorithm to optimize the intensity. The spectral and spatial quality of the results of the MP method were qualitatively and quantitatively compared against those of 15 widely-used pansharpening methods in 5 test sites in Turkey with different land cover features. The experiments aimed to spatially enhance WorldView-2 MS images by using WorldView-2 panchromatic (PAN) bands and a UAV-derived PAN orthophoto. It was also aimed to sharpen IKONOS MS images by using a QuickBird pansharpened image and an IKONOS PAN band. The MATLAB software was used to implement the proposed method and to compute the spatial and spectral quality metrics. The spatial quality of each pansharpened image was evaluated at full-scale, whereas the spectral quality of each pansharpened image was evaluated at both full-scale and reduced-scale. A scoring strategy based on giving a performance score with respect to the spatial and spectral quality metrics was used to ensure a fair comparison among the pansharpening methods used. The results demonstrated that, out of 16 pansharpening methods, the MP method achieved the highest overall spectral and spatial quality scores of 15.5 and 15.5, respectively. The proposed method was found to perform successfully with both singlesensor and multisensor input images. It was also concluded that the proposed method is able to deal with high spatial resolution ratio between the input images.

TI  - Beypazari Houses Within The Context of Traditional Ecological Knowledge
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecology is a field of study that has emerged as one of the sub-research areas of biology. Ecology, which focuses on examining the relationship between all natural beings and their environment, sees nature as a system consisting of harmoniously functioning parts that cannot be considered independent of each other. Culture, on the other hand, is a complex whole that forms the customs, traditions, attitudes and behaviors patterns that the individual and society obtains as a result of their experiences and conveys them to future generations in order to reach the ideal life. The natural environment, then, plays a major role in the realization of all kinds of cultural production. In this sense, ecology has influenced the social sciences that conduct cultural studies from different perspectives. The concept of cultural ecology in social sciences is research areas that study societies' adaptation, evolution, process and verbal, written, material and behavioral productions in this process. Culture maintains all kinds of production it produces within the framework of the traditionally accepted common assumptions. In this context, the approach considered as "traditional ecological knowledge" is all kinds of ideas, discoveries, practices, beliefs and behaviors that societies implement in order to improve the quality of life against all conditions and opportunities of natural environment. Traditional ecological knowledge is therefore an approach to understanding the nature-coordinated cultural creations for folkloristics at the crossroads of social sciences. Traditional ecological knowledge from the perspective of folkloristics is the basic guide of societal worldview or a system of attitudes and behaviors that can be called as folk philosophy or mentality and a constructive, directive and protective interaction. From this perspective, traditional ecological knowledge reveals the causal link between the common attitudes and behaviors of a traditional environment, which is regarded as a community of people who agree to preserve the knowledge they create within themselves. It also has local character. Traditional ecological knowledge is closely related to the research interest of folkloristics, such as folk medicine, folk vet, folk beliefs, folk calendar, folk economy and folk architecture. Traditional architectural knowledge, which has been fixed by trial and error method for many years, is determined and applied according to the geography, climate and material conditions allowed by the ecological environment. The district of Beypazari, chosen as a sampling area, is located in the northwest of Ankara and is suitable for the use of stone, wood, adobe and lime in terms of architectural material. Beypazari has examples with distinctive features of Turkish housing architecture. These houses are not only in terms of materials; in this geography, which is located in an earthquake zone, the measures taken by the traditional construction approach against earthquake are also taken into consideration. Today, while the concrete buildings are destroyed by a slight intensity earthquake, these old buildings, built by the traditional method, stand upright. It is certain that the ecological universe surrounding the local people is also determinant in some practices regarding beliefs. In the construction of some parts of Beypazari houses, the existence of natural environment and beliefs overlapped and enabled some practices to be implemented.The answers to the "why?" and "how" questions about many behaviors in public life are hidden within traditional ecological knowledge.Traditional Beypazari houses reveal the rational solutions of local building masters integrated with nature within the scope of this information. In this article, the impact of traditional ecological knowledge on Beypazari houses in terms of construction materials and methods and related beliefs is evaluated. Literature review, observation and interview methods were used during the research. Based on the data obtained, recommendations are made for the future conservation and sustainability approach of this information.

TI  - Analysis of Thermal Environment by Urban Expansion using KOMPSAT and Landsat 8: Sejong City
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban population growth and consequent rapid urbanization involve some thermal environmental problems in the cities. Monitoring of thermal environments in urban areas such as hot spot analysis is required for effective actions to resolve these problems. This study selected 14 dongs and surrounding administrative districts of Sejong city as study areas and analyzed the characteristics of changes in surface temperature due to the urban expansion in the summer from 2013 to 2018. In the study, the surface temperature distributions in the study areas were plotted using surface temperature values from Landsat 8 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) based on KOMPSAT 2/3 data, and the patterns of surface temperature changes with urban expansion were discussed using the estimated NDVI and NDBI. In particular, the distinct urbanization in the study areas were selected for case studies, and the cause of the changes in the hot spots in the regions was analyzed using high-resolution KOMPSAT images. This study results present that hot spots appeared in urbanized regions within the study areas, and it was plotted that the lower the NDVI values and the higher the NDBI values indicate the temperature values are high. The land surface temperature and satellite-based products were used to divide the study areas into continuously urbanized regions and rapidly urbanized regions and to identify the different characteristics depending on land covers. In the regions with distinct surface temperature changes by urbanization, the analysis using high-resolution KOMPSAT images as presented in this study could provide effective information for urban planning and policy utilization in the future.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data play a major role in supporting knowledge about forest fire by delivering rapid information to map areas damaged. This study, we used 7 Sentinel-2A images to detect change area in forests of Sokcho on April 4, 2019. The process of classify forest fire severity used 7 levels from Sentinel-2A dNBR(differenced Normalized Burn Ratio). In the process of classifying forest fire damage areas, the study selected three areas with high regrowth of vegetation level and conducted a detailed spatial analysis of the areas concerned. The results of dNBR analysis, regrowth of coniferous forest was greater than broad-leaf forest, but NDVI showed the lowest level of vegetation. This is the error of dNBR classification of dNBR. The results of dNBR time series, an area of forest fire damage decreased to a large extent between April 20th and May 3rd. This is an example of the regrowth by developing rare-plants and recovering broad-leaf plants vegetation. The results showed that change area was detected through the change detection of danage area by forest category and the classification errors of the coniferous forest were reached through the comparison of NDVI and dNBR. Therefore, the need to improve the precision Korean forest fire damage rating table accompanied by field investigations was suggested during the image classification process through dNBR.

TI  - A Study of the Intensity of Tropical Cyclone Idai Using Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the intensity and size of a tropical cyclone (TC) is a challenging task, and is important for reducing losses of lives and property. In this study, we use Idai, one of the deadliest TCs on record in the Southern Hemisphere, as an example. Dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission are used to examine the TC structure and intensity. The wind speed is estimated and compared using well known C-band model functions based on calibrated cross-polarization SAR images. Because of the relatively high noise floor of the Sentinel-1 data, wind speeds under 20 m/s from cross-polarization models are ignored and replaced by low to moderate wind speeds retrieved from co-polarization radar signals. Wind fields retrieved from the co- and cross-polarization model results are then merged together to estimate the TC size and the TC fullness scale, a concept related to the wind structure of a storm. Idai has a very strong wind speed and fullness structure, indicating that it was indeed a very intense storm. The approach demonstrates that open and freely available Sentinel-1 SAR data is a unique dataset to estimate the potential destructiveness of similar natural disasters like Idai.

TI  - Ocean surface current retrieval from space: The Sentinel-2 multispectral capabilities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) collects multiple spectral band images, corresponding to specific sensing wavelengths and spatial resolutions, i.e. 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, respectively. Images are collected one at the time with a given time-lag between observations. Under favorable conditions, spatio-temporal characteristics of propagating ocean surface waves can thus uniquely be retrieved. A method for surface current vector field reconstruction is then developed. Demonstrated over different deep ocean regions, the retrieved surface current fields well compare with medium-resolution ocean circulation model or derived-velocities from altimeter measurements. At finer scales, the surface wave-conservation law is recovered, with the associated relationship between current vorticity and wave-ray curvature. Over shallow water regions, the wave propagation properties well follow sea depth variations, consistent with ETOPO1 data. Finally, time-lag between detector bands can also be exploited to estimate speed and direction properties of detected surface wave breaking whitecaps. An analysis of velocity reconstruction errors further reveals that Sentinel-2 MSI inter-channel co-registration is realized with an accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Overall, these results confirm very promising capabilities of optical imagery to provide direct surface current velocity measurements from space, over relatively large areas, O(100 km), with a spatial resolution down to O(1 km).

TI  - Methods to Explore Diverse Soils in the West Caspian Region Using High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images have made it possible to determine dynamic changes in the variety of classification soil units in the West Caspian region with differentiation of functioning soils and ranges of surface deposits. The latter have been conditionally subdivided into the following groups: (a) deposits of soil origin: puff, crustal, and sor-affected solonchaks; (b) deposits of geological origin: outcrops of loose and hard rocks, drained zones of lake bottoms, and water reservoirs, including loose sand; and (c) manmade construction, road, economic, recreational facilities and disturbed land areas. They occupy 10-15% of the total land area and are interpreted by direct transfer to the soil map and by cartographic referencing. The rest of the area (85-90%) is occupied by a soil cover and plant communities which are devoid of interpretation features. A soil salinization scale has been compiled according to the variety of colors of halophytic communities; salt accumulation nature and degree have been specified based on SIs. The increase in resolution, spectral ranges, and other enhancement elements of the Landsat satellite reflect the atmospheric correction of the results obtained in 1978-2007.

T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, new tools have been implemented that merge high-resolution temporal and spatial images for detection of change land cover. With the purpose of evaluate this type of techniques we generated a time series with Landsat satellite imagery and a time series with simulated images Landsat-MODIS, with the purpose of determining which of the two methods provides the best results in the change quantification in the Sabana of Bogota between 2007 and 2013. The processing consists of (i) Time Series with images Landsat trough BFAST, (ii) getting synthetic images through the ESTARFM algorithm; (iii) time series through BFAST with the use of simulated images. In the time series process, the series incorporating synthetic images and images corrected by the gaps generated the best accuracy indexes (global accuracy: 88.16% y Kappa: 76.52%) with respect to the series that incorporated only the images Landsat (global accuracy: 83% y Kappa: 65.18%); it indicates that densification of time series allow to get the best results in the quantification of changes and dynamics of land cover. The methodology applied represents an advance about generation of synthetic images and monitoring and detection of changes in land cover through time series. This is one of the first studies realized in the country that includes this type of process.

TI  - Monitoring the change in land surface temperature and urban areas using Satellite images. Case study Kafr EI-Sheikh City - Egypt
T2  - GEODESY AND CARTOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the rate of urban growth has increased rapidly especially in Egypt, due to the increase in population growth. The Egyptian government has set up new cities and established large factories, roads and bridges in new places to solve this trouble. This paper investigates the change monitoring of land surface temperature, urban and agricultural area in Egypt especially Kafr EL-Sheikh city as case study using high resolution satellite images. Nowadays, satellite images are playing an important role in detecting the change of urban growth. In this paper, cadastral map for Kafr El-Sheikh city with scale 1:5000, images from Landsat 7 with accuracy 30 meters; images from Google Earth with accuracy 0.5 meter; and images from SAS Planet with accuracy 0.5 m are used where all images are available during the study period (for year's 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2017). The analysis has been performed in a platform of Geographical Information System (GIS) configured with Remote Sensing system using ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS Imagine image processing software. From the processing and analysis of the specified images during the studied time period, it is found that the building area was increased by 28.8% from year 2003 up to 2017 from Google Earth images and increased by percentage 34.4% from year 2003 up to year 2017 from supervised Landsat 7 images but for unsupervised Landsat 7 images, the building area was increased by percentage 35.9%. In this study, land surface temperature (LST) was measured also from satellite images for different years through 2003 until 2017. It is deduced that the increase in the building area (urban growth) in the specified city led to increase the land surface temperature (LST) which will affect some agricultural crops. Depending on the results of images analysis, Forecasting models using different algorithms for the urban and agricultural area was built. Finally, it is deduced that integration of spacebased remote sensing technology with GIS tools provide better platform to perform such activities.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes in Doume Communal Forest in eastern Cameroon: implications for conservation and sustainable management
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale identification of land use and land cover change in a tropical forest is a challenge to landscape designers and forest ecologists. Here, Landsat images acquired during the years 2000, 2009, and 2018 were used to assess the spatial-dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) during the last two decades (2000-2018). A classification system composed of six classes-dense forest with (high tree density and low tree density), swampy Raphia forest, swampy flooded forest and savanna were designed as LULC for this study. A maximum likelihood classification was used to classify Landsat images into thematic areas. Elsewhere, Landsat-based LULC mapping, post classification at the per-pixel scales and self-knowledge on the land cover change processes were combined to analyze LULC change, forest loss and change trajectories in Doume Communal Forest in eastern Cameroon. The results show that half of the study area changed in 2000-2009 and that the different types of LULC changes increased and involved more diverse and characteristic trajectories in 2009-2018 compared to 2000-2009. Degradation to a dense forest with low tree density and swampy Raphia forest was dominant, and the forest was mostly lost due to trajectories that involved conversion to agroforestry systems (10%), and a lesser extent due to trajectories that involved deforestation to grasslands (7%). The trajectory analyses did thus contribute to a more comprehensive analysis of LULC change and the drivers of forest loss and, therefore, is essential to improve the sustainable management and support spatial planning of the forest.

TI  - Interaction of Mesoscale and Submesoscale Eddies in the Sea of Okhotsk Based on Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have investigated the interaction between the mesoscale and submesoscale eddies in the deep Kuril Basin of the Sea of Okhotsk. An analysis of the long-term series of satellite altimetry observations (2000-2011) has demonstrated that the circulation in the Kuril Basin is determined by quasi-stationary mesoscale anticyclonic eddies. Based on the QuikSCAT SeaWind scatterometer satellite data, a negative vorticity wind-stress field exists over the deep part of the Sea of Okhotsk in the warm season, which generates anticyclonic circulation composed of mesoscale eddies. An analysis of the satellite infrared images reveals that submesoscale processes determine the interaction of mesoscale eddies with the waters of the zone of intense tidal mixing on the shelf of the Kuril Islands. Submesoscale cyclonic eddies are formed at the fronts of tidal mixing and near the Bussol Strait located in the central part of the Kuril Islands. Applications of Lagrangian analysis have shown that submesoscale eddies move at the periphery of the northern mesoscale eddy within the advective streamer limited by the transport barriers. The formation and destruction of submesoscale eddies caused by horizontal mixing leads to the injection of cold water rich in nutrients from the zone of intense tidal mixing to the deep Kuril Basin. In the summer period, high concentrations of chlorophyll-a are observed in the upper layer of the northeastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk due to the interaction between submesoscale and mesoscale eddies.

TI  - Structure and Dynamics of Waters in the Region of the Shantar Islands National Park (Sea of Okhotsk) Based on the Data of Satellite Observations
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shantar Islands National Park (northwestern shelf of the Sea of Okhotsk) was established to preserve the biological diversity of unique natural marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The water structure and dynamics in the basin of the Shantar Islands has been studied based on the analysis of multisensor satellite images (Terra/Aqua MODIS, Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, Sentinel-2A MSI) and field oceanographic observations. The circulation over the shelf in the Shantar Islands region is strongly determined by strong tidal currents and freshwater discharge. The water structure is formed under the influence of intense local tidal mixing and the propagation of low-saline river plumes in the shallow parts of the main bays of the Shantar archipelago. The interaction of tidal currents with the complex topography and bathymetry (peninsulas, capes, islands, straits, and shallow-water regions of the shelf) leads to a high level of submesoscale activity and the generation of various types of submesoscale structures, including jet currents and eddies.

TI  - An implicit radar convolutional burn index for burnt area mapping with Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with optical sensors, the all-weather and day-and-night imaging ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) makes it competitive for burnt area mapping. This study investigates the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR sensors in burnt area mapping with an implicit Radar Convolutional Burn Index (RCBI). Based on multi temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, a convolutional networks-based classification framework is proposed to learn the RCBI for highlighting the burnt areas. We explore the mapping accuracy level that can be achieved using SAR intensity and phase information for both VV and VH polarizations. Moreover, we investigate the decorrelation of Interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence to wildfire events using different temporal baselines. The experimental results on two recent fire events, Thomas Fire (Dec., 2017) and Carr Fire (July, 2018) in California, demonstrate that the learnt RCBI has a better potential than the classical log-ratio operator in highlighting burnt areas. By exploiting both VV and VH information, the developed RCBI achieved an overall mapping accuracy of 94.68% and 94.17% on the Thomas Fire and Carr Fire, respectively.

TI  - Shoreline evolution in an embayed beach adjacent to tidal inlet: The impact of anthropogenic activities
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Embayed beaches are widely distributed around the world. Their shoreline evolution is controlled primarily by the upstream headland and prevailing wave conditions. Tidal inlets are also ubiquitous in sandy coasts. They are quite dynamic and act as a sediment source or sink, depending on the sediment transport pattern and budget. An embayed beach may develop downstream of a tidal inlet if a protruding headland is formed at the inlet, owing to either natural processes or human construction. In this study, Gaolong Bay, located downstream of a tidal inlet (Qinglan Inlet) in Wenchang City, Hainan Island, China, is used as an example to examine the effects of an upstream tidal inlet on the evolution of an embayed beach. Emphasis is placed on the impact of anthropogenic activities, such as landfilling and jetty construction. Historical remote sensing data were collected, and the evolution of the shoreline from 1998 to 2018 was analyzed. The shoreline change pattern in Gaolong Bay was identified with the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method, and the mechanisms behind these changes were explored with a coupled current-wave-sediment transport modeling system. Our results indicate that the construction of an artificial peninsula and a jetty beside the inlet channel dramatically changed the evolution of the Gaolong Bay shoreline. Defying the classical expectation of shoreline retreat downdrift of a tidal inlet, a clockwise shoreline rotation was prevalent in Gaolong Bay, with the shadow zone accreting and the distal zone retreating, along with an overall shoreline propagation (translation). The static equilibrium shoreline planform model (model of equilibrium of bay beaches [MEPBAYI) was further used to predict the future evolution of the shoreline. This study demonstrates that an embayed beach downdrift of a tidal inlet can exhibit a complex response to human interventions at the inlet and highlights the necessity of considering adjacent shoreline changes when assessing the impact of inlet stabilization.

TI  - From woody cover to woody canopies: How Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data advance the mapping of woody plants in savannas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody vegetation is a central component of savanna ecosystems providing ecosystem services for local livelihoods. Accurate monitoring of woody vegetation in savannas is therefore desirable, yet large scale mapping approaches rely on relatively coarse spatial resolution satellite data, which cannot directly capture the scattered nature of savanna trees. Studies at regional scale thus estimate the fractional cover of woody plants for a given area, whereas binary tree/no-tree estimates are restricted to the use of very high-resolution (VHR) images at local scales. With the launch of the Sentinel satellite systems (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), the spatial resolution of images approaches the size of medium/large tree crowns, providing the opportunity to map the presence/absence of tree canopies, rather than the fraction of woody cover or forested areas. Here, we used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the presence/absence of woody canopies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data at a 10-m spatial resolution for the entire African Sahel. Training samples for the SVM classifier were collected from VHR images provided by Google Earth and Sentinel satellite data were processed in Google Earth Engine. Accuracy assessment was performed based on independent VHR images, showing an overall accuracy of 93% (71% and 98% for producer's accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels, 91% and 93% for user's accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels) when combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (overall accuracy of 89% using Sentinel-1 only and 91% using Sentinel-2 only). The combined use proved to perform significantly better (p < 0.05) than the single use of any of the two. A comparison with existing tree cover maps (by aggregating presence/absence of tree canopies into fractional cover) showed noticeable differences, reflecting the need for new woody cover products adapted to the nature of savanna ecosystems. The Sentinel woody canopy map was able to reproduce the general pattern of scattered woody canopies, but generally overestimated the woody coverage (11.37 26.13% (mean sd) when aggregating to 250 m resolution) due to the 10 x 10-m spatial resolution which exceeds the crown size of a typical savanna tree. The cloud-based Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analysis presented is a step towards large scale mapping of woody canopy (tree/no-tree) in savannas. Ultimately, such direct assessment of woody canopy areas will allow monitoring of temporal dynamics of woody canopies in future studies as Sentinel time-series expands to multiple years.

TI  - Directional and Zonal Analysis of Urban Thermal Environmental Change in Fuzhou as an Indicator of Urban Landscape Transformation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion results in landscape pattern changes and associated changes in land surface temperature (LST) intensity. Spatial patterns of urban LST are affected by urban landscape pattern changes and seasonal variations. Instead of using LST change data, this study analysed the variation of LST aggregation which was evaluated by hotspot analysis to measure the spatial dependence for each LST pixel, indicating the relative magnitudes of the LST values in the neighbourhood of the LST pixel and the area proportion of the hotspot area to gain new insights into the thermal effects of increasing impervious surface area (ISA) caused by urbanization in Fuzhou, China. The spatio-temporal relationship between urban landscape patterns, hotspot locations reflecting urban land cover change in space and the thermal environment were analysed in different sectors. The linear spectral unmixing method of fully constrained least squares (FCLS) was used to unmix the bi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI imagery to derive subpixel ISA and the accuracy of the percent ISA was assessed. Then, a minimum change threshold was chosen to remove random noise, and the change of ISA between 2000 and 2016 was analysed. The urban area was divided into three circular consecutive urban zones in the cardinal directions from the city centre and each circular zone was further divided into eight segments; thus, a total of 24 spatial sectors were derived. The LST aggregation was analysed in different directions and urban segments and hotspot density was further calculated based on area proportion of hotspot areas in each sector. Finally, variations of mean normalized LST (NLST), area proportion of ISA, area proportion of ISA with high LST, and area proportion of hotspot area were quantified for all sectors for 2000 and 2016. The four levels of hotspot density were classified for all urban sectors by proportional ranges of 0%-25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75% and 75%-100% for low-, medium-, sub-high, and high density, and the spatial dynamics of hotspot density between the two dates showed that urbanization mainly dominated in sectors south-southeast 2 (SSE2), south-southwest 2 (SSW2), west-southwest 2 (WSW2), west-northwest 2 (WNW2), north-southwest 2 (NSW2), south-southeast 3 (SSE3) and south-southwest 3 (SSW3). This paper suggests a methodology for characterizing the urban thermal environment and a scientific basis for sustainable urban development.

TI  - Secondary impacts of eutrophication control activities in shallow lakes: Lessons from aquatic macrophyte dynamics in Lake Taihu from 2000 to 2015
T2  - FRESHWATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic macrophytes in lakes and rivers are highly sensitive to changes in water quality and ecological conditions. Satellite remote sensing of aquatic macrophyte distributions can map changes in freshwater ecosystem dynamics. However, macrophyte mapping by remote sensing is challenging in lakes dominated by algal blooms or with high turbidity. In this study, we mapped the composition and distribution of emergent/floating and submerged macrophytes in the large turbid and eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. We used a novel classification method and 16 y of MODIS images to map these data. The inter-annual trends in macrophyte distribution and cover show complex dynamics in this heavily-managed lake. The area occupied by emergent/floating macrophytes increased from 39.3 km(2) in 2000 to 90.3 km(2) in 2015 (a 230% increase), whereas the area dominated by submerged macrophytes decreased from 404.6 km(2) in 2001 to 167.5 km(2) in 2015 (a 59% decrease). We also used the annual date of initial macrophyte occurrence and growth period to examine temporal variation in species composition and biodiversity of macrophytes. Aquatic macrophytes in different parts of the lake responded differently to temporal trends in water quality (Secchi disk and nutrient concentrations), hydrology (water level), and meteorological data (daily temperature, precipitation, and h of sunlight). Changes in lake transparency occurred over the study period, reducing the availability of underwater solar irradiance. Light availability was the most influential local environmental factor for macrophyte dynamics. We also found that eutrophication control projects indirectly reduced lake ecosystem quality in some bays. These control projects included water transfers from the Yangtze River (dilution), aquaculture management actions, macrophyte removal, and dredging. Our findings suggest the species composition and area covered by aquatic macrophytes in this shallow lake are driven by multiple mechanisms. These results highlight that efforts to manage the increase in algal-dominated lake areas require a more complete understanding of the direct and indirect impacts of management activities. We also show that satellite-based remote sensing measurements of macrophyte spatial and temporal dynamics provide a useful indicator to evaluate the impacts of these activities.

TI  - Small baseline InSAR time series analysis: Unwrapping error correction and noise reduction
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - We present a review of small baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis with a new processing workflow and software implemented in Python, named MintPy (https://github.com/insarlab/Mintpy). The time series analysis is formulated as a weighted least squares inversion. The inversion is unbiased for a fully connected network of interfemgrams without multiple subsets, such as provided by modern SAR satellites with small orbital tube and short revisit time. In the routine workflow, we first invert the interferogram stack for the raw phase time-series, then correct for the deterministic phase components: the tropospheric delay (using global atmospheric models or the delay-elevation ratio), the topographic residual and/or phase ramp, to obtain the noise-reduced displacement time-series. Next, we estimate the average velocity excluding noisy SAR acquisitions, which are identified using an outlier detection method based on the root mean square of the residual phase. The routine workflow includes three new methods to correct or exclude phase-unwrapping errors for two-dimensional algorithms: (i) the bridging method connecting reliable regions with minimum spanning tree bridges (particularly suitable for islands), (ii) the phase closure method exploiting the conservativeness of the integer ambiguity of interferogram triplets (well suited for highly redundant networks), and (iii) coherence-based network modification to identify and exclude interferograms with remaining coherent phase-unwrapping errors. We apply the routine workflow to the Galapagos volcanoes using Sentinel-1 and ALOS1 data, assess the qualities of the essential steps in the workflow and compare the results with independent GPS measurements. We discuss the advantages and limitations of temporal coherence as a reliability measure, evaluate the impact of network redundancy on the precision and reliability of the InSAR measurements and its practical implication for interferometric pairs selection. A comparison with another open-source time series analysis software demonstrates the superior performance of the approach implemented in MintPy in challenging scenarios.

TI  - A Review of Regional and Global Gridded Forest Biomass Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest biomass quantification is essential to the global carbon cycle and climate studies. Many studies have estimated forest biomass from a variety of data sources, and consequently generated some regional and global maps. However, these forest biomass maps are not well known and evaluated. In this paper, we reviewed an extensive list of currently available forest biomass maps. For each map, we briefly introduced the data sources, the algorithms used, and the associated uncertainties. Large-scale biomass datasets were compared across Europe, the conterminous United States, Southeast Asia, tropical Africa and South America. Results showed that these forest biomass datasets were almost entirely inconsistent, particularly in woody savannas and savannas across these regions. The uncertainties in biomass maps could be from a variety of sources including the chosen allometric equations used to calculate field data, the choice and quality of remotely sensed data, as well as the algorithms to map forest biomass or extrapolation techniques, but these uncertainties have not been fully quantified. We suggested the future directions for generating more accurate large-scale forest biomass maps should concentrate on the compilation of field biomass data, novel approaches of forest biomass mapping, and comprehensively addressing the accuracy of generated biomass maps.

TI  - Deformation Feature Analysis of Qinghai-Tibet Railway Using TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A Time-Series Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) is the highest plateau artificial facility, connecting Lhasa and Golmud over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Climate change and anthropogenic activities are changing the condition of plateau, with potential influences on the stabilities of QTR. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique could retrieve ground millimeter scale deformation utilizing phase information from SAR images. In this study, the structure and deformation features of QTR are retrieved and analyzed using time-series interferometry with Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X images. The backscattering and coherence features of QTR are analyzed in medium and very high-resolution SAR images. Then, the deformation results from different SAR datasets are estimated and analyzed. Experimental results show that some of the QTR sections undergo serious deformation, with the maximum deformation rate of -20 mm/year. Moreover, the detailed deformation feature in the Beiluhe section has been analyzed as well as the effects of different cooling measurements underline QTR embankment. It is also found that embankment-bridge transition section along QTR is prone to undergo deformation. Our study demonstrates the application potential of high-resolution InSAR in deformation monitoring of QTR.

TI  - Permafrost Deformation Monitoring Along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Engineering Corridor Using InSAR Observations with Multi-Sensor SAR Datasets from 1997-2018
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the highest elevation permafrost region in the world, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) permafrost is quickly degrading due to global warming, climate change and human activities. The Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC), located in the QTP tundra, is of growing interest due to the increased infrastructure development in the remote QTP area. The ground, including the embankment of permafrost engineering, is prone to instability, primarily due to the seasonal freezing and thawing cycles and increase in human activities. In this study, we used ERS-1 (1997-1999), ENVISAT (2004-2010) and Sentinel-1A (2015-2018) images to assess the ground deformation along QTEC using time-series InSAR. We present a piecewise deformation model including periodic deformation related to seasonal components and interannual linear subsidence trends was presented. Analysis of the ERS-1 result show ground deformation along QTEC ranged from -5 to +5 mm/year during the 1997-1999 observation period. For the ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A results, the estimated deformation rate ranged from -20 to +10 mm/year. Throughout the whole observation period, most of the QTEC appeared to be stable. Significant ground deformation was detected in three sections of the corridor in the Sentinel-1A results. An analysis of the distribution of the thaw slumping region in the Tuotuohe area reveals that ground deformation was associated with the development of thaw slumps in one of the three sections. This research indicates that the InSAR technique could be crucial for monitoring the ground deformation along QTEC.

TI  - Automatically Locate Tropical Cyclone Centers Using Top Cloud Motion Data Derived From Geostationary Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel technique for automatically locating tropical cyclone (TC) centers based on top cloud motions in consecutive geostationary satellite images. The high imaging rate and spatial resolution images of the Gaofen-4 geostationary satellite enable us to derive pixel-wise top cloud motion data of TCs, and from the data, TC spiral centers can be accurately determined based on an entirely different principle from those based on static image features. First, a physical motion field decomposition is proposed to eliminate scene shift and TC migration in the motion data without requiring any auxiliary geolocation data. This decomposition does not generate the artifacts that appear in the results of the previously published motion field decomposition. Then, an algorithm of a motion direction-based index embedded in a pyramid searching structure is fully designed to automatically and effectively locate the TC centers. The test shows that the TC concentric motions are more clearly revealed after the proposed motion field decomposition and the located centers are in good agreement with the cloud pattern centers in a visual sense and also with the best track data sets of four meteorological agencies.

TI  - Nomograms for predicting the likelihood of non-sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases may have a low risk of non-SLN metastases. Accurate estimates of the likelihood of additional disease in the non-SLN metastases can avoid many complications mentioned the axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study aims to develop a new model based on Chinese real-world patients to ascertain the likelihood of non-SLN metastases in a breast cancer patient with disease-positive SLN, enabling the surgeons to make a better choice of surgical procedures.Methods: Out of the 470 patients from CSCO Breast Cancer Database collaborated Group, a proportion of 3 (347 cases): 1 (123 cases) was considered for assigning patients to training and validation groups, respectively. Two training models were created to predict the likelihood of having additional, non-SLN metastases in an individual patient. Training model 1 was created with pathological size of the tumor, pathological type, lymphovascular invasion, the number of positive SLNs/number of total SLNs ratio, and the Her-2 status based on multivariable logistic regression (P < .05). Training model 2 was based on the variables in model 1 and age, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, Ki-67 count, menopause status.Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the training model 1 was 0.754, while the area of training model 2 was 0.766. There was no difference between model 1 and model 2 regarding the ROC curve, P=.243. Next, the validation cohort (n =123) was developed to confirm the model l's performance and the ROC curve was 0.703. The nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.754 (95% CI, 0.702-0.807) and 0.703 (95% CI, 0.609-0.796) in predicting the non-SLN metastases in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, with well-fitted calibration curves. The positive and negative predictive values of the nomogram were calculated, resulting in positive values of 59.3% and 48.6% and negative predictive values of 79.7% and 83.0% for the training and validation cohorts, respectively.Conclusion: We developed 2 models that used information commonly available to the surgeon to calculate the likelihood of having non-SLN metastases in an individual patient. The numbers of variables in model 1 were less than in model 2, while model 1 had similar results as model 2 in calculating the likelihood of having non-SLN metastases in an individual patient. Model 1 was more user-friendly nomogram than model 2. Using model 1, the risk for an individual patient having ALND could be determined, which would lead to a rational therapeutic choice.

TI  - The Old Russian Granulation of the 10th and 11th Centuries as a Decorative Art. The Birth of Styles
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The research aims to study the technique of granulation as a kind of a decorative art, which, along with other kinds, characterises a historically important period for the Russian people and state, when the path of Russian political and cultural, including artistic, development was determined. The author compares the development of granulation art with the way of other kinds of a decorative art and considers parallels of Old Russian granulation development with other Slavic peoples' jewel art. The main sources for the research are adornments from Russian hoards and burials and data on the technology of granulation. A review of styles reveals a specific history of granulation art. Style is characterised as a unity of decorative form created by granulation techniques; it may be associated with ideology. The volume-geometric style of the end of the 9th and the first half of the 10th centuries and the partition-figurative style of the first half of the 10th century were based on the unity of technical and decorative properties of miniature metal details: the fitting of the construction of the products from granules and filigree parts; laying of grains on the surface entirely, drawing of a contour by lines. Dimensions of grains and filigree parts are varied (from fractions of a millimeter to 1.0 and 2.0 mm). The unity of filigree and embossing techniques strengthens the decorative role of grains, the spherical shape allows the granules to form geometric elements. In the linear-geometric style of the 10th and early 11th centuries, the role of the granulation line was important; firstly, it was used to divide the composition into zones, then it was used to form borders. Geometric elements were of different sizes. The geometric style of the late 10th and the 11th centuries advanced to equal rhombuses and triangles. An ideal rhythmic ornament was created without any meanings. There is a tendency to a standard grain of D=0.5-0.7 mm. The ornamental arsenal accumulated is claimed in the sculptural and figurative style, which actively developed since the second half of the 11th century. Each ornamental device and technique plays its own role: embossing creates a figured base, granulation details it. Different grain parameters are used again. Anthropomorphic and architectural motifs are created from grains and filigree parts, they tend to a pagan worldview. In the 12th century, the main motif of the Byzantine floral ornament with Christian symbolism (a lily) was laid with grains. As a result, the chronology of styles and the technological basis for their emergence have been identified. The development of geometric ornamentation in grains looks as a parallel to ornamentation development in wood carving, fabric and embroidery. Separate depictive compositions show parallels with cloisonne enamel, niello and embossing. Analogies to products in figurative and geometric styles are found in Moravian and Polish jewelry. Starting with the use of technical qualities in design and decoration, granulation shows its own decorative side, which sometimes overcomes technical restrictions creating figurative and plant motifs, reflecting the main ideological confrontation between pagan and Christian worldviews.

TI  - Plankton community responses to pulsed upwelling events in the southern Taiwan Strait
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used field observations (mapping and time-series observations) and satellite data to investigate the changes of environmental factors and plankton community structure during four pulsed upwelling events in the southern Taiwan Strait (STWS) during August 2004 and July 2005. Based on the surface temperature, salinity, and concentrations of nitrate, oxygen, and chlorophyll a (Chl a), we identified three stages of upwelling: recent, mature, and aged upwelled water. Diatoms and Synechococcus dominated during the first two and third stages of the upwelling, respectively. In recently upwelled water, phytoplankton grew rapidly, and nutrient concentrations were relatively high. Diatoms accounted for >69% of the total Chl a in recently upwelled and mature water. As the upwelled water aged, the phytoplankton community shifted to coexistence of diatoms and Synechococcus. The microzooplankton community was dominated by aloricate ciliates and tintinnids during upwelling, but the abundance of heterotrophic dinoflagellates increased as the upwelled water matured. Microzooplankton grazing reached a maximum during the mature stage and approximately balanced phytoplankton growth in aged, upwelled water. Overall, our study revealed rapid changes in the plankton community during the different stages of upwelling that reflected the complex and dynamic nature of upwelling systems.

TI  - Fusion Methods Evaluation and Classification Suitability Study of Wetland Satellite Imagery
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on HJ-1A HSI data and Landsat-8 OLI data, RS image fusion experiments were carried out using three fusion methods: principal component (PC) transform. Gram Schimdt (OS) transform and nearest neighbor diffusion (NND) algorithm. Four evaluation indexes, namely mean, standard deviation, information entropy and average gradient, were selected to evaluate the fusion results from the aspects of image brightness, clarity and information content. Wetland vegetation was classified by spectral angle mapping (SAM) to find a suitable fusion method for wetland vegetation information extraction. The results show that PC fusion image contains the largest amount of information, GS fusion image has certain advantages in brightness and clarity maintenance, and NND fusion method can retain the spectral characteristics of the image to the maximum extent; among the three fusion methods, PC transform is the most suitable for wetland information extraction. It can retain more spectral information while improving spatial resolution, with classification accuracy of 89.24% and Kappa coefficient of 0.86.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS remote sensing image data, indices including NDVI, WET, NDSI and LST were selected from the aspects of greenness, humidity, dryness and heat respectively, and remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was constructed by principal component analysis to analyze the spatial distribution of ecological environment quality in Poyang Lake area in 2014. The spatial heterogeneity and its influencing factors of the original remote sensing ecological index (RSEI0) were quantitatively analyzed using spatial autocorrelation, semi-variance function, maximum information coefficient, and factor detection. The results showed that ecological environment quality of Poyang Lake area was generally at a moderate level in 2014 and that the overall spatial distribution pattern from southwest to northeast gradually improved. The exploratory spatial data analysis showed that RSEI0 had strong spatial clustering and spatial heterogeneity under the sampling of 2 km grid element. The nugget effect value of RSEI0 was 25.8%, which belonged to medium spatial variability and was mainly affected by structural factors. The results of maximum information coefficient and factor detection analysis showed that slope had the strongest positive correlation with RSEI0. Slope, elevation, curvature, annual average rainfall, annual average temperature, proportion of garden forest area, proportion of cultivated land area, proportion of construction land area, annual average population density and annual average GDP significantly affected RSEI0, but with different magnitude of influences. Among them, the slope independent explanatory power was 57.1%, which was the main factor affecting spatial variation of RSEI0 in Poyang Lake area. Our results could provide reference for the protection and management of ecological environment in the Poyang Lake area.

TI  - Rock mass quality and preliminary analysis of the stability of ancient rock-cut Theban tombs at Sheikh 'Abd el-Qurna, Egypt
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient Theban tombs at the hillside cemetery of Sheikh 'Abd el-Qurna (SAQ), west of Luxor, Egypt, were excavated mainly in the Thebes Limestone Formation and show varying degrees of damage of rock pillars and ceilings. In order to understand the rock mass behaviour in selected tombs and its impact on past failures and current stability, we carried out geological mapping and rock mass quality assessments. Our work provides a geological map and geotechnical evaluation of the rock mass of these SAQ tombs and their surroundings. We mapped and described rock fractures in situ and with remote sensing data, and estimated the rock mass quality of the different members within the Thebes Limestone Formation using the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and Geological Strength Index (GSI) systems. In addition, we conducted a rock pillar analysis. Analyses and mapping were supported by new high-resolution terrain models computed from ground-based and aerial photogrammetry and from terrestrial laser scanning. Our analyses show that the tombs at SAQ have been cut into poor to very good quality rock masses. Rock failures of ceilings and pillars were frequently facilitated by local, unfavourably oriented persistent discontinuities, such as tension cracks and faults. Other failures were related to the disintegration of nodular limestone into individual nodules upon weathering. Our data suggest that, in 18th Dynasty monumental tomb construction, low-strength rock masses rarely resulted in modifications of the planned tomb design in order to minimise the risk of rock falls and collapses.

TI  - The role of the polar vortex strength during winter in Arctic ozone depletion from late winter to spring
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The polar ozone destruction occurs as a result of the chemical processes and catalytic cycles with the participation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) in the presence of weak solar radiation inside the polar vortex from late winter to spring. However, in some years, ozone depletion was not observed under strong polar vortex conditions (in the presence of PSCs). Based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis data and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) satellite data, we show that the polar vortex strength in early winter plays an important role in polar ozone depletion. If the short-term weakening or splitting of the polar vortex, occurring with PSC melting, happened during the winter, then, in most cases, ozone destruction during the subsequent period from late winter to spring was not observed even under conditions of the strong polar vortex containing PSCs.

TI  - Active surveillance of febrile seizures associated to DPT vaccines in a sentinel hospital in Uruguay
T2  - REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Febrile seizures are VAERS often associated with whole-cells Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus vaccines. Aim: To analyze the association of febrile seizures with the administration of pentavalent vaccine in children under two-years-old assisted in the Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell (CHPR), in Montevideo during 2014. Methods: Self-controlled case series study. We included children from Montevideo from two to 24-month-old at the time of admission, with diagnosis of febrile seizure at the time of discharge. We estimated the relative risk in three time periods: 0 to 3 days (risk period), 4 to 14 days (wash-out) and more than 14 days after vaccination (no-risk). Results: We recorded 135 febrile seizures in 114 children, 16 of whom presented two or more events. The total number of events was 7 (5.2%) in risk periods and 8 (5.9%) in wash-out periods. The risk period showed a significantly increased risk (RR = 4.14, CI 95% = [1.73; 8.36]). Conclusions: This work allowed us to establish a national base line for the risk of febrile seizures associated with pentavalent vaccination, by using for the first time in the country a methodology specifically designed for this goal.

TI  - Detection of target spot and bacterial spot diseases in tomato using UAV-based and benchtop-based hyperspectral imaging techniques
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and accurate diagnosis is a critical first step in mitigating losses caused by plant diseases. An incorrect diagnosis can lead to improper management decisions, such as selection of the wrong chemical application that could potentially result in further reduced crop health and yield. In tomato, initial disease symptoms may be similar even if caused by different pathogens, for example early lesions of target spot (TS) caused by the fungus Corynespora cassicola and bacterial spot (BS) caused by Xanthomonas perforans. In this study, hyperspectral imaging (380-1020 nm) was utilized in laboratory and field (collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) settings to detect both diseases. Tomato leaves were classified into four categories: healthy, asymptomatic, early and late disease development stages. Thirty-five spectral vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to select an optimum set of indices for disease detection and identification. Two classification methods were utilized: (i) multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and (ii) stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA). Best wavebands selection was considered in blue (408-420 nm), red (630-650 nm) and red edge (730-750 nm). The most significant VIs that could distinguish between healthy leaves and diseased leaves were the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) for both diseases, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI850) for BS in all stages, and the triangular vegetation index (TVI), NDVI850 and chlorophyll index green (Chl green) for TS asymptomatic, TS early and TS late disease stage respectively. The MLP classification method had an accuracy of 99%, for both BS and TS, under field (UAV-based) and laboratory conditions.

TI  - Distribution and biodiversity of tropical saltmarshes: Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, Southeast coast of India
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are an important marginal coastal ecosystem influenced by tidal movement and are created by the interaction of the halophytic vegetation and sediment trapped from inundating water. This study gives the baseline information on saltmarsh distribution and diversity along the Southeast coast of India. Saltmarsh locations were identified and mapped using satellite images of 2010 of IRS P6 LISS III (23.5 m resolution) & LISS IV (5.8 m) and LandSAT 8 OLI (30.0 m resolution). A total of 37 saltmarsh vegetation sites were identified along Tamil Nadu and one in Puducherry Union Territory. Seven species of saltmarsh flora are reported under four genera and three families: Arthrocnemum indicum (Willd.) Moq., Salicornia brachiata (Roxb), Sesuvium portulacastrum (L.), Suaeda fruticosa (Forssk), S. maritima (L.) Dumort, S. monoica (Forssk) and S. nudiffora (Moquin). The maximum benthic coverage by the saltmarsh community observed at Arucottuthurai was 93.3% and a minimum percentage cover of 28% was observed at Pazhaiyar. The biodiversity indices calculated for all study sites displayed maximum saltmarsh diversity (Shannon-Wiener H' = 2.295 +/- 0.001) at Vedaranyam and a minimum diversity (H' = 0.759 +/- 0.001) at Thirukazhipalai. A total of 23 species representing 16 fauna and seven flora were observed as associates from the saltmarsh ecosystem. Saltmarsh ecosystem provides unique breeding sites for macro fauna and roosting ground for avifauna, provide livelihood options for coastal communities and protects the integrity of coast. Rapid coastal development and aquaculture pose a major threat to this ecosystem. This study helps to protect, conserve and sustainably use this ecologically important coastal ecosystem and prepare specific management strategies by stakeholders.

TI  - Temporal and spatial variations of convection and precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau based on recent satellite observations. Part I: Cloud climatology derived from <i>CloudSat</i> and <i>CALIPSO</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This sequence of papers, consisting of two parts, examines temporal and spatial variations of convection and precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) based on recent satellite observations. Here in Part 1, seasonal and diurnal variations of cloud vertical structure and cloud properties have been derived from four combined CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite data sets and compared between three subregions in the TP which are marked by different dominating large-scale atmospheric circulations and moisture sources. The results show that the plateau is generally dominated by low-level single-layer clouds and stratiform cloud types. Cloud occurrence frequencies peak during the summer monsoon season between May and September and are generally higher during daytime compared with nighttime in all the three subregions. The fraction of detected ice cloud layers in the TP domain exceeds 50% during all months and 80% between January and April. While ice cloud layers occur as altostratus clouds in the westerly dominated north and transition zone, high-level cirrus cloud occurs frequently accompanied by lower level cumulus clouds in the monsoon-dominated south, especially during nighttime. This study complements previous satellite observations of clouds over the TP and reveals firstly the high contribution of stratiform ice cloud layers in the westerly dominated north, secondly the importance of the monsoon season which outweighs day-night differences and affects the examined cloud parameters in all regions and finally the significant regional differences of cloud characteristics within the plateau. It is therefore suggested to focus on the relative importance of stratification, mesoscale convective systems and advection in future studies on hydro-climatic changes in the TP region.

TI  - Selective insecticides secure natural enemies action in cotton pest management
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton hosts a variety of arthropod pests requiring intensive control mostly with insecticides, which in turn may impact beneficial insects and the environment. Therefore, insect control in cotton fields preconizes the use of selective insecticides that offer pest control but conserve natural enemies. In this work, we measured the impact of recommended insecticides on the abundance of predatory insects and predation upon sentinel preys in the field. Further, the survival of four key selected predatory insects of cotton ecosystem, representing chewing and sucking feeding habits and different pest species attacked [Chrysoperla extema Hagen, Eriopis connexa (Germar), Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) and Onus insidiosus (Say)], were assessed when exposed to the dried residues of the tested insecticides. Mortality of sentinel prey caused by natural enemies was higher in areas treated with selective insecticides relative to the non-selective ones, and most of time similar to the untreated areas. Furthermore, areas treated with non-selective insecticides experienced prolonged impact between sprays depending on the insecticide applied. Seasonal abundance of predatory insects was 2 x greater in fields under selective and untreated fields compared to those under non-selective recommendation. Survival of predators exposed to the dried residues of the selective insecticides pymetrozine, chlorantraniliprole, pyriproxyfen, and cyantraniliprole were greater than when exposed to the non-selective lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, dimethoate, and thiamethoxam. Among the non-selective insecticides, malathion and dimethoate exhibited shorter residual time compared to the thiamethoxam and lambda-cyhalothrin + thiamethoxam. Therefore, the recommendation of selective insecticides provides benefits for cotton pest management by maintaining the action of the natural enemies present in the field.

TI  - Effect of Caribbean Water incursion into the Gulf of Mexico derived from absolute dynamic topography, satellite data, and remotely sensed chlorophyll <i>a</i>
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of the Loop Current (LC) and the detached Loop Current eddies (LCEs) dominate the surface circulation of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and transport Caribbean Water (CW) into the gulf. In this work, 25 years (1993-2017) of daily satellite data are used to investigate the variability of these physical processes and their effect on chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations from 1998 to 2017, including temporal changes, mean differences, and regional concentration tendencies. The physical variables analyzed are absolute dynamic topography (ADT) and oceanic currents. From the ADT and oceanic current monthly climatologies, it is shown that there is an annual intrusion of CW with an inward incursion that starts in spring, peaks in the summer, reaches to 28 degrees N and 90.45 degrees W, and then retreats in winter to approximately 26.5 degrees N and 88.3 degrees W. Minimum surface Chl a concentrations (< 0.08 mg m(-3)) are found during the summer-autumn period inside the region of maximum incursion of CW; the opposite is observed during the winter period when Chl a concentrations were at a maximum, e.g., > 0.14 mg m(-3). The 3-year running averages of the ADT 40 cm isoline qualitatively reproduce the climatological pattern of 25 years showing that before 2002 CW was less intrusive. This suggests that from 2003 onward, larger volumes of oligotrophic waters from the Caribbean Sea have invaded the western GoM and reduced mean surface Chl a concentrations. A direct comparison between the 1998-2002 and 2009-2014 periods indicates that in the latter time interval, the Chl a concentration above waters deeper than 250 m has decreased significantly.

TI  - Spatial variability of mean daily estimates of actual evaporation from remotely sensed imagery and surface reference data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface evaporation has considerable spatial variability that is not captured by point-scale estimates calculated from meteorological data alone. Knowing how evaporation varies spatially remains an important issue for improving parameterisations of land surface schemes and hydrological models and various land management practices. Satellite-based and aerial remote sensing has been crucial for capturing moderate- to larger-scale surface variables to indirectly estimate evaporative fluxes. However, more recent advances for field research via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) now allow for the acquisition of more highly detailed surface data.Integrating models that can estimate "actual" evaporation from higher-resolution imagery and surface reference data would be valuable to better examine potential impacts of local variations in evaporation on upscaled estimates. This study introduces a novel approach for computing a normalised ratiometric index from surface variables that can be used to obtain more-realistic distributed estimates of actual evaporation. For demonstration purposes the Granger-Gray evaporation model (Granger and Gray, 1989) was applied at a rolling prairie agricultural site in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Visible and thermal images and meteorological reference data required to parameterise the model were obtained at midday.Ratiometric indexes were computed for the key surface variables albedo and net radiation at midday. This allowed point observations of albedo and mean daily net radiation to be scaled across high-resolution images over a large study region. Albedo and net radiation estimates were within 5 %-10 % of measured values. A daily evaporation estimate for a grassed surface was 0 5 mm (23 %) larger than eddy covari- ance measurements. Spatial variations in key factors driving evaporation and their impacts on upscaled evaporation estimates are also discussed. The methods applied have two key advantages for estimating evaporation over previous remotesensing approaches: (1) detailed daily estimates of actual evaporation can be directly obtained using a physically based evaporation model, and (2) analysis of more-detailed and more-reliable evaporation estimates may lead to improved methods for upscaling evaporative fluxes to larger areas.

TI  - A global wildfire dataset for the analysis of fire regimes and fire behaviour
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global fire monitoring systems are crucial to study fire behaviour, fire regimes and their impact at the global scale. Although global fire products based on the use of Earth Observation satellites exist, most remote sensing products only partially cover the requirements for these analyses. These data do not provide information like fire size, fire spread speed, how fires may evolve and joint into single event, or the number of fire events for a given area. This high level of abstraction is very valuable; it makes it possible to characterize fires by types (either size, spread, behaviour, etc.). Here, we present and test a data mining work flow to create a global database of single fires that allows for the characterization of fire types and fire regimes worldwide. This work describes the data produced by a data mining process using MODIS burnt area product Collection 6 (MCD64A1). The entire product has been computed until the present and is available under the umbrella of the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS).

TI  - Assessing the impacts of land-use/land-cover change on the development of urban heat island effects
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) has been a detrimental problem over the last decades. Also, climate change has obtained more attention due to increased urbanization. Turkey is one of the countries experiencing a rapid urbanization which has resulted in significant UHI impacts on the regional climate and environment. This study was conducted in Osmaniye city, Turkey, where there is a need to determine the effects of land-use/land-cover changes (LUCC) on the UHI using Landsat images. The geospatial analyses were undertaken using USGS/NASA Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus geospatial data from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that percent cover of urban areas significantly increased from 6.13 to 17.76%, broad-leaved forest cover decreased from 14.2 to 11.6%, road and rail network cover increased from 5.23 to 10.85%, and coniferous forest cover decreased from 15.85 to 9.02% between 2000 and 2018. During the process of urbanization from 2000 to 2018, most of the bare land cover was converted to agricultural lands and urbanized areas due to vegetative degradation, and industrial units cover increased from 7.76 to 9.53%. The land surface temperature was 35.57 degrees C for approximately 25% of the study area in 2000, while the same temperature was calculated for 76% of the study area in 2018. The results suggest that LUCC from vegetation to urbanized areas has significantly increased the land surface temperature. This implies that the application of remote sensing technique could help to design methods to mitigate UHI effects by estimating future land-use/land-cover change in urban areas.

TI  - Monitoring spatial variability and trends of wheat grain yield over the main cereal regions in Morocco: a remote-based tool for planning and adjusting policies
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in crop yields may have important implications for food security in Morocco. This study intends to develop an explicit model based solely on phenological parameters derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/NDVI data to monitor wheat grain yield. The developed model allows overcoming missing weather, soil and irrigation supply data without losing the spatial resolution offered by images data. The study period covers a 16-year span between 2000 and 2016, and the considered region is the north-western of Morocco. The model showed a good correlation with ground measurements (R-2 = 0.62; p < 0.01). Spatio-temporal variability and trend of wheat yield were examined. The spatial analyses revealed an increase of instability of wheat grain yields across central and southern regions. Such a tool allows managers and policy makers to analyse the agricultural policy impact, to monitor the agronomic potential dynamic, to control the cropping season evolution and to optimize the land use choices.

TI  - On the Annual Asymmetry of High-Latitude Sporadic F
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The polar F region ionosphere frequently exhibits sporadic variability (e.g., Meek, 1949, ; Hill, 1963, ). Recent satellite data analysis (Noja et al., 2013, ; Chartier et al., 2018, ) showed that the high-latitude F region ionosphere exhibits sporadic enhancements more frequently in January than in July in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The same pattern has been seen in statistics of the degradation and total loss of GPS service onboard low-Earth orbit satellites (Xiong et al. 2018, ). Here, we confirm the existence of this annual pattern using ground GPS-based images of TEC from the MIDAS algorithm. Images covering January and July 2014 confirm that the high-latitude (>70 MLAT) F region exhibits a substantially larger range of values in January than in July in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The range of TEC values observed in the polar caps is 38-57 TECU (north-south) in January versus 25-37 TECU in July. First-principle modeling using SAMI3 reproduces this pattern, and indicates that it is caused by an asymmetry in plasma levels (30% higher in January than in July across both polar caps), as well as 17% longer O+ plasma lifetimes in northern hemisphere winter, compared to southern hemisphere winter.

TI  - A comprehensive in situ and remote sensing data set from the Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day (ACLOUD) campaign
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day (ACLOUD) campaign was carried out north-west of Svalbard (Norway) between 23 May and 6 June 2017. The objective of ACLOUD was to study Arctic boundary layer and mid-level clouds and their role in Arctic amplification. Two research aircraft (Polar 5 and 6) jointly performed 22 research flights over the transition zone between open ocean and closed sea ice. Both aircraft were equipped with identical instrumentation for measurements of basic meteorological parameters, as well as for turbulent and radiative energy fluxes. In addition, on Polar 5 active and passive remote sensing instruments were installed, while Polar 6 operated in situ instruments to characterize cloud and aerosol particles as well as trace gases. A detailed overview of the specifications, data processing, and data quality is provided here. It is shown that the scientific analysis of the ACLOUD data benefits from the coordinated operation of both aircraft. By combining the cloud remote sensing techniques operated on Polar 5, the synergy of multi-instrument cloud retrieval is illustrated. The remote sensing methods were validated using truly collocated in situ and remote sensing observations. The data of identical instruments operated on both aircraft were merged to extend the spatial coverage of mean atmospheric quantities and turbulent and radiative flux measurement. Therefore, the data set of the ACLOUD campaign provides comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observations characterizing the cloudy Arctic atmosphere. All processed, calibrated, and validated data are published in the World Data Center PANGAEA as instrument-separated data subsets (Ehrlich et al., 2019b, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.902603).

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration Using Coupled Remote Sensing and Three SEB Models in an Arid Region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - tau hree surface energy balance (SEB) models were used to estimate ET based on remote sensing (RS) techniques: surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), mapping evapotranspiration at a high-resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC (TM)), and simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI). The study was conducted on the Todhia Arable Farm (TAF), located in the Riyadh province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Both RS data and meteorological data were used. RS data were obtained by processing 20 Landsat 8 satellite images for 2014 focused on alfalfa cultivation. The estimated ET was validated by comparing it with the measured ET using an eddy covariance (EC) device. The ET values estimated by the SEBAL, METRIC, and S-SEBI models were 1.7-18.9 mm center dot d(-1) with a mean of 8.3 mm center dot d(-1), 2.8-22.4 mm center dot d(-1) with a mean of 11.0 mm center dot d(-1), and 6.5-21.6 mm center dot d(-1) with a mean of 15.7 mm center dot d(-1), respectively. The highest ET values were observed in cultivated areas, particularly during the periods of increased irrigation. The comparison between the estimated and measured ET indicated that the METRIC model exhibited the best performance, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.7 mm center dot d(-1). The S-SEBI model was less accurate, followed by the SEBAL model, with an RMSD of 2.9 and 3.1 mm center dot d(-1), respectively. The METRIC model exhibited moderate ET results as well and is considered to be the most suitable ET SEB model for arid regions.

TI  - Big geospatial data analysis for Canada's Air Pollutant Emissions Inventory (APEI): using google earth engine to estimate particulate matter from exposed mine disturbance areas
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate Matter (PM) emissions originating from mine waste and mine tailings can be hazardous to human health, depending on the ore type and processes used to extract ore. Until now, only a single, simple estimate of the total area of mine waste area across all of Canada has been available for calculating air quality emissions from this source. This single estimate, based on manual satellite interpretation completed in 1977, was extrapolated to estimate mine areas for all years from 1990 to the present. These area estimates were used annually to calculate the particulate matter from mines for the Canadian Air Pollutant Emissions Inventory (APEI); however, there is high uncertainty in these measurements of mine area and therefore in emissions estimates. In order to increase certainty in emissions estimates, the exposed mine waste areas must be mapped for each year. Mapping mine waste over areas as large as the Canadian landmass requires enormous quantities of data and considerable computational power, which will be compounded when a time-series analysis is required. Therefore, in this study, we have employed Google Earth Engine (GEE) Javascript API to map exposed mine areas in four "benchmark" years (1990, 2000, 2010, and current year 2018) as part of the APEI. A random forest classifier was trained using two separate datasets (Landsat-5 year 2000; and a combination of Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 for the year 2018). Transfer learning was then used to apply the year 2000 model to the year 1990 and 2010 Landsat-5 imagery, which produced classification results for the four "benchmark" years in our time series. This tool has enabled the monitoring of mine growth over a 30-year period and has confirmed that overall the area of mines is growing in Canada. Overall, Google Earth Engine proved to be an invaluable tool in mapping exposed mine waste areas and would be similarly useful for any organization with large-area monitoring mandates or those interested in time-series analysis of the Landsat archive.

TI  - Measuring Forest Biodiversity Status and Changes Globally
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's forests are crucially important for both biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation. New forest status and forest change spatial layers using remotely sensed data have revolutionised forest monitoring globally, and provide fine-scale deforestation alerts that can be actioned in near-real time. However, existing products are restricted to representing tree cover and do not reflect the considerable spatial variation in the biological importance of forests. Here we link modelled biodiversity values to remotely sensed data on tree cover to develop global maps of forest biodiversity significance (based on the rarity-weighted richness of forest mammal, bird, amphibian and conifer species) and forest biodiversity intactness (based on the modelled relationship between anthropogenic pressures and community intactness). The strengths and weaknesses of these products for policy and local decision-making are reviewed and we map out future improvements and developments that are needed to enhance their usefulness.

TI  - A study of synthetic <SUP>13</SUP>CH<sub>4</sub> retrievals from TROPOMI and Sentinel-5/UVNS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrievals of methane isotopologues have the potential to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic methane sources types, which can provide much needed information about the current global methane budget. We investigate the feasibility of retrieving the second most abundant isotopologue of atmospheric methane ((CH4)-C-13, roughly 1.1% of total atmospheric methane) from the shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels of the future Sentinel-5/ultra-violet, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared (UVNS) and current Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instruments. With the intended goal of calculating the delta C-13 value, we assume that a delta C-13 uncertainty of better than 1% is sufficient to differentiate between source types, which corresponds to a (CH4)-C-13 uncertainty of < 0.02 ppb. Using the well-established information content analysis techniques and assuming clear-sky, non-scattering conditions, we find that the SWIR3 (2305-2385 nm) channel on the TROPOMI instrument can achieve a mean uncertainty of < 1 ppb, while the SWIR1 channel (1590-1675 nm) on the Sentinel-5 UVNS instrument can achieve < 0:68 ppb or < 0:2 ppb in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases. These uncertainties combined with significant spatial and/or temporal averaging techniques can reduce delta C-13 uncertainty to the target magnitude or better. However, we find that (CH4)-C-13 retrievals are highly sensitive to errors in a priori knowledge of temperature and pressure, and accurate knowledge of these profiles is required before (CH4)-C-13 retrievals can be performed on TROPOMI and future Sentinel-5/UVNS data. In addition, we assess the assumption that scattering-induced light path errors are cancelled out by comparing the delta C-13 values calculated for non-scattering and scattering scenarios. We find that there is a minor bias in delta C-13 values from scattering and non-scattering retrievals, but this is unrelated to scattering-induced errors.

TI  - 'Detachment' of icefield outlet glaciers: catastrophic thinning and retreat of the Columbia Glacier (Canada)
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an investigation of changes taking place on the Columbia Glacier, a lake-terminating outlet of the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rockies. The Columbia Icefield is the largest, and one of the most important, ice bodies in the Canadian Rockies. Like other ice masses, it stores water as snow and ice during the winter and releases it during warmer summer months, sustaining river flows and the ecosystems that rely on them. However, the Columbia Glacier and Icefield is shrinking. We use Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery to show that the Columbia Glacier has retreated increasingly rapidly in recent years, and suggest that this looks set to continue. Importantly, we identify a previously undocumented process that appears to be playing an important role in the retreat of this glacier. This process involves the 'detachment' of the glacier tongue from its accumulation area in the Columbia Icefield. This process is important because the tongue is cut off from the accumulation area and there is no replenishment of ice that melts in the glacier's ablation area by flow from upglacier. As a consequence, for a given rate of ablation, the ice in the tongue will disappear much faster than it would if the local mass loss by melting/calving was partly offset by mass input by glacier flow. Such a change would alter the relationship between rates of surface melting and rates of glacier frontal retreat. We provide evidence that detachment has already occurred elsewhere on the Columbia Icefield and that it is likely to affect other outlet glaciers in the future. Modelling studies forecast this detachment activity, which ultimately results in a smaller 'perched' icefield without active outlets. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - SAR polarimetric analysis for major land covers including pre-monsoon crops
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of single date fully polarimetric SAR data was brought out in discriminating different land covers at level 3 (LULC classification system NRSC) by deriving various polarimetric parameters. Various coherent and incoherent decompositions viz. Krogager, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, Van Zyl, H-A-Alpha were analyzed to evaluate its potential for crop identification. Freeman-3 decomposition overestimates the volume component predominantly for high biomass crops but is sensitive across variable range of biomass. Van Zyl decomposition was not found suitable for crop studies as it overestimates surface scattering by underestimating volume scattering from canopy structure. The differencing method using various decomposition conveyed dynamic response for various crops over the individual response. The Entropy-Alpha scatter plot exhibits its capability in discriminating various land covers. Further, polarimetric signature resulted in unique response for various land covers that can be exploited for their identification. High pedestal heights were observed for high biomass crops and vice-versa.

TI  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar for tide modelling in Antarctic ice-shelf grounding zones
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is an essential tool for detecting ice-sheet motion near Antarctica's oceanic margin. These space-borne measurements have been used extensively in the past to map the location and retreat of ice-shelf grounding lines as an indicator for the onset of marine ice-sheet instability and to calculate the mass balance of ice sheets and individual catchments. The main difficulty in interpreting DInSAR is that images originate from a combination of several SAR images and do not indicate instantaneous ice deflection at the times of satellite data acquisitions. Here, we combine the sub-centimetre accuracy and spatial benefits of DInSAR with the temporal benefits of tide models to infer the spatio-temporal dynamics of ice-ocean interaction during the times of satellite overpasses. We demonstrate the potential of this synergy with TerraSAR-X data from the almost-stagnant southern McMurdo Ice Shelf (SMIS). We then validate our algorithm with GPS data from the fast-flowing Darwin Glacier, draining the Antarctic Plateau through the Transantarctic Mountains into the Ross Sea. We are able to reconstruct DInSAR-derived vertical displacements to 7 mm mean absolute residual error and generally improve traditional tide-model output by up to 39 % from 10.8 to 6.7 cm RMSE against GPS data from areas where ice is in local hydrostatic equilibrium with the ocean and by up to 74 % from 21.4 to 5.6 cm RMSE against GPS data in feature-rich coastal areas where tide models have not been applicable before. Numerical modelling then reveals Young's modulus of E = 1.0 +/- 0.56 GPa and an ice viscosity of nu = 10 +/- 3.65 TPa s when finite-element simulations of tidal flexure are matched to 16 d of tiltmeter data, supporting the hypothesis that straindependent anisotropy may significantly decrease effective viscosity compared to isotropic polycrystalline ice on large spatial scales. Applications of our method include the following: refining coarsely gridded tide models to resolve small-scale features at the spatial resolution and vertical accuracy of SAR imagery, separating elastic and viscoelastic contributions in the satellite-derived flexure measurement, and gaining information about large-scale ice heterogeneity in Antarctic ice-shelf grounding zones, the missing key to improving current ice-sheet flow models. The reconstruction of the individual components forming DInSAR images has the potential to become a standard remote-sensing method in polar tide modelling. Unlocking the algorithm's full potential to answer multi-disciplinary research questions is desired and demands collaboration within the scientific community.

TI  - The rise of transactionalism in international relations: evidence from Turkey's relations with the European Union
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper's main objective is to explain the concept of transactionalist foreign policy in detail and to demonstrate how it applies to a real-world case in Turkish foreign policy towards the EU under the AKP rule. We define transactionalism as a foreign policy approach that favours bilateral to multilateral relations, focuses on short-term wins rather than longer-term strategic foresight, adheres to a zero-sum worldview where all gains are relative and reciprocity is absent, rejects value-based policymaking, and does not follow a grand strategy. This paper also provides a new layer to the existing periodisation of AKP's EU policy through framing the EU as 'a foreign policy actor' in Turkey-EU relations. Scholars divide Turkey's EU policy under the AKP government into three broad periods: Europeanisation, selective Europeanisation and De-Europeanisation. We complement this literature by adding another layer of analysis that focuses on Turkey's foreign relations in its broader region, including the EU, and argue that Turkey's relations with the EU were characterised by the zero-problems doctrine during the selective Europeanisation period, and by civilisational competition with the EU during the de-Europeanisation period, and by transactionalism since 2016.

TI  - Monitoring tropical forest carbon stocks and emissions using Planet satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are crucial for mitigating climate change, but many forests continue to be driven from carbon sinks to sources through human activities. To support more sustainable forest uses, we need to measure and monitor carbon stocks and emissions at high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed the first large-scale very high-resolution map of aboveground carbon stocks and emissions for the country of Peru by combining 6.7 million hectares of airborne LiDAR measurements of top-of-canopy height with thousands of Planet Dove satellite images into a random forest machine learning regression workflow, obtaining an R-2 of 0.70 and RMSE of 25.38 Mg C ha(-1) for the nationwide estimation of aboveground carbon density (ACD). The diverse ecosystems of Peru harbor 6.928 Pg C, of which only 2.9 Pg C are found in protected areas or their buffers. We found significant carbon emissions between 2012 and 2017 in areas aggressively affected by oil palm and cacao plantations, agricultural and urban expansions or illegal gold mining. Creating such a cost-effective and spatially explicit indicators of aboveground carbon stocks and emissions for tropical countries will serve as a transformative tool to quantify the climate change mitigation services that forests provide.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Automatically Detect Volcanic Unrest in a Time Series of Interferograms
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites produce measurements of ground deformation at the majority of the world's subaerial active volcanoes and can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. We present an automatic detection algorithm that uses these data to automatically warn when deformation at a volcano departs from the background. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic data sets and the unrest leading to the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra (Galapagos). Our algorithm encompasses spatial independent component analysis and uses a significantly improved version of the ICASO algorithm, which we term ICASAR, to robustly perform spatial independent component analysis. We use ICASAR to isolate signals of geophysical interest from atmospheric signals, before monitoring the evolution of these signals through time in order to detect the onset of a period of volcanic unrest.

TI  - Analysis on Precipitable Water Vapor over the Tibetan Plateau Using FengYun-3A Medium Resolution Spectral Imager Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is the largest and highest plateau in the world, and its complex terrain affects the distribution of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere, which plays an important role in the weather and climate of East Asia. In this paper, the characteristics of PWV over the Tibetan Plateau are studied using the FengYun-3A Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) water vapor products, which are retrieved from the MERSI raw images of Chinese second-generation polar orbit meteorological satellite. Firstly, the accuracy of the MERSI 5-minute water vapor product is validated using three referenced water vapor data from TERRA/MODIS, ground-based GPS, and AERONET sun photometer over the Tibetan Plateau. Then, the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of PWV over the plateau are analyzed, and the effects of topographic factors on PWV are discussed. The results indicate that the MERSI 5-minute water vapor product has a good accuracy over the Tibetan Plateau, which the mean absolute error of MERSI water vapor product is in the range of 28.91%-37.54%, the mean absolute error range between 1.87 and 2.76 millimeter (mm), and the mean bias is between -1.14 and 0.64 mm comparing three referenced data. The PWV content appears as a typical spatial pattern over the Tibetan Plateau where there is a decrease from east to west of the Tibetan Plateau with increasing elevation, with the highest values over the south of Tibet. A second pattern also appears over the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, where the PWV content in the Qaidam Basin and the south of Tarim Basin are also considerably high. The seasonal variation of PWV content over the Tibetan Plateau presents to be highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring, and lowest in winter. The PWV content changes periodically during the year, which fits with a quadratic polynomial over monthly scales. The topographical factors of the Tibetan Plateau were found to affect the water vapor, where the altitude and latitude are negatively correlated with water vapor, while the slope and longitude show a positive correlation with water vapor; however, the aspect does not appear to have any significant influence on water vapor.

TI  - A real-time spatio-temporal syndromic surveillance system with application to small companion animals
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of disease surveillance in small companion animals worldwide has contributed to a deficit in our ability to detect and respond to outbreaks. In this paper we describe the first real-time syndromic surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary premises for the early detection of disease outbreaks in small animals. We illustrate the system's performance using data relating to gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats. The data consist of approximately one million electronic health records for dogs and cats, collected from 458 UK veterinary premises between March 2014 and 2016. For this illustration, the system predicts the relative reporting rate of gastrointestinal disease amongst all presentations, and updates its predictions as new data accrue. The system was able to detect simulated outbreaks of varying spatial geometry, extent and severity. The system is flexible: it generates outcomes that are easily interpretable; the user can set their own outbreak detection thresholds. The system provides the foundation for prompt detection and control of health threats in companion animals.

TI  - Analysis of surface chlorophyll a associated with sea surface temperature and surface wind in the South China Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial and temporal variability in surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in the whole South China Sea (SCS) was investigated in detail by using 8-day, 4-km, gap-free MODIS-A data (2003-2016). Monthly climatology and empirical-orthogonal-functions analysis of Chl-a were performed in association with sea surface temperature and surface wind to aid in better understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for the Chl-a variability. The results are as follows: (1) Chl-a has out-of-phase variability between the coastal and open-sea regions due to different major factors controlling phytoplankton growth in each region; (2) in particular, Chl-a increases in the northern SCS during winter and in the western and southwestern SCS during summer mainly due to the effects of monsoons and orography; and (3) wind-driven coastal upwelling is stronger in the western SCS than in the eastern SCS. A wind-induced coastal upwelling not reported in the literature was detected along Palawan Island (8-12(circle)N, 117-120(circle)E) during winter. In the SCS, the Chl-a variability is influenced by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation with a time lag of 4-9 months, depending on the variability scales.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Influenza A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a co-circulated in Europe in 2018/19. Immunological imprinting by first childhood influenza infection may induce future birth cohort differences in vaccine effectiveness (VE). Aim: The I-MOVE multicentre primary care test-negative study assessed 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) VE by age and genetic subgroups to explore VE by birth cohort. Methods: We measured VE against influenza A(H3N2) and (sub)clades. We stratified VE by usual age groups (0-14, 15-64, >= 65-years). To assess the imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV) hypothesis, we further stratified the middle-aged group, notably including 32-54-year-olds (1964-86) sharing potential childhood imprinting to serine at haemagglutinin position 159. Results: Influenza A(H3N2) VE among all ages was -1% (95% confidence interval (CI): -24 to 18) and 46% (95% CI: 8-68), -26% (95% CI: -66 to 4) and 20% (95% CI: -20 to 46) among 0-14, 15-64 and >= 65-year-olds, respectively. Among 15-64-year-olds, VE against clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a was 15% (95% CI: -34 to 50) and -74% (95% CI: -259 to 16), respectively. VE was -18% (95% CI: -140 to 41), -53% (95% CI: -131 to -2) and -12% (95% CI: -74 to 28) among 15-31-year-olds (1987-2003), 32-54-year-olds (1964-86) and 55-64-year-olds (1954-63), respectively. Discussion: The lowest 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) VE was against clade 3C.3a and among those born 1964-86, corresponding to the I-REV hypothesis. The low influenza A(H3N2) VE in 15-64-year-olds and the public health impact of the I-REV hypothesis warrant further study.

TI  - Mechanical properties of the shoulder and pectoralis major in breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with axillary surgery and radiotherapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy reduce breast cancer recurrence but can cause functional deficits in breast cancer survivors. A cross-sectional study quantified the long-term pathophysiological impact of these treatments on biomechanical measures of shoulder stiffness and ultrasound shear wave elastography measures of the shear elastic modulus of the pectoralis major (PM). Nine node-positive patients treated with radiotherapy to the breast and regional nodes after BCS and axillary lymph node dissection (Group 1) were compared to nine node-negative patients treated with radiotherapy to the breast alone after BCS and sentinel node biopsy (Group 2) and nine healthy age-matched controls. The mean follow-up for Group 1 and Group 2 patients was 988 days and 754 days, respectively. Shoulder stiffness did not differ between the treatment groups and healthy controls (p = 0.23). The PM shear elastic modulus differed between groups (p = 0.002), with Group 1 patients exhibiting a stiffer PM than Group 2 patients (p < 0.001) and healthy controls (p = 0.027). The mean prescribed radiotherapy dose to the PM was significantly correlated with passive shear elastic modulus (p = 0.018). Breast cancer patients undergoing more extensive axillary surgery and nodal radiotherapy did not experience long-term functional deficits to shoulder integrity but did experience long-term mechanical changes of the PM.

TI  - Comparison of Ultrasound-Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology and Ultrasound-Guided Core Biopsy in Preoperative Axillary Staging for Early Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current national guidance supports the use of either ultrasound-guided core biopsy (USCB) or ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USFNAC) to detect preoperatively axillary lymph node involvement in early breast cancer but does not support one over the other. To compare the accuracy of USFNAC to USCB in diagnosing axillary lymph node metastasis in early-stage breast cancer in our symptomatic breast care unit. Historical case series data for patients from November 2007 to May 2012 was analysed. Our study included newly diagnosed, symptomatic, clinically node-negative breast cancers. Women with screen-detected breast cancer, those who had breast staging by magnetic resonance imaging, those unfit for surgery and those with locally advanced cancers were excluded. GE Logic E9 and Philips ultrasound machines were used for the study. A total of 1213 axillary ultrasound scans were performed during the period of the study. Four hundred eighty-eight women were eligible for the study with a mean age of 57.8 years. Eighty-three (17%) had USFNAC, 116 (23.7%) had USCB and 289 (59.2%) had normal/benign US features. The sensitivity and specificity of USFNAC were 58% and 100%, respectively. For USCB, sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 100%, respectively, and for US alone, sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 77%, respectively. We support the routine use of USCB over USFNAC for women who have breast cancer with indeterminate or suspicious axillary involvement on ultrasound, due to its greater accuracy.

TI  - Potential Application of the New Sentinel Satellites for Monitoring of Harmful Algal Blooms in the Galician Aquaculture
T2  - THALASSAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs) in the Rias Baixas area (Galicia) cause a strong ecological and economic impact, since they can even force the closure of the rafts production areas for mollusc culture. In this work, we introduce a method for detection and monitoring of HABs in Galicia based on the analysis of map products derived from optical satellite images, including chlorophyll a concentration or species indicators. The approach is developed in the framework of CoastObs project, which started in 2017 and explores the potential of new Sentinel satellites for coastal water monitoring, suggesting different applications such as seagrass, phytoplankton size class or HABs detection. Preliminary results obtained using a set of images acquired on July 2018 suggest the great potential of this approach, which could complement the existing monitoring program based on direct observations.

TI  - Magnetic local time asymmetries in precipitating electron and proton populations with and without substorm activity
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnetic local time (MLT) dependence of electron (0.15-300 keV) and proton (0.15-6900 keV) precipitation into the atmosphere based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration POES and METOP satellite data during 2001-2008 was described. Using modified APEX coordinates the influence of particle energy, substorm activity and geomagnetic disturbance on the MLT flux distribution was statistically analysed.Some of the findings are the following.a. Substorms mostly increase particle precipitation in the night sector by about factor 2-4, but can also reduce it in the day sector.b. MLT dependence can be assigned to particles entering the magnetosphere at the cusp region and magnetospheric particles in combination with energy-specific drifts (in agreement with Newell et al., 2009).c. MLT flux differences of up to 2 orders of magnitude have been identified inside the auroral oval during geomagnetically disturbed conditions. The novelty here is the comprehensive coverage of energy bands and the focus on asymmetry.d. The maximum flux asymmetry ratio depends on particle energy, decreasing with Kp for low energetic particles and increasing with Kp for higher energy electrons, while high energy protons show a more complex dependency. While some aspects may already have been known, the quantification of the flux asymmetry sheds new light on MLT variation.
