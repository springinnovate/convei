TI  - Cover Crop Species and Management Influence Predatory Arthropods and Predation in an Organically Managed, Reduced-Tillage Cropping System
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural practices affect arthropod communities and, therefore, have the potential to influence the activities of arthropods. We evaluated the effect of cover crop species and termination timing on the activity of ground-dwelling predatory arthropods in a corn-soybean-wheat rotation in transition to organic production in Pennsylvania, United States. We compared two cover crop treatments: 1) hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) planted together with triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) after wheat harvest, and 2) cereal rye (Secale cereale Linnaeus) planted after corn harvest. We terminated the cover crops in the spring with a roller-crimper on three dates (early, middle, and late) based on cover crop phenology and standard practices for cash crop planting in our area. We characterized the ground-dwelling arthropod community using pitfall traps and assessed relative predation using sentinel assays with live greater waxworm larvae (Galleria mellonella Fabricius). The activity density of predatory arthropods was significantly higher in the hairy vetch and triticale treatments than in cereal rye treatments. Hairy vetch and triticale favored the predator groups Araneae, Opiliones, Staphylinidae, and Carabidae. Specific taxa were associated with cover crop condition (e.g., live or dead) and termination dates. Certain variables were positively or negatively associated with the relative predation on sentinel prey, depending on cover crop treatment and stage, including the presence of predatory arthropods and various habitat measurements. Our results suggest that management of a cover crop by roller-crimper at specific times in the growing season affects predator activity density and community composition. Terminating cover crops with a roller-crimper can conserve generalist predators.

TI  - Estimating the Optical Properties of Inorganic Matter-Dominated Oligo-to-Mesotrophic Inland Waters
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies over the years have focused on bio-optical modeling of inland waters to monitor water quality. However, those studies have been conducted mainly in eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic environments dominated by phytoplankton. With the launch of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI)/Sentinel-3A in 2016, a range of bands became available including the 709 nm band recommended for scaling up these bio-optical models for productive inland waters. It was found that one category of existing bio-optical models, the quasi-analytical algorithms (QAAs), when applied to colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and detritus-dominated waters, produce large errors. Even after shifting the reference wavelength to 709 nm, the recently re-parameterized QAA versions could not accurately retrieve the inherent optical properties (IOPs) in waterbodies dominated by inorganic matter. In this study, three existing versions of QAA were implemented and proved inefficient for the study site. Therefore, several changes were incorporated into the QAA, starting with the re-parameterization of the empirical steps related to the total absorption coefficient retrieval. The re-parameterized QAA, QAA(OMW) showed a significant improvement in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). MAPE decreased from 58.05% for existing open ocean QAA (QAA(Lv5)) to 16.35% for QAA(OMW). Considerable improvement was also observed in the estimation of the absorption coefficient of CDOM and detritus from a MAPE of 91.05% for QAA(Lv5) to 18.87% for QAA(OMW). The retrieval of the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(phi)) using the native form of QAA proved to be inaccurate for the oligo-to-mesotrophic waterbody due to the low a(phi) returning negative predictions. Therefore, a novel approach based on the normalized a(phi) was adopted to maintain the spectral shape and retrieve positive values, resulting in an improvement of 119% in QAA(OMW). Further tuning and scale-up of QAA(OMW) to OLCI bands will aid in monitoring water resources and associated watershed processes.

TI  - Mature non-native plantations complement native forests in bird communities: canopy and understory effects on avian habitat preferences
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The habitat composition of mature non-native plantations may provide a different set of resources to that of native forests, and these differences may influence species communities. We studied a bird community in the northern Iberian Peninsula to understand whether habitat composition in either mature non-native plantations or native forests generated differences in the habitat associations of each bird species as well as the composition of the bird community. We sampled 140 4-ha plots, measuring habitat composition at both the canopy and the understory level using remote sensing data and field surveys, respectively. Using a fixed census in each plot, we also studied the bird species composition and analysed the species-specific associations for various habitat variables at the canopy and understory level. We found that mature plantations differed in understory level from native forest, but these differences in habitat did not translate into differences in bird species composition between forest types. Species-habitat associations were on average stronger at the understory compared to the canopy level, which suggests that a combination of field and remote sensing data might better represent the species-specific response to forest resources when measuring the assembly of bird communities in mature plantations. This work suggests the fact that the combination of different levels of forest resources, such as that provided by mature non-native plantations and native forests, is able to support a rich bird community.

TI  - Remote sensing-based environmental assessment and monitoring - generation of operational baseline and enhanced experimental products in southern Africa
T2  - Biodiversity Ecol
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extension of the countries covered by SASSCAL, the diversity of their landscapes, and the range of social and ecological processes, constitute a challenge to environmental research. The latter have sometimes needed to focus on small test sites for very specific questions, or else required data and methods that allowed large area assessments. In either situation it is important that the studies are founded on consistent and comparable data. Responding to this requirement, a range of products based on operational earth observation satellite systems has been developed in the frame of SASSCAL. Here, we introduce the most relevant primary and derived products at coarse (250-500 m MODIS) and medium (30 m Landsat) spatial resolution, describe their basic properties, and provide examples of application as an impetus for further research. At the same time, alternative sources of data and advances in sensor systems offer high potential in complementing information from operational products, or provide further insights into specific local questions. We thus briefly touch upon the potential of such systems, including active sensing and/or airborne technologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar, Light Detection and Ranging, use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and hyperspectral imaging, and introduce studies carried under SASSCAL using these systems.

TI  - Coral reef habitat mapping: A combination of object-based image analysis and ecological modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being one of the most important and well-studied coral reefs in the world, the full extent of coral habitat of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is not well mapped and there is no current and comprehensive map of the GBR's geomorphic zonation or benthic composition. This paper demonstrates an approach that integrates ecological coral habitat mapping with empirical modelling to map the geomorphic zonation and benthic composition of the "shallow offshore reefs" of the GBR, using the Capricorn Bunker Group (CBG) as a case study. The approach combined environmental data sets and geo-ecological rule sets to identify geomorphic zones. The benthic composition of individual geomorphic zones was mapped for: shallow reef flat zones, using object-based image analysis with context driven rules based on coral reef ecology; and reef slope zones, using levels of wave exposure to predict the distribution of coral types. The environmental data sets used were field-based benthic composition data, Landsat 8 OLI satellite image-derived bottom reflectance, water depth and slope (15m x 15m pixel size) data, reef impact data, and modelled wave exposure. The study showed that the combination of geomorphic-ecological rules and models with remote sensing imagery provided robust mapping results over a large (similar to 2500 km(2)) reef system, of which 245 km(2) was mapped as shallow coral reefs and 88 km(2) of that was mapped as areas containing coral. Most importantly, the method produced defined the geomorphic zones and benthic composition of a study area that is significantly larger than the majority of coral reef remote sensing mapping projects previously published. With some modifications, the methods presented have the potential to be applied to the full extent of the shallow offshore reefs of the GBR, or any large reef globally. Monitoring and management of coral reefs for conservation and other purposes, at regional to global scales will benefit from the ability to produce and use this type of essential information on a regular basis.

TI  - Modeling land use changes and their impact on sediment load in a Mediterranean watershed
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to model potential changes in land use and evaluate their effects on sediment load in a Mediterranean watershed, the Carapelle, in Southern Italy. For this purpose, a set of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were processed to generate three different land use maps for 1987, 2002, and 2011. The images were corrected for geometric distortion and atmospheric interference before performing an unsupervised classification and decision expert system post classification. The land use maps for 1987 and 2002, derived from the Landsat TM processing, were analyzed using a Land Change Modeler (LCM) module to identify transitions from the first land cover type to the second. The transitions were modeled using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to create transition potential maps, which provide the controls for subsequent dynamic land use change predictions. The model produced a predicted land use map for 2011 using Markov Chain analysis, which was validated with the actual 2011 land use map. Consequently, a land use scenario (S1) for 2035 and 2050 was predicted, taking into account the current constraints and management options. LCM was further used to define two additional scenarios (S2 and S3) both for 2035 and 2050 based on different land management options.Finally, the Annual Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model (AnnAGNPS) was used to estimate the effect of the predicted land use changes on sediment load after model calibration, using a five-year dataset registered at the Ordona monitoring station.The land use change analysis revealed low transformations from 1987 to 2011. Equally, land use changes were low for the base scenario (S1) so moderate variations in sediment load were estimated. The changes in land use were more significant for the additional scenarios (S2 and S3) and consequently the model estimations underwent major variations, with a significant reduction of soil erosion. The associated utilization of land use change analysis and AnnAGNPS modeling demonstrates how land use management options can be adopted to reduce potential watershed sediment load.

TI  - A Mono-Window Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Estimation from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor Data: A Case Study of the Beas River Basin, India
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is estimated using thermal infrared remote sensing data, which record the apparent temperature of the earth's surface by measuring the radiant energy of its surface. However, it is also possible to estimate LST through satellite images and image processing software. The Landsat 8 satellite was successfully launched in 2013, with two thermal infrared bands for continuous earth observations to provide for the estimation of LST. However, the calibration notifications issued by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) indicate that the data from the Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) Band 11 show large uncertainty and thus, it was suggested to use TIRS Band 10 data as a single spectral band for LST estimation. In this study, we present a mono-window (MW) algorithm for LST estimation from the Landsat 8 (Path-147 and Row-38) using TIRS Band 10 data with a 100-m resolution. Emissivity was derived with the help of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) proportion of vegetation technique for which operational land imager (OLI) Bands 4 and 5 (30-m resolution) were used. The results show that the LST was higher in the regions of barren land but lower in snow-covered areas. Further, the LST results were also compared with the air temperature data and they were found to be in good agreement. The MW algorithm presented in the study could be used as an efficient method for LST estimation from the Landsat 8 TIRS Band 10 data.

CP  - Annual Workshop of the Fundamental-and-Applied-Ecotoxicology-Society (SEFA)
CL  - Reims, FRANCE
AB  - The aim of the present work was to extend our knowledge on the variability of trace metals in sea urchin tissues, focusing on seasonal fluctuations (2010 February for "winter," May for "spring," August for "summer," November for "autumn") in the three different sampling sites of Algerian west coast (Oran Harbor (S1), Ain Defla (S2), and Hadjaj (belonging to Mostaganem City S3)). For this purpose, the bioavailability (metal indices) and bioaccumulation (metal concentrations in soft tissues) of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd), the physiological characteristics (e.g., biological indices such as condition index (CI), repletion index (RI), gonad index (GI)), and the biometric parameters (diameter (D) and the height (H)) of sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus were assessed and related to seasons and sites. To investigate the metal bioavailability to sea urchins more precisely, the metal indices were used as a reliable tool in the present work, instead of the metal concentrations only. The interest to standardize metal concentrations with the weight of the urchin test is to overcome the metal burden variations in the soft tissues of urchin related to the seasonal weight changes of the soft body of animal. We evidence that the most contaminated sites were S1 and S2. Furthermore, it should be noted that the bioavailability of metals, corresponding to the values of metal indices, is also more pronounced in S1 and S2 compared to that measured in S3. Thus, a correlation is observed between seasonal metal content in urchin tissues from the three sites and the corresponding metal indices. The high metal concentrations were obtained during the period when RI and CI were highest. So, it appears that the bioaccumulation of metals in sea urchins of the three sites studied is significantly influenced by the reproductive cycle and diet, feeding activity, and physiological state of these organisms. We noticed that the sea urchins from the sites S1 and S2 were small in size. It is probable that these animals, whose internal tissues contained high concentrations of metals, have been exposed to metal pollution, which might have affected both their growth and altered their physiological capacity. This approach is very original and might be used in the monitoring of the quality of coastal waters, and the present work provided a useful data set for Mediterranean monitoring network.

TI  - Twice-Daily Telaprevir for Posttransplant Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus: A Prospective Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics Study
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Our objective was to determine the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of telaprevir plus pegylated interferon alfa 2a and ribavirin for chronic, posttransplant genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection.Materials and Methods: A prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label, phase 2b study was conducted at 22 North American sites to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of pegylated interferon alfa 2a, ribavirin, and twice daily telaprevir in liver transplant recipients with recurrent, chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis. Baseline liver biopsies were read by a central pathologist. There were planned safety reviews after a sentinel cohort reached treatment weeks 4 and 16. Serial pharmacokinetic sampling was performed for calcineurin inhibitors, telaprevir, and ribavirin.Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled and received >= 1 dose of study medication; 37 (61%) achieved sustained virologic response. Thirteen of 18 treatment-naive patients (72%), 10 of 11 patients with no or minimal fibrosis (91%), 13 of 15 patients (87%) with interleukin 28B genotype CC, and 36 of 45 patients (80%) with either undetectable or unquantifiable hepatitis C virus RNA at treatment week 4 achieved sustained virologic response. Nine patients (15%) had >= 1 drug-related serious adverse event and 7 (11%) discontinued all study drugs due to an adverse event. There were no deaths or acute cellular rejection episodes. During telaprevir treatment, median doses of tacrolimus and cyclosporine were 0.5 mg weekly and 25 mg daily. Target exposures were achieved for telaprevir with twice daily dosing and for ribavirin with reduced initial dosing.Conclusions: Telaprevir combination therapy for post transplant hepatitis C virus infection yielded superior efficacy than historical controls. Adverse events were similar to, but exceeded, those in immunocompetent patients. Calcineurin inhibitor dosing levels were substantially reduced with telaprevir.

TI  - Reflexive dis/embedding: Personal narratives, empowerment and the emotional dynamics of interstitial events
T2  - ORGANIZATION STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflexivity is required for institutional work, yet we know very little about the mechanisms for generating such understandings of the social world. We explore this gap through a case study of an interstitial event that aims to create a community of change-makers'. The findings suggest that such events can generate reflexive dis/embedding through two complementary mechanisms. Specifically, personal narratives of injustice and action and individual-collective empowering generate emotional dynamics that disembed actors from their given attachments and embed them within new social bonds. Through these mechanisms, the event in the case study was able to challenge audience members' conceptions of self and others and change their worldview. This research advances our understanding of how reflexivity can be developed by uncovering the emotional dynamics crucial to the dis/embedding of actors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The United States and Western Europe have seen great improvements in air quality, presumably in response to various regulations curtailing emissions from the broad range of sources that have contributed to local, regional, and global pollution. Such regulations, and the ensuing controls, however, have not come without costs, which are estimated at tens of billions of dollars per year. These costs motivate accountability-related questions such as, to what extent do regulations lead to emissions changes? More important, to what degree have the regulations provided the expected human health benefits?Here, the impacts of specific regulations on both electricity generating unit (EGU) and on-road mobile sources are examined through the classical accountability process laid out in the 2003 Health Effects Institute report linking regulations to emissions to air quality to health effects, with a focus on the 1999-2013 period. This analysis centers on regulatory actions in the southeastern United States and their effects on health outcomes in the 5-county Atlanta metropolitan area. The regulations examined are largely driven by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (C). This work investigates regulatory actions and controls promulgated on EGUs: the Acid Rain Program (ARP), the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP), and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) - and mobile sources: Tier 2 Gasoline Vehicle Standards and the 2007 Heavy Duty Diesel Rule.METHODS: Each step in the classic accountability process was addressed using one or more methods. Linking regulations to emissions was accomplished by identifying major federal regulations and the associated state regulations, along with analysis of individual facility emissions and control technologies and emissions modeling (e.g., using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [U.S. EPA's] MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator [MOVES] mobile-source model). Regulators, including those from state environmental and transportation agencies, along with the public service commissions, play an important role in implementing federal rules and were involved along with other regional stakeholders in the study. We used trend analysis, air quality modeling, satellite data, and a ratio-of-ratios technique to investigate a critical current issue, a potential large bias in mobile-source oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions estimates.The second link, emissions-air quality relationships, was addressed using both empirical analyses as well as chemical transport modeling employing the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filtering accounting for day of the year was used to separate the air quality signal into long-term, seasonal, weekday-holiday, and short-term meteorological signals. Regression modeling was then used to link emissions and meteorology to ambient concentrations for each of the species examined (ozone [O3], particulate matter ≤ 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], sulfate [SO4-2], nitrate [NO3-], ammonium [NH4+], organic carbon [OC], and elemental carbon [EC]). CMAQ modeling was likewise used to link emissions changes to air quality changes, as well as to further establish the relative roles of meteorology versus emissions change impacts on air quality trends. CMAQ and empirical modeling were used to investigate aerosol acidity trends, employing the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic equilibrium model to calculate pH based on aerosol composition. The relationships between emissions and meteorology were then used to construct estimated counterfactual air quality time series of daily pollutant concentrations that would have occurred in the absence of the regulations. Uncertainties in counterfactual air quality were captured by the construction of 5,000 pollutant time series using a Monte Carlo sampling technique, accounting for uncertainties in emissions and model parameters.Health impacts of the regulatory actions were assessed using data on cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits, using patient-level data in the Atlanta area for the 1999-2013 period. Four outcome groups were chosen based on previous studies identifying associations with ambient air pollution: a combined respiratory disease (RD) category; the subgroup of RD presenting with asthma; a combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) category; and the subgroup of CVD presenting with congestive heart failure (CHF).Models were fit to estimate the joint effects of multiple pollutants on ED visits in a time-series framework, using Poisson generalized linear models accounting for overdispersion, with a priori model formulations for temporal and meteorological covariates and lag structures. Several parameterizations were considered for the joint-effects models, including different sets of pollutants and models with nonlinear pollutant terms and first-order interactions among pollutants. Use of different periods for parameter estimates was assessed, as associations between pollutant levels and ED visits varied over the study period. A 7-pollutant, nonlinear model with pollutant interaction terms was chosen as the baseline model and fitted using pollutant and outcome data from 1999-2005 before regulations might have substantially changed the toxicity of pollutant mixtures. In separate analyses, these models were fitted using pollutant and outcome data from the entire 1999-2013 study period. Daily counterfactual time series of pollutant concentrations were then input into the health models, and the differences between the observed and counterfactual concentrations were used to estimate the impacts of the regulations on daily counts of ED visits. To account for the uncertainty in both the estimation of the counterfactual time series of ambient pollutant levels and the estimation of the health model parameters, we simulated 5,000 sets of parameter estimates using a multivariate normal distribution based on the observed variance-covariance matrix, allowing for uncertainty at each step of the chain of accountability. Sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the robustness of the results.RESULTS: EGU NOx and SO2 emissions in the Southeast decreased by 82% and 83%, respectively, between 1999 and 2013, while mobile-source emissions controls led to estimated decreases in Atlanta-area pollutant emissions of between 61% and 93%, depending on pollutant. While EGU emissions were measured, mobile-source emissions were modeled. Our results are supportive of a potential high bias in mobile-source NOx and CO emissions estimates. Air quality benefits from regulatory actions have increased as programs have been fully implemented and have had varying impacts over different seasons. In a scenario that accounted for all emissions reductions across the period, observed Atlanta central monitoring site maximum daily 8-hour (MDA8h) O3 was estimated to have been reduced by controls in the summertime and increased in the wintertime, with a change in mean annual MDA8h O3 from 39.7 ppb (counterfactual) to 38.4 ppb (observed). PM2.5 reductions were observed year-round, with average 2013 values at 8.9 mug/m3 (observed) versus 19.1 mug/m3 (counterfactual). Empirical and CMAQ analyses found that long-term meteorological trends across the Southeast over the period examined played little role in the distribution of species concentrations, while emissions changes explained the decreases observed. Aerosol pH, which plays a key role in aerosol formation and dynamics and may have health implications, was typically very low (on the order of 1-2, but sometimes much lower), with little trend over time despite the stringent SO2 controls and SO42- reductions.Using health models fit from 1999-2005, emissions reductions from all selected pollution-control policies led to an estimated 55,794 cardiorespiratory disease ED visits prevented (i.e., fewer observed ED visits than would have been expected under counterfactual scenarios) - 52,717 RD visits, of which 38,038 were for asthma, and 3,057 CVD visits, of which 2,104 were for CHF - among the residents of the 5-county area over the 1999-2013 period, an area with approximately 3.5 million people in 2013. During the final two years of the study (2012-2013), when pollution-control policies were most fully implemented and the associated benefits realized, these policies were estimated to prevent 5.9% of the RD ED visits that would have occurred in the absence of the policies (95% interval estimate: -0.4% to 12.3%); 16.5% of the asthma ED visits (95% interval estimate: 7.5% to 25.1%); 2.3% of the CVD ED visits (95% interval estimate: -1.8% to 6.2%); and -.6% of the CHF ED visits (95% interval estimate: 26.3% to 10.4%). Estimates of ED visits prevented were generally lower when using health models fit for the entire 1999-2013 study period.Sensitivity analyses were conducted to show the impact of the choice of parameterization of the health models and to assess alternative definitions of the study area. When impacts were assessed for separate policy interventions, policies affecting emissions from EGUs, especially the ARP and the NBP, appeared to have had the greatest effect on prevention of RD and asthma ED visits.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of regulations on improving air quality and health in the southeastern United States. It also demonstrates the complexities of accountability assessments as uncertainties are introduced in each step of the classic accountability process. While accounting for uncertainties in emissions, air quality-emissions relationships, and health models does lead to relatively large uncertainties in the estimated outcomes due to specific regulations, overall the benefits of regulations have been substantial.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Land Cover Classification with Sequential Recurrent Encoders
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) sensors deliver data at daily or weekly intervals. Most land use and land cover classification (LULC) approaches, however, are designed for cloud-free and mono-temporal observations. The increasing temporal capabilities of today's sensors enable the use of temporal, along with spectral and spatial features. Domains such as speech recognition or neural machine translation, work with inherently temporal data and, today, achieve impressive results by using sequential encoder-decoder structures. Inspired by these sequence-to-sequence models, we adapt an encoder structure with convolutional recurrent layers in order to approximate a phenological model for vegetation classes based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel 2 (S2) images. In our experiments, we visualize internal activations over a sequence of cloudy and non-cloudy images and find several recurrent cells that reduce the input activity for cloudy observations. Hence, we assume that our network has learned cloud-filtering schemes solely from input data, which could alleviate the need for tedious cloud-filtering as a preprocessing step for many EO approaches. Moreover, using unfiltered temporal series of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data, our experiments achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracies on a large number of crop classes with minimal preprocessing, compared to other classification approaches.

TI  - Numerical Modeling of the Wave Energy Propagation in the Iberian Nearshore
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work the wave energy propagation patterns in the western side of the Iberian nearshore were evaluated. This assessment takes into account the results provided by a wave modelling system based on spectral phase averaged wave models, which considers subsequent computational domains with increasing resolution towards the coast. The system was previously validated against both in situ measurements and remotely sensed data. Moreover, several data assimilation techniques were implemented as well. In this way, the reliability of the wave predictions was significantly increased. Although extended wave hindcasts have already been carried out close to the Iberian coast of the Atlantic Ocean, including wave energy assessments, they might not be completely accurate because of recent changes in the dynamics of the ocean and coastal wave climate. Thus, the present work considers wave nowcasts that correspond to the most recent and relevant wave energy propagation patterns in the targeted coastal environment. In order to perform this analysis, four different computational levels were considered. The first level corresponds to the sub oceanic domain and it is linked directly to the oceanic wave model, which is implemented over the entire North Atlantic Ocean. The second is related to the coarser computational domains of the coastal areas, while the third relates to the high-resolution domains. These three levels are defined as spherical coordinates (longitude, latitude). Finally, the last computational level includes some coastal areas which have the highest spatial resolution, defined considering the Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, for each level several computational domains have been considered. This work illustrates the most recent and significant wave transformation and energy propagation patterns corresponding to 18 computational domains with various resolutions in the western Iberian coastal environment.

TI  - Fatty Acid Synthase and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Are Expressed in Nodal Metastatic Melanoma But Not in Benign Intracapsular Nodal Nevi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma is a potentially lethal form of skin cancer for which the current standard therapy is complete surgical removal of the primary tumor followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy when indicated. Histologic identification of metastatic melanoma in a sentinel node has significant prognostic and therapeutic implications, routinely guiding further surgical management with regional lymphadenectomy. While melanocytes in a lymph node can be identified by routine histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination, the distinction between nodal nevus cells and melanoma can be morphologically problematic. Previous studies have shown that malignant melanoma can over-express metabolic genes such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). This immunohistochemical study aims to compare the utility of FASN and ACC in differentiating sentinel lymph nodes with metastatic melanomas from those with benign nodal nevi in patients with cutaneous melanoma.Materials and Methods: Using antibodies against FASN and ACC. 13 sentinel lymph nodes from 13 patients with metastatic melanoma and 14 lymph nodes harboring benign intracapsular nevi from 14 patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma were examined. A diagnosis of nodal melanoma was based on cytologic atypia and histologic comparison with the primary melanoma. All nodal nevi were intracapsular and not trabecular. Immunohistochemistiy for Melan-A, S100, human melanoma black 45 (HMB45). FASN, and ACC were performed. The percentage of melanocytes staining with HMB45, FASN, and ACC was determined and graded in 25% increments; staining intensity was graded as weak, moderate, or strong.Results: All metastatic melanomas tested had at least 25% tumor cell staining for both FASN and ACC. Greater than 75% of the tumor cells stained with FAS in 7/13 cases and for ACC in 5/12 cases. Intensity of staining was variable; strong staining for FASN and ACC was observed in 69% and 50% of metastatic melanoma, respectively. HMB45 was negative in 40% of nodal melanoma cases all of which stained with FASN and ACC. Capsular nevi were uniformly negative for FASN, ACC, and HMB45 immtmoreactivity.Conclusions: All metastatic melanoma cases involving sentinel lymph nodes were positive for FASN and ACC while no staining was observed in intracapsular nevi. These findings suggest that FASN and ACC could be used as valuable ancillary stains in the distinction between nodal nevi and metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology guidelines 2015 for the treatment of vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer are relatively rare tumors, and there had been no established treatment principles or guidelines to treat these rare tumors in Japan. The first version of the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology (JSGO) guidelines for the treatment of vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer was published in 2015 in Japanese.The JSGO committee decided to publish the English version of the JSGO guidelines worldwide, and hope it will be a useful guide to physicians in a similar situation as in Japan.The guideline was created according to the basic principles in creating the guidelines of JSGO.The guidelines consist of five chapters and five algorithms. Prior to the first chapter, basic items are described including staging classification and history, classification of histology, and definition of the methods of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy to give the reader a better understanding of the contents of the guidelines for these rare tumors. The first chapter gives an overview of the guidelines, including the basic policy of the guidelines. The second chapter discusses vulvar cancer, the third chapter discusses vaginal cancer, and the fourth chapter discusses vulvar Paget's disease and malignant melanoma. Each chapter includes clinical questions, recommendations, backgrounds, objectives, explanations, and references. The fifth chapter provides supplemental data for the drugs that are mentioned in the explanation of clinical questions.Overall, the objective of these guidelines is to clearly delineate the standard of care for vulvar and vaginal cancer with the goal of ensuring a high standard of care for all women diagnosed with these rare diseases.

TI  - Intraoperative Imprint Cytology of Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer After Negative Preoperative Ultrasound Assessment of Axilla <i>How Many Second Operations Are Avoided?</i>
T2  - ANALYTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE CYTOPATHOLOGY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative imprint cytology (IOIC) of sentinel lymph node (SLN) allows axillary surgery in one sitting in patients with positive SLN, but a second operation may then become necessary to clear margins of the primary tumor. Axillary ultrasound now identifies approximately half the node-positive axillae, reducing the need for intraoperative testing. We studied how many second operations were avoided by IOIC of the SLN.STUDY DESIGN: Large district general hospital breast unit, retrospective review.RESULTS: We reviewed 491 patients with negative preoperative axillary ultrasound who underwent SLN biopsy and IOIC over an 8-year period. A total of 108 patients (22%) had macrometastasis in the SLN, and 81 (75%) were diagnosed intraoperatively and underwent axillary clearance in the same sitting. However, 13 of those 81 patients required further surgery to get adequate margins for primary tumor.CONCLUSION: Only 22% of patients in this study had positive sentinel lymph nodes in the axilla. The false negative rate of IOIC was 25%. 16% of patients whose node positivity was intraoperatively diagnosed still required further surgery for primary tumor. IOIC helped to avoid 81 cases of delayed axillary clearances and 68 reoperations in 491 patients. Imprint cytology is inexpensive and quick and remains a worthwhile addition to breast cancer surgery.

TI  - The eighth TNM classification system for lung cancer: A consideration based on the degree of pleural invasion and involved neighboring structures
T2  - LUNG CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The eighth tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system for lung cancer has been used since January 2017 and must be applied to an individual institution's database.Methods: We analyzed pathological stage data of 2756 patients who underwent resection of non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly in terms of the degree of visceral pleural invasion and involved neighboring structures.Results: Few patients had stage IIA disease (103, 4%); stratification between stages IB and IIA was insufficient (p = 0.129). When T2a tumors were divided into PL1 and PL2 subgroups based on the degree of pleural invasion, there was a significant prognostic difference between the subgroups (p < 0.001). By incorporating T2a tumors with PL2 (T2a-PL2) into the T2b category, modified stages IB, IIA (234, 8%), and IIB were well stratified (IB vs. IIA, p < 0.001; IIA vs. IIB, p = 0.011). Focusing on T3 tumors with PL3 (T3-PL3) invading neighboring structures, multivariate analysis for surveying pT3N0-2M0 tumors revealed that completeness of resection (p = 0.002), implementation of any postoperative therapies (p = 0.003), and subcategorization of whether only the pleura was infiltrated or other deeper structures were also invaded (p = 0.024) were significant and crucial predictors. N2 disease showed worse outcome than NO-1 diseases, with marginal difference (p = 0.054).Conclusion: T2a-PL2 tumors could be categorized into a worse prognostic T2b category. For T3-PL3 tumors involving resectable neighboring organs, subcategorization of whether there is only pleura infiltration (T3a) or other deeper structure invasion (T3b) could be a practical consideration.

TI  - Refined shape model fitting methods for detecting various types of phenological information on major US crops
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenological information is a critical variable in evaluating the influence of environmental stress on the final crop yield in spatio-temporal dimensions. Although the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Dynamics product (MCD12Q2) is widely used in place of crop phenological information, the definitions of MCD12Q2-derived phenological events (e.g. green-up date, dormancy date) were not completely consistent with those of crop development stages used in statistical surveys (e.g. emerged date, harvested date). It has been necessary to devise an alternative method focused on detecting continental-scale crop developmental stages using a different approach. Therefore, this study aimed to refine the Shape Model Fitting (SMF) method to improve its applicability to multiple major U.S. crops. The newly-refined SMF methods could estimate the timing of 36 crop-development stages of major U.S. crops, including corn, soybeans, winter wheat, spring wheat, barley, sorghum, rice, and cotton. The newly-developed calibration process did not require any long-term field observation data, and could calibrate crop-specific phenological parameters, which were used as coefficients in estimated equation, by using only freely accessible public data. The calibration of phenological parameters was conducted in two steps. In the first step, the national common phenological parameters, referred to as X-0[base], were calibrated by using the statistical data of 2008. The SMF method coupled using X-0[base] was named the rSMF[base] method. The second step was a further calibration to gain regionally adjusted phenological parameters for each state, referred to as X-0[local], by using additional statistical data of 2015 and 2016. The rSMF method using the X-0[local] was named the rSMF[local] method. This second calibration process improved the estimation accuracy for all tested crops. When applying the rSMF[base] method to the validation data set (2009-2014), the root mean square error (RMSE) of the rSMF[base]-derived estimates ranged from 7.1 days (corn) to 15.7 days (winter wheat). When using the rSMF[local] method, the RMSE of the rSMF[local]-derived estimates improved and ranged from 5.6 days (corn) to 12.3 days (winter wheat). The results showed that the second calibration step for the rSMF[local] method could correct the region-dependent bias error between the rSMF[base]-derived estimates and the statistical data. A comparison between the performances of the refined SMF methods and the MCD12Q2 products, indicated that both of the rSMF methods were superior to the MCD12Q2 products in estimating all phenological stages, except for the case of the rSMF[base]-derived barley emerged stages. The phenological stages for which the rSMF[local] showed the best estimation accuracy were the corn silking stage (RMSE = 4.3 days); the soybeans dropping leaves stage (RMSE = 4.9 days); the headed stages of winter wheat (RMSE = 11.1 days), barley (RMSE = 6.1 days), and sorghum (RMSE = 9.5 days); the spring-wheat harvested stage (RMSE = 5.5 days); the rice emerged stage (RMSE = 5.5 days), and the cotton squaring stage (RMSE = 6.6 days). These were more accurate than the results achieved by the MCD12Q2 products. In addition, the rSMF[local]-derived estimates were superior in terms of the reproducibility of the annual variation range, particularly of the late reproductive stages, such as the mature and harvested stages.The crop phenology maps derived from the SMF [local] method were also in good agreement with the relevant maps derived from statistics, and could reveal the characteristic spatial pattern of the key phenological stages at the continental scale with fine spatial resolution. For example, the winter-wheat headed stage clearly became later from south to north. The cotton squaring stage became earlier from the central region towards both coastal regions.

T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides caused by a low magnitude earthquake swarm (2.8 <= M <= 3.6) in 2012 were documented at the Santa Rosa Canyon in northeastern Mexico. Disrupted landslides from falls and slides, in both rocks and soils, were identified based on fieldwork and high-resolution satellite imagery along stream banks from natural cliffs and along the road cut in the epicentral area. Most of the landslides occurred on slopes greater than 40 degrees, where geological features played a key role in triggering slope instabilities. The maximum distance limit for disrupted slides from the epicentral area was 7 km. The area affected by landslides during the early stage of the seismic sequence (July through August 2012) was 90 km(2). Landslide identification was limited in some areas by the resolution of the satellite imagery and dense cloud coverage. Both the epicentral distance and the area affected by landslides are above the global bounds reported in literature. The final landslide inventory is the first documented case of earthquake-induced landslides in northeastern Mexico.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common non-melanoma skin cancer type. The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnosis of CSCC micrometastases using sentinel lymphatic node biopsy (SLNB) in sentinel lymphatic nodes (SLN) in patients with high-risk and low-risk CSCC.A prospective clinical study was carried out. Patients with clinically diagnosed and histologically confirmed CSCC were included in the study if no metastases were observed preoperatively. Patients were divided into low-risk (n = 42) and high-risk (n = 46) groups according to the risk factors. Patients underwent a one-stage operation, tumor excision, and SLNB. Primary tumor characteristics and metastases rates were compared between the groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software. A significance level of 0.05 was chosen.Micrometastases were found in three high-risk group patients (6.54%). However, the rate of micrometastases in the low-risk group was 0%. The mean size of primary tumors in the low-risk group was 0.97 cm +/- 0.44 and was 2.25 cm +/- 1.74 in the high-risk group (p < 0.001). The distribution of ulcerated and non-ulcerated tumors differed between the risk groups (p = 0.035). The mean Breslow thickness of CSCC was higher in the high-risk group (2.97 mm +/- 1.49 versus 1.39 mm +/- 0.51 in the low-risk group, p < 0.001).According to the results of our study, SLNB should be performed for high-risk CSCC patients only. Primary tumor size, depth, and fact of ulceration correlate with the rate of micrometastases, which is 6.54% for high-risk CSCC patients.

AB  - Background: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common malignant skin cancer with a tendency to spread through the lymphogenic pathway. Metastases are found in 2-6% of cases. The aim of this study was to determine CSCC micrometastases when non-invasive examination methods do not detect them.Method: A total of 88 patients were included in the study with clinically diagnosed, histologically confirmed CSCC and no distant or regional lymph node metastases detected during instrumental tests. The patients were grouped into low-and high-risk CSCC groups. They underwent one-stage surgery - radical tumour excision and sentinel lymph node/nodes biopsy (SLNB). Significance level of 0.05 was chosen for testing statistical hypotheses.Results: One hundred and fifty-three sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected and excised in 88 patients. Micrometastases were found in five SLNs of three patients with high-risk CSCC. The rate of micrometastases was 3.4%; however, in the high-risk group it was 6.5%. The mean diameter of CSCC with micrometastases in SLN was 5.6 +/- 3.5 cm, and that without micrometastases was 1.5 +/- 1.1 cm (p = 0.003). The depth of CSCC according to Breslow in the patients with detected micrometastases in SLN was 3.5 +/- 1.2 mm, and that without detected micrometastases was 2.2 +/- 1.4 mm (p = 0.047). Patients with micrometastases in sentinel lymphatic nodes underwent radical lymphadenectomy. There was neither recurrence of CSCC metastases in regional lymph nodes nor distant metastases during the research period detected.Conclusions: In patients with CSCC the rate of micrometastases directly correlates with the depth and diameter of the tumour. In patients with high-risk CSCC the rate of micrometastases is 6.5%. (c) 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - HIV prevalence trend from HIV sentinel surveillance over a decade in India: An overview
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - We aim to describe trends in antenatal HIV prevalence in India, at a national and regional level from consistent sentinel surveillance sites (2003-2015) among Antenatal Clinic (ANC) attendees. Data were analyzed from a total of 1,885,207 ANC attendees recruited at ANC sites. The consistent sites were grouped by years of initiation (Group 1: 2003-2005 and Group 2: 2006-2008) and according to six regions. Chi-square test for linear trend was applied to test the statistical significance of the trend. Nationally, at Group 1 sites, HIV prevalence was 0.93% in 2003, which declined to 0.36% in 2015 (P < 0.001). Similarly, at Group 2 sites, prevalence ranged from 0.25% to 0.23% during 2006-2015 (P > 0.05). The findings suggest that HIV is conclusively declining at old sites, nationally as well as in most of the other regions but increasing in the northern region. At newer sites, the conclusive declining trend is evident only in the southern region. National AIDS response must consider these variations to allow locally appropriate responses to the epidemic.

TI  - Semi-natural habitats boost <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> populations and crop damage in sweet cherry
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although increasing landscape complexity is often advocated as a key intervention to sustain pest biocontrol, little is known on how increasing semi-natural habitats surrounding the crop can directly affect the density and damage of generalist pests. Our aim was to test how semi-natural habitats in the landscape influences the density and the impact of spotted wing drosophila (SWD) on sweet cherry. SWD is invasive pest native of South-East Asia that causes severe yield losses in several crops worldwide. We selected 32 conventional cherry orchards in NE Italy surrounded by landscapes with different proportions of forest and we quantified both pest density and crop damage using sentinel fruits. We observed a larger attack density in orchards surrounded by higher forest cover. The same trend was observed for female adult density. Forest habitats may provide ideal microclimatic conditions and alternative host plants that can promote population growth. The effect size of forest cover on both adult density and crop damage, despite the very large tested forest gradient (0-60%), suggests that a reduction of forest cover does not seem to be a viable option for controlling SWD. Indeed, semi-natural habitats can deliver multiple fundamental ecosystem services to the crops (e.g. biocontrol). However, current integrated pest management should take into account landscape composition and interventions should be particularly timely in forested landscapes where SWD can quickly attack the crop at higher density.

TI  - Research Pathways of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Estimation Based on SAR Backscatter and Interferometric SAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forest biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR) observables has been surveyed in 186 peer-reviewed papers to identify major research pathways in terms of data used and retrieval models. Research evaluated primarily (i) L-band observations of SAR backscatter; and, (ii) single-image or multi-polarized retrieval schemes. The use of multi-temporal or multi-frequency data improved the biomass estimates when compared to single-image retrieval. Low frequency SAR backscatter contributed the most to the biomass estimates. Single-pass InSAR height was reported to be a more reliable predictor of biomass, overcoming the loss of sensitivity of SAR backscatter and coherence in high biomass forest. A variety of empirical and semi-empirical regression models relating biomass to the SAR observables were proposed. Semi-empirical models were mostly used for large-scale mapping because of the simple formulation and the robustness of the model parameters estimates to forest structure and environmental conditions. Non-parametric models were appraised for their capability to ingest multiple observations and perform accurate retrievals having a large number of training samples available. Some studies argued that estimating compartment biomass (in stems, branches, foliage) with different types of SAR observations would lead to an improved estimate of total biomass. Although promising, scientific evidence for such an assumption is still weak. The increased availability of free and open SAR observations from currently orbiting and forthcoming spaceborne SAR missions will foster studies on forest biomass retrieval. Approaches attempting to maximize the information content on biomass of individual data streams shall be pursued.

TI  - SAR Mode Altimetry Observations of Internal Solitary Waves in the Tropical Ocean Part 1: Case Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that internal waves (IWs) of tidal frequency (i.e., internal tides) are successfully detected in sea surface height (SSH) by satellite altimetry. Shorter period internal solitary waves (ISWs), whose periods (and spatial scales) are an order of magnitude smaller than tidal internal waves, have been generally assumed too small to be detected with conventional altimeters. This is because conventional (pulse-limited) radar altimeter footprints are somewhat larger than or of similar size, at best, as the typical wavelengths of the ISWs. Here we demonstrate that the synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL) on board the Sentinel-3A can detect short-period ISWs. A variety of signatures owing to the surface manifestations of the ISWs are apparent in the SRAL Level-2 products over the ocean. These signatures are identified in several geophysical parameters, such as radar backscatter (sigmaO), sea level anomaly (SLA), and significant wave height (SWH). Radar backscatter is the primary parameter in which ISWs can be identified owing to the measurable sea surface roughness perturbations in the along-track sharpened SRAL footprint. The SRAL footprint is sufficiently small to capture radar power fluctuations over successive wave crests and troughs, which produce rough and slick surface patterns arrayed in parallel bands with scales of a few kilometers. The ISW signatures are unambiguously identified in the SRAL because of the exact synergy with OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Imager) images, which in cloud-free conditions allow clear identification of the ISWs in the sunglint OLCI images. We show that both sigmaO and SLA yield realistic estimates for routine observation of ISWs with the SRAL, which is a significant improvement from previous observations recently reported for conventional pulse-limited altimeters (Jason-2). Several case studies of ISW signatures are interpreted in light of our knowledge of radar backscatter in the internal wave field. An analysis is presented for the tropical Atlantic Ocean off the Amazon shelf to infer the frequency of the phenomena, being consistent with previous satellite observations in the study region.

TI  - The Effect of Seasonal Floods on Health: Analysis of Six Years of National Health Data and Flood Maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is limited knowledge on the effect of seasonal flooding on health over time. We quantified the short- and long-term effects of floods on selected health indicators at public healthcare facilities in 11 districts in Cambodia, a flood-prone setting. Counts of inpatient discharge diagnoses and outpatient consultations for diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections, injuries, noncommunicable diseases and vector-borne diseases were retrieved from public healthcare facilities for each month between January 2008 and December 2013. Flood water was mapped by month, in square kilometers, from satellite data. Poisson regression models with three lag months were constructed for the health problems in each district, controlled for seasonality and long-term trends. During times of flooding and three months after, there were small to moderate increases in visits to healthcare facilities for skin infections, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea, while no association was seen at one to two months. The associations were small to moderate, and a few of our results were significant. We observed increases in care seeking for diarrhea, skin infections, and acute respiratory infections following floods, but the associations are uncertain. Additional research on previous exposure to flooding, using community- and facility-based data, would help identify expected health risks after floods in flood-prone settings.

TI  - Shifts in Forest Structure in Northwest Montana from 1972 to 2015 Using the Landsat Archive from Multispectral Scanner to Operational Land Imager
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a pressing need to map changes in forest structure from the earliest time period possible given forest management policies and accelerated disturbances from climate change. The availability of Landsat data from over four decades helps researchers study an ecologically meaningful length of time. Forest structure is most often mapped utilizing lidar data, however these data are prohibitively expensive and cover a narrow temporal window relative to the Landsat archive. Here we describe a technique to use the entire length of the Landsat archive from Multispectral Scanner to Operational Land Imager (M2O) to produce three novel outcomes: (1) we used the M2O dataset and standard change vector analysis methods to classify annual forest structure in northwestern Montana from 1972 to 2015, (2) we improved the accuracy of each yearly forest structure classification by applying temporal continuity rules to the whole time series, with final accuracies ranging from 97% to 68% respectively for two and six-category classifications, and (3) we demonstrated the importance of pre-1984 Landsat data for long-term change studies. As the Landsat program continues to acquire Earth imagery into the foreseeable future, time series analyses that aid in classifying forest structure accurately will be key to the success of any land management changes in the future.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Surgical Management of Melanoma of the External Ear
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Historically, external ear melanomas have been treated aggressively, due to early perceptions suggesting they had poor prognosis and aggressive biological behavior. More recent evidence has not supported these notions.Methods: We completed a complete review of the literature involving malignant melanoma of the external ear. We then completed a quantitative analysis on seventy-three cases from 8 reports that contained case-level data, assessing factors that influence recurrence, and assessing characteristics of the melanomas based on histological subtype. Baseline and outcomes data for all 20 studies were then compiled but not statistically evaluated.Results: In our subanalysis, patients who had recurrence were significantly more likely to have had wedge resection versus wide-local excision, and those with no recurrence were more likely to have undergone wide local excision. Nodular tumors had significantly greater thickness. Overall, conservative excisions provided excellent outcomes.Conclusions: Conservative treatment for external ear melanoma produces satisfactory outcomes. There is no evidence to support the use of radical amputation and little evidence to support the removal of cartilage or perichondrium. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is warranted only with positive nodes. There is no role for elective neck dissection. The roles for chemo/radiation therapy are unclear and guidelines for other cutaneous melanomas should be followed.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy of Sentinel-1A and 1B Derived from SAR Raw Data with GPS Surveyed Corner Reflector Positions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometric accuracy of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is usually derived from level-1 products using accurately surveyed comer reflector positions. This paper introduces a novel approach that derives the range delay and azimuth shift from acquired SAR raw data (level-0 products). Therefore, the propagation path is completely retrieved from SAR pulse transmission up to the reception of the point target's backscatter. The procedure includes simple pulse compression in range and azimuth instead of full SAR data processing. By applying this method, the geometric accuracy of ESA's Sentinel-1 SAR satellites (Sentinel-iA and Sentinel-iB) is derived for each satellite overpass by using corner reflectors with precisely surveyed GPS positions. The results show that the azimuth bias of about 2 m found in level-1 products for Stripmap acquisitions is reduced to about 15 cm. This indicates an artificial bias arising from operational Sentinel-1 SAR data processing. The remaining range bias of about 1.0 m, observed in LO-products, is interpreted as the offset between the SAR antenna phase center and the spacecraft's center of gravity. The relative pixel localization accuracy derived with the proposed method is about 12 cm for the evaluated acquisitions. Compared to the full processed level-1 SAR data products, this accuracy is similar in the range direction, but, for the azimuth direction, it is improved by about 50% with the proposed method.

TI  - Long-term land use change analysis in south-central Angola. Assessing the trade-off between major ecosystem services with remote sensing data
T2  - Biodiversity Ecol
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry tropical forests are facing large-scale conversion and degradation processes and are the most endangered forest type worldwide. We analyse these processes in the dry tropical forest type of miombo woodlands in a rural area of south-central Angola. We show that large-scale conversion to agricultural areas takes place in this area, as does modification of woodland areas, i.e. by degradation due to the extraction of natural resources. By using remote sensing data, spatial drivers of this conversion and its effects may be assessed for the time period 1989-2013. We identify settlement dynamics and the location and quality of streets as major underlying determining factors for conversion processes. Since the 1980s, the rate of agricultural expansion has strongly depended on socioeconomic background factors and is currently on a level of ca. 9 000 ha/year in the study area. Fallows were found to only slowly regenerate, and there is a change in cultivation pattern to more permanent forms of cultivation. Large portions of the study area are undergoing degradation processes, leading to an additional loss of biomass. The results indicate that there is high pressure on the natural ecosystems of the study area, which will probably aggravate in the future with a high likelihood of emerging land use conflicts.

TI  - Assessment of geomorphological and hydrological changes produced by Pleistocene glaciations in a Patagonian basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to assess how Pleistocene glaciations modeled the landscape in the upper Senguer River basin and its relationship to current watershed features (drainage surface and fluvial hydrological regime). During the Pleistocene six glacial lobes developed in the upper basin of the Senguer River localized east of the Andean range in southern Argentinean Patagonia between 43 degrees 36' - 46 degrees 27' S. To describe the topography and hydrology, map the geomorphology, and propose an evolution of the study area during the Pleistocene we employed multitemporal Landsat images, national geological sheets and a mosaic of the digital elevation model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) along with fieldwork. The main conclusion is that until the Middle Pleistocene, the drainage divide of the Senguer River basin was located to the west of its current limits and its rivers drained the meltwater of the glaciers during interglacial periods. However, processes of drainage inversion and drainage surface reduction occurred in the headwater of most rivers of the basin during the Late Pleistocene. Those processes were favored by a relative shorter glacial extension during LGM and the dam effect produced by the moraines of the Post GPG I and III glaciations. Thus, since the Late Pleistocene, the headwaters of several rivers in the basin have been reduced, and the moraines corresponding to the Middle Pleistocene glaciations currently divide the watersheds that drain towards the Senguer River from those that flow west towards the Pacific Ocean.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data and SLEUTH Urban Growth Model: As Decision Support Tools for Urban Planning
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sri Lanka is experiencing speedy urbanization by converting the agriculture land and other natural land cover into built-up land. The urban population of Sri Lanka is expected to reach to 60% by 2030 from 14% in 2010. The rapid growth in urban population and urban areas in Sri Lanka may cause serious socioeconomic disparities, if they are not handled properly. Thus, planners in Sri Lanka are in need of information about past and future urban growth patterns to plan a better and sustainable urban future for Sri Lanka. In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of past land use and land cover trends in Matara City of Sri Lanka from 1980 to 2010 to assess the historic urban dynamics. The land use change detection analysis based on remote sensing datasets reveal that the conversion of homestead/ garden and paddy into urban land is evident in Matara City. The historic urban trends are projected into the near future by using SLEUTH urban growth model to identify the hot spots of future urbanization and as well as the urban growth patterns in Matara City up to the basic administrative level, i.e., Grama Niladari Divisions (GND). The urban growth simulations for the year 2030 reveal that 29 GNDs out of 66 GNDs in Matara City will be totally converted into urban land. Whereas, 28 GNDs will have urban land cover from 75% to 99% by 2030. The urban growth simulations are further analyzed with respect to the proposed Matara city development plan by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) of Sri Lanka. The results show that the UDA's city development plan of Matara will soon be outpaced by rapid urbanization. Based on the calibration and validation results, the SLEUTH model proved to be a useful planning tool to understand the near future urbanization of Sri Lankan cities.

TI  - A High-Resolution SAR Focusing Experiment Based on GF-3 Staring Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a proven technique, which can provide high-resolution images as compared to those produced by traditional stripmap SAR. This paper addresses a high-resolution SAR focusing experiment based on Gaofen-3 satellite (GF-3) staring data with about 55 cm azimuth resolution and 240 MHz range bandwidth. In staring spotlight (ST) mode, the antenna always illuminates the same scene on the ground, which can extend the synthetic aperture. Based on a two-step processing algorithm, some special aspects such as curved-orbit model error correction, stop-and-go correction, and antenna pattern demodulation must be considered in image focusing. We provide detailed descriptions of all these aspects and put forward corresponding solutions. Using these suggested methods directly in an imaging module without any modification for other data processing software can make the most of the existing ground data processor. Finally, actual data acquired in GF-3 ST mode is used to validate these methodologies, and a well-focused, high-resolution image is obtained as a result of this focusing experiment.

TI  - Monitoring the Grassland Change in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: A Case Study on Aba County
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Located on the southeast edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, Aba County is the core area of the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project (RGLGP) on the plateau. For the purpose of monitoring the grassland change before and after the grassland protection project in Aba County, Landsat images acquired in 1996, 2003 and 2009 were analyzed. Using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) model, sub-pixel fractions of land cover components were obtained: bright vegetation (BV), dark vegetation (DV), bright soil (BS), dark soil (DS) and water. Fraction images present the distribution and proportions of typical land cover components in this study. Fractions BV and BS were chosen as two indicators for grassland degradation. Thereafter, Change Vector Analysis (CVA) model was applied on the two indicators. After the performance of the CVA model, change results which consisted of both grassland degradation and vegetation re-growth were obtained, showing the change patterns of grassland degradation and vegetation re-growing in Aba County between two gaps: from 1996 to 2003 (before the RGLGP) and from 2003 to 2009 (after the RGLGP). The change patterns of grassland degradation and vegetation re-growing can effectively assist in the development of environmental restoration measures and in the RGLGP plans for the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.

TI  - Stokes based sigma filter for despeckling of compact PolSAR data
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a speckle filtering technique is proposed for coherent compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data based on the statistics of Stokes parameters. The data processing and analysis of coherent compact PolSAR configurations usually start with Stokes vector representation of the data. In this study, the Stokes parameter statistics is discussed and validated, and a modified form of the state-of-the-art Lee sigma filter for compact PolSAR data is presented. Also, a novel algorithm for evaluation of sigma ranges as a function of the degree of polarisation and mean intensities is proposed. An approach based on the statistics of Stokes parameter g(1) for the distinction of homogeneous and heterogeneous areas is also presented in this study. The proposed technique is effective in speckle reduction, preservation of fine details, strong targets and scattering information. The m - chi decomposition with the proposed filter as a pre-processing step improves the land cover classification accuracy. The computational efficiency of the proposed filter is comparable to Lee sigma filter and hence the proposed filter is equally suitable for voluminous high resolution datasets. The results obtained from the developed speckle filter are validated for hybrid-PolSAR RISAT-1 data, hybrid-PolSAR data synthesised from RADARSAT-2 data and simulated PolSAR data by Monte Carlo simulation.

TI  - Dust Detection and Intensity Estimation Using Himawari-8/AHI Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, simple dust detection and intensity estimation methods using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data are developed. Based on the differences of thermal radiation characteristics between dust and other typical objects, brightness temperature difference (BTD) among four channels (BT11-BT12, BT8-BT11, and BT3-BT11) are used together for dust detection. When considering the thermal radiation variation of dust particles over different land cover types, a dynamic threshold scheme for dust detection is adopted. An enhanced dust intensity index (EDII) is developed based on the reflectance of visible/near-infrared bands, BT of thermal-infrared bands, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), and is applied to the detected dust area. The AOD is retrieved using multiple temporal AHI observations by assuming little surface change in a short time period (i. e., 1-2 days) and proved with high accuracy using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and cross-compared with MODIS AOD products. The dust detection results agree qualitatively with the dust locations that were revealed by AHI true color images. The results were also compared quantitatively with dust identification results from the AERONET AOD and Angstrdm exponent, achieving a total dust detection accuracy of 84%. A good agreement is obtained between EDII and the visibility data from National Climatic Data Center ground measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81, indicating the effectiveness of EDII in dust monitoring.

TI  - Global and regional evaluation of a global model simulated AODs with AERONET and MODIS observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical properties vary widely globally due to their short residence time and the large variability in their composition and size resulting from varying sources. In this study, we make use of the three-dimensional global atmospheric chemistry transport model MOZART (Model for OZone And Related chemical Tracers), to simulate Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs) and compare with observations from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, level-3) on board the Terra satellite and AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork level-2), at regional and global scale for the period 2000-2007. The AOD values at a reference wavelength 550 nm are reported for all the data sets. Model and observations show intense aerosol burden over the parts of the world where developing countries are located. On a regional scale, varying features are noted for different regions depending upon topography, regional emissions and weather conditions. MOZART captures the general features observed in AERONET and MODIS fairly well; however, in biomass burning dominated regions (Central South America, South Africa, and North Australia) it underestimates the observed AOD. In industrial regions (North Europe and Mediterranean) MOZART overestimates the observations and over dust dominant regions (Saharan Africa, Middle East, and East Asia), the model AODs are comparable to AERONET and MODIS observations. In general, MOZART simulated AOD show similar seasonal and regional variability as observed in AERONET and MODIS. Our results are similar to the most commonly used models, i.e. GOCART (the GOddard Chemistry, Aerosol, Radiation, and Transport) and GEOS-4 (Goddard Earth Observing System-version 4).

TI  - Validation of MODIS C6 Dark Target Aerosol Products at 3 km and 10 km Spatial Resolutions Over the China Seas and the Eastern Indian Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) level-2 Dark Target (DT) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K) spatial resolutions were validated over the China seas and the eastern Indian Ocean against Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) Level 1.5 AOD measurements collected through 13 cruises from 2010 to 2014. For this, DT3K and DT10K AOD observations were obtained from four Scientific Data Sets (SDS), i.e., "EffectiveOpticalDepth AverageOcean" (EODAO(AOD)), "Effective-Optical Depth Best Ocean" (EODBOAOD), " ImageOpticalDepthLandAndOcean" (IODLAO(AOD)) and "Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean" (ODLAO(AOD)). The MAN AOD measurements were filtered within (i) +/- L2 h, (ii) +/- 4 h, (iii) +/- 6 h, and (iv) +/- 12 h of MODIS overpass time. Results showed that the DT10K and DT3K performed equally over the China seas and the eastern Indian Ocean in terms of retrievals quality and agreement with the MAN AOD measurements, whereas the DT3K has less coincident observations than the DT10K. For seasonal analysis, larger underestimation in the DT algorithm was observed in autumn followed by spring, whereas retrievals were well correlated with the MAN AOD data in summer. Overall, this study found that ODLAO(AOD) observations for the DT3K and DT10K were much better than EODAO(AOD), EODBOAOD and IODLAO(AOD) in terms of high correlation and a large percentage of the AOD retrievals within the Expected Error (EE = +(0.04 + 10%), -(0.02 + 10%)).

TI  - Case Study Comparing Multiple Irrigated Land Datasets in Arizona and Colorado, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While there are currently a number of irrigated land datasets available for the western United States (U.S.), there is uncertainty regarding in how they relate to each other. To help understand the characteristics of available irrigated datasets, we compared (1) the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), (2) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Irrigated Agriculture Dataset (IAD), (3) Digitized Irrigated Land (DIL), and (4) Consumptive Use for Irrigation (CUI) data in Arizona and Colorado, U.S. These datasets were derived from multiple sources at various spatial resolutions and temporal scales. We found spatial and temporal trends among all of them. The datasets showed decreases in irrigated land area in Arizona during the 2000-2010 time period. The change ranges and ratios were similar in all Arizona datasets. Irrigated land in Colorado decreased in DIL and CUI but increased in IAD and CDL. The agreement within the same type of dataset during different time periods was from 60% to 80% (R-2 from 0.35 to 0.72) in Arizona and from 50% to 80% (R-2 from 0.23 to 0.68) in Colorado. DIL had the highest agreement (80%) in both states. The agreement among different datasets acquired at approximately the same time frame ranged from 51% to 63% (R-2 from 0.14 to 0.31) in Arizona and from 47% to 69% (R-2 from 0.32 to 0.40) in Colorado. The results from this study support a greater understanding of the multiresolution and multitemporal nature of these datasets for various applications.

TI  - Spatial and temporal evolution of eco-environmental quality in the oasis of Shiyang River Basin based on RSEDI
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the eco-environmental quality in Wuwei and Minqin oases of Shiyang River Basin based on the Landsat TM/OLI images in 1995, 2006, and 2016. Remote sensing ecological distance index (RSEDI) was used to assess the eco-environmental quality, which was calculated by several indices, including desertification index (DI), generalized difference vegetation index (GI), salinization index (SI), and wetness index (WI). The results showed that the ecological quality of Wuwei and Minqin oases was enhanced from 1995 to 2016, with the mean RSEDI increasing from 5.3 in 1995 to 14.8 in 2016. The area of ecological restoration was larger than that of ecological degradation. Spatially, the eco-environmental quality of Minqin oasis was overall in recovering mode. In contrast, the Wuwei oasis exhibited the recovering mode in the northwest region but the degrading mode in the southeast region. Among the three years examined here, the eco-environmental quality of the two oases in 1995 was poor based on the changes in profile map, with a significant spatial discrepancy. In 2006, the eco-environmental quality was the worst among the three years and its discrepancy was the least. The eco-environmental quality was the best in 2016, with significant spatial discrepancy. In general, the eco-environmental quality in the two oases of Shiyang River Basin has been significantly improved by the environmental rehabilitation in the recent decade.

TI  - Red Tide Detection through Image Fusion of GOCI and Landsat OLI
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to efficiently monitor red tide over a wide range, the need for red tide detection using remote sensing is increasing. However, the previous studies focus on the development of red tide detection algorithm for ocean colour sensor. In this study, we propose the use of multi-sensor to improve the inaccuracy for red tide detection and remote sensing data in coastal areas with high turbidity, which are pointed out as limitations of satellite-based red tide monitoring. The study area were selected based on the red tide information provided by National Institute of Fisheries Science, and spatial fusion and spectral-based fusion were attempted using GOCI image as ocean colour sensor and Landsat OLI image as terrestrial sensor. Through spatial fusion of the two images, both the red tide of the coastal area and the outer sea areas, where the quality of Landsat OLI image was low, which were impossible to observe in GOCI images, showed improved detection results. As a result of spectral-based fusion performed by feature-level and rawdata-level, there was no significant difference in red tide distribution patterns derived from the two methods. However, in the feature-level method, the red tide area tends to overestimated as spatial resolution of the image low. As a result of pixel segmentation by linear spectral unmixing method, the difference in the red tide area was found to increase as the number of pixels with low red tide ratio increased. For rawdata-level, Gram-Schmidt sharpening method estimated a somewhat larger area than PC spectral sharpening method, but no significant difference was observed. In this study, it is shown that coastal red tide with high turbidity as well as outer sea areas can be detected through spatial fusion of ocean colour and terrestrial sensor. Also, by presenting various spectral-based fusion methods, more accurate red tide area estimation method is suggested. It is expected that this result will provide more precise detection of red tide around the Korean peninsula and accurate red tide area information needed to determine countermeasure to effectively control red tide.

TI  - Characterizing dark mantle deposits in the lunar crater Alphonsus
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze available remote-sensing data of the crater Alphonsus, focusing on the analysis of the crater's dark mantle deposits (DMDs), which includes images from NASA Clementine and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), Japanese Selene (Kaguya), and Indian Chandrayaan-1 missions. The Alphonsus DMD5 are gentle-sloped flat hills with typical heights of several meters, which are presented with pyroclastic materials. Our determination of the absolute ages of the Alphonsus DMDs by the technique of crater size-frequency distributions shows that they are similar to 200-400 my. old. However, being geologically young, the Alphonsus DMDs are not seen in OMAT maps. The DMDs have noticeably lower content of TiO2 (2-3%) than the mare regions to the west (>4%). The assessment of total pyroxene shows it has a higher abundance in the DMDs, although LRO Diviner measurements of the Chirstiansen feature suggest, rather, a high abundance of olivine. The DMDs pyroclastic material has no signs of OH/H2O compounds. We may suggest that this characteristic of the DMD5 either relates to their impact reworking and loss of the OH/H2O compounds or to the non-water volatiles as the driving agent of the pyroclastic activity. The compositional assessments of the DMDs may be flawed from contamination with the surrounding material due to horizontal and vertical transportation due to impacts. This effect probably can be observed in LROC NAC images of high resolution. A very dark material outcropping on the slopes of the vent depression is seen due to renovation of the regolith on the steep walls of the depression. Thus, at smaller phase angles, the pyroclastic material is dark and at larger phase angles it appears almost like the surrounding material. This means that the phase dependence of the outcropping dark material is shallow; i.e. the dark surface is smoother than its surroundings. This may suggest venting of gases resulting in fluidization of the granular pyroclastic material of the deposit.

TI  - Determining Optimal New Generation Satellite Derived Metrics for Accurate C3 and C4 Grass Species Aboveground Biomass Estimation in South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While satellite data has proved to be a powerful tool in estimating C3 and C4 grass species Aboveground Biomass (AGB), finding an appropriate sensor that can accurately characterize the inherent variations remains a challenge. This limitation has hampered the remote sensing community from continuously and precisely monitoring their productivity. This study assessed the potential of a Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, and WorldView-2 sensors, with improved earth imaging characteristics, in estimating C3 and C4 grasses AGB in the Cathedral Peak, South Africa. Overall, all sensors have shown considerable potential in estimating species AGB; with the use of different combinations of the derived spectral bands and vegetation indices producing better accuracies. However, WorldView-2 derived variables yielded better predictive accuracies (R2 ranging between 0.71 and 0.83; RMSEs between 6.92% and 9.84%), followed by Sentinel 2, with R2 between 0.60 and 0.79; and an RMSE 7.66% and 14.66%. Comparatively, Landsat 8 yielded weaker estimates, with R2 ranging between 0.52 and 0.71 and high RMSEs ranging between 9.07% and 19.88%. In addition, spectral bands located within the red edge (e.g., centered at 0.705 and 0.745 urm for Sentinel 2), SWIR, and NIR, as well as the derived indices, were found to be very important in predicting C3 and C4 AGB from the three sensors. The competence of these bands, especially of the free-available Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 dataset, was also confirmed from the fusion of the datasets. Most importantly, the three sensors managed to capture and show the spatial variations in AGB for the target C3 and C4 grassland area. This work therefore provides a new horizon and a fundamental step towards C3 and C4 grass productivity monitoring for carbon accounting, forage mapping, and modelling the influence of environmental changes on their productivity.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the decision support system for agrometeorology transfer (DSSAT) v4.6 model has been used to simulate soil moisture and evapotranspiration over central India (Madhya Pradesh) for the period 1990-2011 during drought years. Drought years were identified using observed gridded rainfall datasets for the monsoon months June, July and August for selected stations viz., Balaghat, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur and Seoni in Madhya Pradesh. Remote sensing data from the European Space Agency (ESA) derived soil moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration have been used to compare the model simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration at daily scale. It is found that the ESA derived soil moisture and MODIS evapotranspiration are closer to model simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration respectively. RMS error of 0.07-0.17 m(3) m(-3) is noted in model simulated soil moisture for each station and RMS error of 60-100 mm is noticed in model simulated evapotranspiration over each station. Therefore, the DSSAT model simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration during drought years are useful parameters for drought monitoring and prediction during drought occurrences.

TI  - Characterization of sentinel node-derived antibodies from breast cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autoantibodies to breast and other cancers are commonly present in cancer patients. A method to rapidly produce these anti-cancer autoantibodies in the lab would be valuable for understanding immune events and to generate candidate reagents for therapy and diagnostics. The purpose of this report is to evaluate sentinel nodes (SNs) of breast cancer patients as a source of anti-cancer antibodies. Radiotracer lymphatic mapping in 29 patients with breast cancer confirmed the identity of the SNs which provided source cells for this study. Flow cytometry demonstrated similar to 28% of the MNCs were B cells and similar to 44% of the B cells were class switched memory B cells. EBV-induced proliferation of B cells yielded tumor binding antibodies from 3 wells per 1000 but cultures were too unstable for detailed evaluations. Hybridomas generated by electrofusion produced IgG (48%), IgM (34%) and IgA (18%) antibody isotypes which were screened for binding to a panel of breast cancer cells of the major molecular subtypes. Tumor lysate binding was observed in 28% of the hybridoma clones and 10% of these bound whole tumor cells with unique binding patterns. More detailed evaluation of selected clones showed binding to the patient's own tumor. SNs are removed from more than 100,000 breast cancer patients in the US per year. Samples from these lymph nodes represent a substantial opportunity to generate anticancer antibodies.

TI  - Mapping cropping patterns in irrigated rice fields in West Java: Towards mapping vulnerability to flooding using time-series MODIS imageries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the vulnerability to flooding is vital to understand the potential damages from flood events. A method to determine the vulnerability to flooding in irrigated rice fields using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was proposed in this study. In doing so, the time-series EVI derived from time-series 8 day 500 m spatial resolution MODIS imageries (MODO9A1) was used to generate cropping patterns in irrigated rice fields in West Java. Cropping patterns were derived from the spatial distribution and phenology metrics so that it is possible to show the variation of vulnerability in space and time. Vulnerability curves and cropping patterns were used to determine the vulnerability to flooding in irrigated rice fields. Cropping patterns capture the shift in the vulnerability, which may lead to either an increase or decrease of the degree of damage in rice fields of origin and other rice fields. The comparison of rice field areas between MODO9A1 and ALOS PALSAR and MODO9A1 and Agricultural Statistics showed consistent results with R-2 = 0.81 and R-2 = 0.93, respectively. The estimated and observed DOYs showed RMSEs = 9.21, 9.29, and 9.69 days for the Start of Season (SOS), heading stage, and End of Season (EOS), respectively. Using the method, one can estimate the relative damage provided available information on the flood depth and velocity. The results of the study may support the efforts to reduce the potential damages from flooding in irrigated rice fields.

TI  - Icing Detection over East Asia from Geostationary Satellite Data Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though deicing or airframe coating technologies continue to develop, aircraft icing is still one of the critical threats to aviation. While the detection of potential icing clouds has been conducted using geostationary satellite data in the US and Europe, there is not yet a robust model that detects potential icing areas in East Asia. In this study, we proposed machine-learning-based icing detection models using data from two geostationary satellites-the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) and the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)-over Northeast Asia. Two machine learning techniques-random forest (RF) and multinomial log-linear (MLL) models-were evaluated with quality-controlled pilot reports (PIREPs) as the reference data. The machine-learning-based models were compared to the existing models through five-fold cross-validation. The RF model for COMS MI produced the best performance, resulting in a mean probability of detection (POD) of 81.8%, a mean overall accuracy (OA) of 82.1%, and mean true skill statistics (TSS) of 64.0%. One of the existing models, flight icing threat (FIT), produced relatively poor performance, providing a mean POD of 36.4%, a mean OA of 61.0, and a mean TSS of 9.7%. The Himawari-8 based models also produced performance comparable to the COMS models. However, it should be noted that very limited PIREP reference data were available especially for the Himawari-8 models, which requires further evaluation in the future with more reference data. The spatio-temporal patterns of the icing areas detected using the developed models were also visually examined using time-series satellite data.

TI  - How conspecific primates use their habitats: Surviving in an anthropogenically-disturbed forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) is a biodiversity hotspot at risk because of severe forest loss, degradation and burning events. Habitat loss and anthropogenic altering of forest structures pose a threat to forest-dependent taxa, including multiple endemic primate species. Conservation management schemes may be enhanced by evaluating how forest-dependent primates use their habitat for fulfilling life-history requirements, the role of natural forest structures thereon, and any corresponding impacts from anthropogenic disturbance and modification of forests. We investigated how forest-structure variables and landscape scale anthropogenic disturbance factors influenced the life-history behaviours (sleeping, ranging and feeding) of two endemic and sympatric primate species, Presbytis rubicunda (red langur) and Hylobates albibarbis (Bornean agile gibbon), in Sabangau tropical peat-swamp forest, Central Kalimantan. We aimed to identify key factors that influence habitat suitability for both species, and determine the influence of similar factors when selecting habitat for various activities such as sleeping, feeding and ranging. GPS locational data for each behaviour were analysed in conjunction with forest-structure parameters present (derived from LiDAR, ALOS-PALSAR), landscape-scale habitat related factors, and proximity to landscape-scale disturbance factors including burned areas. A Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm was employed for estimating habitat suitability for the different activities of each species based on the afore-mentioned variables. By using a combination of forest sub-class, structure and disturbance variables within the MaxEnt framework, distribution maps of suitable langur and gibbon sleeping, ranging and feeding habitats were produced. Langurs and gibbons had limited overlaps in terms of feeding, ranging and sleeping habitats. In all cases, landscape-scale variables including those related to landscape scale anthropogenic disturbance had the highest percentage contribution for explaining habitat suitability in comparison to forest-structure variables such as canopy heights (derived using LiDAR data). Additionally, variables influencing habitat selection varied between species; while langur feeding, ranging and sleeping were all influenced by distance from burned forests, gibbon sleeping habitat selection was influenced by distance from the forest edge, and ranging and feeding habitat selection was most affected by distance from burned areas. The insights gained from this study may help inform conservation management of these species and guide forest management strategies accordingly to ensure habitat structure is maintained to facilitate activities by sympatric primate species.

TI  - Effects of contemporary land-use and land-cover change on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in the United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) can have profound effects on terrestrial carbon dynamics, yet their effects on the global carbon budget remain uncertain. While land change impacts on ecosystem carbon dynamics have been the focus of numerous studies, few efforts have been based on observational data incorporating multiple ecosystem types spanning large geographic areas over long time horizons. In this study we use a variety of synoptic-scale remote sensing data to estimate the effect of LULC changes associated with urbanization, agricultural expansion and contraction, forest harvest, and wildfire on the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems (forest, grasslands, shrublands, and agriculture) in the conterminous United States (i.e. excluding Alaska and Hawaii) between 1973 and 2010. We estimate large net declines in the area of agriculture and forest, along with relatively small increases in grasslands and shrublands. The largest net change in any class was an estimated gain of 114 865 km(2) of developed lands, an average rate of 3282 km(2) yr(-1). On average, US ecosystems sequestered carbon at an annual rate of 254 Tg C yr(-1). In forest lands, the net sink declined by 35% over the study period, largely a result of land-use legacy, increasing disturbances, and reductions in forest area due to land use conversion. Uncertainty in LULC change data contributed to a similar to 16% margin of error in the annual carbon sink estimate prior to 1985 (approximately +/- 40 Tg C yr(-1)). Improvements in LULC and disturbance mapping starting in the mid-1980s reduced this uncertainty by similar to 50% after 1985. We conclude that changes in LULC are a critical component to understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics, and continued improvements in detection, quantification, and attribution of change have the potential to significantly reduce current uncertainties.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Wenner-Gren Foundation Symposium on The Anthropology of Corruption
CL  - Sintra, PORTUGAL
AB  - Since 1974, I long Kong has gone from being pervasively corrupt to being the best example of effective anti-corruption programs and, most recently, to experiencing widespread concerns about collusion and corruption convictions at the top levels of the government. I examine these transformations, focusing on the role of informal processes operating within government and how policies may have consequences that are very different from those that were intended. The colonial government believed that the problem of corruption resulted from the discretion of junior officials, and anti-corruption efforts during the colonial period focused on reducing this discretion and, more broadly, on changing the "rules of the game." A case study of boat squatters in the 1960s reveals this worldview, the operation of corruption rackets, and efforts to reduce these problems through setting clear procedures. Yet formal procedures can reduce the risks involved in profiting from public office in ways that are often seen by the public as illicit even when they are formally legal. Precise formalization of what counts as corrupt allows opportunistic rent-seekers to skirt closely to the limits of legality while remaining safely on the legal side. Sharp boundaries between corrupt and noncorrupt offer great possibilities for gaining the system. Even when legal, collusion can be as damaging as or worse than corruption.

TI  - Evolution of proteolytic indicators during storage of broiler wooden breast meat
T2  - POULTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few yr, an emerging muscle abnormality termed wooden breast (WB) was found to affect broilers' Pectoralis major muscles. Although different studies have been performed in order to evaluate the effect of WB on meat quality, there is no evidence concerning its impact on the proteolytic processes taking place during meat aging. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the effect of a 7-day storage of broiler breast fillets on free calcium concentration, calpain activity, and proteolysis. Both the superficial and the deep layers of the Pectoralis major muscles were considered. Although similar electrophoretic profiles were observed by comparing the corresponding sampling positions, an evident lack of a high-molecular weight protein band, ascribed to nebulin, was found in the superficial layer of the WB fillets at 10 h postmortem. Compared to normal fillets (NB), both the superficial and the deep layer of WB exhibited a significantly higher amount of free calcium at 168 h postmortem (96 and 88 vs. 20 and 53 mu M; P <= 0.001). Casein zy-mograms evidenced the presence of mu/m-calpain and its autolyzed form migrating as a doublet within the gel. Interestingly, neither the occurrence of WB nor the intra-fillet sampling position exerted any relevant effect on calpain activity. Indeed, a significant reduction (P <= 0.05) in the unautolyzed mu/m-calpain activity coupled with a remarkable increase (P <= 0.05) in the autolyzed form activity was observed during storage. Concurrently, if compared to NB, a significantly larger (P <= 0.05) amount of desmin was detected in both the superficial and the deep layers of the WB samples at 10 h postmortem. Then, a sharp decrease of the intact desmin band coupled with a progressive accumulation of its 39-kDa degradation fragment was observed without any significant difference among groups. In conclusion, the increased hardness that typically affects the WB cases seemed not to be exclusively attributable to differences in the proteolytic processes taking place within the postmortem period.

TI  - An Approach for Unsupervised Change Detection in Multitemporal VHR Images Acquired by Different Multispectral Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an approach for the detection of changes in multitemporal Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images acquired by different multispectral sensors. The proposed approach, which is inspired by a recent framework developed to support the design of change-detection systems for single-sensor VHR remote sensing images, addresses and integrates in the general approach a strategy to effectively deal with multisensor information, i. e., to perform change detection between VHR images acquired by different multispectral sensors on two dates. This is achieved by the definition of procedures for the homogenization of radiometric, spectral and geometric image properties. These procedures map images into a common feature space where the information acquired by different multispectral sensors becomes comparable across time. Although the approach is general, here we optimize it for the detection of changes in vegetation and urban areas by employing features based on linear transformations (Tasseled Caps and Orthogonal Equations), which are shown to be effective for representing the multisensor information in a homogeneous physical way irrespectively of the considered sensor. Experiments on multitemporal images acquired by different VHR satellite systems (i. e., QuickBird, WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Satellite radar data for back-analyzing a landslide event: the Ponzano (Central Italy) case study
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this manuscript, an integrated strategy that exploits both phase and amplitude features of satellite SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images and ground data is proposed for deriving the deformation field induced by a complex landslide that affected part of the village of Ponzano (Abruzzi Region, Central Italy). The February 12, 2017, landslide was triggered by the combined effects of intense rainfalls and snowmelt that saturated the slope. The SqueeSAR algorithm was applied to two C-band SAR datasets, composed by Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 images, spanning a nine-year time interval before the landslide occurrence. Moreover, the amplitude information carried by two TerraSAR-X images, acquired immediately before and after the event, was exploited to derive the total displacement generated by the landslide movement by means of the RMT (rapid motion tracking) algorithm. The obtained results allow describing the landslide behavior before and after its failure. In particular, the back-monitoring analysis shows that the landslide was already slowly moving, with deformation rates increasing from the Radarsat-2 to the Sentinel-1 monitored periods, 10 years before its complete mobilization. The landslide failure of February 2017 produced maximum displacements of about 10 m in some sectors of the affected area. The registered deformation rates and the localization of the maximum displacements areas were confirmed by field data, collected during a field campaign and a helicopter recognizance of the damaged areas, both performed after the event.

TI  - Performance Assessment of Atmospheric Correction for Multispectral Data of GF-4 on Inland Case II Turbid Water
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - GF-4 satellite is the first geostationary satellite with high spatial resolution in China, which has great potential in the aspects of inland water monitoring. This paper takes the Taihu Lake as study area to evaluate the accuracy of GF-4 derived spectral reflectance after atmospheric correction, aiming to provide valuable information for the application of GF-4 data to water color remote sensing. The MODIS-aided improved Gordon atmospheric correction algorithm was used to conduct atmospheric correction for GF-4 images obtained on 2016-07-21 and 2016-08-17. In situ measurements of quasi-synchronous samples and atmospheric corrected GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data were used to validate the GF-4 derived spectral reflectance. The results show that the red-light B4 band had the highest accuracy with RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 1.25 X 10(-3) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 10.71%, the green-light B3 band had RMSE of 2.43 X 10-3 and MAPE of 13.21%, and the near-infrared B5 band had RMSE of 1.95 X 10(-3) and MAPE of 33.06%. The blue-light B2 band had the worst accuracy with RMSE of 6.81 X 10(-3) and MAPE of 53.55%. The accuracy of B3, B4 and B5 bands of GF-4 were higher than those of GOCI. This is because that the spatial resolution of GF-4 is much higher than that of GOCI, so the errors caused by mixed pixel were relatively smaller, showing the advantage of GF-4 as a high-resolution geostationary satellite when used in water color remote sensing. The accuracy of B2 band of GF-4 was lower than that of GOCI, indicating the B2 band of GF-4 still has room for improvement. In the future, the B2 band should be corrected separately, and the usage of this band in water color remote sensing should be avoided if it is not corrected properly. Overall, the multispectral data of GF-4 has relatively high accuracy and can used to monitor the inland case II turbidwater. In order to improve the accuracy of GF-4 derived spectral reflectance, several researches should be conducted in the future. First, aerosol observation stations should be established to obtained long-term data needed by the multiple scattering algorithm forlocalaerosol. Second, the study area should be divided into several subregions in order to reduce the errors caused by the assumption that the air condition was the same for the whole study area. The third, the spatial resolution of GF-4 was 50 m, while the effective area of thespectrograph probe was only 1 m(2). Spectrum data should be collected at multiple points within one GF-4 pixel, so that the errors caused by scale mismatch can be reduced.

TI  - Agricultural land use and cover change in the Cerrado/Amazon ecotone: A case study of the upper Teles Pires River basin
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Teles Pires River basin is a key hydrological resource for the state of Mato Grosso, but has suffered rapid land use and cover change. The basin includes areas of Cerrado biome, as well as the areas transitional between the Amazon and Cerrado vegetation types, with intensive large-scale agriculture widely-spread throughout the region. The objective of this study was to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and cover change from 1986 to 2014 in the upper Teles Pires basin using remote sensing and GIS techniques. TM (Thematic Mapper) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) sensor images aboard the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, respectively, were employed for supervised classification using the "Classification Workflow" in ENVI 5.0. To evaluate classification accuracy, an error matrix was generated, and the Kappa, overall accuracy, errors of omission and commission, user accuracy and producer accuracy indexes calculated. The classes showing greatest variation across the study period were "Agriculture" and "Rainforest". Results indicated that deforested areas are often replaced by pasture and then by agriculture, while direct conversion of forest to agriculture occured less frequently. The indices with satisfactory accuracy levels included the Kappa and Global indices, which showed accuracy levels above 80% for all study years. In addition, the producer and user accuracy indices ranged from 59-100% and 68-100%, while the errors of omission and commission ranged from 0-32% and 0-40.6%, respectively.

TI  - Simultaneous polarimeter retrievals of microphysical aerosol and ocean color parameters from the "MAPP" algorithm with comparison to high-spectral-resolution lidar aerosol and ocean products
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an optimal-estimation-based retrieval framework, the microphysical aerosol properties from polarimetry (MAPP) algorithm, designed for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol microphysical properties and ocean color bio-optical parameters using multi-angular total and polarized radiances. Polarimetric measurements from the airborne NASA Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) were inverted by MAPP to produce atmosphere and ocean products. The RSP MAPP results are compared with co-incident lidar measurements made by the NASA High-Spectral-Resolution Lidar HSRL-1 and HSRL-2 instruments. Comparisons are made of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 355 and 532 nm, lidar column-averaged measurements of the aerosol lidar ratio and Angstrom exponent, and lidar ocean measurements of the particulate hemispherical backscatter coefficient and the diffuse attenuation coefficient. The measurements were collected during the 2012 Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP) campaign and the 2014 Ship-Aircraft Bio-Optical Research (SABOR) campaign. For the SABOR campaign, 73% RSP MAPP retrievals fall within +/- 0.04 AOD at 532 nm as measured by HSRL-1, with an R value of 0.933 and root-mean-square deviation of 0.0372. For the TCAP campaign, 53% of RSP MAPP retrievals are within 0.04 AOD as measured by HSRL-2, with an R value of 0.927 and root-mean-square deviation of 0.0673. Comparisons with HSRL-2 AOD at 355 nm during TCAP result in an R value of 0.959 and a root-mean-square deviation of 0.0694. The RSP retrievals using the MAPP optimal estimation framework represent a key milestone on the path to a combined lidar + polarimeter retrieval using both HSRL and RSP measurements.

TI  - Regional inequality, spatial spillover effects, and the factors influencing city-level energy-related carbon emissions in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Data show that carbon emissions are increasing due to human energy consumption associated with economic development. As a result, a great deal of attention has been focused on efforts to reduce this growth in carbon emissions as well as to formulate policies to address and mitigate climate change. Although the majority of previous studies have explored the driving forces underlying Chinese carbon emissions, few have been carried out at the city-level because of the limited availability of relevant energy consumption statistics. Here, we utilize spatial autocorrelation, Markov-chain transitional matrices, a dynamic panel model, and system generalized distance estimation (Sys-GMM) to empirically evaluate the key determinants of carbon emissions at the city-level based on Chinese remote sensing data collected between 1992 and 2013. We also use these data to discuss observed spatial spillover effects taking into account spatiotemporal lag and a range of different geographical and economic weighting matrices. The results of this study suggest that regional discrepancies in city-level carbon emissions have decreased over time, which are consistent with a marked spatial spillover effect, and a 'club' agglomeration of high-emissions. The evolution of these patterns also shows obvious path dependence, while the results of panel data analysis reveal the presence of a significant U-shaped relationship between carbon emissions and per capita GDP. Data also show that per capita carbon emissions have increased in concert with economic growth in most cities, and that a high-proportion of secondary industry and extensive investment growth have also exerted significant positive effects on city-level carbon emissions across China. In contrast, rapid population agglomeration, improvements in technology, increasing trade openness, and the accessibility and density of roads have all played a role in inhibiting carbon emissions. Thus, in order to reduce emissions, the Chinese government should legislate to inhibit the effects of factors that promote the release of carbon while at the same time acting to encourage those that mitigate this process. On the basis of the analysis presented in this study, we argue that optimizing industrial structures, streamlining extensive investment, increasing the level of technology, and improving road accessibility are all effective approaches to increase energy savings and reduce carbon emissions across China.

TI  - Patient Relations Measurement and Reporting to Improve Quality and Safety: Lessons from a Pilot Project.
T2  - Healthcare quarterly (Toronto, Ont.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective patient relations can improve the patient experience and the safe delivery of care. Recent Ontario policy and legislative changes have increased accountabilities for healthcare organizations and expanded Health Quality Ontario's mandate to measure and report on patient relations. The purpose of this pilot project was to support improved care by validating standardized measures, data submission processes and prototype reporting of patient relations indicators for the hospital, home and community care and long-term care sectors across Ontario.METHODS: Health Quality Ontario identified potential indicators and best practices by performing a comprehensive environmental scan and consulting with experts, including patients and caregivers. It shortlisted indicators based on alignment to best practices and Ontario legislative requirements. A provincial advisory group then used a modified Delphi process to prioritize and recommend five patient relations indicators for province-wide measurement and comparative public reporting. Through the pilot project, these indicators were validated using facility-level data for fiscal year (FY) 2015-2016 from 29 hospitals, home and community care organizations and long-term care homes across Ontario.RESULTS: In June 2016, Health Quality Ontario recruited 34 organizations for the pilot project. Twenty-nine sites successfully submitted summary-level data on patient relations indicators. More than 90% of the required data were retrieved from existing papers or electronic systems. All sites mapped facility-level "complaint" and "action taken" categories to the provincial standardized categories. Across the three health sectors, "care and treatment" was the top complaint category in FY 2015-2016.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot project reinforced the value of measuring patient relations and reporting feedback to support facility- and system-level improvement. The pilot sites and provincial advisory group recommended phased implementation. This would permit healthcare organizations to standardize data collection and align with provincial indicators and categories. The next step would be voluntary data submission to Health Quality Ontario in advance of any reporting. To facilitate voluntary implementation, Health Quality Ontario included one indicator, "complaints acknowledged," in the annual Quality Improvement Plans beginning in FY 2018-2019. This will allow organizations to monitor and report on the percentage of complaints acknowledged within 2, 5 and 10 days. Implementation will evolve based on input from patients, health sector organizations, Local Health Integration Networks and the Patient Ombudsman.

TI  - Evaluation of remote sensing precipitation estimates over Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate five global high-resolution satellite precipitation products (PERSIANN, PERISANN-CDR, TRMM-RT, TRMM-3B42, and CMORPH) in Saudi Arabia where only 29 rain gauges distributed in various parts of the country record daily rainfall. The satellite data are evaluated on a daily and monthly scale and at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution from January 2003 to December 2011. The satellite products are further assessed in the western and eastern parts of the country where most of the rain falls during the wet season (November through April). Evaluation of the satellite products at the western and eastern gauges shows that most of the products perform better in estimating rainfall during the wet season but perform poorly at the eastern gauges during the dry season (June to September). PERSIANN-CDR improves rainfall estimates at some locations while PERSIANN performs better at others. TRMM-3B42 exhibits better performance than TRMM-RT at all sites. Overall, in terms of most of the statistical metrics, CMORPH, PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42 performed better over Saudi Arabia. These results suggest that the satellites using both TIR and PM data for rainfall estimates do not essentially improve rainfall measurements over the satellite using PM data alone.

TI  - Seasonal field efficacy of pyriproxyfen autodissemination stations against container-inhabiting mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i> under different habitat conditions
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDControl of the container-inhabiting mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is difficult using conventional methods due to its selection of cryptic peri-domestic habitats. We evaluated whether autodissemination stations can deliver sufficient pyriproxyfen to sentinel containers to produce significant pupal mortality in different habitats such as competing oviposition sites, peri-domestic habitats, junkyards and tire piles. We also tested how far the pesticide could be transferred over a 200-m range.RESULTSAutodissemination stations performed effectively for 8-12 weeks under field conditions. Pupal mortality was reduced in sentinel cups with high-competing oviposition habitats (5 versus 20) in isolated plots; however, similar results were not seen in residential areas. Increasing the number of stations per plot (from 1 to 4) enhanced the efficacy. Peri-domestic habitat trials showed the highest pupal mortality (50.4%) and site contamination with pyriproxyfen (82.2%) among the trials. Autodissemination stations were able to contaminate habitats in a junkyard (50.0%) and tire piles (40.2%). Pyriproxyfen was detected in sentinel cups up to 200 m from stations. Detection of pyriproxyfen by residue analysis (0.005-0.741 mu g L-1) in field samples confirmed the transfer of the insect growth regulator.CONCLUSIONAutodissemination stations have shown promising potential as a novel pest management tool against container mosquitoes in field trials in different habitats confronted by mosquito control personnel.

TI  - Multivariate analysis of curve parameters to predict fabric stiffness handle from a pulling-out test
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Comprehensive Handle Evaluation System for Fabrics and Yarns (CHES-FY) is capable of measuring multiple physical and mechanical properties of fabrics, which are related to fabric handle. In this study, ten curve parameters were defined from the pulling-out force-displacement curve of the CHES-FY. Factor analysis was used to remove the co linearity of the curve parameters in order to better characterize the stiffness handle of fabrics. Three principal factors were established using the factor analysis, and the first principal factor was termed the stiffness index based on loadings of the curve parameters to the rotated factors. Comparisons between the evaluation results of the CHES-FY, cantilever test, and newly-developed dual subjective/objective assessments showed that the CHES-FY, together with the stiffness index resulting from the factor analysis, provided a fast and effective method to characterize a fabric's stiffness handle, and the evaluation process of the CHES-FY appears to closely simulate the tactile response to stiffness when a person touches or pinches a fabric.

TI  - Experimental study on an effective method for the friction property of fabrics by the comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns system
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main topic investigated in this paper is the effective measurement of the fabric friction property by the comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY). The optimal system parameters of the CHES-FY were determined using an orthogonal experiment design based on the correlations between four curve parameters from the pulling-out force - the displacement curve of the CHES-FY and the friction coefficient tested by the Kawabata evaluation system for fabric surface tester. The repeatability and stability of the CHES-FY under settings of optimal system parameters were also analyzed. Moreover, the four curve parameters were used to cluster the smoothness/roughness handle of fabrics objectively by the k-means cluster method, and the clustering results of the k-means cluster method were compared with those of the subjective cluster method. Analysis of the results showed that the selected optimal system parameters were a good combination, and the CHES-FY with the optimal system parameters provided an effective and reliable evaluation to the friction coefficient and smoothness/roughness handle of fabrics.

TI  - A cloud shadow detection method combined with cloud height iteration and spectral analysis for Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although enhanced over prior Landsat instruments, Landsat 8 OLI can obtain very high cloud detection precisions, but for the detection of cloud shadows, it still faces great challenges. Geometry-based cloud shadow detection methods are considered the most effective and are being improved constantly. The Function of Mask (Fmask) cloud shadow detection method is one of the most representative geometry-based methods that has been used for cloud shadow detection with Landsat 8 OLI. However, the Fmask method estimates cloud height employing fixed temperature rates, which are highly uncertain, and errors of large area cloud shadow detection can be caused by errors in estimations of cloud height. This article improves the geometry-based cloud shadow detection method for Landsat OLI from the following two aspects. (1) Cloud height no longer depends on the brightness temperature of the thermal infrared band but uses a possible dynamic range from 200 m to 12,000 m, In this case, cloud shadow is not a specific location but a possible range. Further analysis was carried out in the possible range based on the spectrum to determine cloud shadow location. This effectively avoids the cloud shadow leakage caused by the error in the height determination of a cloud. (2) Object-based and pixel spectral analyses are combined to detect cloud shadows, which can realize cloud shadow detection from two aspects of target scale and pixel scale. Based on the analysis of the spectral differences between the cloud shadow and typical ground objects, the best cloud shadow detection bands of Landsat 8 OLI were determined. The combined use of spectrum and shape can effectively improve the detection precision of cloud shadows produced by thin clouds. Several cloud shadow detection experiments were carried out, and the results were verified by the results of artificial recognition. The results of these experiments indicated that this method can identify cloud shadows in different regions with correct accuracy exceeding 80%, approximately 5% of the areas were wrongly identified, and approximately 10% of the cloud shadow areas were missing. The accuracy of this method is obviously higher than the recognition accuracy of Fmask, which has correct accuracy lower than 60%, and the missing recognition is approximately 40%.

TI  - Dynamics of fire, precipitation, vegetation and NDVI in dry forest environments in NW Argentina. Contributions to environmental archaeology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has shaped the environment and has been important for human cultural development. In this paper, we propose to study past fire events using ecological modelling. For instance, the ecology of fire can help us to understand and interpret archaeological problems related to past settlement patterns or environmental scenarios. Variation in fire regimens are related to both, vegetation and precipitation fluctuations. Recently, we have model past ecosystem dynamics using remote sensing in the Ambato Valley (Catamarca NW Argentina) ranging from 442 to 1998 CE. Our aim here is to use remotely sensed vegetation data to enhance our understanding of environmental disturbance in the period 2000-2011. We characterised the spatial-time dynamics of the annual NDVI as an indicator of vegetation functioning. Then we related the NDVI dynamics to precipitation and fire events in an arid highland environment in the area. Further, we analysed the vegetation data (monthly NDVI, MODIS/ TERRA satellite, 1km(2) pixels), and the climate data: annual precipitation. Then we calculated the NDVI annual average of every pixel and the NDVI anomalies of every year over the studied period. Lastly, we related NDVI data with annual precipitation and compared the NDVIs prior to and after known fire events in this period. On a spatial scale, the results show that the NDVI values were (a) low in shrublands and in cultivated areas, (b) medium in grasslands and piedmont forest with anthropic impact, and (c) high in highland forests. Within the studied time-period, extreme positive and negative anomalies were detected. The precipitation interannual variations were greater than the NDVI inter-annual variations, thus demonstrating that in some areas of the valley the horizontal precipitation can make important contributions to the ecosystem humidity. Extreme negative anomalies were observed the year of fire and fire scars at least for the next two years. These results demonstrate the relation between structure and function of vegetation, precipitation and fire. Understanding these relations can enable us to explain results when hindcasting ("predicting" what happened during past episodes of climate change) palaeoenvironmental conditions and fire events, thus helping us to interpret different archaeological contexts related to fire events.

TI  - Optimisation of Savannah Land Cover Characterisation with Optical and SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping savannah land cover at the regional scale can provide useful input to policy decision making efforts regarding, for example, bush control or overgrazing, as well as to global carbon emissions models. Recent attempts have employed Earth observation data, either from optical or radar sensors, and most commonly from the dry season when the spectral difference between woody vegetation, crops and grasses is maximised. By far the most common practice has been the use of Landsat optical bands, but some studies have also used vegetation indices or SAR data. However, conflicting reports with regards to the effectiveness of the different approaches have emerged, leaving the respective land cover mapping community with unclear methodological pathways to follow. We address this issue by employing Landsat and Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data to assess the accuracy of mapping the main savannah land cover types of woody vegetation, grassland, cropland and non-vegetated land. The study area is in southern Africa, covering approximately 44,000 km(2). We test the performance of 15 different models comprised of combinations of optical and radar data from the dry and wet seasons. Our results show that a number of models perform well and very similarly. The highest overall accuracy is achieved by the model that incorporates both optical and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data from both dry and wet seasons with an overall accuracy of 91.1% (+/- 1.7%): this is almost a 10% improvement from using only the dry season Landsat data (81.7 +/- 2.3%). The SAR-only models were capable of mapping woody cover effectively, achieving similar or lower omission and commission errors than the optical models, but other classes were detected with lower accuracies. Our main conclusion is that the combination of metrics from different sensors and seasons improves results and should be the preferred methodological pathway for accurate savannah land cover mapping, especially now with the availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Our findings can provide much needed assistance to land cover monitoring efforts to savannahs in general, and in particular to southern African savannahs, where a number of land cover change processes have been related with the observed land degradation in the region.

TI  - Imaging melanoma: when and why. A proposal for a modern approach
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The use of imaging by X-ray computed tomography and positron emission tomography, as well as Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for managing malignant melanoma is considered a standard of care for the work-up of patients with melanoma. This paper aims to summarize the evidences related to the use of X-ray computed tomography and positron emission tomography in the management of localized (stage I and II) and advanced (stage >= III) melanoma.Methods A systematic search in EMBASE and PUBMED databases-starting from 2011-was performed, using the following keywords: melanoma, skin cancer, metastasis, CT, imaging, PET/CT, sentinel node, sentinel node biopsy.Results A total of 130 papers were analyzed. After excluding case reports (12), anecdotal reports (7), low-quality studies (46), a total of 65 papers were evaluated. The results of the analysis can be summarized as follows: in the evaluation of nodal status, scintigraphic mapping of regional basin, followed by sentinel lymph node or complete lymph node dissection is nowadays considered the standard of care for the correct staging of the disease, whereas the therapeutic utility of preventive complete lymph node dissection is still under debate.Conclusion SLNB should always be offered to patients with melanoma thickness >= 1 mm, whereas for thickness <= 1 mm SLNB may be useful only in presence of definite risk factors in the primitive lesion. The use of cross-sectional imaging is always indicated for melanoma staging in advanced disease (stage III and higher), as well as in the evaluation of to treatment response, and during the surveillance for no evidence of disease patients. Finally, cross-sectional imaging should be used very carefully in low stages of the disease (stage I and low risk stage II), for the possible presence of FP results.

TI  - Pastoralists in a changing environment: The competition for grazing land in and around the W Biosphere Reserve, Benin Republic
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Pastoralists face increasing competition for land with crop farmers and nature in and around the W Biosphere Reserve (WBR) in Benin. Our aim was to describe and analyse land use changes in order to understand their drivers, and to describe and analyse the viewpoints of relevant stakeholders in order to understand the competition for land. To this end, remote sensing data, regional statistics, and survey data were collected. We found that crop land expansion around the WBR was the direct driver of decrease of the grazing land area. Population growth and rising demand for food crops, and government support to the cotton sector were indirect drivers of grazing land reduction. Furthermore, competing claims on land among users arose from the complex interaction of crop expansion, presence of WBR and the way it is governed, the lack of support to pastoralists, and the increasing shift of pastoralists' lifestyle into one of settled crop farmers. Pastoralism is under threat and its survival depends on the successful implementation of policies to support pastoralists and protect grazing lands.

TI  - Lake Area Changes and Their Influence on Factors in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions along the Silk Road
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, the changes in major lakes and their responses to the influence factors in arid and semi-arid regions along the Silk Road are especially important for the sustainable development of local water resources. In this study, the areas of 24 lakes were extracted using MODIS NDVI data, and their spatial-temporal characteristics were analyzed. In addition, the relationship between lake areas and the influence factors, including air temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, land use and land cover change (LULCC) and population density in the watersheds, were investigated. The results indicated that the areas of most lakes shrank, and the total area decreased by 22,189.7 km(2) from 2001 to 2016, except for those of the lakes located on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The air temperature was the most important factor for all the lakes and increased at a rate of 0.113 degrees C/a during the past 16 years. LULCC and the increasing population density markedly influenced the lakes located in the middle to western parts of this study area. Therefore, our results connecting lake area changes in the study region highlight the great challenge of water resources and the urgency of implementation of the green policy in the One Belt and One Road Initiative through international collaboration.

TI  - The detection of sentinel lymph nodes in laparoscopic surgery can eliminate systemic lymphadenectomy for patients with early stage endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The examination of a sentinel lymph node (SLN), where lymph node metastasis first occurs, may be advocated as an alternative staging technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and detection rates of an SLN biopsy in patients with endometrial cancer.Two hundred and eleven patients with endometrial cancer underwent an SLN biopsy at hysterectomy using three kinds of tracers including 99m-technetium-labeled tin colloid (Tc-99m), indigo carmine and indocyanine green. Factors related to the side-specific detection rate, sensitivity and false negative rate were analyzed.The detection rates of the SLN biopsy using Tc-99m, indigo carmine and indocyanine green were 77.9, 17.0 and 73.4%, respectively. The detection rate was lower in elderly patients (ae<yen>60 years) (67.9 vs 89.2%, p < 0.01), patients with > 50% myometrial invasion (68.3 vs 85.2%, p < 0.01), patients with high-grade tumors (69.5 vs 84.9%, p < 0.01) and patients who underwent laparotomy (71.2 vs 84.9%, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in body mass index. The sensitivity was not significantly different in any factor. However, the false negative rate was higher in patients with > 50% myometrial invasion (11.5 vs 1.2%, p < 0.01), high-grade tumors (13.3 vs 0.8%, p < 0.01) and who underwent laparotomy (12.2 vs 0.4%, p < 0.01).Patients who underwent laparoscopy with < 50% myometrial invasion and low-grade tumors not only have higher detection rates, but also have lower false negative rates. These patients may avoid systemic lymphadenectomy according to the status of the SLN biopsy.

TI  - Which is better for predicting pelvic lymph node metastases in patients with cervical cancer Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography or a sentinel node biopsy? A retrospective observational study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic pelvic lymph node resection may not be needed for patients with cervical cancer, especially in the early stage, if the pre- or intraoperative diagnosis of lymph node status is correct. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic lymph node metastasis for fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) and sentinel node biopsy (SNB) of cervical cancer patients.Forty-eight patients with cervical cancer were imaged with FDG PET/CT before radical hysterectomy and underwent an SNB followed by systematic pelvic lymph node dissection. The diagnostic accuracy for predicting pelvic node metastases for FDG PET/CT and SNB compared with the ultimate histologic status was analyzed.Among 96 hemi-pelvises (HPs) in 48 patients, pelvic lymph node metastases were obtained in 12 HPs. The sensitivity of pelvic node metastases for FDG PET/CT and SNB was 8.3% and 75.0%, respectively. The specificity for FDG PET/CT and SNB was 97.6% and 94.0%, respectively. The negative predictive value for FDG-PET/CT and SNB was 88.2% and 100%, respectively.SNB is more suitable for detecting pelvic node metastases than FDG PET/CT. The omission of systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy should be considered based on the findings of SNB, not FDG PET/CT.

TI  - Local Effects of Forests on Temperatures across Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests affect local climate through biophysical processes in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ecosystems in Europe, climate responses to forests vary considerably with diverse geographic and seasonal patterns. Few studies have used an empirical analysis to examine the effect of forests on temperature and the role of the background climate in Europe. In this study, we aimed to quantitatively determine the effects of forest on temperature in different seasons with MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land surface temperature (LST) data and in situ air temperature measurements. First, we compared the differences in LSTs between forests and nearby open land. Then, we paired 48 flux sites with nearby weather stations to quantify the effects of forests on surface air temperature. Finally, we explored the role of background temperatures on the above forests effects. The results showed that (1) forest in Europe generally increased LST and air temperature in northeastern Europe and decreased LST and air temperature in other areas; (2) the daytime cooling effect was dominate and produced a net cooling effect from forests in the warm season. In the cold season, daytime and nighttime warming effects drove the net effect of forests; (3) the effects of forests on temperatures were mainly negatively correlated with the background temperatures in Europe. Under extreme climate conditions, the cooling effect of forests will be stronger during heatwaves or weaker during cold spring seasons; (4) the background temperature affects the spatiotemporal distribution of differences in albedo and evapotranspiration (forest minus open land), which determines the spatial, seasonal and interannual effects of forests on temperature. The extrapolation of the results could contribute not only to model validation and development but also to appropriate land use policies for future decades under the background of global warming.

TI  - Improving Satellite Estimates of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation Through Data Integration: Methodology and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical input in many climate and ecological models. The accuracy of satellite FAPAR products directly influences estimates of ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10% or 0.05 for many applications. However, most current FAPAR products do not meet such requirements, and further improvements are still needed. In this paper, a data fusion scheme based on the multiple resolution tree (MRT) approach is developed to integrate multiple satellite FAPAR estimates at site and regional scales. MRT was chosen because of the superior computational efficiency compared with other fusion methods. The fusion scheme removed the bias in FAPAR estimates and resulted in a 15% increase in the R-2 and 3% reduction in the root-mean-square error compared with the average of individual FAPAR estimates. The regional-scale fusion filled in the missing values, and provided spatially consistent FAPAR distributions at different resolutions. Overall, MRT can be used to efficiently and accurately generate spatially and temporally continuous FAPAR data across both site and regional scales.

TI  - Appraisal of Opportunities and Perspectives for the Systematic Condition Assessment of Heritage Sites with Copernicus Sentinel-2 High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution (VHR) optical satellite imagery (<= 5 m) is nowadays an established source of information to monitor cultural and archaeological heritage that is exposed to hazards and anthropogenic threats to their conservation, whereas few publications specifically investigate the role that regularly acquired images from high-resolution (HR) satellite sensors (5-30 m) may play in this application domain. This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica. With the future development of tailored machine learning approaches of feature extraction and pattern detection, Sentinel-2 can become extremely useful to screen wider regions with short revisiting times and to undertake comparative condition assessment analyses of different heritage sites.

TI  - Evaluation of climate-induced waterlogging hazards in the south-west coast of Bangladesh using Geoinformatics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-induced waterlogging has been significantly affecting the lives and livelihood of people in the south-west coastal region of Bangladesh for a couple of decades. The objective of this study is to investigate the waterlogging hazards of Tala, a south-western coastal Upazila of Bangladesh by analyzing satellite image. An empirical model based on velocity of flow, depth of flow, and inundation depth has been proposed to assess waterlogging hazard in pre monsoon, monsoon, and post monsoon period. Landsat TM images for the years 1989, 2000, and 2011 were analyzed by using Geoinformatics including GIS and remote sensing techniques to quantify the water hazard. Three dominant land use classes such as "water," "vegetation," and "bare lands and others" were selected to identify the land use land cover change. Both FGD (focus group discussions) and KII (key informant interviews) were also accomplished to assess the waterlogging hazard. It was revealed that 0.7% of the study area (246 ha) was under water in 1989, which increased alarmingly to 34% (11,525 ha) in 2011. There was an increase in 62.9% of water bodies during 1989 to 2000, which was further expanded to 77% during 2000 to 2011. Satellite image analysis between 2011 and 2015 also showed that nearly 89% of the waterlogged area including floodplain is inundated by tidal saline water that supports shrimp cultivation. On the contrary, 11% of the waterlogged area was occupied by trapped rain water. Confirmation of saline water and fresh water was done by measuring electrical conductivity and conducting "mouth taste" during field visit. The decreasing rate of "bare lands and others" category indicates that there is around 69.4% of reduction in this category to accommodate the increasing water covering areas. The hazard model shows that the middle part of the Tala along with the flood plain of the Kabodak River usually have to suffer waterlogged in both pre monsoon and post monsoon period. It was found that low flow in the upstream side, siltation in the Kabodak River, elevated riverbed, and recent increase in total annual rainfall have resulted in waterlogging problem. Combining inputs obtained from FGD, KII, and economic study of drainage, the TRM (tidal river management) followed by re-excavation of silted riverbed may provide a sustainable solution to solve the prolonged waterlogging situation.

TI  - Treatment and outcomes of melanoma in Asia: Results from the National Cancer Centre Singapore
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAcral melanoma (AM) and mucosal melanoma (MM) make up more than half of melanomas in Asia but comprise only 5% of cases in Caucasians, where cutaneous melanoma (CM) predominates. AM and MM are thought to be genetically and biologically distinct from CM. We report the characteristics and outcomes of melanoma patients from the National Cancer Centre Singapore.MethodsCase records of 210 patients treated between 2002 and 2014 were reviewed.ResultsMedian follow-up was 2.5 years. CM, AM and MM made up of 37.6%, 33.8% and 16.2% of cases, respectively, with 6.2% each having ocular melanoma and unknown primary. Caucasians made up 16.2% of patients, accounting for 36.7% of CM but only 2.8 of AM and 2.9% of MM. Patients with MM (2.9% stage I, 14.7% stage IV) presented with higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage than those with AM (16.9% stage I, 5.6% stage IV) or CM (24.1% stage I, 8.9% stage IV) (P=0.01). Median overall survival (OS) was 5.7 years for all patients, and 1.0 year for metastatic disease. Considering stage I-III disease, multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated age 60 years and higher stage to be independent adverse prognostic factors for RFS and OS. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, undertaken for 56 stage I-III patients (25 AM, 31 CM) did not influence outcome.ConclusionOur study reinforces the known unique clinicopathologic features of melanomas in Asians where AM and MM predominate. Age and stage remain the most critical prognostic factors across all subtypes.

TI  - Axillary lymph node surgical treatment
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, the overall attention is focused on de-escalating treatments for breast cancer (BC) including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has led to less invasive surgical approaches for accurately staging the axilla, with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) progressively confined to a limited group of patients. One of the goal of surgery in de-escalating approaches is to reduce surgical morbidity by restricting or avoiding axillary surgery with no effect on survival. In this context the importance of imaging study for preoperative identification of axillary metastasis, in order to reduce axillary surgery, is gradually improving while the role of intraoperative assessment of sentinel nodes is progressively becoming limited to restricted groups of patients. According to the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 and following the most important guidelines, ALND can be safely omitted in selected patients treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) with one or two positive SLNB while the adoption of SLNB positive alone in patients undergoing mastectomy is not yet defined. The increased employment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and the use of SLNB in patients after NAC plays an important role in de-escalation of axillary surgery in this group of patients. However current studies on this topic are still controversial, mainly about clinically positive lymph nodes (cN+) pre NAC patients or how to manage positive SLNB in post NAC patients. Some authors have collected predictive factors of positive non sentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs) in nomograms, considered an useful tool to avoid unnecessary further surgery. Elderly women represent specific group of patients where the axillary approach needs to be properly resized. The management of axilla in BC is in continuous evolution and ongoing studies could make even SLNB useless in the next future.

TI  - Assessment of manganese contamination in groundwater using frequency ratio (FR) modeling and GIS: a case study on Burdwan district, West Bengal, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, groundwater is very crucial natural resources that are extensively used in both urban and rural regions for irrigation and drinking purpose. In the present research work, the potential manganese contamination zones (PMCZ) within Burdwan district was investigated using GIS approach by considering various controlling factors, i.e., geology, soil, rainfall and land use land cover. Frequency ratio modeling was implemented to assign the scores to various input factors and their sub-classes. Model output based on PMCZ is classified into two broad classes, i.e., 'suitable' and 'unsuitable' where, 63% (4432 km(2)) and 37% (2607 km(2)) of the study area account for suitable and unsuitable category, respectively. The PMCZ model output was further validated with 654 reported manganese (Mn) occurrence in groundwater from different location in Burdwan district and it is observed that the model achieved an accuracy of about 75%. Success and prediction rate curve also show an accuracy of 83 and 77%, respectively which indicates that the prediction rate and accuracy rate of model in the prediction of PMCZ is quite high. The ground-truth verification of predicted zones shows an accuracy of 80% in prediction which was carried out by means of groundwater sampling in the study area followed by the Mn estimation in groundwater samples. Majority of high Mn contaminated area fall along the flood plain (Neogene-Pleistocene sediment) of Burdwan district. The outcome of the research work can be helpful in better planning and management of groundwater resources in future.

TI  - An Algorithm to Determine the Slope of the Spectral Absorption of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Detritus
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple method to determine the slope of spectral variations of combined absorption of the colored dissolved organic matter and detritus (CDM) is presented. This method uses the slope of total absorption spectrum excluding contribution of waters in lieu of slope for the CDM. The errors in slopes using the new method decreased with increase in contributions of CDM to the total absorption. The relative errors were less than 10% when CDM contributions were above 60% and even at very low contributions of CDM of 25%, errors in the slopes were less than 40%. For estuarine and coastal waters rich in CDM, the errors in the slopes for CDM were less than 10% using this simple method. Absorption of CDM derived using the slope with the new method in a semi-analytical algorithm QAAV6 showed improved performance with RMSE of 0.07, 0.0119 and 0.0027 at 405, 555 and 665 nm respectively and with R-2 > 0.95 at all spectral range. The method provided values of spectral absorption due to CDM with fewer errors when validated with the satellite derived data from MODIS and SeaWiFS. This method to determine the slope of CDM could be easily implemented in any model, as it was very generic in nature, simple, did not involve any mathematical model and avoids empirical methods. Since the method is also independent of any specific bands, it can be used for most ocean color satellites. Considering the performance of this new method and applicability for most water types, it was considered as a better option to derive the slope of CDM than using a constant value or deriving the slope with empirical method.

TI  - Detection of Influenza C Viruses Among Outpatients and Patients Hospitalized for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection, Minnesota, 2013-2016
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Existing literature suggests that influenza C typically causes mild respiratory tract disease. However, clinical and epidemiological data are limited.Methods. Four outpatient clinics and 3 hospitals submitted clinical data and respiratory specimens through a surveillance network for acute respiratory infection (ARI) from May 2013 through December 2016. Specimens were tested using multitarget nucleic acid amplification for 19-22 respiratory pathogens, including influenza C.Results. Influenza C virus was detected among 59 of 10 202 (0.58%) hospitalized severe ARI cases and 11 of 2282 (0.48%) outpatients. Most detections occurred from December to March, 73% during the 2014-2015 season. Influenza C detections occurred among patients of all ages, with rates being similar between inpatients and outpatients. The highest rate of detection occurred among children aged 6-24 months (1.2%). Among hospitalized cases, 7 required intensive care. Medical comorbidities were reported in 58% of hospitalized cases and all who required intensive care. At least 1 other respiratory pathogen was detected in 40 (66%) cases, most commonly rhinovirus/enterovirus (25%) and respiratory syncytial virus (20%). The hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion gene was sequenced in 37 specimens, and both C/Kanagawa and C/Sao Paulo lineages were detected in inpatients and outpatients.Conclusions. We found seasonal circulation of influenza C with year-to-year variability. Detection was most frequent among young children but occurred in all ages. Some cases that were positive for influenza C, particularly those with comorbid conditions, had severe disease, suggesting a need for further study of the role of influenza C virus in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease.

M3  - Article
AB  - Christian stewardship typically involves proper care of capital goods, art, possessions, and property; yet rarely does it involve the call to care for the Earth. God's Creation itself. One possible origin for this position is an eisegesis of the Scriptures concerning eschatology. Here, we address how evolutionary thought may be used to inform Theology, develop a better understanding of, last things. and thus result in a better understanding of the proper care of Creation to allow us to cherish the physical world by forming a, Theology of Nature.. We see evolution as a direct result of the kenotic nature of God that further displays the sacrament of Creation. Through embracing this worldview, we are able to understand our role in ushering in an eschatology that works towards the redemption of all God's Creation.

TI  - The spatio-temporal dynamic pattern of rural domestic solid waste discharge of China and its challenges
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, construction of rural domestic waste treatment facilities is seriously lagging, and in many cases, treatment facilities do not yet exist in some villages of China. Serious rural waste pollution has not only impacted the quality of surface water and groundwater but also the atmosphere and the living environment of farmers of China. There are relatively few studies of rural domestic waste pollution, especially with respect to the spatio-temporal dynamic pattern of rural domestic waste discharge. Using survey data and income per capita, we calculated rural domestic waste discharge per capita per day. From this, we calculated provincial rural domestic waste discharge. According to our study, rural domestic waste discharge was 1.42 x 10(8) t/year in 2000. This number increased to 2.3 x 10(8) t/year in 2006 and to 2.47 x 10(8) t/year in 2010. Rural domestic waste increased dramatically while the actual rural population and the proportion of the rural population declined. When examining the eight regions, the rural domestic waste discharge of northeastern China, Qinghai-Tibet, middle China, and southwestern China had increased dramatically, while that of northern China, southern China, and eastern China increased relatively slowly. The economies of northern China, southern China, and eastern China are more developed; their rural domestic waste discharge has been high since 2000 and has continued to increase slowly. In northeastern China, Qinghai-Tibet, middle China, and southwestern China, rural domestic waste discharge was low in 2000; however, in the ten-year period from 2000 to 2010, their rural domestic waste discharge increased dramatically.

TI  - Modeling Orbital Error in InSAR Interferogram Using Frequency and Spatial Domain Based Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (SAR, InSAR) is increasingly being used for deformation monitoring. Uncertainty in satellite state vectors is considered to be one of the main sources of errors in applications such as this. In this paper, we present frequency and spatial domain based algorithms to model orbital errors in InSAR interferograms. The main advantage of this method, when applied to the spatial domain, is that the order of the polynomial coefficient is automatically determined according to the features of the orbital errors, using K-cross validation. In the frequency domain, a maximum likelihood fringe rate estimate is deployed to resolve linear orbital patterns in strong noise interferograms, where spatial-domain-based algorithms are unworkable. Both methods were tested and compared with synthetic data and applied to historical Environmental Satellite Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ENVISAT ASAR) sensor and modern instruments such as Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Sentinel-1. The validation from the simulation demonstrated that an accuracy of -1mm can be obtained under optimal conditions. Using an independent GPS measurement that is discontinuous from the InSAR measurement over the Tohoku-Oki area, we found a 31.45% and 73.22% reduction in uncertainty after applying our method for ASAR tracks 347 and 74, respectively.

TI  - LONG-TERM REMOTE MONITORING THE EFFECTS OF RAINFALL AND AGRICULTURAL NON-POINT SOURCES POLLUTION ON THE SURFACE WATERS QUALITY IN LAKE TAIHU
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The transport of pollutants into freshwater resources depends on the relationships between pesticide/fertilizer application, local topography and rainfall. These relationships are investigated at Lake Taihu, China, where the cropland around the basin is devoted to growing rice. Our aim is to study the effects of the rainfall and non-point source contamination on surface water quality, with a specific focus on Nitrate Potassium Permanganate Chemical. Oxidant (CODMn) and Nitrates (NH3-N), and using satellite remote sensing to construct a pollution estimation model by using satellite data and surface data from 7 monitoring station surveys in 2008-2015. Comparing measured values and remote sensing predicted values, the average of CODMn relative deviation is -0.775 and the average of NH3-N relative deviation is -0.030, both within a reasonable range. Experimental data shows that the lower concentrations of NH3-N occurred when rainfalls are high, the CODMn's temporal and spatial distributions have high variability, and the interaction between seasons and rainfall rate explains variability of NH3-N and CODMn concentrations in surface waters.

TI  - Landscape Dynamics of the Classified Forest of Lama in Southern Benin
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lama (South Benin) classified forest has undergone profound changes as a result of the restoration and conservation efforts that need to be quantified using landscape ecology techniques and phytosociology. Aiming to map land cover and to evaluate landscape dynamics we assessed two Landsat images (2000 Landsat ETM+ and 2015 Landsat OLI TIRS), using transition matrix and decision tree algorithm model. Phytosociological inventories were carried out to assess the conservation status of the classified forest from 80 records on a transect of 50 m long and 10 m wide. Analyzes show that in 2015 the forest covers 27.85% of the landscape compared with 8.02% in 2000, to the detriment of anthropogenic classes after management. The main spatial transformation processes in the landscape were aggregation, creation and attrition. Phytosociological classification showed two physiognomic vegetation groups based on 192 species. These groups are specifically diversified with the predominance of species from the Guinea-Congolese base-element which confirms acceptable conditions in the forest.

TI  - Modeling of Electric Demand for Sustainable Energy and Management in India Using Spatio-Temporal DMSP-OLS Night-Time Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the pattern of electric power consumption in India have influenced energy utilization processes and socio-economic development to greater extent during the last few decades. Assessment of spatial distribution of electricity consumption is, thus, essential for projecting availability of energy resource and planning its infrastructure. This paper makes an attempt to model the future electricity demand for sustainable energy and its management in India. The nighttime light database provides a good approximation of availability of energy. We utilized defense meteorological satellite program-operational line-scan system (DMSP-OLS) nighttime satellite data, electricity consumption (1993-2013), gross domestic product (GDP) and population growth to construct the model. We also attempted to examine the sensitiveness of electricity consumption to GDP and population growth. The results revealed that the calibrated DMSP and model has provided realistic information on the electric demand with respect to GDP and population, with a better accuracy of r (2) = 0.91. The electric demand was found to be more sensitive to GDP (r = 0.96) than population growth (r = 0.76) as envisaged through correlation analysis. Hence, the model proved to be useful tool in predicting electric demand for its sustainable use and management.

TI  - Multiple conservation criteria, discursive conflicts and stakeholder preferences in the era of ecological modernization
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of conservation plans as the final stage of a long process of institutionalization of modern strategic environmental management theory meets with difficulties in real world conditions. When actual application of scientific principles is confronted with public appreciation and engagement on the ground, the perception per se of-and reaction to-the scientific discourse and technical arguments regarding conservation value(s) of designated areas, it often turns into a critique by local communities of the preponderant role of experts and the dominance of a western scientific worldview in the ecological modernization era. In this paper, we develop the formalism-and use variations-of a multiplicative model of conservation value, involving concepts that are central to the IPBES decomposition of values into interacting meanings: principles and preferences. Technically, overall valuation after a suite of conservation criteria of an exemplary designated site, i.e. the Natura 2000 Kalloni Gulf, Greece, is decomposed into the product of two factors, technical score and appreciation, as perceived by a series of local influential stakeholder groups. We use a multi-criteria valuation profile adopted and promoted by scientific experts as reference to which respective valuations of stakeholder groups are contrasted. The study refers to a case where a two decade-long fierce social conflict drove to stagnation the implementation process. Divergence(s) in scoring and appreciation of conservation criteria between scientific experts versus local stakeholder groups are measured using our models variables and classic decomposition analysis techniques. Our model(s) treat the following problems: (1) the relative effects of singular conservation criteria when only one conservation criterion in one site is considered; (2) the relative effects of multiple conservation criteria when applied in one site. A narrative story is attempted regarding discursive conflicts between social groups in the studied case: (1) a pattern of mistrust of the public against scientific discourse on conservation planning: scientists are perceived just as 'another stakeholder group' promoting their own pro-conservation agenda; (2) a NIMBY-like reaction based on individuals' property-defence discourse; and, (3) the by-effects of poor governance in downscaling decision-making from centralized to regional/local level.

TI  - Diversity patterns of woody vegetation of Kgatleng District, Botswana
T2  - Biodiversity Ecol
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation assessments have intensified around the globe to document plant diversity in the wake of climatic shifts and local environmental changes. Botswana also recognises the value of documenting plant diversity, and in this study we present the results of a vegetation survey of Kgatleng District. Between November 2013 and December 2016 we assessed tree species abundance on 77 plots sized 20 m x 50 m. Vegetation classification resulted in the identification of five woody plant communities: Terminalia sericea-Maytenus tenuispina, Dichrostachys cinerea-Combretum apiculatum, Combretum zeyheri-Vachellia tortilis, Senegalia erubescens-Senegalia mellifera, and Grewia flava-Rhigozium brevispinosum. One-way analysis of variance indicated that species richness was not different among the five plant communities, nor was tree density. We furthermore provide a vegetation map of the district based on supervised classification of Landsat 8 imagery.

TI  - Combining series of multi-source high spatial resolution remote sensing datasets for the detection of shoreline displacement rates and the effectiveness of coastal zone protection measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term change of the shoreline location is a phenomenon, which is highly factored in the design of construction projects along the coastal zone. Especially, beach erosion is characterized as one of the major problems at coastal areas and it is of high importance as a quite significant percentage of social development is concentrated in a relatively narrow zone not far from the waterfront. This study presents a methodology that aims to quantify the shoreline displacement rate by involving the processing of different types of remote sensing datasets such as aerial photographs, satellite images and unmanned aerial system data coupled with in-situ observations and measurements. Several photogrammetric techniques were used in order to orthorectify and homogenize a time series of remotely sensed data acquired from 1945 to 2017, representing a rapidly relocating coastal zone at the southern part of Corinth Gulf (Greece), as a case study. All images were digitally processed and optically optimized in order to produce a highly accurate representation of the shoreline at the time period of each acquisition. The data were imported in a Geographic Information System platform, where they were subjected to comparison and geostatistical analysis. High erosion rates were calculated, reaching the order of 0.18 m/year on average whilst extreme rates of 0.70 m/year were also observed in specific locations leading to the segmentation of the coastal zone according to its vulnerability and consequently the risk for further development as well as the effectiveness of measures already taken by the authorities.

TI  - Resolving Source Geometry of the 24 August 2016 Amatrice, Central Italy, Earthquake from InSAR Data and 3D Finite-Element Modeling
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The source geometry of the 24 August 2016 Amatrice earthquake is studied with Sentinel 1-A/B and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coseismic observations. Without presetting the fault geometry and location, we allow these geodetic data to constrain a planar fault and a listric dislocation through an innovative nonlinear approach. Finite-element models (FEMs) are built to simulate the earthquake deformation over a domain with a distribution of realistic crustal materials. Optimal fault geometries are resolved with the observed coseismic displacements in both homogeneous (HOM) half-spaces and heterogeneous (HET) FEMs. The HET-computed planar slip is modeled next to the hypocenter and estimated with a very compatible dip (47 degrees) similar to the moment tensor solution, while that of the HOM solution is offset by similar to 14 degrees. Mean-while, the former recovers the coseismic displacements significantly better than the latter at 95% confidence. This indicates that the inverse solutions of source analysis are sensitive to the presence of nonuniform rock materials in the elastic domain. Though abundant fault detachments are documented within the epicentral area, the slip distributions derived along optimized listric faults do not improve the prediction of surface movements estimated by the rectangular sources. This implies that a planar fault geometry is sufficient to describe the rupture of the Amatrice earthquake. The corresponding slip distribution reveals a maximum slip of similar to 1 m at 7 km depth, beneath a lithological boundary between the shallow weaker units and the underlying stronger Dolomite. A significant correlation is found between the slip magnitude and subsurface rock stiffness where stress is being accumulated, implying a possible structural control on the earthquake nucleation and propagation.

TI  - Towards a Rational Kingdom in Africa: Knowledge, Critical Rationality and Development in a Twenty-First Century African Cultural Context
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to locate the kind of knowledge that is relevant for African development in the twenty-first century African cultural context and to propose the paradigm for achieving such knowledge. To do this, it advances the view that the concept of twenty-first century in an African context must be located with the colonial and post-colonial challenges of the African world and applied to serve the African demand. Anchored on this position, the paper outlines and critiques the wrong assumption on which modern state project was anchored in post-colonial Africa and its development dividend to suggest that this is an outcome of a wrong knowledge design that is foundational to the state project and which the project did not address. It proposes a shift in the knowledge paradigm in Africa and suggests critical self-consciousness as a more desirable knowledge design for Africa. It applies the term 'rational kingdom' (defined as a community of reason marked by critical conceptual self-awareness driven by innovation and constructivism) to suggest this paradigm. 'Innovation' is meant as the application of reason with an enlarged capacity to anticipate and address problems with fresh options and 'constructivism' is meant as the disposition to sustain innovation by advancing an alternative but more reliable worldview that can meet the exigencies of modernity in an African cultural context. The paper then proceeds to outline the nature of the rational kingdom and its anticipated gains and outcomes. It applies the method of inductive reasoning to advance its position. To do this it invokes selected but crucial areas of African life to locate how the developmental demands of these aspects of life suggest a critical turn in African rationality.

TI  - Atmospheric water budget over the South Asian summer monsoon region
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution hybrid atmospheric water budget over the South Asian monsoon region is examined. The regional characteristics, variability, regional controlling factors and the interrelations of the atmospheric water budget components are investigated. The surface evapotranspiration was created using the High Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS) with the satellite-observed rainfall and vegetation fraction. HRLDAS evapotranspiration shows significant similarity with in situ observations and MODIS satellite-observed evapotranspiration. Result highlights the fundamental importance of evapotranspiration over northwest and southeast India on atmospheric water balance. The investigation shows that the surface net radiation controls the annual evapotranspiration over those regions, where the surface evapotranspiration is lower than 550 mm. The rainfall and evapotranspiration show a linear relation over the low-rainfall regions (< 500 mm/year). Similar result is observed in in NASA GLDAS data (1980-2014). The atmospheric water budget shows annual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal variations. Evapotranspiration does not show a high intra-seasonal variability as compared to other water budget components. The coupling among the water budget anomalies is investigated. The results show that regional inter-annual evapotranspiration anomalies are not exactly in phase with rainfall anomalies; it is strongly influenced by the surface conditions and other atmospheric forcing (like surface net radiation). The lead and lag correlation of water budget components show that the water budget anomalies are interrelated in the monsoon season even up to 4 months lead. These results show the important regional interrelation of water budget anomalies on south Asian monsoon.

TI  - Navigation of Fluorescence Cameras during Soft Tissue Surgeryd-Is it Possible to Use a Single Navigation Setup for Various Open and Laparoscopic Urological Surgery Applications?
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Real-time visualization fluorescence imaging can guide surgeons during tissue resection. Unfortunately tissue induced signal attenuation limits the value of this technique to superficial applications. By positioning the fluorescence camera via a dedicated navigation setup we reasoned that the technology could be made compatible with deeper lesions, increasing its impact on clinical care. Such an impact would benefit from the ability to implement the navigation technology in different surgical settings. For that reason we evaluated whether a single fluorescence camera could be navigated toward targeted lesions during open and laparoscopic surgery.Materials and Methods: A fluorescence camera with scopes available for open and laparoscopic procedures was integrated with a navigation platform. Lymph nodes identified on SPECT/CT (single photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography) or free-hand single photon emission computerized tomography acted as navigation targets and were displayed as augmented overlays in the fluorescence camera video feed. The accuracy of this setup was evaluated in a phantom study of 4 scans per single photon emission computerized tomography imaging modality. This was followed by 4 first in human translations into sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures for penile (open surgery) and prostate (laparoscopic surgery) cancer.Results: Overall the phantom studies revealed a tool-target distance accuracy of 2.1 mm for SPECT/CT and 3.2 mm for freehand single photon emission computerized tomography, and an augmented reality registration accuracy of 1.1 and 2.2 mm, respectively. Subsequently open and laparoscopic navigation efforts were accurate enough to localize the fluorescence signals of the targeted tissues in vivo.Conclusions: The phantom and human studies performed suggested that the single navigation setup is applicable in various open and laparoscopic urological surgery applications. Further evaluation in larger patient groups with a greater variety of malignancies is recommended to strengthen these results.

TI  - Epidemiology of viral respiratory infections in Australian working-age adults (20-64 years): 2010-2013
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute respiratory infections cause significant morbidity and mortality accounting for 5.8 million deaths worldwide. In Australia, influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as cough, fever and fatigue is a common presentation in general practice and results in reduced productivity and lost working days. Little is known about the epidemiology of ILI in working-age adults. Using data from the ASPREN influenza surveillance network in Australia (2010-2013) we found that working-age adults made up 45.2% of all ILI notifications with 55% of samples positive for at least one respiratory virus. Viruses most commonly detected in our study included influenza A (20.6%), rhinovirus (18.6%), influenza B (6.2%), human meta-pneumovirus (3.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%), para-influenza virus (2.6%) and adenovirus (1.3%). We also demonstrated that influenza A is the predominant virus that increases ILI (by 1.2% per month for every positive influenza A case) in working-age adults during autumn-winter months while other viruses are active throughout the year. Understanding the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections through a year will help clinicians make informed decisions about testing, antibiotic and antiviral prescribing and when the beginning of the 'flu season' can be more confidently predicted.

TI  - Lymphatic Drainage of the Splenic Flexure Defined by Intraoperative Scintigraphic Mapping
T2  - DISEASES OF THE COLON & RECTUM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal surgical management of splenic flexure cancer is debated, partly because of an incomplete understanding of the lymphatic drainage of this region.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the normal lymphatic drainage of the human splenic flexure using laparoscopic scintigraphic mapping.DESIGN: This was a clinical trial.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single tertiary care center.PATIENTS: Thirty consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal resections without splenic flexure pathology were recruited.INTERVENTION: Technetium-99m was injected subserosally at the splenic flexure.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lymphatic scintigraphic mapping was undertaken at 15, 30, and 60 minutes using a laparoscopic gamma probe at the left branch of the middle colic, left colic, inferior mesenteric, and ileocolic (control) lymphovascular pedicles.RESULTS: Lymphatic drainage at 60 minutes was strongly dominant in the direction of the left colic pedicle (96% of patients), with a median gamma count of 284 (interquartile range, 113-413), versus the left branch of the middle colic count of 31 (interquartile range, 15-49; p<0.0001). This equated to a median 9.2-times greater flow to the left colic versus the middle colic. Counts at the left colic were greater than all of the other mapped sites at 15, 30, and 60 minutes (p<0.001), whereas middle colic and inferior mesenteric artery counts were equivalent. The protocol increased operative duration by 20 to 30 minutes without complications.LIMITATIONS: These results report lymphatic drainage from patients with normal splenic flexures, and caution is necessary when extrapolating to patients with splenic flexure cancers.CONCLUSIONS: The lymphatic drainage of the normal splenic flexure is preferentially directed toward the left colic in the high majority of cases. Retrieving these nodes should be prioritized in splenic flexure cancer resections, with important secondary emphasis on left middle colic nodes, supporting segmental (left hemicolectomy) resection as the procedure of choice. Additional development of colonic sentinel node mapping using these techniques may contribute to individualized surgical therapy morbidity. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A495.

TI  - Developing Models to Predict the Number of Fire Hotspots from an Accumulated Fuel Dryness Index by Vegetation Type and Region in Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the linkage between accumulated fuel dryness and temporal fire occurrence risk is key for improving decision-making in forest fire management, especially under growing conditions of vegetation stress associated with climate change. This study addresses the development of models to predict the number of 10-day observed Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire hotspots-expressed as a Fire Hotspot Density index (FHD)-from an Accumulated Fuel Dryness Index (AcFDI), for 17 main vegetation types and regions in Mexico, for the period 2011-2015. The AcFDI was calculated by applying vegetation-specific thresholds for fire occurrence to a satellite-based fuel dryness index (FDI), which was developed after the structure of the Fire Potential Index (FPI). Linear and non-linear models were tested for the prediction of FHD from FDI and AcFDI. Non-linear quantile regression models gave the best results for predicting FHD using AcFDI, together with auto-regression from previously observed hotspot density values. The predictions of 10-day observed FHD values were reasonably good with R-2 values of 0.5 to 0.7 suggesting the potential to be used as an operational tool for predicting the expected number of fire hotspots by vegetation type and region in Mexico. The presented modeling strategy could be replicated for any fire danger index in any region, based on information from MODIS or other remote sensors.

TI  - Mapping of Marine Chl-a and Suspended Solid Concentration Using OCM-2 Sensor
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Suspended Solid Concentration (SSC) shows the productivity of water and their surrounding environment. These parameters can be effectively estimated through several remote sensing techniques. From the recent reports on the Gulf of Thailand, it is found that Chl-a and SSC are increasing in coastal areas due to changing environment caused by variations in the global carbon cycle, climate change and water pollution linking to anthropogenic conditions such as high population density and rapid urbanization in neighbouring coastal areas deteriorating the coastal and marine environment. Various models are evaluated in this study for estimation of marine Chl-a and SSC by employing Ocean Colour Monitor-2 sensor of Oceansat-2 satellite for Northern Gulf of Thailand. The retrieval of Chl-a and SSC by the atmospheric correction of visible bands from 400 to 700 nm to attain normalized water-leaving radiances and then a suitable algorithm is applied. The In-situ reflectance values of sea waters are measured using the ASD spectroradiometer. The reflectance values of the spectroradiometer are correlated for the same day atmospherically corrected satellite reflectance and the analysis offers high correlation R-2 0.73. Satellite derived, Chl-a and SSC are correlated with observed in situ Chl-a and SSC. This analysis offered better correlation of R-2 0.86 and 0.85 respectively with the algorithms of Chl-a and SSC.

TI  - Putting the spiritual into practice Anthroposophy in the life and work of Olly and Uno Donner
T2  - APPROACHING RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to examine how Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical ideas were reflected and put into practice in the lives of the Finnish couple Olly (Olga) Donner (1881-1956, nee Sinebrychoff) and Uno Donner (1872-1958). They encountered anthroposophy in 1913 and subsequently embraced it as the guiding principle of their lives. Through a close examination of these two people we aim to shed light on how a new worldview like anthropo-sophy, which was gaining followers in early twentieth-century Finland, was also a manifestation of wider changes in religious culture in Europe. Our perspective could be described as biographical in the sense that it has been characterised by Simone Lassig (2008: 11) who writes that 'the reconstruction of individual life courses helps to discover more about the context - for example, about daily rituals, pious practices, or kinship relationship'. Thus, the biographical perspective serves as a tool for grasping how something as deeply personal as an anthroposophical worldview was understood and practised, not only by Olly and Uno Donner, but also by a larger group of people who in the early twentieth century were looking for new ways to make sense of the surrounding world.

TI  - Qualitative Research in Correctional Settings: Researcher Bias, Western Ideological Influences, and Social Justice
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORENSIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within correctional settings, justice, health, and academic systems overlap for forensic nurse researchers. Within an environment that stresses social control, a researcher's implicit views, perspectives, and biases can lead to altering the authentic (re)presentation of a participant's experience. Researcher bias may be influenced by predominately western ideologies and societal discourses. Qualitative methods to mitigate and raise awareness around researcher biases include bracketing, unstructured interviews, diverse peer review, thinking inductively, investigator responsiveness, and critical reflexivity. In addition to these methods, a social justice perspective should be included within the ethical foundation, guiding theories, and worldview in the research design to mitigate western ideological influences on researcher bias. Finally, a forensic nurse researcher should consider how possible western influences on researcher bias impact their ethical and moral obligation to their participants, the research community, and their clinical practice.

TI  - How do we manage overdiagnosis/overtreatment in breast screening?
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Overdiagnosis is the inevitable flip side of early detection resulting in unnecessary labelling of well women with a diagnosis of cancer and possible unnecessary treatment. Overdiagnosis occurs because breast cancers have different rates of growth and slow-growing cancers are preferentially detected by screening. Some of these slow-growing screen-detected cancers may never have been clinically apparent during an individual's lifetime. Evaluating the benefits and risks of screening are complex, but this has been performed for the UK population by an independent review led by Professor Marmot. It might be possible to limit overdiagnosis by identifying women with "low-risk disease" earlier, either at the point of screening when additional investigations could be delayed ( possibly for ever) so that they are not subjected to additional diagnostic tests, or at the point of diagnosis. Both these options would require major re-education of clinicians and the public who would need to accept that screening is "deliberately ignoring a cancer". There is a long surgical history of reducing the burden of treatment, which continues today with trials of management of the axilla and reducing or even omitting radiotherapy for low-risk disease. The Low Risk Ductal Carcinoma In Situ trial ( LORIS) has started to identify a group of breast cancer patients who could avoid surgery and be offered active monitoring. We need to consider planning a similar trial for low-risk invasive breast cancer. (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of atmospheric downward longwave radiation with remotely sensed data
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of atmospheric downward radiation is very significant in the researches about air -sea interaction. It can be obtained by conventional instrument measurement which is suitable for the area of dense meteorological stations. However, it is costly and has high -maintenance to put those instruments on the sea surface, which is seriously affecting our understanding of the radiation characteristics of the ocean. Satellite can provide time -space continuity and multi-level of information about the sea and it is an effective means to study atmospheric downward radiation. In this study, we have simulated the atmospheric downward long-wave radiation under all kinds of atmospheric conditions. Considering of that the atmospheric downward long-wave radiation is not only the contribution of bottom atmosphere but also the adjacent atmosphere levels, the atmosphere emissivity is parameterized by adding the atmosphere water vapor content and a new model is developed based on the Brutsaert model. And the model is tested by the site flux data acquired from the Yellow Sea area in the project of "Integrated survey and evaluation of the resources of Chinese coastal zone" . Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the improved model is 11.2 W/m(2) in the simulation data and is 20.9 W/m(2 )in the site measurements, and the accuracy of the model is conformed to the precision of instantaneous atmospheric downward radiation in the study of air-sea interaction.

TI  - Examining the Effects of Hydropower Station Construction on the Surface Temperature of the Jinsha River Dry-Hot Valley at Different Seasons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the completion of a large-scale hydropower station, the change of the water area can cause a corresponding change of local weather. To examine such changes, this paper analyzed the effect of the reservoir in the head area of the Xiluodu hydropower station based on the temperature data of MODIS MYD11A2. The temperature differences (TD) between various locations in the study area and the reservoir were calculated to explore the TD in different seasons. The reservoir effect change intensity (RECI) was established to explore the impact of the reservoir on local weather changes in different flood seasons. The combination of the TD and RECI was applied to explore the role of the hydropower station in regulating the temperature of the surrounding reservoir. The results showed the following: (1) after hydropower station construction (HSC), the TD in the valleys decreased and the TD in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season; (2) the RECI had different distribution characteristics in different flood seasons of the reservoir, and the RECI was stronger in the wet season than that in the dry season; and (3) unlike in the plains, cooling and warming effects existed simultaneously in different parts of the mountains.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to measure provincial spending for mental health services in fiscal year (FY) 2013 and to compare these cost estimates to those of FY 2003.Methods: This study estimated the costs of publicly funded provincial mental health services in FY 2013 and compared them to the estimates for FY 2003 from a previously published report. Our data were obtained from publicly accessible databases. The cross-year cost comparisons for provincial mental health services were restricted to general and psychiatric hospital inpatients, clinical payments to physicians and psychologists, and prescribed psychotropic medications. Total public expenditures were inflation adjusted and expressed per capita and as a percentage of the total provincial health spending.Results: Total public spending for mental health and addiction programs/services was estimated to be $6.75 billion for FY 2013. The largest component of the expenditures was hospital inpatient services ($4.02 billion, 59.6%), followed by clinical payments to physicians or psychologists ($1.69 billion, 25%), and then publicly funded prescribed psychotherapeutic medications ($1.04 billion, 15.4%). Nationally, the portion of total public spending on health that was spent on mental health decreased from FY 2003 to FY 2013 from 5.4% to 4.9%.Conclusion: Our results reveal that mental health spending, as a proportion of public health care expenditures, decreased in the decade from FY 2003 to FY 2013. Due to large differences in how the provinces report community mental health services, we still lack a comprehensive picture of the mental health system.

TI  - Global land surface air temperature dynamics since 1880
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographical extent, magnitude, and uncertainty of global climate change have been widely discussed and have critical policy implications at both global and local scales. In this study, a new analysis of annual mean global land surface air temperature since 1880 was generated, which has greater coverage and lower uncertainty than previous distributions. The Biased Sentinel Hospitals Areal Disease Estimation (BSHADE) method, used in this study, makes a best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) when a sample is small and biased to a spatially heterogeneous population. For the period of 1901-2010, the warming trend was found to be 0.109 degrees C decade(-1) with 95% confidence intervals between 0.081 degrees C and 0.137 degrees C. Additionally, warming exhibited different spatial patterns in different periods. In the early 20th century (1923-1950), warming occurred mainly in the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in the most recent decades (1977-2014), warming was more spatially extensive across the global land surface. Compared with other common methods, the difference in results appears in the areas with few stations and in the early years, when stations had sparse coverage and were unevenly distributed. Validation, which was performed using real data that simulated the historic situation, showed a smaller error in the BSHADE estimate than in other methods. This study produced a new database with greater coverage and less uncertainty that will improve the understanding of climate dynamics on the Earth since 1880, especially in isolated areas and early periods, and will benefit the assessment of climate-change-related issues, such as the effects of human activities.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the long-term prognosis of breast cancer patients with Tc-99m-rituximab for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).A total of 2947 patients with negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), treated between June 2005 and December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed. SLNB was performed prior to adjuvant therapy.After a median follow-up of 62 months, 22 cases of axillary recurrence (AR) were observed. The 5-year AR rate (ARR) was 0.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-1.1%] and the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 95.2% (95% CI 94.4-96.0%). Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal axillary ultrasound with negative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) [hazard ratio (HR) 3.79, 95% CI 1.55-9.28; P = 0.004], not receiving radiotherapy (HR 4.38, 95% CI 1.47-13.05; P = 0.008), and age ae<currency> 40 years (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.19-7.20; P = 0.020) were independent risk factors for AR.ARR of SLNB-negative patients with Tc-99m-rituximab is low. Abnormal axillary ultrasound with negative FNA, not receiving radiotherapy, and age ae<currency> 40 years were prognostic factors for higher ARRs.

TI  - A method to obtain soil-moisture estimates over bare agricultural fields in arid areas by using multi-angle RADARSAT-2 data
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter for agriculture, meteorological, and hydrological studies. This paper focuses on soil-moisture estimation methodology based on the multi-angle high- and low-incidence-angle mode RADARSAT-2 data obtained over bare agricultural fields in an arid area. Backscattering of the high- and low-incidence angles is simulated by using AIEM (advanced integral equation model), with the surface-roughness estimation model built based on the simulated data. Combining the surface-roughness estimation model with the backscattering model of the low-incidence-angle mode, a soil-moisture estimation method is put forward. First, the natural logarithm (ln) of soil moisture was obtained and then the soil moisture calculated. Soil moisture of the study area in Dunhuang, Gansu Province, was obtained based on this method; a good agreement was observed between the estimated and measured soil moisture. The coefficient of determination was 0.85, and the estimation precision reached 4.02% in root mean square error (RMSE). The results illustrate the high potential of the approach developed and RADARSAT-2 data to monitor soil moisture.

TI  - Monitoring growth condition of spring maize in Northeast China using a process-based model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and accurate assessment of the growth condition of spring maize, a major crop in China, is important for the national food security. This study used a process-based Remote-Sensing-Photosynthesis-Yield Estimation for Crops (RS-P-YEC) model, driven by satellite-derived leaf area index and ground-based meteorological observations, to simulate net primary productivity (NPP) of spring maize in Northeast China from the first ten-day (FTD) of May to the second ten-day (STD) of August during 2001-2014. The growth condition of spring maize in 2014 in Northeast China was monitored and evaluated spatially and temporally by comparison with 5- and 13-year averages, as well as 2009 and 2013. Results showed that NPP simulated by the RS-P-YEC model, with consideration of multi-scattered radiation inside the crop canopy, could reveal the growth condition of spring maize more reasonably than the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator. Moreover, NPP outperformed other commonly used vegetation indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) for monitoring and evaluating the growth condition of spring maize. Compared with the 5- and 13-year averages, the growth condition of spring maize in 2014 was worse before the STD of June and after the FTD of August, and it was better from the third ten-day (TTD) of June to the TTD) of July across Northeast China. Spatially, regions with slightly worse and worse growth conditions in the STD of August 2014 were concentrated mainly in central Northeast China, and they accounted for about half of the production area of spring maize in Northeast China. This study confirms that NPP is a good indicator for monitoring and evaluating growth condition because of its capacity to reflect the physiological characteristics of crops. Meanwhile, the RS-P-YEC model, driven by remote sensing and ground-based meteorological data, is effective for monitoring crop growth condition over large areas in a near real time.

TI  - Satellite retrieval of actual evapotranspiration in the Tibetan Plateau: Components partitioning, multidecadal trends and dominated factors identifying
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the only connecting term between water balance and energy budget in the earth-atmospheric system, evapotranspiration (ET) is considered the most excellent indicator for the activity for the water and energy cycle. Under the background of global change, regional ET estimates, components partitioning as well as their spatial and temporal patterns recognition are of great importance in understanding the hydrological processes and improving water management practices. This is particularly true for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of most sensitive and vulnerable region in response to the environment change in the earth. In this study, with flux site observation data and monthly ET data from the monthly water balance method incorporating the terrestrial water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite (GRACE) production as the multiple validations, the long-term daily ET in the TP was retrieved by a modified Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model with considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area during 1982-2012. The spatial and temporal changes of partitioned three components of ET, i.e., soil evaporation (E-s), transpiration through the stomata of plant (Er) and canopy interception (E-i), were investigated in the TP. Meanwhile, how the ET components contribute to ET changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the TP was revealed and discussed. The results indicate that E-s dominates ET in most areas of the TP with the mean annual ratio of 65.7%, except southeastern regions where the vegetation coverage is high. Although regional average ET and three main components all present obvious increase trends during the past decades, high spatial heterogeneity for their trends are identified in the TP. Moreover, a mixed changing pattern can be apparently found for E-s in southeastern area, E-c and E-i in northwestern and southeastern area. Spatially, the ET variation are mainly attributed to change in E-s, followed by E-c and E-i. In addition, compared with evaporation related meteorological variables, precipitation and leaf area index (LAI) provide the more dominated contributions to the changes of ET and E-i in the TP, while LAI is overwhelming contribution factor for E-c changes. As for E-s changes, although precipitation play the important role, the effects of other factors are also non-negligible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved retrieval of cloud base heights from ceilometer using a non-standard instrument method
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-base height (CBH) is a basic cloud parameter but has not been measured accurately, especially under polluted conditions due to the interference of aerosol. Taking advantage of a comprehensive field experiment in northern China in which a variety of advanced cloud probing instruments were operated, different methods of detecting CBH are assessed. The Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) and the Vaisala ceilometer (CL51) provided two types of backscattered profiles. The latter has been employed widely as a standard means of measuring CBH using the manufacturer's operational algorithm to generate standard CBH products (CL51 MAN) whose quality is rigorously assessed here, in comparison with a research algorithm that we developed named value distribution equalization (VDE) algorithm. It was applied to both the profiles of lidar backscattering data from the two instruments. The VDE algorithm is found to produce more accurate estimates of CBH for both instruments and can cope with heavy aerosol loading conditions well. By contrast, CL51 MAN overestimates CBH by 400 m and misses many low level clouds under such conditions. These findings are important given that CL51 has been adopted operationally by many meteorological stations in China.

TI  - Contrast Effects of Vegetation Cover Change on Evapotranspiration during a Revegetation Period in the Poyang Lake Basin, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that evapotranspiration (ET) differs before and after vegetation change in watersheds. However, impacts of vegetation change on ET remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we investigated the process-specific, nonclimatic contribution (mainly vegetation coverage changes) to ET at grid, sub-basin, and basin scales using observation and remote sensing data. The Poyang Lake Basin was selected as the study area, which experienced a fast vegetation restoration from 1983 to 2014. Our results showed that vegetation cover change produced contrasting effects on annual ET in magnitude and direction during shifts from a less covered to a more covered stage. At the early stage (1983-1990), with vegetation cover of 30%, vegetation cover change produced negative effects on ET over the basin. At the middle stage (1990-2000), the vegetation coverage increased at a fast pace and the negative effects gradually shifted to positive. At the late stage (2000-2014), the vegetation coverage remained high (over 60%) and maintained a positive relationship with ET. In summary, the vegetation effects are collaboratively influenced by both vegetation coverage and its change rate. Our findings should be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of complicated hydrological responses to anthropogenic revegetation.

TI  - A Practical Approach to Landsat 8 TIRS Stray Light Correction Using Multi-Sensor Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been noticed that the Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) had an issue with stray light since its launch in 2013. This artifact is due to out-of-field radiance that scatters onto the TIRS focal plane. Much effort has been taken to develop an algorithm to remove this artifact. One proposed approach involves using TIRS data itself (referred to as TIRS-on-TIRS) to retrieve the true sensor-reaching radiance. This approach has been proven to be operational and supports the TIRS Collection-1 product. A methodology of calibrating the TIRS sensor with information from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) instrument may optimally reduce the stray light effect for special cases where there is a large temperature contrast between the edge of the TIRS image and out-of-field radiance (referred to as GOES-on-TIRS). This paper illustrates a GOES to TIRS conversion (GTTC) algorithm with the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data to support the GOES-on-TIRS method. Results show this GOESTIRS correction method performs similarly to the TIRS Collection-1 product. Additionally, a simplified methodology is proposed to improve the GOES data processing which can operationalize the GOES-on-TIRS algorithm. Results also show that, using the proposed algorithm with these special cases, the maximum difference between the Collection-1 product and the GOES-on-TIRS correction results in a temperature difference from 0.5% to 0.7%.

TI  - Lymph node management of cN0 penile cancer
T2  - UROLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In penile cancer, lymph node metastasis is the main known prognostic factor affecting patients' survival. Early inguinal lymph node dissection or the resection of clinically occult lymph node metastases improves survival compared with removal when the metastases become clinically apparent. Micrometastatic lymph node involvement is undetectable by current imaging modalities. Nomograms based on clinical and histopathological tumor characteristics are unreliable in predicting lymph node involvement. Consequently, in penile cancer patients with clinically normal inguinal lymph nodes (cN0) and a tumor stage pT1, G2 surgical lymph node exploration is recommended. Radical inguinal lymphadenectomy is no longer recommended because of its invasiveness and high complication rate. Modified lymphadenectomy and dynamic sentinel lymph node surgery allow the detection of lymph node-positive patients with sufficient certainty. Thereby, the sentinel lymph node approach offers the least invasiveness and high sensitivity. Extended inguinal lymphadenectomy is still recommended in the case of positive nodes.

TI  - Dynamics and driving forces of main vegetation types in the Saihanba Nature Reserve, Hebei Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the changes of vegetation landscape pattern and its driving mechanism in Saihanba Nature Reserve, we analyzed vegetation type changes from 1989 to 2013 and the driving factors using random forest and Logistic regression models in conjunction with land dynamic degree indicator, based on three Landsat TM imageries obtained in 1989, 2000 and 2013. The results showed that the proportion of shrubland was always small in this area from 1989 to 2013. During 1989-2013, the proportion of shrubland rapidly decreased and plantation area significantly increased, while the area of grassland and natural secondary forest slightly changed. Key driving factors for the vegetation dynamics were dependent on vegetation type and time. The change of each vegetation type from 1989 to 2000 was significantly influenced by social factors, i.e. distance to road and total investment of afforestation. Since the implementation of the Natural Forest Protection Project and establishment of Saihanba Nature Reserve, the role of natural factors including elevation and aspect gradually became more important during the 2000-2013. The vegetation landscape dynamics were primarily determined by social activities, while the distribution patterns of vegetation types were probably controlled by natural factors in the study area.

TI  - Long-lasting cough in an adult German population: incidence, symptoms, and related pathogens
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of the incidence of pertussis in adults have shown that it accounts for only 5-15% cases of prolonged coughing. We assessed the burden of suffering related to prolonged coughing and tried to identify further causative agents. Based on a sentinel study with 35 general practitioners in two German cities (Krefeld, Rostock), with 3,946 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we estimated the incidence of prolonged coughing in adults. In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan-Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4-11 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use. Apart from B. pertussis, a broad range of pathogens was associated with the symptoms. However, patients sought medical attention too late to guide efficacious therapeutic interventions using the diagnostic tests.

TI  - Narrative Review: Assessment of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Infections Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in National and Sentinel Surveillance Systems in the United States
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - To assess trends in Neisseria gonorrhoeae among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), we reviewed existing and published gonorrhea surveillance data in the United States. Data identified in this review include the following: national gonorrhea case report data and data from 3 other surveillance programs, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), the STD Surveillance Network (SSuN), and National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Rates of reported cases of gonorrhea among men increased 54.8% in 2006 to 2015 compared with a 2.6% increase among women. Since 2012, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases among men surpassed the rate among women; the male-to-female case rate ratio increased from 0.97 in 2012 to 1.31 in 2015. The proportion of gonococcal urethral isolates collected in the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project that were collected from MSM increased from 21.5% to 38.1% in 2006 to 2015. In 2009 to 2015, the percent of MSM who tested positive for rectal and oropharyngeal gonorrhea in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics increased by 73.4% and 12.6%, respectively. Estimated rates of gonorrhea among MSM increased by 151% in 2010 to 2015 in jurisdictions participating in the STD Surveillance Network. Data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance demonstrate that testing for gonorrhea among MSM increased by 23.1% between 2011 and 2014. Together, surveillance data suggest a disproportionate burden of gonorrhea among MSM in the United States and suggest increases in both screening and disease in recent years. Because each data source has inherent limitations and biases, examining these data from different systems together strengthens this conclusion.

TI  - Dark target effectiveness for dark-object subtraction atmospheric correction method on mangrove above-ground carbon stock mapping
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most effective atmospheric correction methods is dark-object subtraction (DOS) method, where the atmospheric offset can be generated from the image itself. The success of DOS strongly relies on the availability and quality of the dark target. Based on the response to the downwelling irradiances, the most effective dark target would be optically-deep water, which is not always available. It is important to assess the alternative dark targets in the absence of the ideal dark target. This research aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different dark targets for DOS method during mangrove above-ground carbon stock (AGC) mapping and comparing the accuracy with robust atmospheric correction FLAASH method. ALOS AVNIR-2 image was used as the test image, and mangrove forest of Karimunjawa and Kemujan Island was selected as the study area. The comparison covers the quality of healthy mangrove reflectance and the accuracy of vegetation indices for mangrove AGC mapping. The results of this research showed that non-ideal dark targets such as cloud-shadow pixels and the minimum value of the image can be used in the absence of ideal dark target, and DOS method is more efficient and effective than more robust atmospheric correction method.

TI  - Simplified Normalization of C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for Terrestrial Applications in High Latitude Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications often require normalization to a common incidence angle. Angular signatures of radar backscatter depend on surface roughness and vegetation cover, and thus differ, from location to location. Comprehensive reference datasets are therefore required in heterogeneous landscapes. Multiple acquisitions from overlapping orbits with sufficient incidence angle range are processed in order to obtain parameters of the location specific normalization function. We propose a simpler method for C-band data, using single scenes only. It requires stable dielectric properties (no variations of liquid water content). This method is therefore applicable for frozen conditions. Winter C-band data have been shown of high value for a number of applications in high latitudes before. In this paper we explore the relationship of incidence angle and Sentinel-1 backscatter across the tundra to boreal transition zone. A linear relationship (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.64) can be found between backscatter and incidence angle dependence (slope of normalization function) as determined by multiple acquisitions on a pixel by pixel basis for typical land cover classes in these regions. This allows a simplified normalization and thus reduced processing effort for applications over larger areas.

TI  - Controls on rapid supraglacial lake drainage in West Greenland: an Exploratory Data Analysis approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The controls on rapid surface lake drainage on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) remain uncertain, making it challenging to incorporate lake drainage intomodels of GrIS hydrology, and so to determine the ice-dynamic impact of meltwater reaching the ice-sheet bed. Here, we first use a lake area and volume tracking algorithm to identify rapidly draining lakes within West Greenland during summer 2014. Second, we derive hydrological, morphological, glaciological and surface-mass-balance data for various factors that may influence rapid lake drainage. Third, these factors are used within Exploratory Data Analysis to examine existing hypotheses for rapid lake drainage. This involves testing for statistical differences between the rapidly and non-rapidly draining lake types, as well as examining associations between lake size and the potential controlling factors. This study shows that the two lake types are statistically indistinguishable for almost all factors investigated, except lake area. Thus, we are unable to recommend an empirically supported, deterministic alternative to the fracture area threshold parameter for modelling rapid lake drainage within existing surface-hydrology models of the GrIS. However, if improved remotely sensed datasets (e.g. ice-velocitymaps, climate model outputs) were included in future research, it may be possible to detect the causes of rapid drainage.

TI  - Usage and survival implications of surgical staging of inguinal lymph nodes in intermediate- to high-risk, clinical localized penile cancer: A propensity-score matched analysis
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the usage of surgical staging of inguinal lymph nodes (SSILNs) in the United States for intermediate to high risk, clinically localized penile squamous cell cancer (SCC), to explore patient and hospital factors associated with omission of this staging, and to evaluate the effect on survival.Patients and methods: Retrospective, observational study using the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014 of 1,689 men diagnosed with pT1b-T3, cN0 penile SCC, who by current guidelines should receive SSILNs-either by inguinal lymph node (1LN) dissection or sentinel node biopsy. Binomial logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of SSILNs. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the impact of SSILNs on survival in the overall and propensity-score matched patient populations.Results: Only 25.3% of patients underwent SSILNs. Increasing patient age, higher comorbidity status, lower pathologic stage, Medicaid insurance, and treatment at a nonacademic facility were independent factors associated with the omission of SSILNs. Omission of SSILNs was an independent predictor of overall mortality, both in the overall patient population after multivariate adjustment, HR = 1.46 [(95% CI: 1.14-1.88), P = 0.003], and in the propensity-score matched adjusted population, HR = 1.59 [(95% CI: 1.20-2.13), P = 0.001]. Limitations include an inability to distinguish biopsy from ILN dissection and those inherent in observational study design.Conclusion: Utilization of SSILN for penile SCC is low and has not changed significantly since the publication of guidelines in the United States. In particular, nonacademic institutions were less likely to adhere to recommendations for performance of SSILNs. We found the omission of SSILNs is associated with a significant increase in mortality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Thin-Cloud Mask Method for Remote Sensing Images Based on Sparse Dark Pixel Region Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin clouds in remote sensing images increase the radiometric distortion of land surfaces. The identification of pixels contaminated by thin clouds, known as the thin-cloud mask, is an important preprocessing procedure to guarantee the proper utilization of data. However, failure to effectively separate thin clouds and high-reflective land-cover features causes thin-cloud masks to remain a challenge. To overcome this problem, we developed a thin-cloud masking method for remote sensing images based on sparse dark pixel region detection. As a result of the effect of scattering, the path radiance is added to the radiance recorded by the sensor in the thin-cloud area, which causes the number of dark pixels in the thin-cloud area to be much less than that in the clear area. In this study, the area of a Thiessen polygon (a nonparametric measure) is used to evaluate the density of local dark pixels, and the region with the sparse dark pixel is selected as the thin-cloud candidate. Then, thin-cloud and clear areas are used as samples to train the background suppression haze thickness index (BSHTI) transform parameters, and convert the original multiband images into single-band images. Finally, an accurate thin-cloud mask is obtained for every buffered thin-cloud candidate, via the segmentation of the BSHTI band. Additionally, the multispectral images obtained by the Wide Field View (WFV), on board the Chinese GaoFenl, and the Operational Land Imager (OLI), on board the Landsat 8, are employed to evaluate the performance of the method. The results reveal that the proposed approach can obtain a thin-cloud mask with a high true-value ratio and detection ratio. Thin-cloud masks can satisfy various application demands.

TI  - Surface-deformation monitoring in the permafrost regions over the Tibetan Plateau, using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) has been widely used to measure surface deformation over the Tibetan Plateau. However, the accuracy and applicability of the D-InSAR method are not well estimated due to the lack of in-situ validation. In this paper, we mapped the seasonal and long-term displacement of Tanggula (TGL) and Liangdaohe (LDH) permafrost regions with a stack of Sentinel-1 acquisitions using the Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method. In the TGL region, with its dry soils and sparse vegetation, the InSAR-derived surface-deformation trend was consistent with ground-based leveling results; long-term changes of the active layer showed a settlement rate of around 1 to 3 mm/a due to the melting of ground ice, indicating a degrading permafrost in this area. Around half of the deformation was picked up on monitoring, in contrast with in-situ measurements in LDH, implying that the D-InSAR method remarkably underestimated the surface-deformation. This phenomenon may be induced by the large soil-water content, high vegetation coverage, or a combination of these two factors in this region. This study demonstrates that surface deformation could be mapped accurately for a specific region with Sentinel-1 C-band data, such as in the TGL region. Moreover, although the D-InSAR technology provides an efficient solution for broad surface-deformation monitoring in permafrost regions, it shows a poor performance in the region with high soil-water content and dense vegetation coverage.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris-covered glaciers are common in the Himalayas and play a key role in understanding future regional water availability and management. Previous studies of regional glacial changes have often neglected debris-covered glaciers or have mixed them with debris-free glaciers. In this study, we generated a new glacier data set that includes debris-covered and debris-free glaciers to study the glacial surface area change in the Koshi River Basin in the central Himalayas. Long time-series Landsat data were used to extract the glacier boundaries using automatic and manual classification methods. The glacial area decreased by 10.4% from 1975 to 2010 at a rate of 0.30% a(-1), with accelerated melting since 2000 (0.47% a(-1)). Small glaciers melted faster than large glaciers. In terms of distinctive glacier types, debris-free glaciers shrank at a rate of 0.45% a(-1), faster than debris-covered glaciers (0.18% a(-1)), while debris-covered glaciers larger than 5.0 km(2) retreated at a rate faster than debris-free glaciers of the same-sized group. We also studied the potential interactions between 222 supraglacial lakes and debris-covered glaciers. Debris-covered glaciers with glacial lakes melt faster than glaciers without lakes. This study can improve our understanding of the differences in the changes between debris-covered and debris-free glaciers in the central Himalayas and help evaluate water resource changes in the Himalayas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal differences in cloud cover of Landsat-8 OLI observations across China during 2013-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the historical archive images of Landsat family sensors are probably the most effective data products for tracking global longitudinal changes since the 1970s. However, the issue of the degree and extent of cloud coverage is always a challenge and varies distinctively worldwide. So far, acquisition probability (AP) analyses of cloud cover (CC) of Landsat observations have been conducted with different sensors at regional scale. To our knowledge, CC probability analysis for the newly-launched Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) across China is not reported. In this paper, monthly, seasonal, and annual APs for Landsat OLI (44,228 in total) images over China acquired from April 2013 to October 2016 with various CC thresholds were analyzed. The results showed that: first, the cumulative average APs of all OLI data over China at the CC thresholds <= 30% was about 49.6% which illustrated the availability of OLI imagery across China. Second, the spatial patterns of 10%, 20%, and 30% CC thresholds of OLI observations, coincided well with the precipitation distributions separated by the respective 200 mm, 400 mm, and 800 mm isohyetal lines. Third, the APs of images with the 30% CC threshold are the highest in autumn and winter especially in October of 58.7%, while the corresponding lowest probability occurred in June of 41.0%. Finally, the spatial differences in APs of targeted images with <= 30% CC thresholds were quite significant. At regional scales, the arid and semi-arid areas, Inland River and Songliao River basins, and northwestern side of the Hu Huanyong population line had the larger probabilities of obtaining high-quality images. Our study suggested that OLI imagery satisfy the data requirements needed for land surface monitoring, although there existed obvious spatio-temporal differences in APs over China at the 30% CC threshold.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Gross Primary Productivity Using Topographic and Vegetation Heterogeneity Information: A Case Study in the Gongga Mountain Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the spatial heterogeneity of land surfaces, downscaling is an important issue in the development of carbon cycle models when evaluating the role of ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. In this study, a downscaling algorithm was developed to model gross primary productivity (GPP) at 500 m in a time series over rugged terrain, which considered the effects of spatial heterogeneity on carbon flux simulations. This work was carried out for a mountainous area with an altitude ranging from 2606 to 4744 m over the Gongga Mountain (Sichuan Province, China). In addition, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product at 1 km served as the primary dataset for the downscaling algorithm, and the 500 m MODIS GPP product was used as the reference dataset to evaluate the downscaled GPP results. Moreover, in order to illustrate the advantages and benefits of the proposed downscaling method, the downscaled results in this work, along with ordinary kriging downscaled results, spline downscaled results and inverse distance weighted (IDW) downscaled results, were compared to the MODIS GPP at 500 m. The results showed that (1) the GPP difference between the 500 m MODIS GPP and the proposed downscaled GPP results was primarily in the range of [-1, 1], showing that both vegetation heterogeneity factors (i.e., LAI) and topographic factors (i.e., altitude, slope and aspect) were useful for GPP downscaling; (2) the proposed downscaled results (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 1.03) had a stronger consistency with the 500 m MODIS GPP than those of the ordinary kriging downscaled results (R-2 = 0.43, RMSE 1.36), the spline downscaled results (R-2 = 0.40, RMSE = 1.50) and the IDW downscaled results (R-2 = 0.42, RMSE = 1.10) for all Julian days; and (3) the inconsistency between MODIS GPP at 500 m and 1 km increased with the increase in altitude and slope. The proposed downscaling algorithm could provide a reference when considering the effects of spatial heterogeneity on carbon flux simulations and retrieving other fine resolution ecological-physiology parameters (e.g., net primary productivity and evaporation) over topographically complex terrains.

TI  - Evaluation of Temporal and Spatial Ecosystem Services in Dalian, China: Implications for Urban Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The valuation of ecosystem services is critical to understand the current status of ecosystems and to develop an effective planning strategy for ecosystem protection. This study aims to analyse the spatio-temporal changes in ecosystem services driven by land use changes from 1984 to 2013 in Dalian, China. The land use changes are characterized using remote sensing data and then ecosystem service values (ESVs) are assessed using the equivalent factor method, i.e., assigning value coefficients to different land use categories. The total ESV of Dalian reduced significantly by 44.3% from 1984 to 2013, primarily due to the reduction of forests, water and wetlands. Water and climate regulations are the two largest service functions, contributing about 43.6% of the total ESV on average. In addition, ESVs show a spatial variation in different administrative regions, with the central city area having the maximum decreasing rate. Further, ESV changes and distributions are found to have a strong link with city development policies. This study provides an enhanced understanding of the implications of urban policies on ecosystem services, which is essential for sustaining the provision of ecosystem services and achieving sustainable development goals.

TI  - Quantifying the influences of grazing, climate and their interactions on grasslands using Landsat TM images
T2  - GRASSLAND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate grazing management ensures sustainable productivities of grassland ecosystems while maintaining grassland services. Thus, it is important to understand the influences of grazing management on grassland ecosystems, which can be monitored by measuring grassland response (e.g. leaf area index [LAI]) to grazing management. However, the measured grassland response includes the impact not only of grazing management, but also of other factors and their interactions, such as climate variability and fire. Therefore, to better study the effects of grazing management, grassland response to grazing needs to be quantified separately from that of other factors which influence grasslands and their interactions. The aim of our research was to quantify these interactions using Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images with long-term datasets at a regional scale. We studied vegetation using a manipulative grazing experiment that applied a range of low to high cattle stocking rates from 2008 to 2011 in a northern native mixed-prairie in Saskatchewan. Results show that precipitation, temperature, interaction between temperature and precipitation, cattle density, interaction between temperature and cattle density, and the interaction among cattle density and climate parameters explained 65.5, 14.5, 9.8, 1.7, 1.4 and 0.5% of the variation in grassland LAI, respectively; thus, precipitation has the dominant effect in mixed-grass prairies, while temperature and the interaction between temperature and precipitation have only moderate effects, and grazing intensity and the interaction between grazing intensity and climate variations have relatively low effects. The results also suggest that grassland response to grazing can be quantitatively separated from that of climate variability with the prior knowledge of grazing intensity, even though the influences of precipitation on LAI overrode the effects of short term grazing.

TI  - Regional Daily ET Estimates Based on the Gap-Filling Method of Surface Conductance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing allows regional evapotranspiration (ET) values to be obtained. Surface conductance is a key variable in estimating ET and controls surface flux interactions between the underlying surface and atmosphere. Limited by the influence of clouds, ET can only be estimated on cloud-free days. In this study, a gap-filling method is proposed to acquire daily surface conductance, which was coupled into a Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, to estimate the regional daily ET over the Hai River Basin. The gap-filling method is coupled with the canopy conductance, surface conductance and a simple time extension method, which provides more mechanisms and is more comprehensive. Field observations, including eddy covariance (EC) fluxes and meteorological elements from automatic weather station (AWS), were collected from two sites for calibration and validation. One site is located in Guantao County, which is cropped in a circular pattern with winter wheat and summer maize. The other site is located in Miyun County, which has orchard and summer maize crops. The P-M equation was inverted to the computed surface conductance at the field scale, and latent heat fluxes from EC were processed and converted to daily ET. The results show that the surface conductance model used in the gap-filling method performs well compared with the inverted surface conductance, which suggests that the model used here is reasonable. In addition, the relationship between the results estimated from the gap-filling method and EC measurements is more pronounced than that between the other method and the EC measurements. The R2 values improve from 0.68 to 0.75 at the Guantao site and from 0.79 to 0.88 at the Miyun site. The improvement mainly occurs during the growing crop season, according to the temporal variations in the results.

TI  - Profiling Human-Induced Vegetation Change in the Horqin Sandy Land of China Using Time Series Datasets
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Discriminating the significant human-induced vegetation changes over the past 15 years could help local governments review the effects of eco-programs and develop sustainable land use policies in arid/semi-arid ecosystems. We used the residual trends method (RESTREND) to estimate the human-induced and climate-induced vegetation changes. Two typical regions in the Horqin Sandy Land of China were selected as study areas. We first detected vegetation dynamics between 2000-2014 using Sen's slope estimation and the Mann-Kendall test detection method (SMK) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, then used RESTREND to profile human modifications in areas of significant vegetation change. RESTREND was optimized using statistical and trajectory analysis to automatically identify flexible spatially homogeneous neighborhoods, which were essential for determining the reference areas. The results indicated the following. (1) Obvious vegetation increases happened in both regions, but Naiman (64.1%) increased more than Ar Horqin (16.8%). (2) Climate and human drivers both contributed to significant changes. The two factors contributed equally to vegetation change in Ar Horqin, while human drivers contributed more in Naiman. (3) Human factors had a stronger influence on ecosystems, and were more responsible for vegetation decreases in both regions. Further evidences showed that the primary human drivers varied in regions. Grassland eco-management was the key driver in Ar Horqin, while farming was the key factor for vegetation change in Naiman.

TI  - Spatio-temporal prediction of crop disease severity for agricultural emergency management based on recurrent neural networks
T2  - GEOINFORMATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - As crop diseases bring huge losses every year in both developed and developing countries, determining how to precisely predict crop disease severity to facilitate agricultural emergency management is really a worldwide problem. Previous studies have introduced machine learning (ML) techniques into crop disease prediction and achieved better experimental results. However, the architectures of these ML models are unsuitable to model time series data. Moreover, the dependences among observations over time and across space have not been taken into account in model construction. By applying data-mining techniques to dynamic spatial panels of remote sensing data and considering features of bioclimatic, topographic and soil conditions as a supplement, we propose a novel crop disease prediction framework for agricultural emergency management based on ensemble learning techniques and spatio-temporal recurrent neural network (STRNN) which is an extension of recurrent neural network (RNN) in time and space. Empirical experiments are conducted on a specific dataset which is built based on reported cases of wheat yellow rust outbreaks in the Longnan city. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baseline models in crop disease severity prediction. The managerial implication of our work is that by applying the proposed methodology, some preparedness measures can be implemented in advance to prevent or mitigate the possible disasters according to predicted results. Notable economic and ecological benefits can be achieved by optimizing the frequency and timing of application of fungicide, pesticides and other preventative measures.

TI  - Evaluation of One-Class Support Vector Classification for Mapping the Paddy Rice Planting Area in Jiangsu Province of China from Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of paddy fields is essential for monitoring the rice cultivated area and predicting rice productivity. Timely and accurate extraction of rice distribution can bring vital information for national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and regional environmental sustainability. Conventional classification methods usually suffered from low accuracy, multi-class training samples, or demanding imagery requirements. This paper proposes to use one-class support vector classification (OCSVC) to extract rice cultivated area with Landsat Optical Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Instead of sampling and training all land cover types as performed by multi-class classification methods, OCSVC only used the training samples of target class (rice) for rice mapping. The performance of OCSVC was evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy of rice mapping and rice acreage estimation based on high-resolution imagery, field survey data and rice acreage data from government reports for Jiangsu Province, China. At the county-level, OCSVC was also compared with the commonly used multi-class support vector classification (MCSVC), decision tree classification (DTC), and vegetation index-based thresholding (VIT). Our results demonstrated that OCSVC produced a comparable overall accuracy to DTC and outperformed MCSVC and VIT. The computational efficiency of OCSVC increased approximately ten times as compared to MCSVC. The OCSVC produced the best correlation between its classified area and reported area among the four classification methods evaluated. When applied to the provincial level, the classification overall accuracy for OCSVC was 88.54%. The detected rice planting area for Jiangsu Province was 22,602 km2, which was consistent with the statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics (22,948 km2). This OCSVC-based mapping strategy provides a practical and efficient way to detect the rice planting extent with Landsat imagery at a large scale.

TI  - Estimating soil total nitrogen in smallholder farm settings using remote sensing spectral indices and regression kriging
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping soil nutrients can help smallholder farmers identify soil nutrient status and implement site-specific soil management schemes. In the past, Digital Soil Mapping has seldom been utilized to guide soil nutrient management in smallholder farm settings in South India. The objective of this research was to analyze the spatial resolution effects of different remote sensing images on soil total nitrogen (TN) prediction models in two smallholder villages, Kothapally and Masuti in South India. Regression kriging (RK) was used to characterize the spatial pattern of TN in the topsoil (0-15 cm) by incorporating spectral indices with different spatial resolutions. The results suggested that soil moisture, vegetation, and soil crusts can contribute to the conservation of soil TN in both study areas. Soil prediction models with different spatial resolutions showed a similar spatial pattern of soil TN. The results also demonstrated that the effect of very fine spatial remote sensing spectral data inputs does not always lead to an increase of soil prediction model performance. A RapidEye-based (5 m) soil TN prediction model had lower prediction accuracy than a Landsat 8-based (30 m) soil TN prediction model in Masuti. WorldView-2/GeoEye-1/Pleiades-1A-based (2 m) soil TN prediction models had the highest prediction accuracy in both study areas. The spectral indices based on new bands of World View-2 such as coastal, yellow, red edge, and new near infrared bands had relatively strong correlations with soil TN. The utilization of Very High Spatial resolution images such as WorldView-2 in Digital Soil Mapping could improve soil model performance and spatial characterization. Remote sensing-based soil prediction models have high potential to be widely applied in smallholder farm settings.

TI  - Construction and application effects of normalized shaded vegetation index (NSVI)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral features and differences in bright vegetation area, shaded vegetation area and water area were investigated by the experimental data from four medium resolution remote sensing images of ALOS AVNIR-2, CBERS-02B CCD, HJIA-CCD2 and Landsat 7 ETM. Based on the near-infrared band and normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Shaded Vegetation Index (NSVI) was constructed and the enhancements of spectral differences and classification effect were also evaluated. The results show that NSVI has increased the relative diferences of the spectra in bright vegetation area, shaded vegetation area and water area, and reduced probability of misapplication for the spectral data. The NSVI threshold method was employed to classify the four experimental images. The overall accuracy is over 97%, and the overall Kappa coefficient is above 0.96. The detection accuracy of the shaded vegetation area is over 94% and the Kappa coefficient is also higher than 0.96. By using radiation differences of the near-infrared band between the ground objects, NSVI can solve the problem that NDVI can only partially weaken the topographic effect and enlarge the spectral differences among the ground objects. NSVI enhances the validity of the ground objects especially in the shadow detection and avoids the "saturation" problem of NDVI. It can provide a new solution to remove the shadow in remote sensing images.

AB  - Background: Adverse effects of ambient fine particles (PM2.5) on sperm quality and oocyte fertilization have been identified by previous research. However, insufficient human studies tested associations between PM2.5 and decreased fertility rates.Methods: We associated long-term exposure to PM2.5 and county-level fertility rates reported by 2010 census across China. Exposure assessments were based on PM2.5 maps (2009-2010) with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees derived from satellite remote sensing data from another published study. We used a Poisson regression to examine the relationship between PM2.5 and fertility rates with adjustment of potential confounders including county-level socioeconomic factors (e.g. sex ratio) and a spatially smoothed trend.Results: We found that fertility rates were significantly decreased by 2.0% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%, 2.1%) per 10 mu g/m(3) increment of PM2.5. We also found a geographical variation of the associations.Conclusions: The study add to epidemiological evidences on adverse effects of PM2.5 on fertility rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping vegetation functional types in urban areas with WorldView-2 imagery: Integrating object-based classification with phenology
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping urban vegetation is a prerequisite to accurately understanding landscape patterns and ecological services provided by urban vegetation. However, the uncertainties in fine-scale vegetation biodiversity mapping still exist in capturing vegetation functional types efficiently at fine scale. To facilitate the application of fine-scale vegetation spatial configuration used for urban landscape planning and ecosystem service valuation, we present an approach integrating object-based classification with vegetation phenology for fine-scale vegetation functional type mapping in compact city of Beijing, China. The phenological information derived from two WorldView-2 imagery scenes, acquired on 14 September 2012 and 26 November 2012, was used to aid in the classification of tree functional types and grass. Then we further compared the approach to that of using only one WorldView imagery. We found WorldView-2 imagery can be successfully applied to map functional types of urban vegetation with its high spatial resolution and relatively high spectral resolution. The application of the vegetation phenology into classification greatly improved the overall accuracy of classification from 82.3% to 91.1%. In particular, the accuracies of vegetation types was improved by from 10% to 13.26%. The approach integrating vegetation phenology with high-resolution remote sensed images provides an efficient tool to incorporate multi-temporal data into fine-scale urban classification.

TI  - Generating Global Products of LAI and FPAR From SNPP-VIIRS Data: Theoretical Background and Implementation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation have been successfully generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data since early 2000. As the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument onboard, the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) has inherited the scientific role of MODIS, and the development of a continuous, consistent, and well-characterized VIIRS LAI/FPAR data set is critical to continue the MODIS time series. In this paper, we build the radiative transfer-based VIIRS-specific lookup tables by achieving minimal difference with the MODIS data set and maximal spatial coverage of retrievals from the main algorithm. The theory of spectral invariants provides the configurable physical parameters, i.e., single scattering albedos (SSAs) that are optimized for VIIRS-specific characteristics. The effort finds a set of smaller red-band SSA and larger near-infraredband SSA for VIIRS compared with the MODIS heritage. The VIIRS LAI/FPAR is evaluated through comparisons with one year of MODIS product in terms of both spatial and temporal patterns. Further validation efforts are still necessary to ensure the product quality. Current results, however, imbue confidence in the VIIRS data set and suggest that the efforts described here meet the goal of achieving the operationally consistent multisensor LAI/FPAR data sets. Moreover, the strategies of parametric adjustment and LAI/FPAR evaluation applied to SNPP-VIIRS can also be employed to the subsequent Joint Polar Satellite System VIIRS or other instruments.

TI  - Large-Area Gap Filling of Landsat Reflectance Time Series by Spectral-Angle-Mapper Based Spatio-Temporal Similarity (SAMSTS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series commonly contain missing observations, i.e., gaps, due to the orbit and sensing geometry, data acquisition strategy, and cloud contamination. A spectral-angle-mapper (SAM) based spatio-temporal similarity (SAMSTS) gap-filling algorithm is presented that is designed to fill small and large area gaps in Landsat data, using one year or less of data and without using other satellite data. Each gap pixel is filled by an alternative similar pixel that is located in a non-missing region of the image. The alternative similar pixel locations are identified by comparison of reflectance time series using a SAM metric revised to be adaptive to missing observations. A time series segmentation-and-clustering approach is used to increase the search efficiency. The SAMSTS algorithm is demonstrated using six months of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) reflectance time series over three 150 x 150 km (5000 x 5000 30 m pixels) areas in California, Minnesota and Kansas. The three areas contain different land cover types, especially crops that have different phenology and abrupt changes due to agricultural harvesting, which make gap filling challenging. Fillings on simulated gaps, which are equivalent to 36% of 5000 x 5000 images in each test area, are presented. The gap filling accuracy is assessed quantitatively, and the SAMSTS algorithm is shown to perform better than the simple closest temporal pixel substitution gap filling approach and the sinusoidal harmonic model-based gap filling approach. The SAMSTS algorithm provides gap-filled data with five-band reflective-wavelength root-mean-square differences less the 0.02, which is comparable to the OLI reflectance calibration accuracy.

TI  - Transition of Akabane virus genogroups and its association with changes in the nature of disease in Japan
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Akabane virus (AKAV) is teratogenic to the foetus of domestic ruminants and causes a significant reproduction loss in cattle in Japan. In several past epizootics in cattle, AKAV was also associated with post-natal encephalomyelitis, mainly in calves and young stock. Previously analysed AKAV isolates in East Asia form two major clusters, genogroups I and II, with isolates involved in encephalomyelitis belonging mainly to the former. Between 2007 and 2013, AKAV epizootics were regularly observed in Japan during the summer/autumn season, and abnormal deliveries and post-natal encephalomyelitis caused by the virus in cattle were reported. During this period, 30 AKAV isolates were obtained from diseased and sentinel cattle, a piglet and Culicoides biting midges throughout Japan and were subjected to genetic comparison and phylogenetic analysis with previous isolates. In 2007, 2011 and 2013, AKAV belonging to genogroup I was identified in the central nervous systems of calves showing neurological disorders. Notably, a total of 165 cases of bovine encephalomyelitis were reported in 2011 and the isolated viruses from affected animals shared high genetic identities with a South Korean isolate that was associated with a large outbreak in 2010, suggesting some epidemiological linkage between these epizootics. Epizootics of genogroup II were observed in 2008 and 2010, but bovine post-natal encephalomyelitis cases rarely occurred. Our findings suggest that the frequent incursion of genogroup I isolates has increased the frequency of post-natal encephalomyelitis cases in Japan in recent years. Infection by genogroup I virus was also identified in piglets with neurological disorders or congenital malformations in 2011 and 2013. The aetiological role of AKAV in pigs should be elucidated in the future.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Uncertainty of Fractional Vegetation Cover Change over Northern China during 2001-2012 Based on Multiple Vegetation Data Sets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern China is one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions in the country. To combat environmental degradation in northern China, a series of vegetation protection programs, such as the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (TNFSP), have been implemented. Whether the implementation of these programs in northern China has improved the vegetation conditions has merited global attention. Therefore, quantifying vegetation changes in northern China is essential for meteorological, hydrological, ecological, and societal implications. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a crucial biophysical parameter which describes land surface vegetation conditions. In this study, four FVC data sets derived from remote sensing data over northern China are employed for a spatio-temporal analysis to determine the uncertainty of fractional vegetation cover change from 2001 to 2012. Trend analysis of these data sets (including an annually varying estimate of error) reveals that FVC has increased at the rate of 0.26 4-0.13%, 0.30 4-0.25%, 0.12 :-0.03%, 0.49 :-0.21% per year in northern China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and North China during the period 2001-2012, respectively. In all of northern China, only 33.03% of pixels showed a significant increase in vegetation cover whereas approximately 16.81% of pixels showed a significant decrease and 50.16% remained relatively stable.

TI  - Factors associated with HIV infection among Yi minority residents in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province: A path analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to evaluate HIV prevalence among residents of Liangshan Prefecture through HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) data over the period from 2010 to 2016, and investigate risk factors for HIV infection in this population and interactions among them.Two sites (Dechang and Ningnan counties) with majority-Han populations, and 1 site (Butuo) with a majority-Yi population were selected. We used questionnaires to investigate residents' demographic and behavioral characteristics from 2010 to 2016, and performed HIV testing. Multivariate logistic regression and path analysis were undertaken to investigate the interactions and mediating effects among significant risk factors for HIV infection.A total of 5403 community residents in the Yi area and 10,897 community residents in the Han areas were enrolled. HIV prevalence in the Yi area was consistently high, ranging from 9.46% (63/666, 2011) to 2.88% (23/798, 2012) over the period from 2010 to 2016. HIV prevalence in the Han areas ranged from 0.15% (2/1333, 2010) to 0.44% (7/1604, 2011) over the same period. Multivariate logistic regression showed that unprotected casual sexual behavior, male gender, illiteracy, drug use, and injection drug use were positively associated with HIV infection risk in the Yi area. Path analysis of the risk factors revealed that casual sexual behavior (0.051) and injection drug use (0.161) were directly associated with HIV infection. However, marital status (0.004), ethnicity (0.017), education level (-0.004), HIV/AIDS-related prevention knowledge (-0.012), and drug use (0.11) had an indirect influence on HIV infection through casual sexual behavior and injection drug use.The prevalence of HIV is high among residents of majority-Yi areas, and injection drug use and casual sexual behavior are risk factors for infection.

TI  - Sentinel Wraps: Real-Time Monitoring of Food Contamination by Printing DNAzyme Probes on Food Packaging
T2  - ACS NANO
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we report the development of a transparent, durable, and flexible sensing surface that generates a fluorescence signal in the presence of a specific target bacterium. This material can be used in packaging, and it is capable of monitoring microbial contamination in various types of food products in real time without having to remove the sample or the sensor from the package. The sensor was fabricated by covalently attaching picoliter-sized microarrays of an E. coli-specific RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme probe (RFD-EC1) to a thin, flexible, and transparent cyclo-olefin polymer (COP) film. Our experimental results demonstrate that the developed (RFD-EC1)COP surface is specific, stable for at least 14 days under various pH conditions (pH 3-9), and can detect E. coli in meat and apple juice at concentrations as low as 10(3) CFU/mL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our sensor is capable of detecting bacteria while still attached to the food package, which eliminates the need to manipulate the sample. The developed biosensors are stable for at least the shelf life of perishable packaged food products and provide a packaging solution for real-time monitoring of pathogens. These sensors hold the potential to make a significant contribution to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the negative public-health-related impacts of food-borne illnesses.

TI  - Mapping Soil Salinity/Sodicity by using Landsat OLI Imagery and PLSR Algorithm over Semiarid West Jilin Province, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity and sodicity can significantly reduce the value and the productivity of affected lands, posing degradation, and threats to sustainable development of natural resources on earth. This research attempted to map soil salinity/sodicity via disentangling the relationships between Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery and in-situ measurements (EC, pH) over the west Jilin of China. We established the retrieval models for soil salinity and sodicity using Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). Spatial distribution of the soils that were subjected to hybridized salinity and sodicity (HSS) was obtained by overlay analysis using maps of soil salinity and sodicity in geographical information system (GIS) environment. We analyzed the severity and occurring sizes of soil salinity, sodicity, and HSS with regard to specified soil types and land cover. Results indicated that the models' accuracy was improved by combining the reflectance bands and spectral indices that were mathematically transformed. Therefore, our results stipulated that the OLI imagery and PLSR method applied to mapping soil salinity and sodicity in the region. The mapping results revealed that the areas of soil salinity, sodicity, and HSS were 1.61 +/- 106 hm(2), 1.46 +/- 106 hm(2), and 1.36 +/- 106 hm(2), respectively. Also, the occurring area of moderate and intensive sodicity was larger than that of salinity. This research may underpin efficiently mapping regional salinity/sodicity occurrences, understanding the linkages between spectral reflectance and ground measurements of soil salinity and sodicity, and provide tools for soil salinity monitoring and the sustainable utilization of land resources.

TI  - The Impacts of Vegetation and Meteorological Factors on Aerodynamic Roughness Length at Different Time Scales
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerodynamic roughness length (z(0m)) is a crucial parameter for reliably simulating turbulent exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. Due to the large number of input variables related to vegetation growth and aerodynamic conditions near the surface, estimating z(0m) precisely is difficult and, to date, no universal model has been established. Understanding the z(0m) changes in time series data and the relative contributions of vegetation indices and meteorological factors is important to providing a basis for modelling z(0m). In this paper, the main meteorological factors that influence z(0m) in different seasons are presented based on data from three automatic weather stations (AWSs) that represent various land surface patterns in the Heihe river basin. A correlation analysis identified the dominant factors that influence z(0m) changes at half-hour and daily scales; then, a factor analysis was performed to identify the different contributions of vegetation indices and meteorological factors to z(0m) at different time scales. The results show that meteorological factors (wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric stability) are the main driving factors for z(0m) at the Arou and Guantan sites, which are situated in grassland and forest mountain areas, respectively, and that the vegetation indices have no impact on the z(0m) variations in these areas. In contrast, for the Daman site, situated in flat farmland, the vegetation indices are the primary driving factors, while meteorological factors such as wind speed and atmospheric stability are secondary factors, and wind direction has no significant influence. Finally, a detailed analysis was conducted to detect the relationships between half-hourly z(0m) measurements and three dominant meteorological factors.

TI  - Individual and Interactive Influences of Anthropogenic and Ecological Factors on Forest PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations at an Urban Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of Landsat images and multisource data using spatial statistical analysis and geographical detector models can reveal the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic activities and ecological factors on concentrations of atmospheric particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5). This approach has been used in many studies to estimate biomass and forest disturbance patterns and to monitor carbon sinks. However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e. g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e. g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e. g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively. We conclude that in order to reveal the direct and indirect effects of human activities and multiple factors on PM2.5 concentrations in urban forests, quantification of fusion satellite data and spatial statistical methods should be conducted in urban areas.

T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The Haut-Sassandra Classified Forest (HSCF) experienced an accelerated deterioration with the 2002 crisis that shook Cote d'lvoire. The establishment of crops and habitats within this forest may suggest that the land on the periphery of this forest would be depleted. However, studies dealing with land saturation in the area around this FCHS are almost non-existent. The purpose of this study is to determine the dynamics of land use and land management in the peripheral zone of the HSFC. To achieve this, five Landsat satellite images covering the period 1990 to 2016 were acquired and processed. The validation of these treatments was coupled with socio-economic surveys and participatory observations carried out in 11 villages bordering this forest. The various analyze show that perennial crops, mainly cocoa trees, already occupied 73.9% of the area in 1990. With the disappearance of forests, aging orchards and certain parasitic constraints, cocoa cultivation experienced a regression during and after the decade of crisis in favor of rubber and cashew nuts. All this affects the land acquisition methods dominated before the crisis by donation or leasing but witch have disappeared today to the benefit of inheritance and purchase.

TI  - Copy number variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is characterized by a combination of neurological, developmental, and congenital defects that may occur as a consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure. Earlier reports showed that large chromosomal anomalies may link to FASD. Here, we examined the prevalence and types of copy number variations (CNVs) in FASD cases previously diagnosed by a multidisciplinary FASD team in sites across Canada. We genotyped 95 children with FASD and 87 age-matched, typically developing controls on the Illumina Human Omni2.5 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) array platform. We compared their CNVs with those of 10 851 population controls to identify rare CNVs (<0.1% frequency), which may include large unbalanced chromosomal abnormalities, that might be relevant to FASD. In 12/95 (13%) of the FASD cases, rare CNVs were found that impact potentially clinically relevant developmental genes, including the CACNA1H involved in epilepsy and autism, the 3q29 deletion disorder, and others. Our results show that a subset of children diagnosed with FASD have chromosomal deletions and duplications that may co-occur or explain the neurodevelopmental impairments in a diagnosed cohort of FASD individuals. Children suspected to have FASD with or without sentinel facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome and neurodevelopmental delays should potentially be evaluated by a clinical geneticist and possibly have genetic investigations as appropriate to exclude other etiologies.

TI  - A Comparison of Diagnostic Value of Pre-operative Axillary Ultrasonography with Frozen Section Pathologic Results of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: Although the breast cancer mortality rate has drastically decreased, it is still the second cause of cancer-induced death among women worldwide. Biopsy and surgery of sentinel lymph nodes are utilized to assess adjacent lymph nodes. However, this procedure has several side effects. Ultrasonography has been recommended as an alternative choice for distinguishing the involvement of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer. The present study aims to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of axillary ultrasonography in patients with breast cancer to compare the results with the sentinel lymph nodes biopsy. Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on the patients diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 60), referred to Afzalipour and Bahonar Hospitals, Kerman, Iran during 2015-2016. Ultrasonography was carried out using an ultrasound device with the surface probe at 10 MHz. Those patients, whose different ultrasonography parameters such as size, thickness of cortex, and thickness of modulus related to the most accessible susceptible lymph node showed no involvement, were included in the study. Sentinel lymph nodes were studied through concurrent utilization of the isotope injection method (scintigraphy) and blue iso-sulfate injection method. All samples were subjected to pathological analyses, and the results were compared to the ultrasonography results. Results: Results of permanent pathology were positive in all of the 9 patients whose Frozen Section results were positive. Of the 51 patients with negative Frozen Section results, only three demonstrated positive permanent pathologic results, and 48 participants showed negative permanent pathology. Considering the validating assessments, the negative predictive value of ultrasonography is 85%, compared with the frozen section specimens of sentinel nodes. Conclusion: Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes could be replaced with ultrasonography only by an expert and trained radiologist. It is recommended to use a predefined protocol in collaboration with four medical groups including radiology, nuclear medicine, surgery, and pathology groups.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of the nominations of non-voice sounds of a person. The study is done on the material of individual speech of a Siberian old-timer. 99 units (a lexical-semantic variant was taken as a unit of calculation) in more than 500 usages were analyzed. For the nomination of a sound, the dialect speaker most often uses verbs and onomatopoeia, and rarely nouns and adjectives. Several comparisons and metaphors were also fixed. as well as some non-verbal units (gestures).The non-voiced sounds of a person were divided into three groups: signals; sounds accompanying various actions; physiological sounds.The microfield "Signals" includes 22 units. Most of them are nominations of a knock at the door and their various derivatives. Nominations of this type of sound can be combined with nominations of thinking, emotion and evaluation, and such examples indicate their importance.The second group of nominations (sounds accompanying various actions) totals to 27 units. Sounds produced when food and drink are consumed are mentioned fairly often, and this fact reflects the importance of the process of eating in the peasant worldview. Sounds accompanying physical work as well as sounds of strokes are also regularly verbalized. The functioning of the onomatopoeic unit imitating spittle is peculiar. This unit, along with the gesture, is polysemantic. Most often it is used to denote a symbolic defense against the evil eye, and such usage reflects the superstitious views of the traditional culture representative. The second meaning is the expression of contempt and the third meaning (or function) is using it as a reaction to one's own mistake.The last microfield "Physiological Sounds" includes 50 units. The dialect speaker actively uses onomatopoeia (some of which are not presented in the literary language) to name such sounds. Physiological sounds (coughing, sneezing, snoring, wheezing, etc.) are usually associated with illness. A special group of nominations is that of unreal sound (tinnitus). It is nominated by different ways, including detailed comparisons with a natural phenomenon (wind). The final part of the article is devoted to the analysis of metaphorical meanings of sound nominations in the idiolect (eight cases).As a result of the whole analysis, the following conclusions are drawn in the article:1. The non-voice sound in the worldview of the informant appears most often as a sign informing about different events and states. 2. Sound is included in the system of superstitious representations of the person. 3. The sphere of music which takes an important place in literary texts is not relevant for the informant (it is a lacuna in the dialect sound worldview).

TI  - Quantifying Surface Coal-Mining Patterns to Promote Regional Sustainability in Ordos, Inner Mongolia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ordos became the new "coal capital" of China within a few decades since the country's economic reform in 1978, as large-scale surface coal mining dramatically propelled its per capita GDP from being one of the lowest to one of the highest in China, exceeding Hong Kong in 2009. Surface coal-mining areas (SCMAs) have continued to expand in this region during recent decades, resulting in serious environmental and socioeconomic consequences. To understand these impacts and promote regional sustainability, quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of SCMAs is urgently needed. Thus, the main objectives of this study were to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of SCMAs in the Ordos region from 1990 to 2015, and to examine some of the major environmental and socioeconomic impacts in the study region. We extracted the SCMAs using remote-sensing data, and then quantified their spatiotemporal patterns using landscape metrics. The loss of natural habitat and several socioeconomic indicators were examined in relation to surface coal mining. Our results show that the area of SCMAs increased from 7.12 km(2) to 355.95 km(2), an increase of nearly 49 times from 1990 to 2015 in the Ordos region. The number of SCMAs in this region increased from 82 to 651, a nearly seven-fold increase. In particular, Zhungeer banner (an administrative division), Yijinhuoluo banner, Dongsheng District and Dalate banner in the north-eastern part of the Ordos region had higher growth rates of SCMAs. The income gap between urban and rural residents increased along with the growth in SCMAs, undermining social equity in the Ordos region. Moreover, the rapid increase in SCMAs resulted in natural habitat loss (including grasslands, forests, and deserts) across this region. Thus, we suggest that regional sustainability in Ordos needs to emphasize effective measures to curb large-scale surface coal mining in order to reduce the urban-rural income gap, and to restore degraded natural ecosystems.

TI  - Ecosystem assessment and protection effectiveness of a tropical rainforest region in Hainan Island, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services have become one of the core elements of ecosystem management and evaluation. As a key area of ecosystem services and for maintaining national ecological security, ecosystem changes and implementation effect evaluation are important in national key ecological function zones, for promoting the main function zone strategy and for improving the construction of an ecological civilization. This article studies the ecological zone of a tropical rainforest region in the central mountain area of Hainan Island, China. Multi- source satellite data and ground observation statistics are analyzed with geo-statistics method and ecological assessment model. The core analysis of this paper includes ecosystem patterns, quality and services. By means of spatial and temporal scale expansion and multidimensional space-time correlation analysis, the trends and stability characteristics of ecosystem changes are analyzed, and implementation effect evaluation is discussed. The analysis shows a variety of results. The proportion of forest area inside the ecological zone was significantly higher than the average level in Hainan Island. During 1990-2013, settlement gradually increased inside the ecological zone. After implementation of the zone in 2010, human activity intensity increased, with the main land use being urban construction and land reclamation. Water conservation in the ecological function zone was higher than that outside the zone. In general, it increased slightly, but had obvious fluctuations. Soil conservation inside the zone was also better than that outside. However, it demonstrated dramatic fluctuations and relatively poor stability during 1990-2013. The human disturbance index inside the zone was significantly lower than that outside, and had a lower biodiversity threat level. Especially in 2010-2013, the increased range of the human disturbance index inside the zone was significantly less than that outside.

TI  - Monitoring of aeolian desertification on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the 1970s to 2015 using Landsat images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian desertification, one of the most serious environmental issues, has hampered socioeconomic development on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, research on aeolian desertification in this region has been limited. To develop a set of science-based preventive measures to mitigate desertification in this region, it is first necessary to clarify the status, evolution, and driving factors of aeolian desertification. In this study, based on extensive field investigations and a current classification system for aeolian desertification, we established a new system for interpreting aeolian desertified land (ADL) on the plateau using Landsat images from 1977, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 and obtained the distribution of ADL through visual interpretation of the images. The results showed that ADL covered 392,914 km(2) (15.1% of the study area) in 2015, including gravel ADL, sandy ADL, and aeolian monadnocks. Controlled by climate, landforms, the type of Quaternary deposit, and human activities, ADL is scattered throughout the plateau but is concentrated mostly in the western and northern parts. Aeolian desertification on the plateau expanded from 1977 to 2000 and then began to reverse. The evolution during the study period is the result of the combined effects of natural and human factors. Irrational human activities were the dominant factor responsible for the expansion of ADL prior to 2000, whereas the subsequent reversal was mainly caused by climate change combined with large ecological restoration projects.

TI  - Numerical Study of Physical Processes Controlling Summer Precipitation over the Western Ghats Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer precipitation over the Western Ghats and its adjacent Arabian Sea is an important component of the Indian monsoon. To advance understanding of the physical processes controlling this regional precipitation, a series of high-resolution convection-permitting simulations were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Convection simulated in the WRF Model agrees with TRMM and MODIS satellite estimates. Sensitivity simulations are conducted, by altering topography, latent heating, and sea surface temperature (SST), to quantify the effects of different physical forcing factors. It is helpful to put India's west coast rainfall systems into three categories with different causes and characteristics. 1) Offshore rainfall is controlled by incoming convective available potential energy (CAPE), the entrainment of midtropospheric dry layer in the monsoon westerlies, and the latent heat flux and SST of the Arabian Sea. It is not triggered by the Western Ghats. When offshore convection is present, it reduces both CAPE and the downwind coastal rainfall. Strong (weak) offshore rainfall is associated with high (low) SSTs in the Arabian Sea, suggested by both observations and sensitivity simulations. 2) Coastal convective rainfall is forced by the coastline roughness, diurnal heating, and the Western Ghats topography. This localized convective rainfall ends abruptly beyond the Western Ghats, producing a rain shadow to the east of the mountains. This deep convection with mixed phase microphysics is the biggest overall rain producer. 3) Orographic stratiform warm rain and drizzle dominate the local precipitation on the crest of the Western Ghats.

TI  - A manifold learning approach to urban land cover classification with optical and radar data
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land covers (ULC) are essential data for numerous studies of urban landscape ecology performed on various scales. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to obtain accurate and timely ULC information. This study presents a methodological framework for fusing optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at the pixel level with manifolds to improve ULC classification. Three typical manifold learning models, namely, ISOMAP, Local Linear Embedding (LLE) and principle component analysis (PCA), were employed, and their results were compared. SPOT-5 data were used as optical data to be fused with three different SAR datasets. Experimental results showed that 1) the most useful information of the optical and SAR data were included in the manifolds with intrinsic dimensionality, while various ULC classes were distributed differently throughout the feature spaces of manifolds derived from different learning methods; 2) in certain cases, ISOMAP performed comparably to PCA, but PCA generally performed the best out of all the study cases, yielding the best producer's and user's accuracy of all ULC classes and requiring the least amount of time to build the machine learning models; and 3) the LLE-derived manifolds yielded the lowest accuracy, primarily by confusing bare soils with dark impervious surfaces and vegetation. These results indicate the effectiveness of the new manifold technology to fuse optical and SAR data at the pixel level for improving ULC classification, which can be applied in practice to support the accurate analysis of urban landscape.

TI  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma of the breast: Experience of a major Chinese cancer center
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intracystic papillary carcinoma (IPC) is a rare breast neoplasm. There are few studies focusing on its clinical features and limited data about its preoperative diagnosis,treatment and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore specific characteristics of patients with IPC, investigate Its clinicopathological features, prognosis in China and confirm its surgery management.Methods: We identified 111 patients with IPC from the registry of Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between 2004 and 2017. Follow-up of cases dating back to January 1, 2004 was obtained from retrospective chart review and patient questionnaires. Differences in clinical features and survival of patients were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: The median tumor size was 2.25 cm. Median age was 62 years. In the cases of axillary lymph node dissection(ALND), only 1.1% (1/85) of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were found. The diagnostic accuracy of preoperative Color Doppler ultrasound and Mammograms for IPC was 62.0% (62/100) and 63.5% (54/85) respectively. The median follow-up period was 52 (range2-149) months. The overall survival rate was 98.9%, 92.2%,and 85.6% at 2,5,and 10 years and the relapse-free rate was 99.1%,97.2%,and 92.0% at 2,5, and 10 years, respectively. The disease-specific survival rate was 100%.Conclusion: Overall, we report some unique features of IPC in the Chinese population. The patients of IPC of the breast in China have more excellent prognosis than in Caucasian and other races. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging was low, and was easily misinterpreted as a cyst or benign disease. Preoperative core needle biopsies are very difficult for accurate pathological diagnosis of IPC. IPC is a localized disease with a low frequency of axillary lymph node involvement, rare distant metastases and excellent survival. The low incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis suggests that quadrectomy + sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and breast-conserving surgery is recommended for IPC.

TI  - Glacial Lake Detection from GaoFen-2 Multispectral Imagery Using an Integrated Nonlocal Active Contour Approach: A Case Study of the Altai Mountains, Northern Xinjiang Province
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to recent global climate change, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) have become a serious problem in many high mountain areas. Accurately and rapidly mapping glacial lakes is the basis of other glacial lake studies that are associated with water resources management, flood hazard assessment, and climate change. Most glacial lake detection studies have mainly used medium to coarse resolution images, whose application is limited to large lakes. Because small glacial lakes are abundant and because changes in these lakes are small and occur around the lake shores, fine-resolution satellite imagery is required for adequate assessments. In addition, the existing detection methods are mainly based on simply applying a threshold on various normalized difference water indices (NDWIs); this cannot give appropriate results for glacial lakes that have a wide range of turbidity, mineral, and chlorophyll content. In the present study, we propose a region-dependent framework to overcome the spectral heterogeneity of glacial lake areas using a nonlocal active contour model that is integrated with the NDWI. As the first trial, the glacial lakes were detected using high-resolution GaoFen-2 multispectral imagery in the test site of Altai Mountains (northern Xinjiang Province). The validation of the results was carried out using the manually digitized lake boundaries. The average probabilities of false positives P-FP and false negatives P-FN were found to be 0.0106 and 0.0039, respectively. After taking into consideration the spectral features of the water and making slight NDWI threshold adjustments, this method can also be used for lake detection in any glaciated environment elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a Estimation in Turbid Waters Using Combined SAR Data With Hyperspectral Reflectance Data: A Case Study in Lake Taihu, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration remains a great challenge in turbid waters due to their complex optical conditions. To improve chl-a estimation, this study aims to determine whether combined use of polarimetric synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data has potential for improving the chl-a estimation from hyperspectral sensing reflectance for turbid waters such as those found in Lake Taihu, China. In situ measurements of hyperspectral reflectance data and water samples were collected over the lake corresponding to ENVISAT ASAR data. Semiempirical (two-band and three-band models) and empirical [multiple linear regression (MLR) and multilayer perceptron network (MLP)] models are compared to estimate the chl-a concentration from in situ hyperspectral reflectance and SAR data. The results show that there is a general underestimation of chl-a for concentrations higher than 26 ug/L, which is probably caused by the large spatial variation of chl-a in the study area. The results also demonstrate that the MLR model performs in a more stable manner than the MLP network does, while MLP underestimates low and high areas of chl-a concentrations in the lake. On the other hand, due to the availability of one scenic SAR data on the same day, our results show that the additional use of SAR data improved chl-a estimation very slightly in this case study, although the performance of vertical/vertical polarization SAR data was better than that of horizontal/horizontal polarization data in chl-a estimation. Potential future work in this subject could explore other measures of mutual information between SAR and hyperspectral optical data beyond the correlation and regression techniques described. Therefore, it is still necessary to apply more SAR data in varied turbid waters in the near future to determine how SAR data can be useful in the improvement of chl-a estimation.

TI  - A Framelet-Based Iterative Pan-Sharpening Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is used to fuse multispectral images and panchromatic images to produce a multispectral image with high spatial resolution. In this paper, we design a new iterative method based on framelet for pan-sharpening. The proposed model takes advantage of the upsampled multispectral image and a linear relation between the panchromatic image and the latent high-resolution multispectral image. Since the sparsity of the pan-sharpened image under a B-spline framelet transform is assumed, we regularize the model by penalizing 11 norm of a framelet based term. The model is solved by a designed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). For better performance, we propose an iterative strategy to pick up more spectral and spatial details. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing pan-sharpening methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and response to climate extremes and ecological restoration in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme drought, precipitation, and other extreme climatic events often have impacts on vegetation. Based on meteorological data from 52 stations in the Loess Plateau (LP) and a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the third-generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) dataset, this study investigated the relationship between vegetation change and climatic extremes from 1982 to 2013. Our results showed that the vegetation coverage increased significantly, with a linear rate of 0.025/10a (P < 0.001) from 1982 to 2013. As for the spatial distribution, NDVI revealed an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast, with about 61.79% of the LP exhibiting a significant increasing trend (P < 0.05). Some temperature extreme indices, including TMAXmean, TMINmean, TN90p, TNx, TX90p, and TXx, increased significantly at rates of 0.77 mm/10a, 0.52 A degrees C/10a, 0.62 A degrees C/10a, 0.80 A degrees C/10a, 5.16 days/10a, and 0.65 A degrees C/10a, respectively. On the other hand, other extreme temperature indices including TX10p and TN10p decreased significantly at rates of -2.77 days/10a and 4.57 days/10a (P < 0.01), respectively. Correlation analysis showed that only TMINmean had a significant relationship with NDVI at the yearly time scale (P < 0.05). At the monthly time scale, vegetation coverage and different vegetation types responded significantly positively to precipitation and temperature extremes (TMAXmean, TMINmean, TNx, TNn, TXn, and TXx) (P < 0.01). All of the precipitation extremes and temperature extremes exhibited significant positive relationships with NDVI during the spring and autumn (P < 0.01). However, the relationship between NDVI and RX1day, TMAXmean, TXn, and TXx was insignificant in summer. Vegetation exhibited a significant negative relationship with precipitation extremes in winter (P < 0.05). In terms of human activity, our results indicate a strong correlation between the cumulative afforestation area and NDVI in Yan'an and Yulin during 1998-2013, r = 0.859 and 0.85, n = 16, P < 0.001.

TI  - Monitoring Quarry Area with Landsat Long Time-Series for Socioeconomic Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quarry sites result from human activity, which includes the removal of original vegetation and the overlying soil to dig out stones for building use. Therefore, the dynamics of the quarry area provide a unique view of human mining activities. Actually, the topographic changes caused by mining activities are also a result of the development of the local economy. Thus, monitoring the quarry area can provide information about the policies of the economy and environmental protection. In this paper, we developed a combined method of machine learning classification and quarry region analysis to estimate the quarry area in a quarry region near Beijing. A temporal smoothing based on the classification results of all years was applied in post-processing to remove outliers and obtain gently changing sequences along the monitoring term. The method was applied to Landsat images to derive a quarry distribution map and quarry area time series from 1984 to 2017, revealing significant inter-annual variability. The time series revealed a five-stage development of the quarry area with different growth patterns. As the study region lies on two jurisdictions-Tianjin and Hebei-a comparison of the quarry area changes in the two jurisdictions was applied, which revealed that the different policies in the two regions could impose different impacts on the development of a quarry area. An analysis concerning the relationship between quarry area and gross regional product (GRP) was performed to explore the potential application on socioeconomic studies, and we found a strong positive correlation between quarry area and GRP in Langfang City, Hebei Province. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of annual monitoring over the long-term for socioeconomic studies, which can be used for mining decision making.

AB  - To explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in pre-operative breast cancer patients and the value of enhancement patterns for diagnosing lymph node metastases and characterising axillary nodal burden.110 consecutive breast cancer patients were enrolled. Before the surgery, microbubbles were injected intradermally. The lymphatic drainage pathway was detected to identify the SLNs. Blue dye and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence were used to trace SLNs during the operation. The enhancement patterns of SLNs were recorded and compared with the final pathological diagnosis.SLN detection rate was 96.4 % of 110 patients, 134 SLNs were detected in total. The sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, negative-predictive value and accuracy of predicting SLNs metastases by CEUS enhancement patterns were 100 %, 52.0 %, 43.4 %, 100 % and 64.9 %, respectively. No metastatic SLNs were presented as homogeneous enhancement. Low nodal burden with 0-2 SLN metastases in 92.5 % nodes presented as heterogeneous enhancement. No enhancement pattern was proved to be SLN metastases in 100 % patients.CEUS is a feasible approach for SLN identification.

TI  - Clinicopathologic features and prognoses of different histologic types of triple-negative breast cancer: A large population-based analysis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To examine the clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of different histologic types of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Methods: We used the SEER database to identify patients with TNBC diagnosed between 2010 and 2014. Our analysis focused on the seven most prevalent histologic types. Differences were compared between invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) and the other six types.Results: Significant differences were observed in age at diagnosis, tumor grade, size, nodal status and treatment. As tumor size increased, the number of positive lymph nodes increased markedly in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and mixed NST and lobular carcinoma (NST-ILC), while in metaplastic carcinoma the number only increased slightly. In multivariate survival analyses, compared with patients with invasive carcinoma NST, breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were worse for those with NST-ILC (BCSS: hazard ratio [HR] 1.81, P < .001; OS: HR 1.56, P = .005) or metaplastic carcinoma (BCSS: HR 1.95, P < .001; OS: HR 1.73, P < .001). By contrast, patients with medullary (HR 0.40, P = .010) or apocrine carcinoma (HR 0.27, P = .008) showed better BCSS. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated that T category in ILC and N category in metaplastic carcinoma were of less prognostic value.Conclusions: According to the histologic classification of TNBC, this heterogeneous disease can be divided into several entities with different clinicopathologic features and prognoses. In the era of molecular subtyping of breast cancer, the histologic classification of NBC is still of considerable clinical significance.

TI  - A robust adaptive spatial and temporal image fusion model for complex land surface changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal satellite image fusion (STIF) has provided a feasible alternative for generating imagery with both high spatial and temporal resolution, thus expanding the applications of existing satellite sensors. However, a critical challenge confronting the further development of STIF is to systematically and robustly address complex land surface changes, which include land cover changes without shape changes (e.g., crop rotation) and land cover changes with shape changes (e.g., urban expansion), in addition to conventional land surface changes (e.g., phenological changes of vegetation). This paper presents the Robust Adaptive Spatial and Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) to tackle this challenge with one prior pair of MODIS-Landsat images. In RASTFM, land surface changes are reorganized into non-shape changes (including phenological changes and land cover changes without shape changes) and shape changes (i.e., land cover changes with shape changes), which are handled differently. However, both non-shape changes and shape changes are predicted through a Non-Local Linear Regression (NL-LR) of the subject pixel's similar neighbors. A regression.based high-pass modulation is also performed as a post-processing step to improve both the spatial details and spectral fidelity of the predicted Landsat image. Unlike other STIF models (e.g., the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM), RASTFM can find similar neighboring pixels more precisely through a non-local searching strategy and derives the weights of similar neighbors more rigorously via a linear regression model. As both non-shape and shape changes are treated based on the regression of similar neighboring pixels, the land surface changes are processed in a unified manner. Experiments that use one simulated and three actual MODIS-Landsat datasets featured by different types of land surface changes were conducted to demonstrate the performance of RASTFM. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art STIF models, including weighted function, unmixing and dictionary learning methods, show that NL-LR based RASTFM can capture the land surface changes in various landscapes more accurately and robustly in a unified manner, thereby facilitating the continuous and detailed monitoring of complex and diverse land surface dynamics.

TI  - Bamboo mapping of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda for the year 2016 using multi-temporal Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of bamboo in East Africa is necessary for biodiversity conservation, resource management and policy making for rural poverty reduction. In this study, we produced a contemporary bamboo cover map of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda for the year 2016 using multi-temporal Landsat imagery series at 30 m spatial resolution. This is the first bamboo map generated using remotely sensed data for these three East African countries that possess most of the African bamboo resource. The producer's and user's accuracies of bamboos are 79.2% and 84.0%, respectively. The hotspots with large amounts of bamboo were identified and the area of bamboo coverage for each region was estimated according to the map. The seasonal growth status of two typical bamboo zones (one highland bamboo and one lowland bamboo) were analyzed and the multi-temporal imagery proved to be useful in differentiating bamboo from other vegetation classes. The images acquired in September to February are less contaminated by clouds and shadows, and the image series cover the dying back process of lowland bamboo, which were helpful for bamboo identification in East Africa.

TI  - PECULIARITIES OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY FORMATION IN THE HISTORY OF KAZAKHSTAN
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper highlights problems of religious identity formation in Kazakhstan. The authors call attention to the genesis of religious tolerance as one of the main factors of the structure of religious identity in Kazakhstan. Pre-Islamic cultural layer in combination with different religious traditions has made the basis of the worldview with some elements of eclecticism and syncretism. Being most viable, Old Turkic religious faiths having joined Islam later created a tolerance basis of a religious worldview. On the whole, religious identity is a symbiosis of spiritual values in a polyconfessional society, where historically, Islam and Christianity played an important role. Religious identity in Kazakhstan is considered from the point of view of different forms of studies. The authors in their research raise the following issues: What is religious identity? What is its origin? What is the role of religious identity during different historical periods? Has its significance changed in the modern society and what are the perspectives in the context of ambivalent relations of a state and religion?

TI  - Research on Strong Clutter Suppression for Gaofen-3 Dual-Channel SAR/GMTI
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), moving targets are almost buried in ground clutter due to the wide clutter Doppler spectrum and the restricted pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which increases the difficulty of moving target detection. Clutter suppression is one of the key issues in the spaceborne SAR moving target indicator operation. In this paper, we describe the clutter suppression principle and analyze the influence of amplitude and phase error on clutter suppression. In the following, a novel dual-channel SAR clutter suppression algorithm is proposed, which is suitable for the Gaofen-3(GF-3) SAR sensor. The proposed algorithm consists of three technique steps, namely adaptive two-dimensional (2D) channel calibration, refined amplitude error correction and refined phase error correction. After channel error is corrected by these procedures, the clutter component, especially a strong clutter component, can be well suppressed. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by GF-3 SAR real data which demonstrates the ground moving-target indication (GMTI) capability of GF-3 SAR sensor.

TI  - Groundwater Depletion in the West Liaohe River Basin, China and Its Implications Revealed by GRACE and <i>In Situ</i> Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The West Liaohe River Basin (WLRB) is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in China and an important grain production base in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Groundwater depletion in this region is becoming a critical issue. Here, we used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and in situ well observations to estimate groundwater storage (GWS) variations and discussed the driving factors of GWS changes in the WLRB. GRACE detects a GWS decline rate of -0.92 +/- 0.49 km(3)/yr in the WLRB during 2005-2011, consistent with the estimate from in situ observations (-0.96 +/- 0.19 km (3)/yr). This long-term GWS depletion is attributed to reduced precipitation and extensive groundwater overexploitation in the 2000s. Long-term groundwater level observations and reconstructed total water storage variations since 1980 show favorable agreement with precipitation anomalies at interannual timescales, both of which are significantly influenced by the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Generally, the WLRB receives more/less precipitation during the El Nifio/La Nifia periods. One of the strongest El Nifho events on record in 1997-1998 and a subsequent strong La Nifia drastically transform the climate of WLRB into a decade-long drought period, and accelerate the groundwater depletion in the WLRB after 1998. This study demonstrates the significance of integrating satellite observations, ground-based measurements, and climatological data for interpreting regional GWS changes from a long-term perspective.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Land Subsidence in the Beijing Plain 2003-2015 Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) with Multi-Source SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is one of the most important geological hazards in Beijing, China, and its scope and magnitude have been growing rapidly over the past few decades, mainly due to long-term groundwater withdrawal. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been used to monitor the deformation in Beijing, but there is a lack of analysis of the long-term spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence. This study focused on detecting and characterizing spatiotemporal changes in subsidence in the Beijing Plain by using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and geographic spatial analysis. Land subsidence during 2003-2015 was monitored by using ENVISAT ASAR (2003-2010), RADARSAT-2 (2011-2015) and TerraSAR-X (2010-2015) images, with results that are consistent with independent leveling measurements. The radar-based deformation velocity ranged from -136.9 to + 15.2 mm/year during 2003-2010, and -149.4 to + 8.9 mm/year during 2011-2015 relative to the reference point. The main subsidence areas include Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi and Changping districts, where seven subsidence bowls were observed between 2003 and 2015. Equal Fan Analysis Method (EFAM) shows that the maximum extensive direction was eastward, with a growing speed of 11.30 km2 /year. Areas of differential subsidence were mostly located at the boundaries of the seven subsidence bowls, as indicated by the subsidence rate slope. Notably, the area of greatest subsidence was generally consistent with the patterns of groundwater decline in the Beijing Plain.

TI  - Simulation for balanced effect of soil and water resources on cultivated land in Naoli River Basin, Northeast China under the RCPs climate scene
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the scenarios of climate change, balancing the land and water resources is one of the key problems needed to be solved in land development. To reveal the water dynamics of the cultivated land in Naoli River Basin, we simulated the future scenarios by using the future land use simulation model based on Landsat Satellite images, the DEM data and the meteorological data. Results showed that the growth rate of cultivated land gradually decreased. It showed different chan. ging characteristics in different time periods, which led to different balancing effect between land and water resources. In 1990, the water dynamics of the cultivated land resources was in good state, At the same time, the adjustment of crops structure caused the paddy fields increased dramatically. During 2002 to 2014, the cultivated land that in moderate and serious moisture shortage state increased slightly, the water deficit was deteriorating to a certain degree, and maintained sound development of water profit and loss situation gradually. By comparing the simulation accuracy with different spatial resolutions and time scales, we selected 200 m as the spatial resolution of the simu. lation, and simulated the land use status in 2038. The simulation results showed that the cultivated land's water profit and loss degree in the river basin showed significant polarization characteristic, in that the water profit and loss degree of the cultivated land would be further intensified, the area with the higher grades of moisture profit and loss degree would distribute more centralized, and partially high evaluated grades for the moisture shortage would expand. It is needed to develop the cultivated land irrigation schemes and adjust the cultivated land in Naoli River Basin to balance soil and water resources.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Identifying Urban Built-Up Area Boundaries Using High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Data Based on the Scale Effect
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying urban built-up area boundaries is critical to urban data statistics, size measurement, and spatial control. However, previous methods of extracting urban built-up area boundaries based on low-resolution remote-sensing data are frequently constrained by data accuracy. In this paper, a new method for extracting urban built-up area boundaries using high-resolution remote sensing images based on scale effects is proposed. Firstly, we generate a number of different levels of edge-multiplied hexagonal vector grids. Secondly, the impervious surface densities are calculated based on the hexagonal vector grids with the longest edge. Then, the hexagonal grids with higher impervious surface densities are extracted as the built-up area of the first level. Thirdly, we gradually reduce the spatial scale of the hexagonal vector grid and repeat the extraction process based on the extracted built-up area in the previous step. Eventually, we obtain the urban built-up area boundary at the smallest scale. Plausibility checks indicate that the suggested method not only guarantees the spatial continuity of the resultant urban built-up area boundary, but also highlights the prevailing orientation of urban expansion. The extracted Beijing built-up area boundary can serve as a reference in decision-making for space planning and land-use control.

TI  - Multiple 3-D Feature Fusion Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the 3-D nature of hyperspectral images, as well as the spatial properties (such as regularity and continuity) of land covers, many 3-D feature extraction operators have been designed to fully exploit the joint spatial-spectral information. However, the large amount of obtained features can suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" problem, especially for the small training sample set. Moreover, various spatial-spectral features can represent the characteristics of the hyperspectral image from different aspects. In this paper, a multiple 3-D feature fusion framework (M3DF3) has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. First, we extend the 2-D Gabor surface feature into 3-D (3DSF) domains to comply with the spatial-spectral structure of the hyperspectral image, which is directly applied on the original hyperspectral image instead of the Gabor features. Second, three 3-D feature extraction methods, including the 3-D morphological profile, the 3-D local binary pattern, and the proposed 3DSF, that, respectively, characterize the hyperspectral image from three different angles, i.e., morphology, local dependence, and shape smoothness, are fused under a multitask sparse representation framework to take full advantage of the multiple 3-D features together. The proposed M3DF3 approach was fully tested on three real-world hyperspectral image data, i.e., the widely used Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Houston University. The results show that our method can achieve as high as 68.22%, 79.44%, and 72.84% accuracies, respectively, even when only few samples, i.e., three samples per class, are used for training.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Multisource Remote Sensing Data: Literature Survey, Taxonomy, Principles, Applications, and Future Directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite time series with high spatial resolution is critical for monitoring land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. Although remote sensing technologies have experienced rapid development in recent years, data acquired from a single satellite sensor are often unable to satisfy our demand. As a result, integrated use of data from different sensors has become increasingly popular in the past decade. Many spatiotemporal data fusion methods have been developed to produce synthesized images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions from two types of satellite images, frequent coarse-resolution images, and sparse fine-resolution images. These methods were designed based on different principles and strategies, and therefore show different strengths and limitations. This diversity brings difficulties for users to choose an appropriate method for their specific applications and data sets. To this end, this review paper investigates literature on current spatiotemporal data fusion methods, categorizes existing methods, discusses the principal laws underlying these methods, summarizes their potential applications, and proposes possible directions for future studies in this field.

TI  - Conditioning a Hydrologic Model Using Patterns of Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic models are usually calibrated using observed river runoff at catchment outlets. Streamflow, however, represents an integral response of the entire catchment and is observed at a few locations worldwide. Parameter estimation based on streamflow has the disadvantage that it does not consider the spatiotemporal variability of hydrologic states and fluxes such as evapotranspiration. Remotely sensed data, in contrast, include these variabilities and are broadly available. In this study, we assess the predictive skill of satellite-derived land surface temperature (T-s) with respect to river runoff (Q). We developed a bias-insensitive pattern-matching criterion to focus the parameter optimization on spatial patterns of T-s. The proposed method is extensively tested in six distinct large German river basins and cross validated in 222 additional basins in Germany. We conclude that land surface temperature calibration outperforms random drawn parameter sets, which could be meaningful for calibrating hydrologic models in ungauged locations. A combined calibration with Q and T-s reduces the root mean squared error in the predicted evapotranspiration by 8% compared to flux tower observations but reduces the NSEs of the streamflow predictions by 6% on average for the six large basins. Our results show that patterns of Ts better constrain model parameters when considered in a calibration next to Q, which finally reduces parametric uncertainty.

TI  - Study of High Accuracy Spectral Calibration of Fourier Transform Spectrometer
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the Fourier spectrometer spectral calibration accuracy and reduce spectral calibration error, we studied the Fourier spectrometer spectral calibration algorithm. The study is based on the data of spectral calibration experiment of the atmospheric vertical detector, which is a payload of FY-4 meteorology satellite. Firstly, the spectroscopic principle of the Fourier spectrometer is analyzed. Secondly, after analyzing the principle of the spectrum shift caused by the reference laser wave number drift, the light off-axis, and the limited field of view, the Fourier spectrometer spectral calibration formula and the calibration parameter calculation method are obtained. Then, the reasons for the large spectral calibration error caused by the barrier effect of Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) and the toe function generated by the truncation of the interferogram are analyzed. By comparing several different spectral refinement methods, fast Chirp Z-transform(CZT) for spectral refinement is selected to solve the problem of lower spectral resolution of FFT resulting in larger spectral error. Gaussian expansion and convoluting the sinc function of reference gas spectral can reduce the calibration error caused by limited optical path difference. At last, the spectral calibration algorithm is validated by using experimentally measured data. By comparing the calibration errors before and after refining the spectra using CZT, and the calibration errors before and after the processing of the reference gas spectrum, the algorithm is proved to be effective in improving spectral calibration accuracy. Spectral calibration error can be reduced about 10 times at most.

TI  - Enhanced Modeling of Annual Temperature Cycles with Temporally Discrete Remotely Sensed Thermal Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite thermal remote sensing provides land surface temperatures (LST) over extensive areas that are vital in various applications, but this technique suffers from its sampling style and the impenetrability of clouds, which frequently generates data gaps. Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models can fill these gaps and estimate continuous daily LST dynamics from a number of thermal observations. However, the standard ATC model (termed ATCs) remains incapable of quantifying the short-term LST variations caused by synoptic conditions. By incorporating in-situ surface air temperatures (SATs) and satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVIs), here we proposed an enhanced ATC model (ATCE) to describe the daily LST fluctuations. With Aqua/MODIS LST products as validation data, we implemented and tested the ATCE over the Yangtze River Delta region of China. The results demonstrate that, when compared with the ATCs, the overall root mean square errors of the ATCE decrease by 1.0 and 0.8 K for the day and night, respectively. The accuracy improvements vary with land cover types with greater improvements over the forest, grassland, and built-up areas than over cropland and wetland. The assessments at different time scales further confirm that LST fluctuations can be better described by the ATCE. Though with limitations, we consider this new model and its associated parameters hold great potentials in various applications.

TI  - Estimation and partitioning of actual daily evapotranspiration at an intensive olive grove using the STSEB model based on remote sensing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is based on the application of an existing simplified two-source energy balance (STSEB) model, using medium-resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) to estimate instantaneous (at the satellite overpass time) and daily actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) over an intensive olive grove. Daily values were obtained by the use of the evaporative fraction method and corrected for latent heat, available energy, and evaporative fraction biases (beta-factor correction). Model estimates were compared to ground-based measurements. Heat flux densities (eddy covariance method) were recorded, and five Landsat images at approximately monthly intervals were used, covering our study site in 2011. Comparison with ground measurements showed a maximum difference of -0.6 mm day(-1) before, and 0.2 mm day(-1) after beta-factor correction for the main plot.The experimental site consisted of a main plot exposed to deficit irrigation, and two small subplots where during a limited period of time (six weeks) one was temporarily not irrigated, and the other well irrigated for reference. One Landsat image was available for this limited period of time.Additionally, the STSEB algorithm was tested for partitioning evapotranspiration into its evaporation and transpiration components. Evaporation estimated from the STSEB model was compared with evaporation estimated from a model adjusted from local lysimeter measurements. Transpiration data obtained from calibrated sap flow measurements were, after local calibration, also compared to model estimates. Model results agreed with the measured data, showing) under- and overestimation for transpiration and evaporation, respectively.

TI  - Dating lava flows of tropical volcanoes by means of spatial modeling of vegetation recovery
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The age of past lava flows is crucial information for evaluating the hazards and risks posed by effusive volcanoes, but traditional dating methods are expensive and time-consuming. This study proposes an alternative statistical dating method based on remote sensing observations of tropical volcanoes by exploiting the relationship between lava flow age and vegetation cover. First, the factors controlling vegetation density on lava flows, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were investigated. These factors were then integrated into pixel-based multi-variable regression models of lava flow age to derive lava flow age maps. The method was tested at a pixel scale on three tropical African volcanoes with considerable recent effusive activity: Nyamuragira (Democratic Republic of Congo), Mt Cameroon (Cameroon) and Karthala (the Comoros). Due to different climatic and topographic conditions, the parameters of the spatial modeling are volcano-specific. Validation suggests that the obtained statistical models are robust and can thus be applied for estimating the age of unmodified undated lava flow surfaces for these volcanoes. When the models are applied to fully vegetated lava flows, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the saturation of NDVI. In order to improve the accuracy of the models, when available, spatial data on temperature and precipitation should be included to directly represent climatic variation.

TI  - Increased carriage of non-vaccine serotypes with low invasive disease potential four years after switching to the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in The Netherlands
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children < 5 years and adults > 65 years (2004-2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.

TI  - Spatial-temporal characteristics of aerosol loading over the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal characteristics of aerosol loading over the Yangtze River Basin, China during 2001-2015 were investigated using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), and ground-level particulate matter (PM) data. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) >0.8 occurs in the Yangtze River Delta, central China, and the Sichuan Basin, while AOD <0.3 occurs over higher-elevation areas in the western Sichuan Plateau and the source regions of the Yangtze River. The western Sichuan Plateau is characterized by fine-mode natural aerosols, while the source region of the Yangtze River is more influenced by dust aerosols. The Sichuan Basin, central China, and the Yangtze River Delta are dominated by anthropogenic aerosols. The spatial distribution of ground-level PM2.5 and its ratio to PM10 confirm the high aerosol loading and dominance of small particles over the middle and lower Yangtze Basin. Over the Yangtze River Delta, central China, and the Sichuan Basin, AOD varies seasonally from low in the cold months to high in the warm months, being suppressed by rainfall and wind during the Asian summer monsoon. Precipitation increases aerosol loading in the western Sichuan Plateau but reduces dust particles in the source region of the Yangtze River. There is no significant AOD trend over most areas of the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2015, while strong decreasing trends are found over most of the middle and lower Yangtze Basin during 2011-2015. These decreasing trends may relate to changes in annual precipitation, wind speed, and air-pollution control policies. The NO2 and SO2 emissions decreased by 16.51 and 23.40% over major provinces and cities of the Yangtze River Basin from 2011 to 2015. An increase in rainfall over the middle and lower Yangtze Basin and a better pollutant diffusion condition in the Sichuan Basin also favour the decreasing AOD during this period.

AB  - We use surveillance data to describe influenza A and B virus circulation over two consecutive seasons with excess all-cause mortality in Europe, especially in people aged 60 years and older. Influenza A(H3N2) virus dominated in 2016/17 and B/Yamagata in 2017/18. The latter season was prolonged with positivity rates above 50% among sentinel detections for at least 12 weeks. With a current west-east geographical spread, high influenza activity might still be expected in eastern Europe.

TI  - Migration of Atlantic salmon post-smolts in a fjord with high infestation pressure of salmon lice
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding Atlantic salmon Salmo salar post-smolt coastal migration behaviour is crucial for predicting their exposure to ecological challenges such as the parasite salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. We compared the migration of acoustically tagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon post-smolts of wild and domesticated origins from the inner, middle and outer part of a 172 km long aquaculture-intensive fjord in western Norway. Additionally, we examined if the timing of the release or treatment with an anti-parasitic drug (prophylaxis) altered migratory behaviour. We found no significant differences in mean progression rates among the 3 release locations, among genetic groups or between treatments (range: 11.5-16.9 km d(-1)). However, individual variation in progression rates and migratory routes resulted in large differences in fjord residence times (range: 2-39 d). Ocean-current directions during and after release affected swimming speed, progression rate and route choice, and for most post-smolts, swimming speeds were much higher than their progression rates out of the fjord. The predicted lice loads based on lice intensity growth rates on smolts held in sentinel cages throughout the fjord indicated that individuals taking >10 d to exit the fjord in periods with high infestation pressure are likely to get lethally high sea-lice infestations. We conclude that, as migratory routes of S. salar post-smolts are hard to predict and migration times can stretch up to over a month, it is important to develop aquaculture management that keeps salmon lice levels down along all potential migration routes and during the full potential migratory period.

TI  - A case of respiratory toxigenic diphtheria: contact tracing results and considerations following a 30-year disease-free interval, Catalonia, Spain, 2015
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In May 2015, following a 30-year diphtheria-free interval in Catalonia, an unvaccinated 6-year-old child was diagnosed with diphtheria caused by toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae. After a difficult search for equine-derived diphtheria antitoxin (DAT), the child received the DAT 4 days later but died at the end of June. Two hundred and seventeen contacts were identified in relation to the index case, and their vaccination statuses were analysed, updated and completed. Of these, 140 contacts underwent physical examination and throat swabs were taken from them for analysis. Results were positive for toxigenic C. diphtheriae in 10 contacts; nine were asymptomatic vaccinated children who had been in contact with the index case and one was a parent of one of the nine children. Active surveillance of the 217 contacts was initiated by healthcare workers from hospitals and primary healthcare centres, together with public health epidemiological support. Lack of availability of DAT was an issue in our case. Such lack could be circumvented by the implementation of an international fast-track procedure to obtain it in a timely manner. Maintaining primary vaccination coverage for children and increasing booster-dose immunisation against diphtheria in the adult population is of key importance.

TI  - Measuring Carbon Monoxide With TROPOMI: First Results and a Comparison With ECMWF-IFS Analysis Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was launched onboard of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-5P satellite. One of the mission's key products is the total column density of carbon monoxide, inferred from TROPOMI's 2.3m measurements. Using the operational processing algorithm, we analyze six subsequent days of measurements during the commissioning phase. The TROPOMI product is compared with CO fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) assimilation system. Globally, a small mean difference between the data sets of 3.2 5.5% with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 is found. The daily global coverage of TROPOMI enables it to capture day-to-day evolution of the atmospheric composition. As an example, we discuss the air pollution event of India in November 2017 with high carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, which partly dispersed when the CO polluted air was transported north alongside the Himalaya to China. The striking agreement and also regional differences with ECMWF indicate new exciting applications for the TROPOMI CO data product.

TI  - T regulatory cells mediate immunosuppresion by adenosine in peripheral blood, sentinel lymph node and TILs from melanoma patients
T2  - CANCER LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - T regulatory cells (Tregs), involved in tumour tolerance, can generate Adenosine by CD39/CD73 surface enzymes, which identify four Tregs subsets: CD39(+)CD73(-) nTregs, CD39(+)CD73(+) iTregs, CD39(-)CD73(+) oTregs and CD39(-)CD73(-) xTregs. In melanoma patients, increased Tregs levels are detected in peripheral blood (PB), sentinel lymph node (SLN) and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), but Adenosine role was not investigated yet. We examined total Tregs and Adenosine subsets in PB, SLN and TILs from melanoma patients (n=32) and PB from healthy donors (HD; n = 10) by flow cytometry. Total Tregs significantly increased in stage III-IV patients PB, in SLN and TILs, as compared to HD/stage I-II patients. Tregs subsets analyses showed that: 1) PB nTregs significantly increased in SLN and decreased in TILs; 2) iTregs significantly increased in stage III-IV patients PB and further significantly increased in SLN and TILs; 3) PB oTregs and xTregs significantly decreased in SLN and TILs. Patients clinical features did not significantly influence total Tregs, except SLN excision order. Results confirmed Tregs role in melanoma progression and indicate Adenosine generation as a novel escape mechanism, being nTregs and iTregs increased in PB/SLN/TILs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Personalized service recommendations for travel using trajectory pattern discovery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Service recommendations help travelers locate en route traffic information service of interest in a timely manner. However, recommendations based on simple traffic information, such as the number of requests for the location of a facility, fail to consider an individual's preferences. Most existing work on improving service recommendations has continued to utilize the same ratings and rankings of services without consideration of diverse users' demands. The challenge remains to push forward the modeling of spatiotemporal trajectories to improve service recommendations. In this research, we proposed a new method to address the above challenge. We developed a personalized service-trajectory correlation that could recommend the most appropriate services to users. In addition, we proposed the use of congeniality probability to measure the service demand similarity of two travelers based on their service-visiting behaviors and preferences. We employed a clustering-based scheme, taking into account the spatiotemporal dimensions to refine the trajectories at each spot where travelers stayed at a certain point in time. Experiments were conducted employing a real global positioning system-based dataset. The test results demonstrated that our proposed approach could reduce the deviation of the trajectory measurement to 10% and enhance the success rates of the service recommendations to 60%.

TI  - Remote-sensing data processing with the multivariate regression analysis method for iron mineral resource potential mapping: a case study in the Sarvian area, central Iran
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses multivariate regression to create a mathematical model for iron skarn exploration in the Sarvian area, central Iran, using multivariate regression for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). The main target of this paper is to apply multivariate regression analysis (as an MPM method) to map iron outcrops in the northeastern part of the study area in order to discover new iron deposits in other parts of the study area. Two types of multivariate regression models using two linear equations were employed to discover new mineral deposits. This method is one of the reliable methods for processing satellite images. ASTER satellite images (14 bands) were used as unique independent variables (UIVs), and iron outcrops were mapped as dependent variables for MPM. According to the results of the probability value (p value), coefficient of determination value (R-2) and adjusted determination coefficient (R-adj(2)), the second regression model (which consistent of multiple UIVs) fitted better than other models. The accuracy of the model was confirmed by iron outcrops map and geological observation. Based on field observation, iron mineralization occurs at the contact of limestone and intrusive rocks (skarn type).

TI  - Multidecadal Changes and Interannual Variation in Springtime Phenology of North American Temperate and Boreal Deciduous Forests
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of leaf emergence is an important diagnostic of climate change impacts on ecosystems. Here we present the first continental-scale analysis of multidecadal changes in the timing of spring onset across North American temperate and boreal forests based on Landsat imagery. Our results show that leaf emergence in Eastern Temperate Forests has consistently trended earlier, with a median change of about 1 week over the 30 year study period. Changes in leaf emergence dates in boreal forests were more heterogeneous, with some sites showing trends toward later dates. Interannual variability in leaf emergence dates was strongly sensitive to springtime accumulated growing degree days across all sites, and geographic patterns of changes in onset dates were highly correlated with changes in regional springtime temperatures. These results provide a refined characterization of recent changes in springtime forest phenology and improve understanding regarding the sensitivity of North American forests to climate change.Plain Language Summary The timing of leaf emergence is an important diagnostic of climate change impacts on ecosystems.

TI  - Clinical and epidemiological characterization of influenza virus infections in children with severe acute respiratory infection in Maputo, Mozambique: Results from the implementation of sentinel surveillance, 2014-2016
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0-14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0-38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1-5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.

TI  - Morphology of Immunomodulation in Breast Cancer Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes Depends on Stage and Intrinsic Subtype
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer research of immune-modulating mechanisms mainly addresses the role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Mechanisms modulating the adaptive immune system at the primary activation site - the draining lymph node (LN) - are less investigated. Here we present tumor-caused histomorphological changes in tumor draining LNs of breast cancer patients, dependent on the localization (sentinel LN vs. non-sentinel LN), the tumor size, the intrinsic subtype and nodal metastatic status. The quantitative morphological study was conducted in breast cancer patients with at least one sentinel LN and no neoadjuvant therapy. All LNs were annotated considering to their topographical location, stained for IgD/H&E, digitized and quantitatively analyzed. In 206 patients, 394 sentinels and 940 non-sentinel LNs were categorized, comprising 40758 follicles and 7074 germinal centers. Subtype specific immunomorphological patterns were detectable: Follicular density was higher in LNs of Her2 enriched hormone receptor positive and triple-negative breast cancers whereas hormone receptor positive breast cancers showed more macrophage infiltrations in the LN cortex. Follicles are rounder in metastatic LNs and non-sentinel LNs. The identified immunomorphological changes reflect different underlying immunomodulations taking place in the tumor-draining LNs and should therefore be considered as possible prognostic and predictive markers for LN metastasis and therapy associated immunomodulation.

TI  - Diketopyrrolopyrrole-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles for <i>in vivo</i> second near-infrared window imaging and image-guided tumor surgery
T2  - CHEMICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A diketopyrrolopyrrole-based semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (PDFT1032) has been developed as a NIR-II (near infrared window II, 1000-1700 nm) fluorescent probe. It shows high photostability, a favorable absorption peak at 809 nm, a large Stokes shift of 223 nm, outstanding biocompatibility and minimal in vivo toxicity. More importantly, the versatile use of PDFT1032 for several important biomedical applications in the NIR-II window has been demonstrated, including the NIR-II optical imaging of tumors on a subcutaneous osteosarcoma model, assessing the vascular embolization therapy of tumors, and NIR-II image-guided orthotopic tumor surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Overall, excellent biocompatibility, favorable hydrophilicity, and desirable chemical and optical properties make the semiconducting polymer nanoparticle PDFT1032 a highly promising NIR-II imaging probe with the potential to be widely applicable in clinical imaging and the surgical treatment of malignancy.

TI  - Satellite Geodesy Captures Offset Magma Supply Associated With Lava Lake Appearance at Masaya Volcano, Nicaragua
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data sets from various satellites (CSK, RSAT-2, ALOS-2, and Sentinel-1) show a maximum of similar to 8 cm ground inflation in Masaya caldera over a 15 month period (6 November 2015 to 1 September 2016). The center of inflation is located in the NW part of the caldera, north of the active Santiago vent which has hosted a new lava lake since 11 December 2015. Simultaneous inversions of those Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data sets using a neighbourhood algorithm demonstrate that a spherical magma reservoir explains the geodetic data, with a horizontal location similar to 3 km north of the active Santiago vent and a depth-to-center similar to 3 km. The associated modeled volume increase (similar to 0.0042 km(3)) is lower than the "excess" magma volume inferred from gas measurements from November 2015 to February 2016. The magma reservoir offset from the current center of eruptive activity may be the result of preexisting caldera structures.

TI  - A New Global Sea Surface Salinity and Density Dataset From Multivariate Observations (1993-2016)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring sea surface salinity (SSS) and density variations is crucial to investigate the global water cycle and the ocean dynamics, and to analyse how they are impacted by climate change. Historically, ocean salinity and density have suffered a poor observational coverage, which hindered an accurate assessment of their surface patterns, as well as of associated space and time variability and trends. Different approaches have thus been proposed to extend the information obtained from sparse in situ measurements and provide gap-free fields at regular spatial and temporal resolution, based on the combination of in situ and satellite data. In the framework of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, a daily (weekly sampled) global reprocessed dataset at 1/4 degrees x 1/4 degrees resolution has been produced by modifying a multivariate optimal interpolation (OI) technique originally developed within MyOcean project. The algorithm has been applied to in situ salinity/density measurements covering the period from 1993 to 2016, using satellite sea surface temperature differences to constrain the surface patterns. This improved algorithm and the new dataset are described and validated here with holdout approach and independent data.

TI  - A new photometric ozone reference in the Huggins bands: the absolute ozone absorption cross section at the 325 nm HeCd laser wavelength
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The room temperature (294.09 K) absorption cross section of ozone at the 325 nm HeCd wavelength has been determined under careful consideration of possible biases. At the vacuum wavelength of 325.126 nm, thus in a region used by a variety of ozone remote sensing techniques, an absorption cross-section value of sigma = 16.470 x 10(-21) cm(2) was measured. The measurement provides the currently most accurate direct photometric absorption value of ozone in the UV with an expanded (coverage factor k = 2) standard uncertainty u (sigma) = 31 x 10(-24) cm(2), corresponding to a relative level of 2 parts per thousand. The measurements are most compatible with a relative temperature coefficient c(T) = sigma(-1) partial derivative(T)sigma = 0.0031 K-1 at 294 K. The cross section and its uncertainty value were obtained using generalised linear regression with correlated uncertainties. It will serve as a reference for ozone absorption spectra required for the long-term remote sensing of atmospheric ozone in the Huggins bands. The comparison with commonly used absorption cross-section data sets for remote sensing reveals a possible bias of about 2 %. This could partly explain a 4 % discrepancy between UV and IR remote sensing data and indicates that further studies will be required to reach the accuracy goal of 1 % in atmospheric reference spectra.

TI  - Spatial Representativeness of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Obtained Using Observations From Network Stations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze has been a focused air pollution phenomenon in China, and its characterization is highly desired. Aerosol properties obtained from a single station are frequently used to represent the haze condition over a large domain, such as tens of kilometers, which could result in high uncertainties due to their spatial variation. Using a high-resolution network observation over an urban city in North China from November 2015 to February 2016, this study examines the spatial representativeness of ground station observations of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5m (PM2.5). We developed a new method to determine the representative area of PM2.5 measurements from limited stations. The key idea is to determine the PM2.5 spatial representative area using its spatial variability and temporal correlation. We also determine stations with large representative area using two grid networks with different resolutions. Based on the high spatial resolution measurements, the representative area of PM2.5 at one station can be determined from the grids with high correlations and small differences of PM2.5. The representative area for a single station in the study period ranges from 0.25 to 16.25km(2) but is less than 3km(2) for more than half of the stations. The representative area varies with locations, and observation at 10 optimal stations would have a good representativeness of those obtained from 169 stations for the 4month time scale studied. Both evaluations with an empirical orthogonal function analysis and with independent data set corroborate the validity of the results found in this study.

TI  - Nationwide insecticide resistance status and biting behaviour of malaria vector species in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Globally, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) accounted for 9% of malaria cases and 10% of malaria deaths in 2015. As part of control efforts, more than 40 million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) were distributed between 2008 and 2013, resulting in 70% of households owning one or more LLINs in 2014. To optimize vector control efforts, it is critical to monitor vector behaviour and insecticide resistance trends. Entomological data was collected from eight sentinel sites throughout DRC between 2013 and 2016 in Kingasani, Mikalayi, Lodja, Kabondo, Katana, Kapolowe, Tshikaji and Kalemie. Mosquito species present, relative densities and biting times were monitored using human landing catches (HLC) conducted in eight houses, three times per year. HLC was conducted monthly in Lodja and Kapolowe during 2016 to assess seasonal dynamics. Laboratory data included resistance mechanism frequency and sporozoite rates. Insecticide susceptibility testing was conducted with commonly used insecticides including deltamethrin and permethrin. Synergist bioassays were conducted with PBO to determine the role of oxidases in permethrin resistance.Results: In Lodja, monthly Anopheles gambiae s.l. biting rates were consistently high at >10 bites/person/night indoors and outdoors. In Kapolowe, An. gambiae s.l. dominated during the rainy season, and Anopheles funestus s.l. during the dry season. In all sites, An. gambiae and An. funestus biting occurred mostly late at night. In Kapolowe, significant biting of both species started around 19: 00, typically before householders use nets. Sporozoite rates were high, with a mean of 4.3% (95% CI 3.4-5.2) for An. gambiae and 3.3% (95% CI 1.3-5.3) for An. funestus. Anopheles gambiae were resistant to permethrin in six out of seven sites in 2016. In three sites, susceptibility to deltamethrin was observed despite high frequency permethrin resistance, indicating the presence of pyrethroid-specific resistance mechanisms. Pre-exposure to PBO increased absolute permethrin-associated mortality by 24%, indicating that resistance was partly due to metabolic mechanisms. The kdr-1014F mutation in An. gambiae was present at high frequency (>70%) in three sites (Kabondo, Kingasani and Tshikaji), and lower frequency (<20%) in two sites (Lodja and Kapolowe).Conclusion: The finding of widespread resistance to permethrin in DRC is concerning and alternative insecticides should be evaluated.

TI  - Interactive Effects of Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and N Fertilization on Yield and Quality of Tomato Grown Under Reduced Irrigation Regimes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactive effects of CO2 elevation, N fertilization, and reduced irrigation regimes on fruit yield (FY) and quality in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were investigated in a split-root pot experiment. The plants were grown in two separate climate-controlled greenhouse cells at atmospheric [CO2] of 400 and 800 ppm, respectively. In each cell, the plants were fertilized at either 100 or 200 mg N kg(-1) soil and were either irrigated to full water holding capacity [i.e., a volumetric soil water content of 18%; full irrigation (FI)], or using 70% water of FI to the whole pot [deficit irrigation (DI)] or alternately to only half of the pot [partial root-zone irrigation (PRI)]. The yield and fruit quality attributes mainly from sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose) and organic acids (OAs; citric acid and malic acid) to various ionic (NH4+, K+, Mg-2(+), Ca-2(+), NO3-, SO42-, and PO43-) concentrations in fruit juice were determined. The results indicated that lower N supply reduced fruit number and yield, whereas it enhanced some of the quality attributes of fruit as indicated by greater firmness and higher concentrations of sugars and OAs. Elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) attenuated the negative influence of reduced irrigation (DI and PRI) on FY. Principal component analysis revealed that the reduced irrigation regimes, especially PRI, in combination with e[CO2] could synergistically improve the comprehensive quality of tomato fruits at high N supply. These findings provide useful knowledge for sustaining tomato FY and quality in a future drier and CO2-enriched environment.

TI  - Intralake Heterogeneity of Thermal Responses to Climate Change: A Study of Large Northern Hemisphere Lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) measurements from various sources illustrate that lakes are warming in response to climate change. Most previous studies of geographical distributions of lake warming have tended to utilize data with limited spatial resolution of LSWTs, including single-point time series. Spatially resolved LSWT time series are now available from satellite observations, and some studies have investigated previously the intralake warming patterns in specific lakes (e.g., North American Great Lakes). However, across-lake comparisons of intralake warming differences have not yet been investigated at a large, across-continental scale, thus limiting our understanding of how intralake warming patterns differ more broadly. In this study, we analyze up to 20years of satellite data from 19 lakes situated across the Northern Hemisphere, to investigate how LSWT changes vary across different lake surfaces. We find considerable intralake variability in warming trends across many lakes. The deepest areas of large lakes are characterized by a later onset of thermal stratification, a shorter stratified warming season and exhibit longer correlation timescales of LSWT anomalies. We show that deep areas of large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere as a result tend to display higher rates of warming of summer LSWT, arising from a greater temporal persistence in deep areas of the temperature anomalies associated with an earlier onset of thermal stratification. Utilization of single-point LSWT trends to represent changes in large lakes therefore suppresses important aspects of lake responses to climate change, whereas spatially resolved LSWT measurements can be exploited to provide more comprehensive understanding.

TI  - Reassembly of <SUP>89</SUP>Zr-Labeled Cancer Cell Membranes into Multicompartment Membrane-Derived Liposomes for PET-Trackable Tumor-Targeted Theranostics
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanoengineering of cell membranes holds great potential to revolutionize tumor-targeted theranostics, owing to their innate biocompatibility and ability to escape from the immune and reticuloendothelial systems. However, tailoring and integrating cell membranes with drug and imaging agents into one versatile nanoparticle are still challenging. Here, multicompartment membrane-derived liposomes (MCLs) are developed by reassembling cancer cell membranes with Tween-80, and are used to conjugate Zr-89 via deferoxamine chelator and load tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin for in vivo noninvasive quantitative tracing by positron emission tomography imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), respectively. Radiolabeled constructs, Zr-89-Df-MCLs, demonstrate excellent radiochemical stability in vivo, target 4T1 tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention effect, and are retained long-term for efficient and effective PDT while clearing gradually from the reticuloendothelial system via hepatobiliary excretion. Toxicity evaluation confirms that the MCLs do not impose acute or chronic toxicity in intravenously injected mice. Additionally, Zr-89-labeled MCLs can execute rapid and highly sensitive lymph node mapping, even for deep-seated sentinel lymph nodes. The as-developed cell membrane reassembling route to MCLs could be extended to other cell types, providing a versatile platform for disease theranostics by facilely and efficiently integrating various multifunctional agents.

AB  - Aerosol optical properties measured at Appalachian State University's co-located NASA AERONET and NOAA ESRL aerosol network monitoring sites over a nearly four-year period (June 2012-Feb 2016) are used, along with satellite-based surface reflectance measurements, to study the seasonal variability of diurnally averaged clear sky aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) and radiative efficiency (RE) at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface. Aerosol chemistry and loading at the Appalachian State site are likely representative of the background southeast US (SE US), home to high summertime aerosol loading and one of only a few regions not to have warmed during the 20th century. This study is the first multi-year "ground truth" DRE study in the SE US, using aerosol network data products that are often used to validate satellite-based aerosol retrievals. The study is also the first in the SE US to quantify DRE uncertainties and sensitivities to aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance, including their seasonal dependence. Median DRE for the study period is -2.9Wm(-2) at the TOA and -6.1Wm(-2) at the surface. Monthly median and monthly mean DRE at the TOA (surface) are 1 to -2Wm(-2) (2 to -3Wm(-2)) during winter months and 5 to -6Wm(-2) (-10Wm(-2)) during summer months. The DRE cycles follow the annual cycle of aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is 9 to 10 times larger in summer than in winter. Aerosol RE is anti-correlated with DRE, with winter values 1.5 to 2 times more negative than summer values. Due to the large seasonal dependence of aerosol DRE and RE, we quantify the sensitivity of DRE to aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance, using a calendar day representative of each season (21 December for winter; 21 March for spring, 21 June for summer, and 21 September for fall). We use these sensitivities along with measurement uncertainties of aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance to calculate DRE uncertainties. We also estimate uncertainty in calculated diurnally-averaged DRE due to diurnal aerosol variability. Aerosol DRE at both the TOA and surface is most sensitive to changes in AOD, followed by single-scattering albedo (omega(0)). One exception is under the high summertime aerosol loading conditions (AOD >= 0.15 at 550 nm), when sensitivity of TOA DRE to omega(0) is comparable to that of AOD. Aerosol DRE is less sensitive to changes in scattering asymmetry parameter (g) and surface reflectance (R). While DRE sensitivity to AOD varies by only similar to 25 to 30% with season, DRE sensitivity to omega(0), g, and R largely follow the annual AOD cycle at APP, varying by factors of 8 to 15 with season. Since the measurement uncertainties of AOD, omega(0), g, and R are comparable at Appalachian State, their relative contributions to DRE uncertainty are largely influenced by their (seasonally dependent) DRE sensitivity values, which suggests that the seasonal dependence of DRE uncertainty must be accounted for. Clear sky aerosol DRE uncertainty at the TOA (surface) due to measurement uncertainties ranges from 0.45 (0.75Wm(-2)) for December to 1.1 (1.6Wm(-2)) for June. Expressed as a fraction of DRE computed using monthly median aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance, the DRE uncertainties at TOA (surface) are 20 to 24% (15 to 22 %) for March, June, and September and 49 (50 %) for DEC.The relatively low DRE uncertainties are largely due to the low uncertainty in AOD measured by AERONET. Use of satellite- based AOD measurements by MODIS in the DRE calculations increases DRE uncertainties by a factor of 2 to 5 and DRE uncertainties are dominated by AOD uncertainty for all seasons. Diurnal variability in AOD (and to a lesser extent g) contributes to uncertainties in DRE calculated using daily-averaged aerosol optical properties that are slightly larger (by similar to 20 to 30 %) than DRE uncertainties due to measurement uncertainties during summer and fall, with comparable uncertainties during winter and spring.

TI  - Aseismic fold growth in southwestern Taiwan detected by InSAR and GNSS
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report very rapid and aseismic fold growth detected by L-band InSAR images and GNSS data in southwestern Taiwan where is characterized by high convergence rate and low seismicity. Six independent interferograms acquired from ascending orbit during 2007-2011 commonly indicate large line-of-sight (LOS) shortening. For descending orbit, one interferogram spanning 21 months also indicates the LOS shortening at the same location. After removing long-wavelength noise and height-dependent phase component from these interferograms using GNSS velocity field and DEM, we obtained the quasi-vertical and the quasi-east velocity fields. We found very rapid uplift (quasi-vertical movement) in the fold and thrust belt to the east of the Tainan city. The uplifted area stretches about 25 km in the N-S direction and about 5 km in the E-W direction. At the southern part of the uplifted area, the uplift rate obtained by InSAR is consistent with that measured by the leveling survey, which takes 18 mm/year at a maximum. On the other hand, at the northern part, the maximum uplift rate detected by InSAR reaches up to 37 mm/year, more than twice as large as the rate along the levelling route. Judging from very low seismicity in this region, the severe crustal deformation we detected with InSAR is aseismic. At the eastern flank of the uplifted area, we found a sharp discontinuity in the uplift rate from the ALOS/PALSAR interferometry, and a sharp discontinuity in the amount of uplift in response to the 2016 Meinong earthquake (M6.4) from ALOS-2/PALSAR2 interferometry, which implies the existence of a shallow active fault. The stable slip of this active fault would be due to the high pore fluid pressure reported in this region. The aseismic uplift before the Meinong earthquake would be mainly due to the mud diapirs at the depth, which is perturbed by the aseismic movement of the shallow active fault.

TI  - Routing optimization method for fast return of data on overseas satellites in Beidou Global Navigation Satellite System
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem of the lack of station in Beidou Global Navigation Satellite System, a route optimization method was proposed to quickly transmit the overseas satellite data to the domestic satellite by using the inter-satellite link. Firstly, the problem of fast data transmission in the case of limited number of ground stations was described, and the optimization objective, rules and constraints of data transmission routing were defined. Then, based on the genetic algorithm, the routing optimization method and the minimum data transmission scheme were proposed. Finally, the validity of the algorithm was verified. The results show data transmission is completed within 2 skips (6 seconds) in the Beidou system constellation with two domestic station conditions. This optimized result can meet the requirements of overseas data fast transmit.

TI  - Detection of coastal landforms in a deltaic area using a multi-scale object-based classification method
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landforms play an important role in protecting deltaic areas from erosion due to the action of waves. However, landforms in the deltas are dynamic and vulnerable to changes due to the effect of natural disasters like floods and cyclones. Automatic detection of dynamic landforms from satellite data can provide important inputs for effective coastal zone management. In this study, we developed an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) technique to identify and map landforms in the Krishna delta, east coast of India using Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV multispectral image (5.8 m) and digital elevation model (DEM) (4 m). Since landforms are represented at multiple scales, the plateau objective function method was used to select appropriate scales during multiresolution segmentation. Knowledge-based rules in OBIA, using the parameters tone, texture, shape and context derived from satellite images and height from DEM were developed for classification of landforms. A total of 11 landforms (beach, beach ridge, swale, tidal creek, marsh, spit, barrier bar, mangrove, natural levee, channel island and channel bar) were mapped using this approach. High detection accuracy of these landforms indicates that the method developed has the potential for geomorphological mapping of dynamic landforms in low lying deltaic areas.

TI  - Estimating net primary productivity of croplands in Indo-Gangetic Plains using GOME-2 sun-induced fluorescence and MODIS NDVI
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently evolved satellite-based sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) spectroscopy is considered as a direct measure of photosynthetic activity of vegetation. We have used monthly averages of satellite-based SIF retrievals for three agricultural year cycles, i.e. May to April for each of the three years, viz. 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 to assess comparative performance of SIF and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for predicting net primary productivity (NPP) over the Indo-Gangetic Plains, India. Results show that SIF values for C4 crop-dominated districts were higher than C3 crop-dominated districts during summer and low during winter for all three years. SIF explained more or less above 70% of variance in NPP. The variance explained by integrated NDVI ranged from 60% to 67%. Thus the present study has shown the potential of SIF data for improved modelling of agricultural productivity at a regional scale.

TI  - Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During metastasis, malignant cells escape the primary tumor, intravasate lymphatic vessels, and reach draining sentinel lymph nodes before they colonize distant organs via the blood circulation. Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the bloodstream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded blood vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct. These results suggest that the lymph node blood vessels can serve as an exit route for systemic dissemination of cancer cells in experimental mouse models. Whether this form of tumor cell spreading occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.

TI  - Use of a public-private partnership in malaria elimination efforts in Sri Lanka; a case study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In special circumstances, establishing public private partnerships for malaria elimination may achieve targets faster than the state sector acting by itself. Following the end of the separatist war in Sri Lanka in 2009, the Anti Malaria Campaign (AMC) of Sri Lanka intensified malaria surveillance jointly with a private sector partner, Tropical and Environmental Diseases and Health Associates Private Limited (TEDHA) with a view to achieving malaria elimination targets by 2014.Methods: This is a case study on how public private partnerships can be effectively utilized to achieve malaria elimination goals. TEDHA established 50 Malaria Diagnostic Laboratories and 17 entomology surveillance sentinel sites in consultation with the AMC in areas difficult to access by government officials (five districts in two provinces affected by war).Results: TEDHA screened 994,448 individuals for malaria, of which 243,867 were screened at mobile malaria clinics as compared to 1,102,054 screened by the AMC. Nine malaria positives were diagnosed by TEDHA, while the AMC diagnosed 103 malaria cases in the same districts in parallel. Over 13,000 entomological activity days were completed. Relevant information was shared with AMC and the data recorded in the health information system.Conclusions: A successful public-private partnership model for malaria elimination was initiated at a time when the health system was in disarray in war ravaged areas of Sri Lanka. This ensured a high annual blood examination rate and screening of vulnerable people in receptive areas. These were important for certification of malaria-free status which Sri Lanka eventually received in 2016.

TI  - Quantitative trait loci associated with soft wheat quality in a cross of good by moderate quality parents
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the genetic control of the quality traits of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum) is essential for breeding. Our objective was to identify QTL associated with end-use quality. We developed 150 F4-derived lines from a cross of Pioneer 26R46 x SS550 and tested them in four environments. We measured flour yield (FY), softness equivalent (SE), test weight (TW), flour protein content (FP), alkaline water retention capacity (AWRC), and solvent retention capacity (SRC) of water (WA), lactic acid (LA), sucrose (SU), sodium carbonate (SO). Parents differed for nine traits, transgressive segregants were noted, and heritability was high (0.67 to 0.90) for all traits. We detected QTL distributed on eight genomic regions. The QTL with the greatest effects were located on chromosome 1A, 1B, and 6B with each affecting at least five of ten quality traits. Pioneer 26R46 is one of the best quality soft wheats. The large-effect QTL on 1A novel and accounted for much of the variation for AWRC (r(2) = 0.26), SO (0.26) and SE (0.25), and FY (0.15) and may explain why Pioneer 26R46 has such superior quality. All alleles that increased a trait came from the parent with the highest trait value. This suggests that in any population that marker-assisted selection for these quality traits could be conducted by simply selecting for the alleles at key loci from the parent with the best phenotype without prior mapping.

TI  - Lymph node metastases can invade local blood vessels, exit the node, and colonize distant organs in mice
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastases in cancer patients are associated with tumor aggressiveness, poorer prognoses, and the recommendation for systemic therapy. Whether cancer cells in lymph nodes can seed distant metastases has been a subject of considerable debate. We studied mice implanted with cancer cells (mammary carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or melanoma) expressing the photoconvertible protein Dendra2. This technology allowed us to selectively photoconvert metastatic cells in the lymph node and trace their fate. We found that a fraction of these cells invaded lymph node blood vessels, entered the blood circulation, and colonized the lung. Thus, in mouse models, lymph node metastases can be a source of cancer cells for distant metastases. Whether this mode of dissemination occurs in cancer patients remains to be determined.

TI  - Changes in Andes snow cover from MODIS data, 2000-2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andes span a length of 7000 km and are important for sustaining regional water supplies. Snow variability across this region has not been studied in detail due to sparse and unevenly distributed instrumental climate data. We calculated snow persistence (SP) as the fraction of time with snow cover for each year between 2000 and 2016 from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors (500 m, 8-day maximum snow cover extent). This analysis is conducted between 8 and 36 degrees S due to high frequency of cloud (> 30 % of the time) south and north of this range. We ran Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sens analyses to identify areas with significant changes in SP and snowline (the line at lower elevation where SP = 20 %). We evaluated how these trends relate to temperature and precipitation from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA2) and University of Delaware datasets and climate indices as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Areas north of 29 degrees S have limited snow cover, and few trends in snow persistence were detected. A large area (34 370 km(2)) with persistent snow cover between 29 and 36 degrees S experienced a significant loss of snow cover (2-5 fewer days of snow year(-1)). Snow loss was more pronounced (62 % of the area with significant trends) on the east side of the Andes. We also found a significant increase in the elevation of the snowline at 10-30 m year(-1) south of 29-30 degrees S. Decreasing SP correlates with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature, and the magnitudes of these correlations vary with latitude and elevation. ENSO climate indices better predicted SP conditions north of 31 degrees S, whereas the SAM better predicted SP south of 31 degrees S.

TI  - On the retrieval of sea ice thickness and snow depth using concurrent laser altimetry and L-band remote sensing data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate knowledge of sea ice parameters, including sea ice thickness and snow depth over the sea ice cover, is key to both climate studies and data assimilation in operational forecasts. Large-scale active and passive remote sensing is the basis for the estimation of these parameters. In traditional altimetry or the retrieval of snow depth with passive microwave remote sensing, although the sea ice thickness and the snow depth are closely related, the retrieval of one parameter is usually carried out under assumptions over the other. For example, climatological snow depth data or as derived from reanalyses contain large or unconstrained uncertainty, which result in large uncertainty in the derived sea ice thickness and volume. In this study, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth using the concurrent active altimetry and passive microwave remote sensing of the sea ice cover. Specifically, laser altimetry and L-band passive remote sensing data are combined using two forward models: the L-band radiation model and the isostatic relationship based on buoyancy model. Since the laser altimetry usually features much higher spatial resolution than L-band data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, there is potentially covariability between the observed snow freeboard by altimetry and the retrieval target of snow depth on the spatial scale of altimetry samples. Statistically significant correlation is discovered based on high-resolution observations from Operation IceBridge (OIB), and with a nonlinear fitting the co-variability is incorporated in the retrieval algorithm. By using fitting parameters derived from large-scale surveys, the retrievability is greatly improved compared with the retrieval that assumes flat snow cover (i. e., no covariability). Verifications with OIB data show good match between the observed and the retrieved parameters, including both sea ice thickness and snow depth. With detailed analysis, we show that the error of the retrieval mainly arises from the difference between the modeled and the observed (SMOS) L-band brightness temperature (TB). The narrow swath and the limited coverage of the sea ice cover by altimetry is the potential source of error associated with the modeling of L-band TB and retrieval. The proposed retrieval methodology can be applied to the basin-scale retrieval of sea ice thickness and snow depth, using concurrent passive remote sensing and active laser altimetry based on satellites such as ICESat-2 and WCOM.

TI  - The role of aromatic side chains on the supramolecular hydrogelation of naphthalimide/dipeptide conjugates
T2  - NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, the influence of an amino acid side chain on the structural and functional properties of hydrogels has been described. In this study, four new hydrogelators based on the conjugates of dipeptides and naphthalimide (NI) have been designed, synthesized, and examined. Homopeptide 1 (NI-FF) of the phenylalanine residue forms a weak hydrogel or a viscous solution of worm-like micelles under basic conditions. On the other hand, dipeptide conjugates of 2 (NI-FY), 3 (NI-YF), and 4 (NI-YY), containing additional hydroxyl groups as tyrosine residues, can self-assemble into supramolecular hydrogels under physiological pH conditions. UV-vis, IR, and rheological studies clearly indicate the formation and stability of these dipeptide hydrogels. The TEM results revealed that the hydrogels (1-4) self-assembled into a nanofibrous morphology. Furthermore, the cell culture results show that NI-YF has better cell compatibility as compared to NI-FY and NI-YY and thus shows potential to be used as a hydrogel biomaterial. Overall, this study highlights the importance of the structure-hydrogelation relationship and provides new insights into the design of self-assembled peptide amphiphiles.

TI  - The contribution of Earth observation technologies to the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000 network in a protected wetland
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Wetlands are highly productive systems that supply a host of ecosystem services and benefits. Nonetheless, wetlands have been drained and filled to provide sites for building houses and roads and for establishing farmland, with an estimated worldwide loss of 64-71% of wetland systems since 1900. In Europe, the Natura 2000 network is the cornerstone of current conservation strategies. Every six years, Member States must report on implementation of the European Habitats Directive. The present study aims to illustrate how Earth observation (EO) technologies can contribute to the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000 network in relation to wetland ecosystems.Methods: We analysed the habitat changes that occurred in a protected wetland (in NW Spain), 13 years after its designation as Natura 2000 site (i.e., between 2003 and 2016). For this purpose, we analysed optical multispectral bands and water-related and vegetation indices derived from data acquired by Landsat 7 TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. To quantify the uncertainty arising from the algorithm used in the classification procedure and its impact on the change analysis, we compared the habitat change estimates obtained using 10 different classification algorithms and two ensemble classification approaches (majority and weighted vote).Results: The habitat maps derived from the ensemble approaches showed an overall accuracy of 94% for the 2003 data (Kappa index of 0.93) and of 95% for the 2016 data (Kappa index of 0.94). The change analysis revealed important temporal dynamics between 2003 and 2016 for the habitat classes identified in the study area. However, these changes depended on the classification algorithm used. The habitat maps obtained from the two ensemble classification approaches showed a reduction in habitat classes dominated by salt marshes and meadows (24.6-26.5%), natural and semi-natural grasslands (25.9-26.5%) or sand dunes (20.7-20.9%) and an increase in forest (31-34%) and reed bed (60.7-67.2%) in the study area.Discussion: This study illustrates how EO-based approaches might be particularly useful to help (1) managers to reach decisions in relation to conservation, (2) Member States to comply with the requirements of the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), and (3) the European Commission to monitor the conservation status of the natural habitat types of community interest listed in Annex I of the Directive. Nonetheless, the uncertainty arising from the large variety of classification methods used may prevent local managers from basing their decisions on EO data. Our results shed light on how different classification algorithms may provide very different quantitative estimates, especially for water-dependent habitats. Our findings confirm the need to account for this uncertainty by applying ensemble classification approaches, which improve the accuracy and stability of remote sensing image classification.

TI  - Ticks are more suitable than red foxes for monitoring zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in northeastern Italy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Northeastern Italy is a hotspot for several tick-borne pathogens, transmitted to animals and humans mainly by Ixodes ricinus. Here we compare the results of molecular monitoring of ticks and zoonotic TBPs over a six-year period, with the monitoring of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in an endemic area.Results: In the period 2011-2016, 2,578 ticks were collected in 38 sites of 20 municipalities of Belluno Province. Individual adults (264), pooled larvae (n = 330) and nymphs (n = 1984) were screened for tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.), Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and "Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis" by specific SYBR green real-time PCR assays and sequencing. The spleens of 97 foxes, culled in the period 2015-2017 during sport hunting or population control programs, were also screened. Overall, nine different pathogens were found in I. ricinus nymph and adult ticks: Rickettsia helvetica (3.69%); R. monacensis (0.49%); four species of the B. burgdorferi (s. l.) complex [B. afzelii (1.51%); B. burgdorferi (s. s.) (1.25%); B. garinii (0.18%); and B. valaisiana (0.18%)]; A. phagocytophilum (3.29%); "Candidatus N. mikurensis" (1.73%); and Babesia venatorum (0.04%). Larvae were collected and screened in the first year only and two pools (0.6%) were positive for R. helvetica. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not found in ticks although human cases do occur in the area. The rate of infection in ticks varied widely according to tick developmental stage, site and year of collection. As expected, adults were the most infected, with 27.6% harboring at least one pathogen compared to 7.3% of nymphs. Pathogens with a minimum infection rate above 1% were recorded every year. None of the pathogens found in ticks were detectable in the foxes, 52 (54%) of which were instead positive for Babesia cf. microti (also referred to as Babesia microti-like, "Theileria annae", "Babesia annae" and "Babesia vulpes").Conclusions: The results show that foxes cannot be used as sentinel animals to monitor tick-borne pathogens in the specific epidemiological context of northeastern Italy. The high prevalence of Babesia cf. microti in foxes and its absence in ticks strongly suggests that I. ricinus is not the vector of this pathogen.

TI  - Karymsky volcano eruptive plume properties based on MISR multi-angle imagery and the volcanological implications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based operational instruments are in unique positions to monitor volcanic activity globally, especially in remote locations or where suborbital observing conditions are hazardous. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) provides hyper-stereo imagery, from which the altitude and microphysical properties of suspended atmospheric aerosols can be derived. These capabilities are applied to plumes emitted at Karymsky volcano from 2000 to 2017. Observed plumes from Karymsky were emitted predominantly to an altitude of 2-4 km, with occasional events exceeding 6 km. MISR plume observations were most common when volcanic surface manifestations, such as lava flows, were identified by satellite-based thermal anomaly detection. The analyzed plumes predominantly contained large (1.28 mu m effective radius), strongly absorbing particles indicative of ash-rich eruptions. Differences between the retrievals for Karymsky volcano's ash-rich plumes and the sulfur-rich plumes emitted during the 2014-2015 eruption of Holuhraun (Iceland) highlight the ability of MISR to distinguish particle types from such events. Observed plumes ranged from 30 to 220 km in length and were imaged at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km. Retrieved particle properties display evidence of downwind particle fallout, particle aggregation and chemical evolution. In addition, changes in plume properties retrieved from the remote-sensing observations over time are interpreted in terms of shifts in eruption dynamics within the volcano itself, corroborated to the extent possible with suborbital data. Plumes emitted at Karymsky prior to 2010 display mixed emissions of ash and sulfate particles. After 2010, all plumes contain consistent particle components, indicative of entering an ash-dominated regime. Post-2010 event timing, relative to eruption phase, was found to influence the optical properties of observed plume particles, with light absorption varying in a consistent sequence as each respective eruption phase progressed.

TI  - Biomass smoke from southern Africa can significantly enhance the brightness of stratocumulus over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine stratocumulus clouds cover nearly one-quarter of the ocean surface and thus play an extremely important role in determining the global radiative balance. The semipermanent marine stratocumulus deck over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean is of particular interest, because of its interactions with seasonal biomass burning aerosols that are emitted in southern Africa. Understanding the impacts of biomass burning aerosols on stratocumulus clouds and the implications for regional and global radiative balance is still very limited. Previous studies have focused on assessing the magnitude of the warming caused by solar scattering and absorption by biomass burning aerosols over stratocumulus (the direct radiative effect) or cloud adjustments to the direct radiative effect (the semidirect effect). Here, using a nested modeling approach in conjunction with observations from multiple satellites, we demonstrate that cloud condensation nuclei activated from biomass burning aerosols entrained into the stratocumulus (the microphysical effect) can play a dominant role in determining the total radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere, compared with their direct and semidirect radiative effects. Biomass burning aerosols over the region and period with heavy loadings can cause a substantial cooling (daily mean -8.05 W m(-2)), primarily as a result of clouds brightening by reducing the cloud droplet size (the Twomey effect) and secondarily through modulating the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water path and coverage (the cloud lifetime effect). Our results highlight the importance of realistically representing the interactions of stratocumulus with biomass burning aerosols in global climate models in this region.

TI  - Detecting the dynamics of vegetation disturbance and recovery in surface mining area via Landsat imagery and LandTrendr algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation cover dynamics such as the spatial extent and pattern of disturbance and recovery are necessary information in mining regulation and environmental sustainability assessment. The acquisition and further analysis of these dynamics are hampered due to that the vegetation cover in mining area changes both spatially and temporally. This paper aims to assess the capability of LandTrendr algorithm and Landsat imagery in surface mining area to detect the vegetation change and characterize the historical dynamics. Curragh coal mine site in Australia was taken as an illustrative application. The spatial extent, change pattern and attributes of vegetation disturbance and recovery during 1989-2014 were detected and mapped. The overall accuracy for disturbance and recovery classification are 85.21% and 86.59% respectively. The results show that more than 2982 ha out of 4573 ha of disturbed land in entire Curragh had been covered by vegetation, while 95% of the oldest part of the operation (Central Curragh) has been seeded and rehabilitated. The average value of cumulative Disturbance to Recovery ratio for entire Curragh mine site was about 59%. This suggests that the Curragh mine has been complying with mining legislation by undertaking progressive rehabilitation and vegetation establishment efforts. The advantage of LandTrendr is that it relies on free data from Landsat archive and has straightforward operating procedures. It can provide environmental assessment and rehabilitation with serviceable data including raster maps, yearly data, cumulative Disturbance to Recovery ratio and change attributes. The LandTrendr algorithm and Landsat imagery could be supplemented with field validation and study such as recovery success analysis to facilitate better environmental assessment and mining sustainability.

TI  - Measuring resilience and assessing vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in South America
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).

TI  - Skeletal muscle magnetic resonance biomarkers correlate with function and sentinel events in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.MethodsMR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T-2) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites. Fat fraction was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis using MR spectroscopy, while T-2 was assessed using MRI in eight lower extremity muscles. Ambulatory function was measured using the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests.ResultsSignificant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (vertical bar rho vertical bar = 0.68-0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (vertical bar rho vertical bar = 0.63-0.73) and peroneals (vertical bar rho vertical bar = 0.59-0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function. A VL FF of 0.40 was an approximate lower threshold of muscle pathology associated with loss of ambulation.DiscussionLower extremity qMR biomarkers have a robust relationship to clinically meaningful measures of ambulatory function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These results provide strong supporting evidence for qMR biomarkers and set the stage for their potential use as surrogate outcomes in clinical trials.

TI  - Strong cooling induced by stand-replacing fires through albedo in Siberian larch forests
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Siberian larch forests, taking up about a fifth of the global boreal biome, are different from the North American boreal forests in that they generally do not undergo a secondary succession. While wildfires in the boreal forests in North America have been shown to exert a cooling effect on the climate system through a sharp increase in surface albedo associated with canopy removal and species composition change during succession, the magnitude of the surface forcing resulting from fire-induced albedo change and its longevity in Siberia have not been previously quantified. Here we show that in contrast to previous expectations, stand-replacing fires exert a strong cooling effect similar in magnitude to that in North America. This cooling effect is attributable to the increase in surface albedo during snow-on periods. However, the observed earlier snowmelt in the region, and subsequently a longer snow-free season, has resulted in a warming effect which has the potential to offset the fire-induced cooling. The net albedo-induced forcing of the Siberian larch forests in the future would hinge on the interaction between the fire-induced cooling effect and the climate-induced warming effect, both of which will be impacted by the expected further warming in the region.

TI  - Bayesian aerosol retrieval algorithm for MODIS AOD retrieval over land
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a Bayesian aerosol retrieval (BAR) algorithm for the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In the BAR algorithm, we simultaneously retrieve all dark land pixels in a granule, utilize spatial correlation models for the unknown aerosol parameters, use a statistical prior model for the surface reflectance, and take into account the uncertainties due to fixed aerosol models. The retrieved parameters are total AOD at 0.55 mu m, fine-mode fraction (FMF), and surface reflectances at four different wavelengths (0.47, 0.55, 0.64, and 2.1 mu m). The accuracy of the new algorithm is evaluated by comparing the AOD retrievals to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD. The results show that the BAR significantly improves the accuracy of AOD retrievals over the operational Dark Target (DT) algorithm. A reduction of about 29% in the AOD root mean square error and decrease of about 80% in the median bias of AOD were found globally when the BAR was used instead of the DT algorithm. Furthermore, the fraction of AOD retrievals inside the +/-(0.05 + 15% ) expected error envelope increased from 55 to 76%. In addition to retrieving the values of AOD, FMF, and surface reflectance, the BAR also gives pixel-level posterior uncertainty estimates for the retrieved parameters. The BAR algorithm always results in physical, non-negative AOD values, and the average computation time for a single granule was less than a minute on a modern personal computer.

TI  - Assessment of plant species diversity based on hyperspectral indices at a fine scale
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and nondestructive approaches of measuring plant species diversity have been a subject of excessive scientific curiosity and disquiet to environmentalists and field ecologists worldwide. In this study, we measured the hyperspectral reflectances and plant species diversity indices at a fine scale (0.8 meter) in central Hunshandak Sandland of Inner Mongolia, China. The first-order derivative value (FD) at each waveband and 37 hyperspectral indices were used to assess plant species diversity. Results demonstrated that the stepwise linear regression of FD can accurately estimate the Simpson (R-2 = 0.83), Pielou (R-2 = 0.87) and Shannon-Wiener index (R-2 = 0.88). Stepwise linear regression of FD (R-2 = 0.81, R-2 = 0.82) and spectral vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.51, R-2 = 0.58) significantly predicted the Margalef and Gleason index. It was proposed that the Simpson, Pielou and Shannon-Wiener indices, which are widely used as plant species diversity indicators, can be precisely estimated through hyperspectral indices at a fine scale. This research promotes the development of methods for assessment of plant diversity using hyperspectral data.

TI  - Performance metrics for the assessment of satellite data products: an ocean color case study
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Performance assessment of ocean color satellite data has generally relied on statistical metrics chosen for their common usage and the rationale for selecting certain metrics is infrequently explained. Commonly reported statistics based on mean squared errors, such as the coefficient of determination (r(2)), root mean square error, and regression slopes, are most appropriate for Gaussian distributions without outliers and, therefore, are often not ideal for ocean color algorithm performance assessment, which is often limited by sample availability. In contrast, metrics based on simple deviations, such as bias and mean absolute error, as well as pair-wise comparisons, often provide more robust and straightforward quantities for evaluating ocean color algorithms with non-Gaussian distributions and outliers. This study uses a SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a validation data set to demonstrate a framework for satellite data product assessment and recommends a multimetric and user-dependent approach that can be applied within science, modeling, and resource management communities.

TI  - Sensor performance requirements for atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color remote sensing
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the effects of the sensor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color remote sensing using the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. Using the Gaussian noise model for the sensor noise distribution in the NIR and SWIR bands, some extensive simulations have been carried out to evaluate and assess the effects of sensor NIR and SWIR SNR values on the retrieved normalized water-leaving reflectance spectra rho(wN)(lambda), which are used to derive all ocean or inland water biological and biogeochemical property data. The standard atmospheric correction algorithm for global oceans and inland waters using the two NIR bands, i.e., Gordon and Wang (1994) [Appl. Opt. 33, 443 (1994)], or two SWIR bands, i.e., Wang (2007) [Appl. Opt. 46, 1535 (2007)], is assumed in the evaluation. Specifically, the minimum and goal SNR requirements for the NIR and SWIR bands for atmospheric correction are estimated. The minimum SNR values are those with which sufficiently accurate rho(wN)(lambda) can be derived, while the goal SNR requirements are those with which the atmospheric correction algorithms reach to their corresponding inherent limitations (or inherent errors), i.e., no gains can be achieved with further increase of SNR values in the NIR and SWIR bands. Evaluation results show that the minimum SNR requirement for the two NIR bands is similar to 200-300, while the minimum SNR requirement for the three SWIR bands is similar to 100. For the goal SNR requirements, the recommendations are SNR's of similar to 600 and similar to 200 for the two NIR bands and three SWIR bands, respectively.

TI  - PCR-Based Analysis of ColE1 Plasmids in Clinical Isolates and Metagenomic Samples Reveals Their Importance as Gene Capture Platforms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ColE1 plasmids are important vehicles for the spread of antibiotic resistance in the Enterobacteriaceae and Pasteurellaceae families of bacteria. Their monitoring is essential, as they harbor important resistant determinants in humans, animals and the environment. In this work, we have analyzed ColE1 replicons using bioinformatic and experimental approaches. First, we carried out a computational study examining the structure of different ColE1 plasmids deposited in databases. Bioinformatic analysis of these ColE1 replicons revealed a mosaic genetic structure consisting of a host-adapted conserved region responsible for the housekeeping functions of the plasmid, and a variable region encoding a wide variety of genes, including multiple antibiotic resistance determinants. From this exhaustive computational analysis we developed a new PCR-based technique, targeting a specific sequence in the conserved region, for the screening, capture and sequencing of these small plasmids, either specific for Enterobacteriaceae or specific for Pasteurellaceae. To validate this PCR-based system, we tested various collections of isolates from both bacterial families, finding that ColE1 replicons were not only highly prevalent in antibiotic-resistant isolates, but also present in susceptible bacteria. In Pasteurellaceae, ColE1 plasmids carried almost exclusively antibiotic resistance genes. In Enterobacteriaceae, these plasmids encoded a large range of traits, including not only antibiotic resistance determinants, but also a wide variety of genes, showing the huge genetic plasticity of these small replicons. Finally, we also used a metagenomic approach in order to validate this technique, performing this PCR system using total DNA extractions from fecal samples from poultry, turkeys, pigs and humans. Using Illumina sequencing of the PCR products we identified a great diversity of genes encoded by ColE1 replicons, including different antibiotic resistance determinants, supporting the previous results achieved with the collections of bacterial isolates. In addition, we detected cryptic ColE1 plasmids in both families with no known genes in their variable region, which we have named sentinel plasmids. In conclusion, in this work we present a useful genetic tool for the detection and analysis of ColE1 plasmids, and confirm their important role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, especially in the Pasteurellaceae family of bacteria.

TI  - Report of a large depletion in the ozone layer over southern Brazil and Uruguay by using multi-instrumental data
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone is one of the chemical compounds that form part of the atmosphere. It plays a key role in the stratosphere where the "ozone layer" is located and absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation. However, during austral spring (August-November), there is a massive destruction of the ozone layer, which is known as the "Antarctic ozone hole". This phenomenon decreases ozone concentration in that region, which may affect other regions in addition to the polar one. This anomaly may also reach midlatitudes; hence, it is called the "secondary effect of the Antarctic ozone hole". Therefore, this study aims to identify the passage of an ozone secondary effect (OSE) event in the region of the city of Santa Maria - RS (29.68 degrees S, 53.80 degrees W) by means of a multi-instrumental analysis using the satellites TIMED/SABER, AURA/MLS, and OMI-ERS. Measurements were made in Sao Martinho da Serra/RS - Brazil (29.53 degrees S, 53.85 degrees W) using a sounding balloon and a Brewer Spectrophotometer. In addition, the present study aims to describe and analyse the influence that this stratospheric ozone reduction has on temperatures presented by these instruments, including data collected through the radio occultation technique. The event was first identified by the AURA/MLS satellite on 19 October 2016 over Uruguay. This reduction in ozone concentration was found by comparing the climatology for the years 1996-1998 for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which is close to Uruguay. This event was already observed in Santa Maria/RS-Brazil on 20 October 2016 as presented by the OMI-ERS satellite and the Brewer Spectrophotometer. Moreover, a significant decrease was reported by the TIMED/SABER satellite in Uruguay. On 21 October, the poor ozone air mass was still over the region of interest, according to the OMI-ERS satellite, data from the sounding balloon launched in Santa Maria/RS-Brazil, and measurements made by the AURA/MLS satellite. Furthermore, the influence of ozone on the stratosphere temperature was observed during this period. Despite a continuous decrease detected in height, the temperature should have followed an increasing pattern in the stratospheric layer. Finally, the TIMED/SABER and OMI-ERS satellites showed that on 23 October, the air mass with low ozone concentration was moving away, and its layer, as well as the temperature, in the stratosphere was re-established.

TI  - The 21 August 2017 Ischia (Italy) Earthquake Source Model Inferred From Seismological, GPS, and DInSAR Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The causative source of the first damaging earthquake instrumentally recorded in the Island of Ischia, occurred on 21 August 2017, has been studied through a multiparametric geophysical approach. In order to investigate the source geometry and kinematics we exploit seismological, Global Positioning System, and Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar coseismic measurements. Our results indicate that the retrieved solutions from the geodetic data modeling and the seismological data are plausible; in particular, the best fit solution consists of an E-W striking, south dipping normal fault, with its center located at a depth of 800m. Moreover, the retrieved causative fault is consistent with the rheological stratification of the crust in this zone. This study allows us to improve the knowledge of the volcano-tectonic processes occurring on the Island, which is crucial for a better assessment of the seismic risk in the area.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability and Trends in 2001-2016 Global Fire Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire regimes across the globe have great spatial and temporal variability, and these are influence by many factors including anthropogenic management, climate, and vegetation types. Here we utilize the satellite-based active fire product, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, to statistically analyze variability and trends in fire activity from the global to regional scales. We split up the regions by economic development, region/geographical land use, clusters of fire-abundant areas, or by religious/cultural influence. Weekly cycle tests are conducted to highlight and quantify part of the anthropogenic influence on fire regime across the world. We find that there is a strong statistically significant decline in 2001-2016 active fires globally linked to an increase in net primary productivity observed in northern Africa, along with global agricultural expansion and intensification, which generally reduces fire activity. There are high levels of variability, however. The large-scale regions exhibit either little change or decreasing in fire activity except for strong increasing trends in India and China, where rapid population increase is occurring, leading to agricultural intensification and increased crop residue burning. Variability in Canada has been linked to a warming global climate leading to a longer growing season and higher fuel loads. Areas with a strong weekly cycle give a good indication of where fire management is being applied most extensively, for example, the United States, where few areas retain a natural fire regime.

TI  - Urban Modification of Convection and Rainfall in Complex Terrain
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a globally growing proportion of cities located in regions of complex terrain, interactions between urbanization and complex terrain and their meteorological impacts are not well understood. We utilize numerical model simulations and satellite data products to investigate such impacts over San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina. Numerical modeling experiments show urbanization results in 20-30% less precipitation downwind of the city and an eastward shift in precipitation upwind. Our experiments show that changes in surface energy, boundary layer dynamics, and thermodynamics induced by urbanization interact synergistically with the persistent forcing of atmospheric flow by complex terrain. With urbanization increasing in mountainous regions, land-atmosphere feedbacks can exaggerate meteorological forcings leading to weather impacts that require important considerations for sustainable development of urban regions within complex terrain.Plain Language Summary Rapid urbanization produces a variety of challenges including management of food and water security, pollution, and vector borne diseases. Several cities around the globe within regions of complex terrain face additional challenges. Urbanization impacts from land cover change and human activity in cities could potentially be amplified through persistent forcing of clouds and precipitation from flow interactions with complex terrain. This important feedback is not yet understood. This study examines the impact of the city of San Miguel de Tucuman in northwestern Argentina, located in the vicinity of Andes, on regional weather. Our analysis finds that urbanization leads to changes in cloud and rain formation around the city and over the mountains further downwind. Changes in clouds and rainfall caused by urbanization have the potential to reduce stream flow from higher elevations and adversely impact available water resources. While this study focuses on a single city, broader implications of this work suggest that urbanization in regions of complex terrain has significant impacts on regional precipitation that could affect food and water availability. By addressing the unknown meteorological feedbacks of urbanization within complex terrain, urban planning can be more strategic toward the end goal of future urban sustainability, particularly in developing countries.

TI  - Lack of impact of the El Hierro (Canary Islands) submarine volcanic eruption on the local phytoplankton community
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The eruption of a submarine volcano south of El Hierro Island (Canary Islands) in October 2011 led to major physical and chemical changes in the local environment. Large amounts of nutrients were found at specific depths in the water column above the volcano associated with suboxic layers resulting from the oxidation of reduced chemical species expelled during the eruptive phase. It has been suggested that the fertilization with these compounds enabled the rapid restoration of the ecosystem in the marine reserve south of the island once the volcanic activity ceased, although no biological evidence for this has been provided yet. To test the biological fertilization hypothesis on the pelagic ecosystem, we studied the evolution and variability in chlorophyll a, from in situ and remote sensing data, combined with information on phytoplankton and bacterial community structure during and after the eruptive episode. Remote sensing and in situ data revealed that no phytoplankton bloom took place neither during nor after the eruptive episode. We hypothesize that the fertilization by the volcano did not have an effect in the phytoplankton community due to the strong dilution of macro- and micronutrients caused by the efficient renewal of ambient waters in the zone.

TI  - Association between localized geohazards in West Texas and human activities, recognized by Sentinel-1A/B satellite radar imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - West Texas' Permian Basin, consisting of ancient marine rocks, is underlain by water-soluble rocks and multiple oil-rich formations. In the region that is densely populated with oil producing facilities, many localized geohazards, such as ground subsidence and micro-earthquakes, have gone unnoticed. Here we identify the localized geohazards in West Texas, using the satellite radar interferometry from newly launched radar satellites that provide radar images freely to public for the first time, and probe the causal mechanisms of ground deformation, encompassing oil/gas production activities and subsurface geological characteristics. Based on our observations and analyses, human activities of fluid (saltwater, CO2) injection for stimulation of hydrocarbon production, salt dissolution in abandoned oil facilities, and hydrocarbon extraction each have negative impacts on the ground surface and infrastructures, including possible induced seismicity. Proactive continuous and detailed monitoring of ground deformation from space over the currently operating and the previously operated oil/gas production facilities, as demonstrated by this research, is essential to securing the safety of humanity, preserving property, and sustaining the growth of the hydrocarbon production industry.

TI  - Revised mineral dust emissions in the atmospheric chemistry-climate model EMAC (MESSy 2.52 DU_Astitha1 KKDU2017 patch)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the aeolian dust budget calculations with the global ECHAM/MESSy atmospheric chemistry-climate model (EMAC), which combines the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) with the ECMWF/Hamburg (ECHAM) climate model developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg based on a weather prediction model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), we have implemented new input data and updates of the emission scheme.The data set comprises land cover classification, vegetation, clay fraction and topography. It is based on up-todate observations, which are crucial to account for the rapid changes of deserts and semi-arid regions in recent decades. The new Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover and vegetation data are time dependent, and the effect of long-term trends and variability of the relevant parameters is therefore considered by the emission scheme. All input data have a spatial resolution of at least 0:1 degrees compared to 1 degrees in the previous version, equipping the model for high-resolution simulations.We validate the updates by comparing the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm wavelength from a 1-year simulation at T106 (about 1:1 degrees) resolution with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and MODIS observations, the 10 mu m dust AOD (DAOD) with Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) retrievals, and dust concentration and deposition results with observations from the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) dust benchmark data set. The update significantly improves agreement with the observations and is therefore recommended to be used in future simulations.

TI  - The ATP-P2X<sub>7</sub> Signaling Axis Is an Essential Sentinel for Intracellular <i>Clostridium difficile</i> Pathogen-Induced Inflammasome Activation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of nosocomial infection in hospitalized patients receiving long-term antibiotic treatment. An excessive host inflammatory response is believed to be the major mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, and various proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta are detected in patients with C. difficile infection. IL-1 beta is known to be processed by caspase-1, a cysteine protease that is regulated by a protein complex called the inflammasome, which leads to a specialized form of cell death called pyroptosis. The function of inflammasome activation-induced pyroptosis is to clear or limit the spread of invading pathogens via infiltrated neutrophils. Here, we focused on inflammasome activation induced by intact C. difficile to re-evaluate the nature of inflammasome activation in CDI pathogenesis, which could provide information that leads to an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this condition in humans. First, we found that caspase-1-dependent IL-1 beta production was induced by C. difficile pathogens in macrophages and increased in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, intracellular toxigenic C. difficile was essential for ATP-P2X(7) pathway of inflammasome activation and subsequent caspase-1-dependent pyroptotic cell death, leading to the loss of membrane integrity and release of intracellular contents such as LDH. Notably, we also observed that bacterial components such as surface layer proteins (SLPs) were released from pyroptotic cells. In addition, pro-IL-1 beta production was completely MyD88 and partially TLR2 dependent. Finally, to investigate the role of the caspase-1-dependent inflammasome in host defense, we found that colonic inflammasome activation was also induced by CDI and that caspase-1 inhibition by Ac-YVAD-CMK led to increased disease progression and C. difficile load. Taken together, the present results suggest that MyD88 and TLR2 are critical component in pro-IL-1 beta production and intracellular C. difficile following the ATP-P2X(7) pathway of inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which play important roles in host defense through the utilization of inflammation-mediated bacterial clearance mechanisms during C. difficile infection.

TI  - Evaluating Surface Radiation Fluxes Observed From Satellites in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on evaluation of current satellite and reanalysis estimates of surface radiative fluxes in a climatically important region. It uses unique observations from the STRATUS Ocean Reference Station buoy in a region of persistent marine stratus clouds 1,500km off northern Chile during 2000-2012. The study shows that current satellite estimates are in better agreement with buoy observations than model outputs at a daily time scale and that satellite data depict well the observed annual cycle in both shortwave and longwave surface radiative fluxes. Also, buoy and satellite estimates do not show any significant trend over the period of overlap or any interannual variability. This verifies the stability and reliability of the satellite data and should make them useful to examine El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability influences on surface radiative fluxes at the STRATUS site for longer periods for which satellite record is available.Plain Language Summary The ability of satellites to provide accurate estimates of shortwave and longwave radiation reaching the surface of the ocean is investigated by comparing satellite estimates with observations from a surface buoy. The buoy was deployed since 2000 at a site 1,500km off northern Chile, where persistent clouds complicate remote sensing of the ocean surface. Good agreement has been found between current satellite products and the buoy; the results are better than those found with surface radiation estimates based on reanalysis models. Since the satellite data capture well the annual cycle in radiative fluxes at the buoy, and there are no detectable trends in buoy and satellite shortwave and longwave radiation, the satellite data are seen to have good temporal stability. Neither satellite nor the buoy showed interannual variability in surface radiative fluxes at the site; using satellite data to map where El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability is seen shows that the STRATUS site is just south of the region where El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability is seen in surface radiative fluxes.

TI  - Variability and trend in ozone over the southern tropics and subtropics
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term variability in ozone trends was assessed over eight Southern Hemisphere tropical and subtropical sites (Natal, Nairobi, Ascension Island, Java, Samoa, Fiji, Reunion and Irene), using total column ozone data (TCO) and vertical ozone profiles (altitude range 15-30 km) recorded during the period January 1998-December 2012. The TCO datasets were constructed by combination of satellite data (OMI and TOMS) and ground-based observations recorded using Dobson and SAOZ spectrometers. Vertical ozone profiles were obtained from balloon-sonde experiments which were operated within the framework of the SHADOZ network. The analysis in this study was performed using the Trend-Run model. This is a multivariate regression model based on the principle of separating the variations of ozone time series into a sum of several forcings (annual and semi-annual oscillations, QBO (Quasi-Biennial Oscillation), ENSO, 11-year solar cycle) that account for most of its variability.The trend value is calculated based on the slope of a normalized linear function which is one of the forcing parameters included in the model. Three regions were defined as follows: equatorial (0-10 degrees S), tropical (10-20 degrees S) and subtropical (20-30 degrees S). Results obtained indicate that ozone variability is dominated by seasonal and quasi-biennial oscillations. The ENSO contribution is observed to be significant in the tropical lower stratosphere and especially over the Pacific sites (Samoa and Java). The annual cycle of ozone is observed to be the most dominant mode of variability for all the sites and presents a meridional signature with a maximum over the subtropics, while semi-annual and quasi-biannual ozone modes are more apparent over the equatorial region, and their magnitude decreases southward. The ozone variation mode linked to the QBO signal is observed between altitudes of 20 and 28 km. Over the equatorial zone there is a strong signal at similar to 26 km, where 58% +/- 2% of total ozone variability is explained by the effect of QBO. Annual ozone oscillations are more apparent at two different altitude ranges (below 24 km and in the 27-30 km altitude band) over the tropical and subtropical regions, while the semi-annual oscillations are more significant over the 27-30 km altitude range in the tropical and equatorial regions. The estimated trend in TCO is positive and not significant and corresponds to a variation of similar to 1.34 +/- 0.50% decade(-1) (averaged over the three regions). The trend estimated within the equatorial region (0-15 degrees S) is less than 1% per decade, while it is assessed at more than 1.5% decade(-1) for all the sites located southward of 17 degrees S. With regard to the vertical distribution of trend estimates, a positive trend in ozone concentration is obtained in the 22-30 km altitude range, while a delay in ozone improvement is apparent in the UT-LS (upper troposphere-lower stratosphere) below 22 km. This is especially noticeable at approximately 19 km, where a negative value is observed in the tropical regions.

TI  - The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project H-Series climate data record product
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper describes the new global long-term International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-series climate data record (CDR). The H-series data contain a suite of level 2 and 3 products for monitoring the distribution and variation of cloud and surface properties to better understand the effects of clouds on climate, the radiation budget, and the global hydrologic cycle. This product is currently available for public use and is derived from both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite imaging radiometers with common visible and infrared (IR) channels. The H-series data currently span July 1983 to December 2009 with plans for continued production to extend the record to the present with regular updates. The H-series data are the longest combined geostationary and polar orbiter satellite-based CDR of cloud properties. Access to the data is provided in network common data form (netCDF) and archived by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) under the satellite Climate Data Record Program (https://doi.org/10.7289/V5QZ281S). The basic characteristics, history, and evolution of the dataset are presented herein with particular emphasis on and discussion of product changes between the H-series and the widely used predecessor D-series product which also spans from July 1983 through December 2009. Key refinements included in the ISCCP H-series CDR are based on improved quality control measures, modified ancillary inputs, higher spatial resolution input and output products, calibration refinements, and updated documentation and metadata to bring the H-series product into compliance with existing standards for climate data records.

AB  - This investigation was aimed at contributing to develop a suitable multi-biomarker approach for pollution monitoring in mangrove-lined Caribbean coastal systems using as sentinel species, the mangrove cupped oyster, Crassostrea rhizophorae. A pilot field study was carried out in 8 localities (3 in Nicaragua; 5 in Colombia), characterized by different environmental conditions and subjected to different levels and types of pollution. Samples were collected in the rainy and dry seasons of 2012-2013. The biological effects at different levels of biological complexity (Stress-on-Stress response, reproduction, condition index, tissue-level biomarkers and histopathology) were determined as indicators of health disturbance, integrated as IBR/n index, and compared with tissue burdens of contaminants in order to achieve an integrative biomonitoring approach. Though modulated by natural variables and confounding factors, different indicators of oyster health, alone and in combination, were related to the presence of different profiles and levels of contaminants present at low-to-moderate levels. Different mixtures of persistent (As, Cd, PAHs) and emerging chemical pollutants (musk fragrances), in combination with different levels of organic and particulate matter resulting from seasonal oceanographic variability and sewage discharges, and environmental factors (salinity, temperature) elicited a different degree of disturbance in ecosystem health condition, as reflected in sentinel C. rhizophorae. As a result, IBR/nwas correlated with pollution indices, even though the levels of biological indicators of health disturbance and pollutants were low-to-moderate, and seasonality and the incidence of confounding factors were remarkable. Our study supports the use of simple methodological approaches to diagnose anomalies in the health status of oysters from different localities and to identify potential causing agents and reflect disturbances in ecosystem health. Consequently, the easy methodological approach used herein is useful for the assessment of health disturbance in a variety of mangrove-lined Caribbean coastal systems using mangrove cupped oysters as sentinel species.

TI  - Decadal trends in photosynthetic capacity and leaf area index inferred from satellite remote sensing for global vegetation types
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of a mounting diversity of experimental, satellite and ground-based observations, it is becoming necessary to simulate all changes associated with vegetation (phenological, structural, physiological and biochemical) and to understand the links between them. In this respect, global land-surface models are an indispensible tool. These models require, above all, a temporally and spatially explicit parameterisation of light- and Rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity in order to simulate photosynthesis accurately. The current study carries out a novel retrieval of these quantities by combining the standard satellite products of Leaf Area Index (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll concentration from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Monthly values of photosynthetic capacity are retrieved for the period 2002-2012 for global 0.5 degrees landpoints and made available to the community. We examine the decadal trends in both photosynthetic capacity and LAI in order to ascertain biochemical and structural responses of vegetation to environmental change. The main conclusion is that these trends, if sustained, are of a sufficient magnitude to vie in importance with other environmental factors which affect vegetation productivity and carbon uptake (e.g. CO2 fertilisation and climate). The decadal trends for Rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity, which tend to be negative, depend more on plant functional type than latitude, suggesting that biochemical change, like physiological response (e.g. owing to CO2 fertilisation), might best be monitored in terms of vegetation type rather than climate zone. We record an LAI trend which, globally, is flat (-0.2 +/- 0.4% per decade) and, for the (mid-)northern latitudes, is much smaller (1.5-2.7% per decade) than that inferred by previous authors for Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the 1980s (9-13%).

TI  - Sea surface temperature variability along the Portuguese coast since 1950
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Overall an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) has been recorded over the last century. However, changes in SST are not homogeneous across the ocean. Most studies focus on the processes and mechanisms setting SST variability across broad scales and neglect changes occurring at a regional scale. So, this study aims to describe annual, seasonal and monthly time-series trends in SST along the Portuguese coast, compare trends among areas (Northwest, Southwest and South), quantify SST increase rates and SST time-series discontinuities. Time-series analyses showed that SST has the same annual and monthly trend regardless of the area and data sets used (ICOADS: 1950-2010; Satellite data: 1985-2010). SST increased in the three areas: +0.1 degrees Cdecade(-1) in Northwestern and Southwestern coasts (the same than global average), +0.2 degrees Cdecade(-1) in the Southern coast. The higher monthly SST increment rates were observed in spring and summer (satellite data: +0.4 degrees C decade(-1) in June in Northwest; +0.4 degrees C decade(-1) in April in Southwest; +0.5 degrees Cdecade(-1) in June in South). Discontinuities, that is, sudden shifts in time-series, were observed after 1987, 1995 and 1982-1983 in the Northwest, Southwest and Southern areas, respectively. Overall, this study reinforces the hypothesis that SST varies regionally; so, studies assessing the impacts inherent to climate change along coastal areas, namely fisheries variability, ought to have this perspective into account.

TI  - Miniaturized Six-Degree-of-Freedom Force/Moment Transducers for Instrumented Teeth With Single Sensor Chip
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports on a novel force/moment transducer small enough to replace the root of an artificial tooth. Its dimensions of 4.5 mm in diameter and 16.4 mm in height are identical to the former state-of-the-art design. However, the new design requires a significantly reduced assembly effort and imposes lower demands on the external read-out periphery. The latter improvement facilitates the simultaneous operation of a larger number of force/moment transducers. The novel design was optimized using the finite-element analysis, whose results are experimentally validated. The new design and the former state-of-the-art design are extensively tested with the same test procedure for ranges of +/- 3 N and +/- 30 Nmm. The measurement accuracies are measured to be 10, 23, and 64 mN for the forces f(x), f (y), and f(z), respectively, and 161 x 10(-3) Nmm, 302 x 10(-3) Nmm, and 42 x 10(-3) Nmm for the moments m(x), m(y), and m(z). Despite the simpler assembly effort and device handling, the accuracy is better or at least close to former designs. Especially, the more critical force measurements are significantly improved. Long-term stability tests show only little change in measurement performance of the two designs in time.

TI  - Aerosols characteristics, trends and their climatic implications over Northeast India and adjoining South Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol characteristics and climatic implications derived for selected locations of the north-eastern region of India and adjoining locations Thimphu (THM), Dhaka (DAC) and Banmauk between 22-30 degrees N and 88-98 degrees E are reported. The region is found to reveal a distinct spatio-temporal variability in aerosol distribution, with highest climatological mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550)) at DAC (0.65 +/- 0.07) and lowest at the high altitude location THM (0.19 +/- 0.02). Seasonally the maximum AOD(550) is observed in the pre-monsoon season. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer Level-3 Collection 6 AOD(550) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) exhibit a significant and simultaneous increasing trend in the range of approximate to 0.003 year(-1) to 0.012 year(-1) and approximate to-0.001 year(-1) to 0.020 year(-1), respectively, during the period 2001-2014. Together with AE, increasing trend of total ozone mapping spectrometer and ozone monitoring instrument-retrieved aerosol index (approximate to 0.001 year(-1) to 0.007 year(-1) during 1979-2014) signifies an increase in anthropogenic aerosol loading, leading to an increase in number density of cloud condensation nuclei and decrease/increase of cloud effective radius /cloud optical depth (COD). This is further associated with overall decreasing trends of rainfall rate over this complex monsoon region. A slow increase in maximum temperature (T-max) (approximate to 0.008 degrees C year(-1) to 0.049 degrees C year(-1)) compared to that in minimum temperature (T-min) (approximate to 0.007 degrees C year(-1) to 0.068 degrees C year(-1)) is attributed to solar dimming due to increasing aerosol loading and COD (approximate to 0.056 year(-1) to 0.15 year(-1)). A decrease in high-level cloud (CODhigh) counteracts decreasing trends of ground reaching solar radiation over a few locations, including Dibrugarh. This study is important from an aerosol radiation interaction and aerosol cloud interaction viewpoint, which facilitates in reaching a closure of model simulated present day climate change and future climate projections.

TI  - Active tectonics of the onshore Hengchun Fault using UAS DSM combined with ALOS PS-InSAR time series (Southern Taiwan)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing active faults and quantifying their activity are major concerns in Taiwan, especially following the major Chichi earthquake on 21 September 1999. Among the targets that still remain poorly understood in terms of active tectonics are the Hengchun and Kenting faults (Southern Taiwan). From a geodynamic point of view, the faults affect the outcropping top of the Manila accretionary prism of the Manila subduction zone that runs from Luzon (northern Philippines) to Taiwan. In order to better locate and quantify the location and quantify the activity of the Hengchun Fault, we start from existing geological maps, which we update thanks to the use of two products derived from unmanned aircraft system acquisitions: (1) a very high precision (< 50 cm) and resolution (< 10 cm) digital surface model (DSM) and (2) a georeferenced aerial photograph mosaic of the studied area. Moreover, the superimposition of the resulting structural sketch map with new Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) results obtained from PALSAR ALOS images, validated by Global Positioning System (GPS) and leveling data, allows the characterization and quantification of the surface displacements during the monitoring period (2007-2011). We confirm herein the geometry, characterization and quantification of the active Hengchun Fault deformation, which acts as an active left-lateral transpressive fault. As the Hengchun ridge was the location of one of the last major earthquakes in Taiwan (26 December 2006, depth: 44 km, M-L = 7.0), Hengchun Peninsula active tectonics must be better constrained in order if possible to prevent major destructions in the near future.

TI  - The Saposin-Like Protein ApID Displays Pore-Forming Activity and Participates in Defense Against Bacterial Infection During a Multicellular Stage of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to their archaic life style and microbivor behavior, amoebae may represent a source of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. The amoebic protozoon Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model organism in cell biology for decades and has recently also been used for research on host-pathogen interactions and the evolution of innate immunity. In the genome of D. discoideum, genes can be identified that potentially allow the synthesis of a variety of antimicrobial proteins. However, at the protein level only very few antimicrobial proteins have been characterized that may interact directly with bacteria and help in fighting infection of D. discoideum with potential pathogens. Here, we focus on a large group of gene products that structurally belong to the saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family and which members we named provisionally Apls (amoebapore-like peptides) according to their similarity to a comprehensively studied antimicrobial and cytotoxic pore-forming protein of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. We focused on AplD because it is the only Apl gene that is reported to be primarily transcribed further during the multicellular stages such as the mobile slug stage. Upon knock-out (KO) of the gene, aplD-slugs became highly vulnerable to virulent Klebsiella pneumoniae. AplD-slugs harbored bacterial clumps in their interior and were unable to slough off the pathogen in their slime sheath. Re-expression of AplD in aplD-slugs rescued the susceptibility toward K. pneumoniae. The purified recombinant protein rAplD formed pores in liposomes and was also capable of permeabilizing the membrane of live Bacillus megaterium. We propose that the multifarious Apl family of D. discoideum comprises antimicrobial effector polypeptides that are instrumental to interact with bacteria and their phospholipid membranes. The variety of its members would allow a complementary and synergistic action against a variety of microbes, which the amoeba encounters in its environment.

TI  - Spatial distribution of volcanic ash deposits of 2011 Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption in Patagonia as measured by a perturbation in NDVI temporal dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash fallout is a recurrent environmental disturbance in forests, arid and semi-arid rangelands of Patagonia, South America. The ash deposits over large areas are responsible for several impacts on ecological processes, agricultural production and health of local communities. Public policy decision making needs monitoring information of the affected areas by ash fallout, in order to better orient social, economic and productive aids. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of volcanic ash deposits from the eruption of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle in 2011, by identifying a sudden change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal dynamics, defined as a perturbation located in the time series. We applied a sparse-wavelet transform using the Basis Pursuit algorithm to NDVI time series obtained from the Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, to identify perturbations at a pixel level. The spatial distribution of the perturbation promoted by ash deposits in Patagonia was successfully identified and characterized by means of a perturbation in NDVI temporal dynamics. Results are encouraging for the future development of a new platform, in combination with data from forecasting models and tracking of ash cloud trajectories and dispersion, to inform stakeholders to mitigate impact of volcanic ash on agricultural production and to orient public intervention strategies after a volcanic eruption followed by ash fallout over a wide region.

TI  - Technical note: A simple approach for efficient collection of field reference data for calibrating remote sensing mapping of northern wetlands
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The calibration and validation of remote sensing land cover products are highly dependent on accurate field reference data, which are costly and practically challenging to collect. We describe an optical method for collection of field reference data that is a fast, cost-efficient, and robust alternative to field surveys and UAV imaging. A lightweight, waterproof, remote-controlled RGB camera (GoPro HERO4 Silver, GoPro Inc.) was used to take wide-angle images from 3.1 to 4.5 m in altitude using an extendable monopod, as well as representative near-ground (< 1 m) images to identify spectral and structural features that correspond to various land covers in present lighting conditions. A semi-automatic classification was made based on six surface types (graminoids, water, shrubs, dry moss, wet moss, and rock). The method enables collection of detailed field reference data, which is critical in many remote sensing applications, such as satellite-based wetland mapping. The method uses common non-expensive equipment, does not require special skills or training, and is facilitated by a step-by-step manual that is included in the Supplement. Over time a global ground cover database can be built that can be used as reference data for studies of non-forested wetlands from satellites such as Sentinel 1 and 2 (10 m pixel size).

TI  - Transected thin melanoma: Implications for sentinel lymph node staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesIndications for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with thin melanoma (1mm thick) are controversial. We asked whether deep margin (DM) positivity at initial biopsy of thin melanoma is associated with SLN positivity.MethodsCases were identified using prospectively maintained databases at two melanoma centers. Patients who had undergone SLN biopsy for melanoma 1mm were included. DM status was assessed for association with SLN metastasis in univariate and multivariate analyses.Results1413 cases were identified, but only 1129 with known DM status were included. 39% of patients had a positive DM on original biopsy. DM-positive and DM-negative patients did not differ significantly in primary thickness, ulceration, or mitotic activity. DM-positive and DM-negative patients had similar incidence of SLN metastasis (5.7% vs 3.5%; P=0.07). Positive DM was not associated with SLN metastasis on univariate analysis (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 0.95-3.00, P=0.07) or on multivariate analysis adjusted for Breslow depth, Clark level, mitotic rate, and ulceration (OR=1.59, 95% CI: 0.89-2.85; P=0.12).ConclusionsFor patients with thin melanoma, a positive DM on initial biopsy is not associated with risk of SLN metastasis, so DM positivity should not be considered an indication for SLN staging in an otherwise low-risk patient.

TI  - Using MODIS NDVI phenoclasses and phenoclusters to characterize wildlife habitat: Mexican spotted owl as a case study
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most uses of remotely sensed satellite data to characterize wildlife habitat have used metrics such as mean NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in a year or season. These simple metrics do not take advantage of the temporal patterns in NDVI within and across years and the spatial arrangement of cells with various temporal NDVI signatures. Here we use 13 years of data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to bin individual MODIS pixels (5.3 ha) into phenoclasses, where each phenoclass consists of pixels with a particular temporal profile of NDVI, regardless of spatial location. We present novel procedures that assign sites to phenoclusters, defined as particular composition of phenoclasses within a 1 km radius. We apply these procedures to Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidenralis lucida) nesting locations in the Sacramento Mountain range in south-central New Mexico. Phenoclasses at owl nest sites and phenoclusters around owl nest sites differed from those at and around points randomly placed in forest types that are known to support nesting owls. Stand exam data showed that the phenoclasses associated with owl nest sites are dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor). The availability of phenoclusters and phenoclasses on Mescalero Apache tribal lands differed from those on adjacent National Forest lands within the Sacramento Mountain, consistent with different elevations and forest management practices. Nonetheless owls predominately used the same phenoclasses and phenoclusters in both land ownerships. MODIS phenoclasses and phenoclusters offer a useful means of remotely identifying forest conditions suitable for wildlife. Because the remote sensing data are freely available and regularly updated, they can be part of a cost effective approach to monitor and assess forested wildlife habitat over large temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of upwelling along the southwest coast of India based on satellite observations
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Upwelling phenomenon along the eastern boundaries of global ocean has received greater attention in the recent times due to its environmental and economic significance in the global warming and the scenario of changing climate as opined by IPCC AR5. In this context, the availabile satellite data on sea surface winds, sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomaly (SLA) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), for the period 1981-2016 were analyzed to identify the coastal upwelling pattern in the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS). Synergistic approach, using winds, SST, SLA and Chl-a revealed that strong upwelling was prevailing between 8 degrees N and 12 degrees N. During the study period, geographical differences existed in the peak values of upwelling favorable conditions considered for study. Analysis of the alongshore winds which are conducive for upwelling were observed to be curtailed towards the northern part of the study region between 2005 and 2010. Also, the strength of upwelling reduced during the strong ENSO years of 1997 and 2015. Linear regression based trend analysis of upwelling indices like Ekman transport, SST and chlorophyll along the coast, during the upwelling period, revealed slight increase in the strength towards the southern region while it decreased to the north during the study period.

TI  - Vessel detection and classification from spaceborne optical images: A literature survey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.

TI  - Long-term trend and correlation between vegetation greenness and climate variables in Asia based on satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data has been used to ascertain trends and correlations between climate change and vegetation greenness in Asia. Our study utilized 33-year (1982-2014) AVHRR-GIMMS (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer - Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit Time Series) climate variable (temperature, rainfall, and potential evapotranspiration) time series. First, we estimated the overall trends for vegetation greenness, climate variables and analyzed trends during summer (April to October), winter (November to March), and the entire year. Second, we carried out correlation and regression analyses to detect correlations between vegetation greenness and climate variables. Our study revealed an increasing trend (0.05 to 0.28) in temperature in northeastern India (bordering Bhutan), Southeast Bhutan, Yunnan Province of China, Northern Myanmar, Central Cambodia, northern Laos, southern Vietnam, eastern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and southern Pakistan. However, a decreasing trend in temperature (0.00 to -0.04) was noted for specific areas in southern Asia including Central Myanmar and northwestern Thailand and the Guangxi, Southern Gansu, and Shandong provinces of China. The results also indicated an increasing trend for evapotranspiration and air temperature accompanied by a decreasing trend for vegetation greenness and rainfall. The temperature was found to be the main driver of the changing vegetation greenness in Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, Northeast and Central China, North Korea, South Korea, and northern Japan, showing an indirect relationship (R= 0.84-0.96).

TI  - Biological factors dominate the interannual variability of evapotranspiration in an irrigated cropland in the North China Plain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the interannual variability (IAV) and investigating the physical and biological controls on the IAV of evapotranspiration (ET) is fundamental for better simulating the hydrological processes in cropland where ET is the dominant component of water cycle. However, this topic has not been fully studied, although the number of long-term field observations is growing. By using a combination of long-term field observations (10 years) and agro-hydrological modelling, this study attempted to examine the IAV of ET and the physical and biological controls on the IAV of ET in an irrigated cropland in the North China Plain. This study reveals that the IAV of ET was only 7% in the selected dry subhumid area, which was much smaller than that of water supply (i.e., the sum of precipitation and irrigation). Moreover, the water supply was not the primary controlling factor that influenced the IAV of annual ET. Biological factors, including the leaf area index and bulk stomatal conductance, were found to be the dominant contributors to the MV of annual ET. Irrigation was an essential water source for crop growth, particularly for winter wheat growth, whereas its contribution to the MV of ET was smaller than that of precipitation because of the sufficient amount of irrigation. This study demonstrates that the variability of biological factors should be adequately represented in eco-hydrological models to accurately simulate the MV of annual ET.

TI  - Coupling physics and biogeochemistry thanks to high-resolution observations of the phytoplankton community structure in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale physical structures and ocean dynamics strongly influence and regulate biogeochemical and ecological processes. These processes are particularly challenging to describe and understand because of their ephemeral nature. The OSCAHR (Observing Submesoscale Coupling At High Resolution) campaign was conducted in fall 2015 in which a fine-scale structure (1-10 km/1-10 days) in the northwestern Mediterranean Ligurian subbasin was pre-identified using both satellite and numerical modeling data. Along the ship track, various variables were measured at the surface (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations) with ADCP current velocity. We also deployed a new model of the CytoSense automated flow cytometer (AFCM) optimized for small and dim cells, for near real-time characterization of the surface phytoplankton community structure of surface waters with a spatial resolution of a few kilometers and an hourly temporal resolution. For the first time with this optimized version of the AFCM, we were able to fully resolve Prochlorococcus picocyanobacteria in addition to the easily distinguishable Synechococcus. The vertical physical dynamics and biogeochemical properties of the studied area were investigated by continuous high-resolution CTD profiles thanks to a moving vessel profiler (MVP) during the vessel underway associated with a high-resolution pumping system deployed during fixed stations allowing sampling of the water column at a fine resolution (below 1 m). The observed fine-scale feature presented a cyclonic structure with a relatively cold core surrounded by warmer waters. Surface waters were totally depleted in nitrate and phosphate. In addition to the doming of the isopycnals by the cyclonic circulation, an intense wind event induced Ekman pumping. The up-welled subsurface cold nutrient-rich water fertilized surface waters and was marked by an increase in Chl a concentration. Prochlorococcus and pico- and nano-eukaryotes were more abundant in cold core waters, while Synechococcus dominated in warm boundary waters. Nanoeukaryotes were the main contributors (> 50 %) in terms of pigment content (red fluorescence) and biomass. Biological observations based on the mean cell's red fluorescence recorded by AFCM combined with physical properties of surface waters suggest a distinct origin for two warm boundary waters. Finally, the application of a matrix growth population model based on high-frequency AFCM measurements in warm boundary surface waters provides estimates of in situ growth rate and apparent net primary production for Prochlorococcus (mu = 0.21 d(-1), NPP = 0.11 mgCm(-3) d(-1)) and Synechococcus (mu = 0.72 d(-1), NPP = 2.68 mgCm(-3) d(-1)), which corroborate their opposite surface distribution pattern. The innovative adaptive strategy applied during OSCAHR with a combination of several multidisciplinary and complementary approaches involving high-resolution in situ observations and sampling, remote-sensing and model simulations provided a deeper understanding of the marine biogeochemical dynamics through the first trophic levels.

TI  - Land use and land cover dynamics in Dendi-Jeldu hilly-mountainous areas in the central Ethiopian highlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The central Ethiopian highlands where most human and livestock populations concentrated have experienced a drastic change in land use and land cover (LULC) of the landscapes. This study was aimed to define the rate and pattern of LULC changes in Dendi-Jeldu hilly-mountainous areas in the central Ethiopia. Aerial photographs of years 1957 and 1995, and Landsat images taken at 1995 and 2014 were used to analyze the historical land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The study covered an area of about 438 km(2). The analysis extracted from these remote sensing data revealed that, in 1957, the dominant LULCs were pastureland, cultivated land (cropland) and forestland covering 49, 25 and 20% of the total area, respectively. Remarkable LULC change dominated by cultivated land expansion (now covering 68% of the total area), however, claimed vast areas under pastureland (main), forestland and woodland. Deforestation in particular, would have been greater if Chilimo forest (remnant afro-montane forest) was not under state control. Plantation forestry exclusively dominated by eucalyptus species also showed substantial expansion into pastureland in the period between 1957 and 1995, and cultivated land between 1995 and 2014. In the period 1957 to 2014 cultivated land, plantation land and settlement were increased by 170%, 13,674% and 172% respectively, while pastureland, forestland and woodland declined by 67%, 73% and 100%, respectively. Change from natural habitat (pastureland, forestland and woodland) to other land uses (cultivated, plantation and settlement lands) is likely to have a large impact on biodiversity, land degradation and beyond.

TI  - Improving crop crop yield estimation by assimilating LAI and inputting satellite-based surface incoming solar radiation into SWAP model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise crop yield forecast at regional scales would increase global food security, especially in strategic crops such as wheat and barley. Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) is an agro-hydrological model based on a crop growth detailed module that could properly estimate crop yield using satellite observations as input data. In this study, in order to reduce crop yield estimation errors in wheat and barley, MODIS-based leaf area index (LAI) was assimilated using a sequential update algorithm into SWAP, and GLDAS/Noah-derived surface incoming solar radiation (SISR) was used as an alternative to measured SISR. The assimilation of remotely sensed LAI and using SISR as input was examined in nine different cases. Results showed that soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was the best VI for LAI estimation with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.72 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 m(2) m(-2). Also noise equivalent variations indicated an appropriate sensitivity of SAVI along the entire range of LAI variability. GLDAS/Noah-derived SISR showed good agreement with measured SISR; therefore LAI and SISR were jointly used in the model. Simulation results showed that the lowest percent absolute error (PAE) for aboveground dry biomass and grain yield was obtained in case 7 (the assimilation of the peak LAI in addition to ten days after and before the peak LAI is reached) with 1.59% and case 5 (the daily assimilation of LAI until twenty days after the peak LAI is reached) with 6.06%, respectively. Crop yield estimates were improved by 26.25 and 14.4% compared with no LAI assimilation case. Overall, LAI assimilation into SWAP associated with the most efficient cases in this study would result in an accurate crop yield forecast in wheat and barley.

TI  - Observation and modeling of the evolution of an ephemeral storm-induced inlet: Pea Island Breach, North Carolina, USA
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Outer Banks of North Carolina is a wave-dominated barrier island system that has experienced the opening and closure of numerous inlets in the last four centuries. The most recent of those inlets formed after the breaching of Pea Island during Hurricane Irene in 2011. The Pea Island Breach experienced a rapid evolution including episodic curvature of the main channel, rotation of the ebb channel, shoaling, widening by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and finally closing before the summer of 2013. Studying the life cycle of Pea Island Breach contributes to understanding the behavior of ephemeral inlets in breaching-prone regions. This topic has gained relevance due to rising sea levels, a phenomenon that increases the chances of ephemeral inlet formation during extreme events.This study explores the spatiotemporal effects of tides, waves, and storms on flow velocities and morphology of the breach by means of remotely sensed data, geospatial metrics, and a numerical model. The combined use of observations and results from modeling experiments allowed building a conceptual model to explain the life cycle of Pea Island Breach. Wave seasonality dominated the morphological evolution of the inlet by controlling the magnitude and direction of the longshore current that continuously built transient spits at both sides of the breach. Sensitivity analysis to external forcings indicates that ocean waves can modify water levels and velocities in the back barrier. Sound-side storm surge regulates overall growth rate, duration, and decay of peak water levels entering the inlet during extreme events.

TI  - Igneous rocks formed by hypervelocity impact
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Igneous rocks are the primary building blocks of planetary crusts. Most igneous rocks originate via decompression melting and/or wet melting of protolith lithologies within planetary interiors and their classification and compositional, petrographic, and textural characteristics, are well-studied. As our exploration of the Solar System continues, so too does the inventory of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks, settings, and processes. The results of planetary exploration have also clearly demonstrated that impact cratering is a ubiquitous geological process that has affected, and will continue to affect, all planetary objects with a solid surface, whether that be rock or ice. It is now recognized that the production of igneous rocks is a fundamental outcome of hypervelocity impact. The goal of this review is to provide an up-to-date synthesis of our knowledge and understanding of igneous rocks formed by hypervelocity impact. Following a brief overview of the basics of the impact process, we describe how and why melts are generated during impact events and how impact melting differs from endogenic igneous processes. While the process may differ, we show that the products of hypervelocity impact can share close similarities with volcanic and shallow intrusive igneous rocks of endogenic origin. Such impact melt rocks, as they are termed, can display lobate margins and cooling cracks, columnar joints and at the hand specimen and microscopic scale, such rocks can display mineral textures that are typical of volcanic rocks, such as quench crystallites, ophitic, porphyritic, as well as features such as vesicles, flow textures, and soon. Historically, these similarities led to the misidentification of some igneous rocks now known to be impact melt rocks as being of endogenic origin. This raises the question as to how to distinguish between an impact versus an endogenic origin for igneous-like rocks on other planetary bodies where fieldwork and sample analysis may not be possible and all that may be available is remote sensing data. While the interpretation of some impact melt rocks may be relatively straightforward (e.g., for clast-rich varieties and those with clear projectile contamination) we conclude that distinguishing between impact and endogenic igneous rocks is a non-trivial task that ultimately may require sample investigation and analysis to be conducted. Caution is, therefore, urged in the interpretation of igneous rocks on planetary surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating the statistical performance of less applied algorithms in classification of worldview-3 imagery data in an urbanized landscape
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decade, analyzing the remotely sensed imagery is considered as one of the most common and widely used procedures in the environmental studies. In this case, supervised image classification techniques play a central role. Hence, taking a high resolution Worldview-3 over a mixed urbanized landscape in Iran, three less applied image classification methods including Bagged CART, Stochastic gradient boosting model and Neural network with feature extraction were tested and compared with two prevalent methods: random forest and support vector machine with linear kernel. To do so, each method was run ten time and three validation techniques was used to estimate the accuracy statistics consist of cross validation, independent validation and validation with total of train data. Moreover, using ANOVA and Tukey test, statistical difference significance between the classification methods was significantly surveyed. In general, the results showed that random forest with marginal difference compared to Bagged CART and stochastic gradient boosting model is the best performing method whilst based on independent validation there was no significant difference between the performances of classification methods. It should be finally noted that neural network with feature extraction and linear support vector machine had better processing speed than other. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Making different things, but eating the same food? Correlation between cultural and subsistence changes during the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The end of the Pleistocene is characterized by a succession of climatic oscillations from the onset of MIS 2. These oscillations were associated with important environmental transformations that culminated in the Pleistocene to the Holocene transition, with latter climate amelioration. However, the changes during this period are not only restricted to the environment, as important cultural transformations took place. The cultural traditions characteristics from the end of the Upper Paleolithic disappear with the emergence of the traits characteristic of the Mesolithic culture. This is clearly attested in the well-known lithic record, but also in other domains of material culture, like bone industry and art. Nevertheless, the extent to which these cultural and environmental transformations were associated with changes in subsistence strategies remains unclear, at least at the Mediterranean basin of the Iberian Peninsula. Apparently, the exploitation of faunal resources during the Mesolithic does not seem to change so much with respect to the end of the Upper Paleolithic, especially concerning the consumption of small prey.The main goal of this paper is (1) to analyze how environmental transformations could or could not intervene on the modes of life of Prehistoric populations during these transitional periods, and (2) to discuss the apparent dichotomy between cultural changes and subsistence strategies at the end of the Upper Paleolithic and the Mesolithic in northeastern Iberia. In that sense, we will include the case of the Moll del Salt site (Catalonia, Spain) as an example to explain these trends. This site has an archaeological sequence from the Upper Magdalenian to the Mesolithic, which makes it a reference place to comprehend the dynamics of human populations during this period.

TI  - Pediatric Oncologist Willingness to Offer Germline <i>TP53</i> Testing in Osteosarcoma
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene TP53. Osteosarcoma is a sentinel cancer in LFS. Prior studies using Sanger sequencing platforms have demonstrated that 3% of individuals with osteosarcoma harbor a mutation in TP53. New data from next-generation sequencing have demonstrated that 3.8% of patients with osteosarcoma have a known pathogenic variant, and an additional 5.7% carry exonic variants of unknown significance in TP53. METHODS: Pediatric oncologists were e-mailed an anonymous 18-question survey assessing their willingness to offer TP53 germline testing to a child with osteosarcoma with or without a family history, and they were evaluated for changes in their choices with the prior data and the new data. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-seven pediatric oncologists (22%) responded to the survey. Respondents were more likely to offer TP53 testing to a patient with a positive family history (77.4% vs 12.4%; P<.0001). Significantly more providers responded that they would offer TP53 testing once they were provided with the new data (25.4% vs 12.4%; P 5.0038). The proportion of providers who responded that they were unsure increased significantly when they were presented with the new data (25.4% vs 10.2%; P 5.0002). Potential implications for other family members and the possibility that surveillance imaging would detect new malignancies at an earlier stage were important factors influencing a provider's decision to offer TP53 testing. CONCLUSIONS: Recent data increase the proportion of providers willing to offer testing, and this suggests concern on the part of pediatric oncologists that variants of unknown significance may be disease-defining in rare cancers.

TI  - Utility of ASTER and Landsat for quantifying hydrochemical concentrations in abandoned gold mining
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of mining on water resources is severe and requires careful monitoring and management. Remote sensing has been used to characterize water quality indicators in efforts to fight mine-induced contamination. Much focus has however been placed on producing a qualitative classification of water qualities. Moreover, the number of variables considered inmost studies is relatively small for a large number of hydrochemical constituents common in water bodies associated with gold mining activities. This study is aimed at quantifying a comprehensive list of field- and laboratory-measured chemical constituents of water samples from abandoned mines using remotely-sensed data. Akaike's Information Criterion was used to estimate each of the constituents using statistical values derived from individual bands of ASTER and Landsat data as predictors. Fairly good accuracies were obtained for constituents such as redox potential (Eh), major anions and cations. In contrast, trace elements correlated poorly with ASTER and Landsat bands, due mainly to a sampling anomaly. The performances of the two images in estimating the constituents were comparable. These findings suggest the potential of multispectral, moderate spatial resolution remote sensing for quantifying different hydrochemical properties of water bodies in mining environments. Further studies are however encouraged to enhance accuracies and reliability using a greater number of samples than was used in this study to capture the variability present in the population.

TI  - Wetlands inform how climate extremes influence surface water expansion and contraction
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective monitoring and prediction of flood and drought events requires an improved understanding of how and why surface water expansion and contraction in response to climate varies across space. This paper sought to (1) quantify how interannual patterns of surface water expansion and contraction vary spatially across the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) and adjacent Northern Prairie (NP) in the United States, and (2) explore how landscape characteristics influence the relationship between climate inputs and surface water dynamics. Due to differences in glacial history, the PPR and NP show distinct patterns in regards to drainage development and wetland density, together providing a diversity of conditions to examine surface water dynamics. We used Landsat imagery to characterize variability in surface water extent across 11 Landsat path/rows representing the PPR and NP (images spanned 1985-2015). The PPR not only experienced a 2.6-fold greater surface water extent under median conditions relative to the NP, but also showed a 3.4-fold greater change in surface water extent between drought and deluge conditions. The relationship between surface water extent and accumulated water availability (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) was quantified per watershed and statistically related to variables representing hydrology-related landscape characteristics (e.g., infiltration capacity, surface storage capacity, stream density). To investigate the influence stream connectivity has on the rate at which surface water leaves a given location, we modeled stream-connected and stream-disconnected surface water separately. Stream-connected surface water showed a greater expansion with wetter climatic conditions in landscapes with greater total wetland area, but lower total wetland density. Disconnected surface water showed a greater expansion with wetter climatic conditions in landscapes with higher wetland density, lower infiltration and less anthropogenic drainage. From these findings, we can expect that shifts in precipitation and evaporative demand will have uneven effects on surface water quantity. Accurate predictions regarding the effect of climate change on surface water quantity will require consideration of hydrology-related landscape characteristics including wetland storage and arrangement.

TI  - Detecting Himalayan glacial lake outburst floods from Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several thousands of moraine-dammed and supraglacial lakes spread over the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, and some have grown rapidly in past decades due to glacier retreat. The sudden emptying of these lakes releases large volumes of water and sediment in destructive glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), one of the most publicised natural hazards to the rapidly growing Himalayan population. Despite the growing number and size of glacial lakes, the frequency of documented GLOFs is remarkably constant. We explore this possible reporting bias and offer a new processing chain for establishing a more complete Himalayan GLOF inventory. We make use of the full seasonal archive of Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, and track automatically where GLOFs left shrinking water bodies, and tails of sediment at high elevations. We trained a Random Forest classifier to generate fuzzy land cover maps for 2491 images, achieving overall accuracies of 91%. We developed a likelihood-based change point technique to estimate the timing of GLOFs at the pixel scale. Our method objectively detected ten out of eleven documented GLOFs, and another ten lakes that gave rise to previously unreported GLOFs. We thus nearly doubled the existing GLOF record for a study area covering similar to 10% of the HKH region. Remaining challenges for automatically detecting GLOFs include image insufficiently accurate co-registration, misclassifications in the land cover maps and image noise from clouds, shadows or ice. Yet our processing chain is robust and has the potential for being applied on the greater HKH and mountain ranges elsewhere, opening the door for objectively expanding the knowledge base on GLOF activity over the past three decades.

TI  - Improving a distributed hydrological model using evapotranspiration-related boundary conditions as additional constraints in a data-scarce river basin
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many hydrological models have been calibrated and validated using hydrographs alone. Because streamflow integrates water fluxes in space, many distributed hydrological models tend to have multiple feasible descriptions of hydrological processes. This equifinality usually leads to substantial prediction uncertainty. In this study, additional constraintsnamely, the spatial patterns of long-term average evapotranspiration (ET), shallow groundwater level, and land cover changewere used to investigate the reduction of equifinality and prediction uncertainty in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the Wami River basin in Tanzania. The additional constraints were used in the set-up, parameter emulation and calibration of the SWAT model termed an improved hydrological model (IHM). The IHM was then compared with a classical hydrological model (CHM) that was also developed using the SWAT model but without additional constraints. In the calibration, the CHM used only the hydrograph, but the IHM used the hydrograph and the spatial pattern of long-term average ET as an additional constraint. The IHM produced a single, unique behavioural simulation, whereas the CHM produced many behavioural simulations that resulted in prediction uncertainty. The performance of the IHM with respect to the hydrograph was more consistent than that of the CHM, and the former clearly captured the mean behaviour of ET in the river basin. Therefore, we conclude that additional constraints substantially reduce equifinality and prediction uncertainty in a distributed hydrological model.

TI  - The spatial and temporal variation of total suspended solid concentration in Pearl River Estuary during 1987-2015 based on remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The movement and migration of total suspended solid (TSS) are the essential component of global material cycling and change. Based on the TSS concentrations retrieved from 112 scenes of Landsat remote sensing imageries during 1987-2015, the spatial and temporal variations of TSS concentration in high flow season and low flow seasons of six sub-regions (west shoal, west channel, middle shoal, east channel, east shoal and Pearl River Estuary Chinese White Dolphin National Nature Reserve and its adjacent waters (NNR)) of Pearl River Estuary (PRE) were analyzed and compared by statistical simulation. It was found that TSS concentrations in east and west shoals were about 23 mg/L and 64 mg/L higher than that of the middle shoal, respectively. There was a significant decreasing trend of TSS concentration from the northwest (223.7 mg/L) to southeast (51.4 mg/L) of study area, with an average reduction of 5.86 mg/L per km, which mainly attributes to unique interaction of runoff and tide in PRE. In high flow season, there existed a significant and definite annual cycle period (5-8 years) of TSS concentration change primarily responding to the periodic variation of precipitation. There were five full-fledged period changes of TSS detected in west shoal and west channel (the years of changes in 1988, 1994, 1998, 2003, 2010, 2015), while there were the last four cycle periods found in middle shoal, east channel, east shoal and NNR only. TSS concentrations in shoals and channels of PRE showed a significant decreased trend mainly due to the dam construction at the same time, with an average annual TSS concentration decrease of 5.7-10.1 mg/L in high flow season from 1988 to 2015. There was no significant change trend of TSS concentration in NNR before 2003, but the TSS concentration decreased significantly after the establishment of the NNR since June 2003, with an average annual decrease of 9.7 mg/L from 2004 to 2015. It was deduced that man-made protection measures had a great influence on the variation trend and intensity of TSS concentration in PRE, but had little effect on the cycle of TSS changes, indicating that the cyclical change is a very strong natural law. In low flow season, there was no significant change trend of TSS concentrations in PRE except that TSS concentrations in west channel and middle shoal showed a weak increasing trend (2.1 mg/L and 2.9 mg/L, respectively), which is probably because of controlled discharge for avoiding the intrusion of saltwater in PRE. Evidently, the change trend and cycle periods of TSS concentration in high-and low-flow seasons in six sub-regions of PRE had significant difference. The decreasing trend and cycle periods of TSS concentration mainly occurred in high flow season. The change trend and cycle periods of TSS concentration in low flow season was relatively small in PRE. The study shows that long series mapping of Landsat remote sensing images is an effective way to help understanding the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations of estuaries and coasts, and to increase awareness of environmental change and human activity effects.

TI  - Capturing rapid land surface dynamics with Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo (MCD43) products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products (MCD43) have been widely used for a variety of land surface studies since 2000 (e.g., for climate and biosphere modeling, radiative forcing, phonology, and classification schemes). In the past, limitations in computing and archive capacity had restricted the MCD43 retrievals to only once every eight days. The latest reprocessing of the entire archive of Terra and Aqua MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products (Collection V006) provide retrievals each day and therefore represent a major improvement for phonological and surface monitoring efforts. Compared to the previous retrieval which occurred every 8-days based on a 16-day retrieval period for Collection V005 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo, this study demonstrates that the Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo product retrieved every day captures significantly more seasonal vegetation dynamics and rapid land surface changes. The Collection V006 product still utilizes the 16-days of directional reflectances surrounding the day of interest (9th day) to retrieve the model of the surface anisotropy but assigns the highest temporal weight to the day of interest (the center date of the retrieval period). Furthermore, the Collection V006 retrievals utilize the day of interest snow/snow-free status to capture snow albedo (an improvement over the previous Collection V005 strategy which based the retrieval on the predominant snow/snow-free status of the majority of the observations over the 16-day retrieval period). All valid clear sky observations from Terra and Aqua are now used for each retrieval, which improves the inversion quality. This is especially true at high latitudes, where up to nine observations from each sensor can be observed per day. Thus, although the high quality full inversion Collection V006 albedo retrieval values are consistent with the Collection V005 results, the overall number of high quality results retrieved has increased. Furthermore, the accuracy of the poorer quality magnitude inversions (which rely on a back-up algorithm) has improved due to utilization of the latest high quality full inversion retrievals as pixel-specific a priori knowledge. The ability of the latest Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products to capture land surface dynamics is evaluated by using a globally-distributed record of spatially representative tower measurements. The RMSE of broadband shortwave blue-sky albedo at these sites is < 0.0318 and the bias is within +/- 0.0076 for all quality results.

TI  - A multidimensional comparison between MODIS and VIIRS AOD in estimating ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over a heavily polluted region in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been proven effective for estimating ground-level particles with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) concentrations. Using a time fixed effects regression model, we compared the capacity of two AOD sources, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over a heavily polluted region in China. Regarding high-quality AOD data, the results show that the VIIRS model performs better than the MODIS model with respect to all model accuracy evaluation indexes (e.g., the coefficient of determination, R-2, of the VIIRS and MODIS models are 0.76 and 0.71 during model fitting and 0.72 and 0.66 in cross validation, respectively), the potential for capturing high PM2.5 concentrations, and the precision of annual and seasonal PM2.5 estimates. However, the spatiotemporal coverage of the high-quality VIIRS AOD is inferior to that of the MODIS AOD. We attempted to include medium-quality VIIRS AOD data to eliminate this, while exploring its influence on the performance of the VIIRS model. The results show that it improves the spatiotemporal coverage of the VIIRS AOD dramatically especially in winter, although a decline in model accuracy occurred. Compared to the MODIS model, the VIIRS model with both high-quality and medium-quality AOD data performs comparably or even better with respect to some model accuracy evaluation indexes (e.g., the model overfitting degree of the VIIRS and MODIS models are 7.46% and 5.82%, respectively), the potential for capturing high PM2.5 concentrations, and the precision of annual and seasonal PM2.5 estimates. Nevertheless, the VIIRS models did not perform as well as the MODIS model in summer. This study reveals the advantages and disadvantages of the MODIS and VIIRS AOD in simulating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, promoting research on satellite-based PM2.5 estimates.

TI  - Earlier leaf-flushing suppressed ecosystem productivity by draining soil water in the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent earlier greening trends are believed to enhance terrestrial ecosystem productivity. However, advanced onset of growing season may also deplete soil water in early spring, leading to summer water stress for plant growth. In this study, we linked soil moisture with start of growing season (SGS, represented by day of year) to examine the responses of ecosystem productivity to water stress during 1982-2011 on the Mongolian Plateau. Results showed that, though not significant, earlier SGS has tendency to enhance spring productivity at north part of the study area. Nonetheless, we observed that suppressed summer photosynthesis due to phenology-induced water stress dramatically reduced annual carbon assimilation. Thus, phenology-associated changes in soil moisture have profound potential in regulating seasonal and annual productivity in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The relationship between SGS and GPP was not observed in more mesic forest ecosystems (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.10) nor in the agricultural area (R-2 = 0.03, p > 0.10) where practices like irrigation aim to alleviate summer water stress. Therefore, at the scale of the entire study area, earlier growing season did not translate to higher productivity (R-2 = 0.006). On the contrary, advanced SGS aggravated growing-season water stress, which in turn, supressed annual carbon assimilation in water limited area. This mechanism implies the advanced greening trends may not necessarily lead to more carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems but rather a carbon loss, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Near-surface temperature inversion during summer at Summit, Greenland, and its relation to MODIS-derived surface temperatures
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As rapid warming of the Arctic occurs, it is imperative that climate indicators such as temperature be monitored over large areas to understand and predict the effects of climate changes. Temperatures are traditionally tracked using in situ 2m air temperatures and can also be assessed using remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing is especially valuable over the Greenland Ice Sheet, where few ground-based air temperature measurements exist. Because of the presence of surface-based temperature inversions in ice-covered areas, differences between 2m air temperature and the temperature of the actual snow surface (referred to as "skin" temperature) can be significant and are particularly relevant when considering validation and application of remote sensing temperature data. We present results from a field campaign extending from 8 June to 18 July 2015, near Summit Station in Greenland, to study surface temperature using the following measurements: skin temperature measured by an infrared (IR) sensor, 2m air temperature measured by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) meteorological station, and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface temperature product. Our data indicate that 2m air temperature is often significantly higher than snow skin temperature measured in situ, and this finding may account for apparent biases in previous studies of MODIS products that used 2m air temperature for validation. This inversion is present during our study period when incoming solar radiation and wind speed are both low. As compared to our in situ IR skin temperature measurements, after additional cloud masking, the MOD/MYD11 Collection 6 surface temperature standard product has an RMSE of 1.0 degrees C and a mean bias of -0.4 degrees C, spanning a range of temperatures from -35 to -5 degrees C (RMSE = 1.6 degrees C and mean bias = -0.7 degrees C prior to cloud masking). For our study area and time series, MODIS surface temperature products agree with skin surface temperatures better than previous studies indicated, especially at temperatures below -20 degrees C, where other studies found a significant cold bias. We show that the apparent cold bias present in other comparisons of 2m air temperature and MODIS surface temperature may be a result of the near-surface temperature inversion. Further investigation of how in situ IR skin temperatures compare to MODIS surface temperature at lower temperatures (below -35 degrees C) is warranted to determine whether a cold bias exists for those temperatures.

AB  - Background: The performance of a prototype novel digital single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) camera with multiple pixelated CZT detectors and high sensitivity collimators (Digital SPECT; Valiance X12 prototype, Molecular Dynamics) was evaluated in various clinical settings.Images obtained in the prototype system were compared to images from an analog camera fitted with high-resolution collimators. Clinical feasibility, image quality, and diagnostic performance of the prototype were evaluated in 36 SPECT studies in 35 patients including bone (n = 21), brain (n = 5), lung perfusion (n = 3), and parathyroid (n = 3) and one study each of sentinel node and labeled white blood cells. Images were graded on a scale of 1-4 for sharpness, contrast, overall quality, and diagnostic confidence.Results: Digital CZT SPECT provided a statistically significant improvement in sharpness and contrast in clinical cases (mean score of 3.79 +/- 0.61 vs. 3.26 +/- 0.50 and 3.92 +/- 0.29 vs. 3.34 +/- 0.47 respectively, p < 0.001 for both). Overall image quality was slightly higher for the digital SPECT but not statistically significant (3.74 vs. 3.66).Conclusion: CZT SPECT provided significantly improved image sharpness and contrast compared to the analog system in the clinical settings evaluated. Further studies will evaluate the diagnostic performance of the system in large patient cohorts in additional clinical settings.

TI  - Arctic sea ice signatures: L-band brightness temperature sensitivity comparison using two radiation transfer models
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is a crucial component for short-, medium- and long-term numerical weather predictions. Most importantly, changes of sea ice coverage and areas covered by thin sea ice have a large impact on heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere. L-band brightness temperatures from ESA's Earth Explorer SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) have been proven to be a valuable tool to derive thin sea ice thickness. These retrieved estimates were already successfully assimilated in forecasting models to constrain the ice analysis, leading to more accurate initial conditions and subsequently more accurate forecasts. However, the brightness temperature measurements can potentially be assimilated directly in forecasting systems, reducing the data latency and providing a more consistent first guess. As a first step towards such a data assimilation system we studied the forward operator that translates geophysical parameters provided by a model into brightness temperatures. We use two different radiative transfer models to generate top of atmosphere brightness temperatures based on ORAP5 model output for the 2012/2013 winter season. The simulations are then compared against actual SMOS measurements. The results indicate that both models are able to capture the general variability of measured brightness temperatures over sea ice. The simulated brightness temperatures are dominated by sea ice coverage and thickness changes are most pronounced in the marginal ice zone where new sea ice is formed. There we observe the largest differences of more than 20K over sea ice between simulated and observed brightness temperatures. We conclude that the assimilation of SMOS brightness temperatures yields high potential for forecasting models to correct for uncertainties in thin sea ice areas and suggest that information on sea ice fractional coverage from higher-frequency brightness temperatures should be used simultaneously.

TI  - Recent high-resolution Antarctic ice velocity maps reveal increased mass loss in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed Antarctic ice velocity maps from Landsat 8 images for the years 2014 and 2015 at a high spatial resolution (100 m). These maps were assembled from 10,690 scenes of displacement vectors inferred from more than 10,000 optical images acquired from December 2013 through March 2016. We estimated the mass discharge of the Antarctic ice sheet in 2008, 2014, and 2015 using the Landsat ice velocity maps, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-derived ice velocity maps (similar to 2008) available from prior studies, and ice thickness data. An increased mass discharge (53 +/- 14 Gt yr(-1)) was found in the East Indian Ocean sector since 2008 due to unexpected widespread glacial acceleration in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, while the other five oceanic sectors did not exhibit significant changes. However, present-day increased mass loss was found by previous studies predominantly in west Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. The newly discovered increased mass loss in Wilkes Land suggests that the ocean heat flux may already be influencing ice dynamics in the marine-based sector of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS). The marine-based sector could be adversely impacted by ongoing warming in the Southern Ocean, and this process may be conducive to destabilization.

TI  - Deep learning decision fusion for the classification of urban remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor data fusion is one of the most common and popular remote sensing data classification topics by considering a robust and complete description about the objects of interest. Furthermore, deep feature extraction has recently attracted significant interest and has become a hot research topic in the geoscience and remote sensing research community. A deep learning decision fusion approach is presented to perform multisensor urban remote sensing data classification. After deep features are extracted by utilizing joint spectral-spatial information, a soft-decision made classifier is applied to train high-level feature representations and to fine-tune the deep learning framework. Next, a decision-level fusion classifies objects of interest by the joint use of sensors. Finally, a context-aware object-based postprocessing is used to enhance the classification results. A series of comparative experiments are conducted on the widely used dataset of 2014 IEEE GRSS data fusion contest. The obtained results illustrate the considerable advantages of the proposed deep learning decision fusion over the traditional classifiers.

AB  - Vegetation phenology controls the seasonality of many ecosystem processes, as well as numerous biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. Phenology is also highly sensitive to climate change and variability. Here we present a series of datasets, together consisting of almost 750 years of observations, characterizing vegetation phenology in diverse ecosystems across North America. Our data are derived from conventional, visible-wavelength, automated digital camera imagery collected through the PhenoCam network. For each archived image, we extracted RGB (red, green, blue) colour channel information, with means and other statistics calculated across a region-of-interest (ROI) delineating a specific vegetation type. From the high-frequency (typically, 30 min) imagery, we derived time series characterizing vegetation colour, including "canopy greenness", processed to 1- and 3-day intervals. For ecosystems with one or more annual cycles of vegetation activity, we provide estimates, with uncertainties, for the start of the "greenness rising" and end of the "greenness falling" stages. The database can be used for phenological model validation and development, evaluation of satellite remote sensing data products, benchmarking earth system models, and studies of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Altimetry, gravimetry, GPS and viscoelastic modeling data for the joint inversion for glacial isostatic adjustment in Antarctica (ESA STSE Project REGINA)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The poorly known correction for the ongoing deformation of the solid Earth caused by glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is a major uncertainty in determining the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet from measurements of satellite gravimetry and to a lesser extent satellite altimetry. In the past decade, much progress has been made in consistently modeling ice sheet and solid Earth interactions; however, forward-modeling solutions of GIA in Antarctica remain uncertain due to the sparsity of constraints on the ice sheet evolution, as well as the Earth's rheological properties. An alternative approach towards estimating GIA is the joint inversion of multiple satellite data - namely, satellite gravimetry, satellite altimetry and GPS, which reflect, with different sensitivities, trends in recent glacial changes and GIA. Crucial to the success of this approach is the accuracy of the space-geodetic data sets. Here, we present reprocessed rates of surface-ice elevation change (Envisat/Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, ICESat; 2003-2009), gravity field change (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE; 2003-2009) and bedrock uplift (GPS; 1995-2013). The data analysis is complemented by the forward modeling of viscoelastic response functions to disc load forcing, allowing us to relate GIA-induced surface displacements with gravity changes for different rheological parameters of the solid Earth. The data and modeling results presented here are available in the PANGAEA database (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.875745). The data sets are the input streams for the joint inversion estimate of present-day ice-mass change and GIA, focusing on Antarctica. However, the methods, code and data provided in this paper can be used to solve other problems, such as volume balances of the Antarctic ice sheet, or can be applied to other geographical regions in the case of the viscoelastic response functions. This paper presents the first of two contributions summarizing the work carried out within a European Space Agency funded study: Regional glacial isostatic adjustment and CryoSat elevation rate corrections in Antarctica (REGINA).

TI  - Seasonal evolution of soil and plant parameters on the agricultural Gebesee test site: a database for the set-up and validation of EO-LDAS and satellite-aided retrieval models
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground reference data are a prerequisite for the calibration, update, and validation of retrieval models facilitating the monitoring of land parameters based on Earth Observation data. Here, we describe the acquisition of a comprehensive ground reference database which was created to test and validate the recently developed Earth Observation Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS) and products derived from remote sensing observations in the visible and infrared range. In situ data were collected for seven crop types (winter barley, winter wheat, spring wheat, durum, winter rape, potato, and sugar beet) cultivated on the agricultural Gebesee test site, central Germany, in 2013 and 2014. The database contains information on hyperspectral surface reflectance factors, the evolution of biophysical and biochemical plant parameters, phenology, surface conditions, atmospheric states, and a set of ground control points. Ground reference data were gathered at an approximately weekly resolution and on different spatial scales to investigate variations within and between acreages. In situ data collected less than 1 day apart from satellite acquisitions (RapidEye, SPOT 5, Landsat-7 and -8) with a cloud coverage <= 25% are available for 10 and 15 days in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The measurements show that the investigated growing seasons were characterized by distinct meteorological conditions causing interannual variations in the parameter evolution. Here, the experimental design of the field campaigns, and methods employed in the determination of all parameters, are described in detail. Insights into the database are provided and potential fields of application are discussed. The data will contribute to a further development of crop monitoring methods based on remote sensing techniques. The database is freely available at PANGAEA (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.874251).

TI  - Prevalence of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> delayed clearance associated polymorphisms in adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (<i>pfap2mu</i>) and ubiquitin specific protease 1 (<i>pfubp1</i>) genes in Ghanaian isolates
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Plasmodium falciparum delayed clearance with the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACTs) has been reported in some African countries. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes, P. falciparum adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (pfap2mu) and ubiquitin specific protease 1 (pfubp1), have been linked to delayed clearance with ACT use in Kenya and recurrent imported malaria in Britain. With over 12 years of ACT use in Ghana, this study investigated the prevalence of SNPs in the pfap2mu and pfubp1 in Ghanaian clinical P. falciparum isolates to provide baseline data for antimalarial drug resistance surveillance in the country.Methods: Filter paper blood blots collected in 2015-2016 from children aged below 9 years presenting with uncomplicated malaria at hospitals in three sentinel sites Begoro, Cape Coast and Navrongo were used. Parasite DNA was extracted from 120 samples followed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). Sanger sequencing was performed to detect and identify SNPs in pfap2mu and pfubp1 genes.Results: In all, 11.1% (9/81) of the isolates carried the wildtype genotypes for both genes. A total of 164 pfap2mu mutations were detected in 67 isolates whilst 271 pfubp1 mutations were observed in 72 isolates. The majority of the mutations were non-synonymous (NS): 78% (128/164) for pfap2mu and 92.3% (250/271) for pfubp1. Five unique samples had a total of 215 pfap2mu SNPs, ranging between 15 and 63 SNPs per sample. Genotypes reportedly associated with ART resistance detected in this study included pfap2mu S160N (7.4%, 6/81) and pfubp1 E1528D (7.4%, 6/81) as well as D1525E (4.9%, 4/81). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of the SNPs between the three ecologically distinct study sites (pfap2mu: chi(2) = 6.905, df = 2, P = 0.546; pfubp1: chi(2) = 4.883, df = 2, P = 0.769).Conclusions: The detection of pfap2mu and pfubp1 genotypes associated with ACT delayed parasite clearance is evidence of gradual nascent emergence of resistance in Ghana. The results will serve as baseline data for surveillance and the selection of the genotypes with drug pressure over time. The pfap2mu S160N, pfubp1 E1528D and D1525E must be monitored in Ghanaian isolates in ACT susceptibility studies, especially when cure rates of ACTs, particularly AL, is less than 100%.

TI  - Predictive factors for sentinel node metastases in primary invasive breast cancer: a population-based cohort study of 2552 consecutive patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine predictive factors for metastasis to sentinel node (SN) in primary invasive breast cancer.Method: This is a study of 3979 patients with primary breast cancer during 2008-2013 in Malmo and Lund scheduled for surgery and included in the information retrieved from Information Network for Cancer Care (INCA). The final study population included 2552 patients with primary invasive breast cancer. The risk of metastases to SN were examined in relation to potential clinicopathological factors such as age, screening mammography, tumor size, tumor type, histological grade, estrogen status, progesterone status, Her-2 status, multifocality, and lymphovascular invasion. Binary logistic regression was used; adjusted analyses yielded odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval.Results: Tumors detected by mammography screening were less likely to be associated with metastases to SN compared to those not found by mammography screening (0.63; 0.51-0.80). Negative hormonal status for estrogen associated with lower risk for SN metastases compared to tumor with positive estrogen status (0.64; 0.42-0.99). Tumors with a size more than 20 mm had higher risk to metastasize to SN (1.84; 1.47-2.33) compared to tumors less than 20 mm. Multifocality (1.90; 1.45-2.47) and lymphovascular invasion (3.74; 2.66-5.27) were also strong predictive factors for SN metastases.Conclusion: SN metastasis is less likely to occur in women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed by screening mammogram. Tumors with negative estrogen status are associated with low risk for SN metastases. Tumors larger than 20 mm, multifocality, or lymphovascular invasion are also factors associated with high risk for SN metastases.

TI  - Dynamic Change Characteristics and Its Dominant Influencing Factors of Secchi Disk Depth in Coastal and Inland Waters
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on mass bio-optical data from Taihu Lake, Poyang Lake, Pearl River Estuary and Daya Bay, we propose a method called Secchi disk depth (SD_H) to evaluate the water transparency. The method is applied to the new generation water color satellite sensor Suomi NPP VIIRS. The dynamic change characteristics of water transparency arc revealed. We analyze the dominant influencing factors of transparency in different waters, compare the transparency products of VIIRS and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Pearl River Estuary, and discuss their water environmental monitoring capacity. The results show that the SD_H model constructed based on VIIRS at 988, 555, 672 nm is suitable for water investigation, which can explain 799 of the transparency variation. We apply the proposed model to VIIRS satellite remote sensing images after pretreatment, and get the spatial distribution characteristics of water transparency in Taihu Lake, Poyang Lake, Pearl River Estuary and Daya Bay. Compared to phytoplankton, the suspended sediments and chromophoric dissolved organic matter arc the dominant factors influencing the Secchi disk depth in coastal and inland waters. Transparency products of VIIRS and MODIS arc consistent in space. However, the transparency product of VIIRS has a better spatial resolution and a stronger environmental monitoring ability.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (Cox A16) in Guangdong province from 2012 to 2016. Methods: The data of mild HFMD cases caused by Cox A16 were collected from 8 sentinel hospitals in 8 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong to estimate Cox A16 infection status and its population and time distribution characteristics. Results: (1) The highest estimated incidence of Cox A16 infection was in 2014 (113.0/100 000), followed by 2016 (86.4/100 000) and 2012 (79.1/100 000), while the estimated incidence was lower in 2015 (29.0/100 000) and 2013 (28.8/100 000). (2) Cox A16 was confirmed to be the predominant pathogen causing HFMD outbreaks (54.6%, 89/163). The number of outbreaks in the year with high incidence (28 outbreaks) was 11.2 times higher than that in the year with low incidence (2.5 outbreaks). (3) Across all age groups, the annual estimated incidence of Cox A16 infection decreased with age (trend chi(2)=853 905.63, P<0.01). The incidence was highest in age group 1 year (1 449.2/100 000), followed by that in age group 3 years (1 097.0/100 000), in age group 2 years (1 083.5/100 000), in age group 4 years (687.8/100 000) and in age group 0 year (604.9/100 000). Among the age groups <12 months, the estimated incidence increased with age (trend chi(2)=5 541.77, P<0.01), which was highest in age group 11-months (2 105.1/100 000), followed by that in age groups 10-months (1 448.6/100 000), 9-months (938.3/100 000), 8-months (703.3/100 000) and 6-months (664.6/100 000). (4) The annual incidence peak was during May (143.9/100 000)-June (131.5/100 000). Conclusion: The prevalence of Cox A16 infection differed with year in Guangdong during 2012-2016. When the incidence of Cox A16 infection was high, more outbreaks occurred. The prevalence occurred mainly in nurseries and kindergartens from May to June each year. Children aged 0-4 years were the high risk group for Cox A16 infection, children aged 6-11 months were at high risk for Cox A16 infection.

TI  - Characterizing the responses of vegetation to climate change in the Tibet Plateau using remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to investigate the changes in vegetation and its response to climate change in Tibet due to the sensitivity and vulnerability of the area to climate change. The spatiotemporal pattern of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its trends between 2001 and 2015 were depicted using NDVI from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The responses of vegetation to climatic variables were analyzed through linear regression and correlation analysis with tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data. The results showed that (1) the average annual NDVI gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest in accordance with the variations in LST and precipitation, (2) the annual NDVI increased from 2001 to 2015 at a rate of 0.3 x 10(-3) per year. The LST exhibited an average annual increase of 0.05 degrees C while precipitation remained relatively stable, (3) the correlation between NDVI and precipitation was positive in the central region, whereas it became negative in the southeast and northeast. The correlation between NDVI and LST was opposite of that between NDVI and precipitation, and (4) the increases in NDVI in the tropical monsoon rain forest and rain forest, subalpine coniferous forest, and alpine meadow vegetation types in the southeast depended more on LST than precipitation. In contrast, the increases in NDVI responded strongly to precipitation in the alpine bush and meadow, alpine grassland, alpine desert, and alpine desert steppe vegetation types in the northwest.

TI  - Integration of ground-based radar and satellite InSAR data for the analysis of an unexpected slope failure in an open-pit mine
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On 17 November 2016, an unexpected slope failure occurred in an undisclosed copper open-pit mine. The nature of the event urged for a thorough back-analysis of slope monitoring data in order to assess its size and temporal evolution, and to determine whether precursors potentially able to anticipate the failure were present. To this aim, satellite InSAR data spanning over the final 9 months before the event were, in retrospect, acquired and coupled with measurements from a ground-based radar that was in use at the time of the failure. Although progressive deformation was detected by the ground-based radar in correspondence of the two uppermost benches in the pit, the satellite InSAR data revealed that the vast majority of the instability actually involved a large part of natural slope above the mine crest. This sector was not visible by the ground-based radar. Thanks to the short revisit time of the Sentinel-1 mission, clear slope accelerating creep was observed for the first time in satellite InSAR measurements over an open-pit mine. The delimitation of the area featuring accelerating creep behavior matched remarkably the source area of the failure as mapped in the field after the event. Considerations on the volume of the instability and on the development of the failure process (both in space and time) were consequently derived. The results provided a clear example of the value of jointly using ground-based and satellite interferometry to reduce the uncertainties inherent to the identification and characterization of impending catastrophic slope failures.

TI  - Integrative image segmentation optimization and machine learning approach for high quality land-use and land-cover mapping using multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing use of optimization for geographic object-based image analysis and the possibility to derive a wide range of information about the image in textual form makes machine learning (data mining) a versatile tool for information extraction from multiple data sources. This paper presents application of data mining for land-cover classification by fusing SPOT-6, RADARSAT-2, and derived dataset. First, the images and other derived indices (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and soil adjusted vegetation index) were combined and subjected to segmentation process with optimal segmentation parameters obtained using combination of spatial and Taguchi statistical optimization. The image objects, which carry all the attributes of the input datasets, were extracted and related to the target land-cover classes through data mining algorithms (decision tree) for classification. To evaluate the performance, the result was compared with two nonparametric classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Furthermore, the decision tree classification result was evaluated against six unoptimized trials segmented using arbitrary parameter combinations. The result shows that the optimized process produces better land-use land-cover classification with overall classification accuracy of 91.79%, 87.25%, and 88.69% for SVM and RF, respectively, while the results of the six unoptimized classifications yield overall accuracy between 84.44% and 88.08%. Higher accuracy of the optimized data mining classification approach compared to the unoptimized results indicates that the optimization process has significant impact on the classification quality.

TI  - The efficacy of sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green in cervical cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node metastasis is a significant predictive factor for disease recurrence and survival in cervical cancer patients. Given the importance of lymph node metastasis, it is imperative that patients harboring metastasis are identified and can undergo appropriate treatment. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has drawn attention as a lymph node mapping technique. We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of (SLN) mapping using indocyanine green (ICG) in cervical cancer.Methods: We performed a single-center, retrospective study of 103 surgically treated cervical cancer patients who underwent SLN mapping. After using ICG to detect SLN during surgery, we removed the SLNs followed by laparoscopic or robotic-assisted radical surgery and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.Results: Stage IB1 was the most common (61.17%). At least one SLN was detected in all cases. Eighty-eight patients (85.44%) had bilateral pelvic SLNs. The mean number of SLN per patient was 2.34. The side-specific sensitivity was 71.43%, the specificity was 100%, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.98%, and the false negative rate (FNR) was 28.57%. In cases of tumors smaller than 2 cm with negative lymph node metastasis on imaging, the study revealed a side-specific sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 100%, a NPV of 100%, and a FNR of 0%. Large tumor size (>= 4 cm), a previous history of a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), depth of invasion (>= 50%), the microscopic parametrial (PM) invasion, and vaginal extension were significantly associated with the false-negative detection of SLN. Moreover, the microscopic PM invasion was the only risk factor of the false-negative detection of SLN in multivariate analysis.Conclusion: SLN mapping with ICG in cervical cancer is feasible and has high detection rate. The sensitivity of 100% was high enough to perform SLN biopsy alone in an early stage in which the tumor is less than 2 cm, with no lymphadenopathy on image examination. However, for large or invasive tumors, we would have to be cautious about performing SLN biopsy alone.

TI  - Using SAR satellite data time series for regional glacier mapping
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With dense SAR satellite data time series it is possible to map surface and subsurface glacier properties that vary in time. On Sentinel-1A and RADARSAT-2 backscatter time series images over mainland Norway and Svalbard, we outline how to map glaciers using descriptive methods. We present five application scenarios. The first shows potential for tracking transient snow lines with SAR backscatter time series and correlates with both optical satellite images (Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8) and equilibrium line altitudes derived from in situ surface mass balance data. In the second application scenario, time series representation of glacier facies corresponding to SAR glacier zones shows potential for a more accurate delineation of the zones and how they change in time. The third application scenario investigates the firn evolution using dense SAR backscatter time series together with a coupled energy balance and multilayer firn model. We find strong correlation between backscatter signals with both the modeled firn air content and modeled wetness in the firn. In the fourth application scenario, we highlight how winter rain events can be detected in SAR time series, revealing important information about the area extent of internal accumulation. In the last application scenario, averaged summer SAR images were found to have potential in assisting the process of mapping glaciers outlines, especially in the presence of seasonal snow. Altogether we present examples of how to map glaciers and to further understand glaciological processes using the existing and future massive amount of multi-sensor time series data.

TI  - Linking influenza epidemic onsets to covariates at different scales using a dynamical model
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evaluating the factors favoring the onset of influenza epidemics is a critical public health issue for surveillance, prevention and control. While past outbreaks provide important insights for understanding epidemic onsets, their statistical analysis is challenging since the impact of a factor can be viewed at different scales. Indeed, the same factor can explain why epidemics are more likely to begin (i) during particular weeks of the year (global scale); (ii) earlier in particular regions (spatial scale) or years (annual scale) than others and (iii) earlier in some years than others within a region (spatiotemporal scale).Methods: Here, we present a statistical approach based on dynamical modeling of infectious diseases to study epidemic onsets. We propose a method to disentangle the role of covariates at different scales and use a permutation procedure to assess their significance. Epidemic data gathered from 18 French regions over six epidemic years were provided by the Regional Influenza Surveillance Group (GROG) sentinel network.Results: Our results failed to highlight a significant impact of mobility flows on epidemic onset dates. Absolute humidity had a significant impact, but only at the spatial scale. No link between demographic covariates and influenza epidemic onset dates could be established.Discussion: Dynamical modeling presents an interesting basis to analyze spatiotemporal variations in the outcome of epidemic onsets and how they are related to various types of covariates. The use of these models is quite complex however, due to their mathematical complexity. Furthermore, because they attempt to integrate migration processes of the virus, such models have to be much more explicit than pure statistical approaches. We discuss the relation of this approach to survival analysis, which present significant differences but may constitute an interesting alternative for non-methodologists.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory predictors of influenza infection among individuals with influenza-like illness presenting to an urban Thai hospital over a five-year period
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early diagnosis of influenza infection maximizes the effectiveness of antiviral medicines. Here, we assess the ability for clinical characteristics and rapid influenza tests to predict PCR-confirmed influenza infection in a sentinel, cross-sectional study for influenza-like illness (ILI) in Thailand. Participants meeting criteria for acute ILI (fever >38 degrees C and cough or sore throat) were recruited from inpatient and outpatient departments in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2009-2014. The primary endpoint for the study was the occurrence of virologically-confirmed influenza infection (based upon detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR) among individuals presenting for care with ILI. Nasal and throat swabs were tested by rapid influenza test (QuickVue) and by RT-PCR. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using the case test-negative method. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to predict influenza RT-PCR positivity based upon symptoms reported. We enrolled 4572 individuals with ILI; 32.7% had detectable influenza RNA by RT-PCR. Influenza cases were attributable to influenza B (38.6%), A(H1N1) pdm09 (35.1%), and A(H3N2) (26.3%) viruses. VE was highest against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus and among adults. The most important symptoms for predicting influenza PCR-positivity among patients with ILI were cough, runny nose, chills, and body aches. The accuracy of the CART predictive model was 72.8%, with an NPV of 78.1% and a PPV of 59.7%. During epidemic periods, PPV improved to 68.5%. The PPV of the QuickVue assay relative to RT-PCR was 93.0% overall, with peak performance during epidemic periods and in the absence of oseltamivir treatment. Clinical criteria demonstrated poor predictive capability outside of epidemic periods while rapid tests were reasonably accurate and may provide an acceptable alternative to RT-PCR testing in resource-limited areas.

TI  - Real-time predictive seasonal influenza model in Catalonia, Spain
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza surveillance is critical to monitoring the situation during epidemic seasons and predictive mathematic models may aid the early detection of epidemic patterns. The objective of this study was to design a real-time spatial predictive model of ILI (Influenza Like Illness) incidence rate in Catalonia using one- and two-week forecasts. The available data sources used to select explanatory variables to include in the model were the statutory reporting disease system and the sentinel surveillance system in Catalonia for influenza incidence rates, the official climate service in Catalonia for meteorological data, laboratory data and Google Flu Trend. Time series for every explanatory variable with data from the last 4 seasons (from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014) was created. A pilot test was conducted during the 2014-2015 season to select the explanatory variables to be included in the model and the type of model to be applied. During the 2015-2016 season a real-time model was applied weekly, obtaining the intensity level and predicted incidence rates with 95% confidence levels one and two weeks away for each health region. At the end of the season, the confidence interval success rate (CISR) and intensity level success rate (ILSR) were analysed. For the 2015-2016 season a CISR of 85.3% at one week and 87.1% at two weeks and an ILSR of 82.9% and 82% were observed, respectively. The model described is a useful tool although it is hard to evaluate due to uncertainty. The accuracy of prediction at one and two weeks was above 80% globally, but was lower during the peak epidemic period. In order to improve the predictive power, new explanatory variables should be included.

TI  - Context adaptive panchromatic band simulation and detail injection for image pansharpening
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - General component substitution (CS) pansharpening methods establish a global model over the whole image plane and may lead to unexpected spectral distortion. This paper proposes a context adaptive CS pansharpening method, which features a totally localbased processing procedure. The method consists of two processing blocks. The first block is to simulate a low-resolution panchromatic band by a local linear regression model between panchromatic and multispectral bands. The second block extracts spatial details and adds details back to multispectral bands in locally varying ratios. By recasting the local linear regression model into the guided filtering framework and analyzing the implicit statistical assumptions underlying CS methods, the strengths of the local-based pansharpening algorithm are addressed. Experiments test 7 pairs of images acquired from different sensors, such as GF-2, Quickbird, and Worldview-2. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal that the presented method can better preserve the spectral information than some state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Regression and Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Melanoma Progression
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the role of regression and other clinical and histological features for the prognosis and the progression of cutaneous melanoma.Material/Methods: Between 2005 and 2016, 403 patients with melanoma were treated and followed at our Department of Dermatology. Of the 403 patients, 173 patients had cutaneous melanoma and underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and thus were included in this study.Results: Histological regression was found in 37 cases of melanoma (21.3%). It was significantly associated with marked and moderate tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and with negative SLN. Progression of the disease occurred in 42 patients (24.2%). On multivariate analysis, we found that a positive lymph node and a Breslow index higher than 2 mm were independent variables associated with disease free survival (DFS). These variables together with a mild TIL were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). The presence of regression was not associated with DFS or OS.Conclusions: We could not demonstrate an association between regression and the outcome of patients with cutaneous melanoma. Tumor thickness greater than 2 mm and a positive SLN were associated with recurrence. Survival was influenced by a Breslow thickness > 2 mm, the presence of a mild TIL and a positive SLN status.

TI  - Model simulations of the chemical and aerosol microphysical evolution of the Sarychev Peak 2009 eruption cloud compared to in situ and satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions impact climate through the injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is oxidized to form sulfuric acid aerosol particles that can enhance the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD). Besides large-magnitude eruptions, moderate-magnitude eruptions such as Kasatochi in 2008 and Sarychev Peak in 2009 can have a significant impact on stratospheric aerosol and hence climate. However, uncertainties remain in quantifying the atmospheric and climatic impacts of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption due to limitations in previous model representations of volcanic aerosol microphysics and particle size, whilst biases have been identified in satellite estimates of post-eruption SAOD. In addition, the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption co-injected hydrogen chloride (HCl) alongside SO2, whose potential stratospheric chemistry impacts have not been investigated to date. We present a study of the stratospheric SO2-particle-HCl processing and impacts following Sarychev Peak eruption, using the Community Earth System Model version 1.0 (CESM1) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) -Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) sectional aerosol microphysics model (with no a priori assumption on particle size). The Sarychev Peak 2009 eruption injected 0.9 Tg of SO2 into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS),enhancing the aerosol load in the Northern Hemisphere. The post-eruption evolution of the volcanic SO2 in space and time are well reproduced by the model when compared to Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite data. Co-injection of 27 GgHCl causes a lengthening of the SO2 lifetime and a slight delay in the formation of aerosols, and acts to enhance the destruction of stratospheric ozone and mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) compared to the simulation with volcanic SO2 only. We therefore highlight the need to account for volcanic halogen chemistry when simulating the impact of eruptions such as Sarychev on stratospheric chemistry. The model-simulated evolution of effective radius (r(eff)) reflects new particle formation followed by particle growth that enhances r(eff) to reach up to 0.2 mu m on zonal average. Comparisons of the model-simulated particle number and size distributions to balloon-borne in situ stratospheric observations over Kiruna, Sweden, in August and September 2009, and over Laramie, USA, in June and November 2009 show good agreement and quantitatively confirm the post-eruption particle enhancement. We show that the model-simulated SAOD is consistent with that derived from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) when both the saturation bias of OSIRIS and the fact that extinction profiles may terminate well above the tropopause are taken into account. Previous modelling studies (involving assumptions on particle size) that reported agreement with (biased) post-eruption estimates of SAOD derived from OSIRIS likely underestimated the climate impact of the 2009 Sarychev Peak eruption.

TI  - Direct Detection of Unamplified Pathogen RNA in Blood Lysate using an Integrated Lab-in-a-Stick Device and Ultrabright SERS Nanorattles
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct detection of genetic biomarkers in body fluid lysate without target amplification will revolutionize nucleic acid-based diagnostics. However, the low concentration of target sequences makes this goal challenging. We report a method for direct detection of pathogen RNA in blood lysate using a bioassay using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based detection integrated in a "lab-in-a-stick" portable device. Two levels of signal enhancement were employed to achieve the sensitivity required for direct detection. Each target sequence was tagged with an ultrabright SERS-encoded nanorattle with ultrahigh SERS signals, and these tagged target sequences were concentrated into a focused spot for detection using hybridization sandwiches with magnetic microbeads. Furthermore, the washing process was automated by integration into a "lab-in-a-stick" portable device. We could directly detect synthetic target with a limit of detection of 200 fM. More importantly, we detected plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite RNA directly in infected red blood cells lysate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SERS-based direct detection of pathogen nucleic acid in blood lysate without nucleic acid extraction or target amplification. The results show the potential of our integrated bioassay for field use and point-of-care diagnostics.

TI  - Climate-related variation in plant peak biomass and growth phenology across Pacific Northwest tidal marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interannual variability of tidal marsh plant phenology is largely unknown and may have important ecological consequences. Marsh plants are critical to the biogeomorphic feedback processes that build estuarine soils, maintain marsh elevation relative to sea level, and sequester carbon. We calculated Tasseled Cap Greenness, a metric of plant biomass, using remotely sensed data available in the Landsat archive to assess how recent climate variation has affected biomass production and plant phenology across three maritime tidal marshes in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. First, we used clipped vegetation plots at one of our sites to confirm that tasseled cap greenness provided a useful measure of aboveground biomass (r(2) = 0.72). We then used multiple measures of biomass each growing season over 20-25 years per study site and developed models to test how peak biomass and the date of peak biomass varied with 94 climate and sea-level metrics using generalized linear models and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) model selection. Peak biomass was positively related to total annual precipitation, while the best predictor for date of peak biomass was average growing season temperature, with the peak 7.2 days earlier per degree C. Our study provides insight into how plants in maritime tidal marshes respond to interannual climate variation and demonstrates the utility of time-series remote sensing data to assess ecological responses to climate stressors.

TI  - Multi-temporal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in a macro tidal river Plume (the Gironde) as observed by satellite data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gironde River plume area is unique in terms of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) dynamics. Multiple factors contribute to the variations of SPM at multiple time scales, from river outputs to wind stress, currents and tidal cycles. The formation and evolution of the Maximum Turbidity Zone (MTZ) inside the estuary also plays a significant role. Thus, detailed analyses and monitoring of the region is important for better understanding the mechanisms governing the turbid plume dynamics, for proper future management and monitoring of SPM export from the estuary to the coastal ocean. In this study we use an unprecedented volume of satellite data to capture and better understand the dynamics of the river plume. We combine two types of satellite information in order to achieve these goals: data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensors. The integrated information allows accounting for multiple time scales, i.e. from seasonal to diurnal cycles. We show and parameterize the overall effects of river discharge rates over the plume extension. Seasonal variations are also analyzed and an overall relationship between river discharge rates and plume magnitude is computed. For the first time, we clearly observe and explain the diurnal cycle of SPM dynamics in the river plume. Despite the limited capabilities of the SEVIRI sensor, geostationary data was successfully used to derive such information and results similar to in-situ datasets were obtained. The same patterns are observed, with significant increase in SPM plume during spring/ebb tide periods. Results from our study can be further used to refine sediment transport models and to gain a better perspective on the ecological implications of the sediment output in the continental shelf area.

TI  - Climate effects on vegetation vitality at the treeline of boreal forests of Mongolia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern Mongolia, at the southern boundary of the Siberian boreal forest belt, the distribution of steppe and forest is generally linked to climate and topography, making this region highly sensitive to climate change and human impact. Detailed investigations on the limiting parameters of forest and steppe in different biomes provide necessary information for paleoenvironmental reconstruction and prognosis of potential landscape change. In this study, remote sensing data and gridded climate data were analyzed in order to identify main distribution patterns of forest and steppe in Mongolia and to detect environmental factors driving forest development. Forest distribution and vegetation vitality derived from the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) were investigated for the three types of boreal forest present in Mongolia (taiga, subtaiga and forest-steppe), which cover a total area of 73 818 km(2). In addition to the forest type areas, the analysis focused on subunits of forest and nonforested areas at the upper and lower treeline, which represent ecological borders between vegetation types. Climate and NDVI data were analyzed for a reference period of 15 years from 1999 to 2013.The presented approach for treeline delineation by identifying representative sites mostly bridges local forest disturbances like fire or tree cutting. Moreover, this procedure provides a valuable tool to distinguish the potential forested area. The upper treeline generally rises from 1800 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in the northeast to 2700 ma.s.l. in the south. The lower treeline locally emerges at 1000 ma.s.l. in the northern taiga and rises southward to 2500 ma.s.l. The latitudinal gradient of both treelines turns into a longitudinal one on the eastern flank of mountain ranges due to higher aridity caused by rain-shadow effects. Less productive trees in terms of NDVI were identified at both the upper and lower treeline in relation to the respective total boreal forest type area. The mean growing season temperature (MGST) of 7.9-8.9 degrees C and a minimum MGST of 6 degrees C are limiting parameters at the upper treeline but are negligible for the lower treeline. The minimum of the mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 230-290 mm yr(-1) is a limiting parameter at the lower treeline but also at the upper treeline in the forest-steppe ecotone. In general, NDVI and MAP are lower in grassland, and MGST is higher compared to the corresponding boreal forest. One exception occurs at the upper treeline of the subtaiga and taiga, where the alpine vegetation consists of mountain meadow mixed with shrubs. The relation between NDVI and climate data corroborates that more precipitation and higher temperatures generally lead to higher greenness in all ecological subunits. MGST is positively correlated with MAP of the total area of forest-steppe, but this correlation turns negative in the taiga. The limiting factor in the forest-steppe is the relative humidity and in the taiga it is the snow cover distribution. The subtaiga represents an ecological transition zone of approximately 300 mm yr(-1) precipitation, which occurs independently from the MGST.Since the treelines are mainly determined by climatic parameters, the rapid climate change in inner Asia will lead to a spatial relocation of tree communities, treelines and boreal forest types. However, a direct deduction of future tree vitality, forest composition and biomass trends from the recent relationships between NDVI and climate parameters is challenging. Besides human impact, it must consider bio-and geoecological issues like, for example, tree rejuvenation, temporal lag of climate adaptation and disappearing permafrost.

TI  - Towards an assessment of riverine dissolved organic carbon in surface waters of the western Arctic Ocean based on remote sensing and biogeochemical modeling
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Future climate warming of the Arctic could potentially enhance the load of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) of Arctic rivers due to increased carbon mobilization within watersheds. A greater flux of tDOC might impact the biogeochemical processes of the coastal Arctic Ocean (AO) and ultimately its capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2. In this study, we show that sea-surface tDOC concentrations simulated by a physical-biogeochemical coupled model in the Canadian Beaufort Sea for 2003-2011 compare favorably with estimates retrieved by satellite imagery. Our results suggest that, over spring-summer, tDOC of riverine origin contributes to 35% of primary production and that an equivalent of similar to 10% of tDOC is exported westwards with the potential of fueling the biological production of the eastern Alaskan nearshore waters. The combination of model and satellite data provides promising results to extend this work to the entire AO so as to quantify, in conjunction with in situ data, the expected changes in tDOC fluxes and their potential impact on the AO biogeochemistry at basin scale.

TI  - An initial ULF wave index derived from 2 years of Swarm observations
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing Swarm satellite mission provides an opportunity for better knowledge of the near-Earth electromagnetic environment. Herein, we use a new methodological approach for the detection and classification of ultra low-frequency (ULF) wave events observed by Swarm based on an existing time-frequency analysis (TFA) tool and utilizing a state-of-the-art high-resolution magnetic field model and Swarm Level 2 products (i.e., field-aligned currents - FACs - and the Ionospheric Bubble Index - IBI). We present maps of the dependence of ULF wave power with magnetic latitude and magnetic local time (MLT) as well as geographic latitude and longitude from the three satellites at their different locations in low-Earth orbit (LEO) for a period spanning 2 years after the constellation's final configuration. We show that the inclusion of the Swarm single-spacecraft FAC product in our analysis eliminates all the wave activity at high altitudes, which is physically unrealistic. Moreover, we derive a Swarm orbit-by-orbit Pc3 wave (20-100 MHz) index for the topside ionosphere and compare its values with the corresponding variations of solar wind variables and geomagnetic activity indices. This is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to derive a ULF wave index from LEO satellite data. The technique can be potentially used to define a new Level 2 product from the mission, the Swarm ULF wave index, which would be suitable for space weather applications.

TI  - Improving salt marsh digital elevation model accuracy with full-waveform lidar and nonparametric predictive modeling
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marsh vegetation tends to increase vertical uncertainty in light detection and ranging (lidar) derived elevation data, often causing the data to become ineffective for analysis of topographic features governing tidal inundation or vegetation zonation. Previous attempts at improving lidar data collected in salt marsh environments range from simply computing and subtracting the global elevation bias to more complex methods such as computing vegetation-specific, constant correction factors. The vegetation specific corrections can be used along with an existing habitat map to apply separate corrections to different areas within a study site. It is hypothesized here that correcting salt marsh lidar data by applying location-specific, point-by-point corrections, which are computed from lidar waveform-derived features, tidal-datum based elevation, distance from shoreline and other lidar digital elevation model based variables, using nonparametric regression will produce better results. The methods were developed and tested using full-waveform lidar and ground truth for three marshes in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, U.S.A. Five different model algorithms for nonparametric regression were evaluated, with TreeNet's stochastic gradient boosting algorithm consistently producing better regression and classification results. Additionally, models were constructed to predict the vegetative zone (high marsh and low marsh). The predictive modeling methods used in this study estimated ground elevation with a mean bias of 0.00 m and a standard deviation of 0.07 m (0.07 m root mean square error). These methods appear very promising for correction of salt marsh lidar data and, importantly, do not require an existing habitat map, biomass measurements, or image based remote sensing data such as multi/hyperspectral imagery.

TI  - An operational wave forecasting system for the east coast of India
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Demand for operational ocean state forecasting is increasing, owing to the ever-increasing marine activities in the context of blue economy. In the present study, an operational wave forecasting system for the east coast of India is proposed using unstructured Simulating WAves Nearshore model (UNSWAN). This modelling system uses very high resolution mesh near the Indian east coast and coarse resolution offshore, and thus avoids the necessity of nesting with a global wave model. The model is forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) winds and simulates wave parameters and wave spectra for the next 3 days. The spatial pictures of satellite data overlaid on simulated wave height show that the model is capable of simulating the significant wave heights and their gradients realistically. Spectral validation has been done using the available data to prove the reliability of the model. To further evaluate the model performance, the wave forecast for the entire year 2014 is evaluated against buoy measurements over the region at 4 waverider buoy locations. Seasonal analysis of significant wave height (Hs) at the four locations showed that the correlation between the modelled and observed was the highest (in the range 0.78-0.96) during the post-monsoon season. The variability of Hs was also the highest during this season at all locations. The error statistics showed clear seasonal and geographical location dependence. The root mean square error at Visakhapatnam was the same (0.25) for all seasons, but it was the smallest for pre-monsoon season (0.12 m and 0.17 m) for Puducherry and Gopalpur. The wind sea component showed higher variability compared to the corresponding swell component in all locations and for all seasons. The variability was picked by the model to a reasonable level in most of the cases. The results of statistical analysis show that the modelling system is suitable for use in the operational scenario.

TI  - Geotechnology in the analysis of forest fragments in northern Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture implantation fragments and reduces the Amazonian forest area. The objective was to quantify landscape changes in 1985, 2000 and 2015 in northern Mato Grosso, Brazil. The study was carried out in three scenes obtained by the LANDSAT satellite of a microbasin (2742.33 ha) in the municipality of Alta Floresta. Forest, water bodies, pasture and exposed soil were the thematic classes determined to e mapping the land use evolution. The edge, density and shape indexes of the fragments were measured. Normalized vegetation difference (NDVI) values were high in 1985. Land use and occupation over 15 years (1985-2000) reduced forest cover by 69.8%, but it increased by 1.7% over the next 15 years (2000-2015). The number of exposed soil patches increased between the periods, but the total area and number of the patches of the forest fragments decreased. The high values of NDVI in 1985 showed vegetated areas with high density. Reducing forest cover decreases the size of the fragments, increases the isolation and the number of soil patches exposed. The mapping of land use showed a reduction of the Amazon forest in the microbasin in the north of Mato Grosso, in the years 2000 and 2015 compared to 1985.

TI  - Multi-modal survey of Adelie penguin mega-colonies reveals the Danger Islands as a seabird hotspot
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite concerted international effort to track and interpret shifts in the abundance and distribution of Adelie penguins, large populations continue to be identified. Here we report on a major hotspot of Adelie penguin abundance identified in the Danger Islands off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). We present the first complete census of Pygoscelis spp. penguins in the Danger Islands, estimated from a multi-modal survey consisting of direct ground counts and computer-automated counts of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Our survey reveals that the Danger Islands host 751,527 pairs of Adelie penguins, more than the rest of AP region combined, and include the third and fourth largest Adelie penguin colonies in the world. Our results validate the use of Landsat medium-resolution satellite imagery for the detection of new or unknown penguin colonies and highlight the utility of combining satellite imagery with ground and UAV surveys. The Danger Islands appear to have avoided recent declines documented on the Western AP and, because they are large and likely to remain an important hotspot for avian abundance under projected climate change, deserve special consideration in the negotiation and design of Marine Protected Areas in the region.

TI  - Simulating damage for wind storms in the land surface model ORCHIDEE-CAN (revision 4262)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth system models (ESMs) are currently the most advanced tools with which to study the interactions among humans, ecosystem productivity, and the climate. The inclusion of storm damage in ESMs has long been hampered by their big-leaf approach, which ignores the canopy structure information that is required for process-based wind throw modelling. Recently the big-leaf assumptions in the large-scale land surface model ORCHIDEE-CAN were replaced by a three-dimensional description of the canopy structure. This opened the way to the integration of the processes from the small-scale wind damage risk model Forest-GALES into ORCHIDEE-CAN. The integration of Forest-GALES into ORCHIDEE-CAN required, however, developing numerically efficient solutions to deal with (1) landscape heterogeneity, i.e. account for newly established forest edges for the parameterization of gusts; (2) downscaling spatially and temporally aggregated wind fields to obtain more realistic wind speeds that would represents gusts; and (3) downscaling storm damage within the 2500 km(2) pixels of ORCHIDEE-CAN. This new version of ORCHIDEE-CAN was parameterized over Sweden. Subsequently, the performance of the model was tested against data for historical storms in southern Sweden between 1951 and 2010 and south-western France in 2009. In years without big storms, here defined as a storm damaging less than 15 x 10(6) m(3) of wood in Sweden, the model error is 1.62 x 10(6) m(3), which is about 100% of the observed damage. For years with big storms, such as Gudrun in 2005, the model error increased to 5.05 x 10(6) m(3), which is between 10 and 50% of the observed damage. When the same model parameters were used over France, the model reproduced a decrease in leaf area index and an increase in albedo, in accordance with SPOT-VGT and MODIS records following the passing of Cyclone Klaus in 2009. The current version of ORCHIDEE-CAN (revision 4262) is therefore expected to have the capability to capture the dynamics of forest structure due to storm disturbance on both regional and global scales, although the empirical parameters calculating gustiness from the gridded wind fields and storm damage from critical wind speeds may benefit from regional fitting.

TI  - Semisupervised GDTW kernel-based fuzzy c-means algorithm for mapping vegetation dynamics in mining region using normalized difference vegetation index time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping vegetation dynamic types in mining areas is significant for revealing the mechanisms of environmental damage and for guiding ecological construction. Dynamic types of vegetation can be identified by applying interannual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. However, phase differences and time shifts in interannual time series decrease mapping accuracy in mining regions. To overcome these problems and to increase the accuracy of mapping vegetation dynamics, an interannual Landsat time series for optimum vegetation growing status was constructed first by using the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model algorithm. We then proposed a Markov random field optimized semi-supervised Gaussian dynamic time warping kernel-based fuzzy c-means (FCM) cluster algorithm for interannual NDVI time series to map dynamic vegetation types in mining regions. The proposed algorithm has been tested in the Shengli mining region and Shendong mining region, which are typical representatives of China's open-pit and underground mining regions, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can solve the problems of phase differences and time shifts to achieve better performance when mapping vegetation dynamic types. The overall accuracies for the Shengli and Shendong mining regions were 93.32% and 89.60%, respectively, with improvements of 7.32% and 25.84% when compared with the original semisupervised FCM algorithm.

TI  - Contrasting the co-variability of daytime cloud and precipitation over tropical land and ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The co-variability of cloud and precipitation in the extended tropics (35 degrees N-35 degrees S) is investigated using contemporaneous data sets for a 13-year period. The goal is to quantify potential relationships between cloud type fractions and precipitation events of particular strength. Particular attention is paid to whether the relationships exhibit different characteristics over tropical land and ocean. A primary analysis metric is the correlation coefficient between fractions of individual cloud types and frequencies within precipitation histogram bins that have been matched in time and space. The cloud type fractions are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) joint histograms of cloud top pressure and cloud optical thickness in 1 degrees grid cells, and the precipitation frequencies come from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) data set aggregated to the same grid.It is found that the strongest coupling (positive correlation) between clouds and precipitation occurs over ocean for cumulonimbus clouds and the heaviest rainfall. While the same cloud type and rainfall bin are also best correlated over land compared to other combinations, the correlation magnitude is weaker than over ocean. The difference is attributed to the greater size of convective systems over ocean. It is also found that both over ocean and land the anti-correlation of strong precipitation with "weak" (i.e., thin and/or low) cloud types is of greater absolute strength than positive correlations between weak cloud types and weak precipitation. Cloud type co-occurrence relationships explain some of the cloud-precipitation anti-correlations. Weak correlations between weaker rainfall and clouds indicate poor predictability for precipitation when cloud types are known, and this is even more true over land than over ocean.

TI  - Increased Spatial Variability and Intensification of Extreme Monsoon Rainfall due to Urbanization
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While satellite data provides a strong robust signature of urban feedback on extreme precipitation; urbanization signal is often not so prominent with station level data. To investigate this, we select the case study of Mumbai, India and perform a high resolution (1 km) numerical study with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for eight extreme rainfall days during 2014-2015. The WRF model is coupled with two different urban schemes, the Single Layer Urban Canopy Model (WRFSUCM), Multi-Layer Urban Canopy Model (WRF-MUCM). The differences between the WRF-MUCM and WRF-SUCM indicate the importance of the structure and characteristics of urban canopy on modifications in precipitation. The WRF-MUCM simulations resemble the observed distributed rainfall. WRF-MUCM also produces intensified rainfall as compared to the WRF-SUCM and WRF-NoUCM (without UCM). The intensification in rainfall is however prominent at few pockets of urban regions, that is seen in increased spatial variability. We find that the correlation of precipitation across stations within the city falls below statistical significance at a distance greater than 10 km. Urban signature on extreme precipitation will be reflected on station rainfall only when the stations are located inside the urban pockets having intensified precipitation, which needs to be considered in future analysis.

TI  - Delineation of homogeneous forest patches using combination of field measurements and LiDAR point clouds as a reliable reference for evaluation of low resolution global satellite data
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds: There are many satellite systems acquiring environmental data on the world. Acquired global remote sensing datasets require ground reference data in order to calibrate them and assess their quality. Regarding calibration and validation of these datasets with broad geographical extents, it is essential to register zones which might be considered as Homogeneous Patches (HPs). Such patches enable an optimal calibration of satellite data/sensors, and what is more important is an analysis of components which significantly influence electro-magnetic signals registered by satellite sensors.Methods: We proposed two structurally different methods to identify HPs: predefined thresholding-based one (static one), and statistical thresholding-based technique (dynamic one). In the first method, 3 different thresholds were used: 5%, 10%, and 20%. Next, it was aimed to assess how delineated HPs were spatially matched to satellite data with coarse spatial resolution. Selected cell sizes were 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 m. The number of particular grid cells which almost entirely fell into registered HPs was counted (leaving 2% cell area tolerance level). This procedure was executed separately for each variant and selected structural variables, as well as for their intersection parts.Results: The results of this investigation revealed that ALS data might have the potential in the identification of HPs of forest stands. We showed that different ALS based variables and thresholds of HPs definition influenced areas which can be treated as similar and homogeneous. We proved that integration of more than one structural variable limits size of the HPs, in contrast, visual interpretation revealed that inside such patches vegetation structure is more constant.Conclusions: We concluded that ALS data can be used as a potential source of data to "enlarge" small ground sample plots and to be used for evaluation and calibration of remotely sensed datasets provided by global systems with coarse spatial resolutions.

TI  - A Modified Landscape Expansion Index Algorithm for Urban Growth Classification Using Satellite Remote Sensing Image
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Computer and Network Applications (ICCNA)
CL  - Kota Kinabalu, MALAYSIA
AB  - Traditional landscape indices are only able to specify the characteristics of urban area at one particular time. The same landscape index applied at different time would generate different result. A new landscape index, called landscape expansion index (LEI) is able to reflect the specific growth type of the urban area using multi temporal datasets. This paper evaluates the efficiency of LEI algorithm for urban growth classification using several Landsat Thematic Mapper images of Klang Valley, one of the most rapid urban growth areas in Malaysia. The images are pre-processed into binary images containing the undeveloped and existing region of the study area. The identified new urban region are then classified by incorporating LEI in the classification algorithm. Result shows that LEI has the limitations to properly identify infill and expansion growth. A modified LEI is proposed by taking into accounts two parameters: location of the new urban region and the existence of existing region surrounding it. Experiments with all available images produced positive output whereby the modified LEI is capable of correctly classifying urban growth types.

TI  - Changes in soil hydraulic properties, soil moisture and water balance in <i>Acacia senegal</i> plantations of varying age in Sudan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of Acacia senegal trees on soil moisture (SM) and hydraulic properties in relation to plantations age and associated changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) were investigated and compared to grasslands at two sites in Sudan. Soil hydraulic properties were computed using pedotransfer functions based on texture and SOC, and SM measured using TDR. The measured SM data was used to parametrize a simple daily water balance model in which Hortonian runoff was calculated using the SCS runoff curve number (CM) method and evapotranspiration calculated using crop coefficients, K-c, adjusted to seasonal values using NDVI. Measured SM was higher in the grasslands than plantations, but increased with plantation age, reflecting a similar trend in plantation SOC and plant available water capacities. The modelling resulted in lower runoff from the plantations, increased infiltration, evapotranspiration, reduced drainage and lower SM, as shown by measurements. Greater SM contents in the grasslands were attributed to lower evapotranspiration and resulted in greater drainage fluxes compared to the plantations. The study highlighted the need for more empirical studies on the effect of tree density and cover on rainfall-runoff relationships, infiltration, evapotranspiration and drainage in drylands, especially those of the drier parts of semi-arid Africa.

TI  - Peri-urbanisation and loss of arable land in Kumasi Metropolis in three decades: Evidence from remote sensing image analysis
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examined the effects of peri-urbanisation on arable land in Kumasi Metropolis. The study involved classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1986 imagery and images from Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) 2004 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Image and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) image for 2016 to show land use and cover changes in the Metropolis. The results show that the Metropolis has undergone significant land use and land cover changes in thirty years with negative repercussions for food crop production. While urban land use increased by 54.6% between 1986 and 2016, arable land declined by 15.6% over the same period. The results show a strong positive correlation between the size of arable land and crop output over a fifteen-year period. The paper calls for legislative enforcement as well as standards on urban land use and development as enshrined in the 2016 Land Use and Spatial Planning Act to ensure that land use in the city is consistent with sustainable principles.

TI  - Monitoring of playa evaporites as seen with optical remote sensing sensors: case of Chott El Jerid, Tunisia, from 2003 to present
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Chott El Jerid in the Zone of Chotts of Tunisia is one of the largest endorheic basins in the world. During the dry period, from May to August, it is generally covered by continental evaporites which result from the desiccation of the lake formed after a flooding event. This lake comprises runoff water from the surrounding relief and also water resurgence. In order to map and monitor these evaporitic surfaces (mineral composition and evolution in space and time), optical multisource, multispectral, and multidate satellite data have been used. Landsat 4-5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, SPOT 6, and Landsat Surface Reflectance (LSR) constitute the main data set. The central part of the Chott, north and south of the road crossing the Chott over 70 km from Tozeur to Kebili, has been particularly studied, because it corresponds to the major evaporite accumulation zone. These evaporites precipitated as concentric layers (a relatively rare pattern), mainly north of the road, after several recent flooding events during the last 15 years. Winds can play a significant role in the development of the evaporite layers. Image interpretation associated with field data shows that after the final desiccation of the playa lake, the mineralogy of the salt crust comprised an assemblage dominated by halite south of the road and by gypsum north of the road. Halite and gypsum are the only minerals to be identified using satellite remote sensing data. Sulfates such as gypsum can be identified thanks to a drop in reflectance in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) range caused by vibrations of the SO4 group. Gypsum crusts are more widely distributed than halite crusts. LSR data are particularly suitable for multitemporal comparison because they are calibrated and atmospherically corrected. The classical bull's eye pattern characterizing evaporitic deposits (from carbonates along the rims to halite, gypsum, and finally potassium-magnesium minerals in the center of the basin) is deeply disturbed by the road crossing Chott El Jerid.

TI  - Mapping Mangroves Extents on the Red Sea Coastline in Egypt using Polarimetric SAR and High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They are among the most productive forest ecosystems. They provide various ecological and economic ecosystem services. Despite of their economic and ecological importance, mangroves experience high yearly loss rates. There is a growing demand for mapping and assessing changes in mangroves extents especially in the context of climate change, land use change, and related threats to coastal ecosystems. The main objective of this study is to develop an approach for mapping of mangroves extents on the Red Sea coastline in Egypt, through the integration of both L-band SAR data of ALOS/PALSAR, and high resolution optical data of RapidEye. This was achieved via using object-based image analysis method, through applying different machine learning algorithms, and evaluating various features such as spectral properties, texture features, and SAR derived parameters for discrimination of mangroves ecosystem classes. Three non-parametric machine learning algorithms were tested for mangroves mapping; random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART). As an input for the classifiers, we tested various features including vegetation indices (VIs) and texture analysis using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The object-based analysis method allowed clearly discriminating the different land cover classes within mangroves ecosystem. The highest overall accuracy (92.15%) was achieved by the integrated SAR and optical data. Among all classifiers tested, RF performed better than other classifiers. Using L-band SAR data integrated with high resolution optical data was beneficial for mapping and characterization of mangroves growing in small patches. The maps produced represents an important updated reference suitable for developing a regional action plan for conservation and management of mangroves resources along the Red Sea coastline.

TI  - A call for viewshed ecology: Advancing our understanding of the ecology of information through viewshed analysis
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been rapid increase of interest in the role that information acquisition plays in ecological process and in shaping life histories and their evolution. Compared to auditory and olfactory cues, the range at which visual cues are likely to be informative to animals is particularly sensitive to the spatial structure of the environment. However, quantification of and accounting for availability of visual information in fundamental and applied ecological research remains extremely limited. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviour in a spatial context would greatly benefit from objective quantification of the area an animal can potentially obtain visual information from and therefore draw broad attention to viewshed analysis. This analysis identifies all cells of a gridded surface that are connected by lines-of-sight to a viewpoint, hence, providing information on how much of the environment surrounding a location can be seen. Although heavily used in non-ecological disciplines including civil planning and archaeology, viewshed analysis has seldom been applied in an ecological context. Here, we highlight the opportunity to make use of viewshed approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional remote sensing data and data from animal tracking to make major progress in understanding how visual information influences animal spatial behaviour, ecology and evolution.

TI  - Investigation of reddening patterns of dune sands - The megabarchans of Al-ghord Lahmar (Khnifiss National Park, South-West of Morocco)
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to investigate the geological and environmental parameters controlling the redness of sand at the megabarchans located nearby Khnifiss lagoon (SW of Morocco). Mineralogical investigation either by laboratory or remotely sensed data showed the abundance of a mixed composition of Quartz, Carbonates and mafic minerals with a dominance of Hematite Quartz coated grains. Also, grain size analysis revealed the heterogeneity of the megabarchans sand and the dominance of fine and well to very well sorted sand with a mean grains size of (0.2 mm). Mineralogical species were adequately distributed according to their size and density. We noted the dominance of iron bearing minerals including: Magnetite, Hematite, Ilmenite, Ulvospinel, and Pyroxenes, in the very fine fraction (< 63 mu m). Yet, the coarser fractions (> 63) mu m knew a dominance of Hematite coated Quartz, Carbonates and Feldspars. These both fractions are carried by wind with almost the same threshold motion, which meant that the size could compensate the density. That explains their deposition in the same environment. The megabarchans migrated over the past 325 years with a rate of 2 m/year. Thus, grains may undergo many turnover cycles until they can be reactivated by wind. Climatic parameters such as precipitations with 164 mm/year, the frequent stormy events that bring a flash flooding, in addition to the high humidity and important fog and dew provide a source of moisture that make the megabarchans a moistened environment encouraging the iron oxidation. Thus, the abundance of a source of iron and a source of moisture, in addition to the stability of the megabarchans, and their water holding capacity remained the effective factors that led to the megabarchans redness.

TI  - Exploitation of mortality salience in communication on climate change
T2  - RECHERCHE ET APPLICATIONS EN MARKETING-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Review
AB  - This research focuses on the effectiveness of anxiety-inducing communication for mobilizing consumers against climate change. Based on terror management theory (TMT), we show that this register can be counterproductive in generating consumer choices that run counter to pro-environmental logics. In particular, we report the results of an experiment (N=132) testing the influence of the type of communication (anxiogenic vs informative) on consumer choices (pro-materialistic vs pro-environmental). The results reveal that people's consumption choices depend on their cultural worldviews (i.e. materialistic vs environmentalist) and the type of communication used. The effectiveness of communication strategies on climate change is then discussed in terms of people's cultural worldview.

TI  - Investigation of the influence of lineaments, lineament intersections and geology on groundwater yield in the basement complex terrain of Ondo State, Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The influence of lineaments, lineament intersections and geology on the groundwater yield of the basement terrain of Ondo State was investigated using optical remote sensing data, Aster DEM, geology, and borehole yield data. Landsat-7 ETM+ and Aster DEM were processed to generate composite lineament map. The study area was traversed by five (5) main lineament populations trending N-S, NE-SW, E-W, ENE-WSW, NNW-SSE. Boreholes sited on lineament exhibited a yield range of between 0.8 and 1.28 l/s with an average yield of 1.04 l/s. Boreholes sited close to lineament gave groundwater yield values of between 0.5 and 1.28 l/s and an average yield of 1 l/s, while boreholes located outside lineament gave groundwater yield range of between 0.2 and 1.26 l/s with an average yield of 0.98 l/s. The investigation of the hydrogeological characteristics of the lithologies by superimposing the yield data showed average yield of 0.98 l/s for migmatite gneiss biotite granite undifferentiated (M), 1.01 l/s for porphyritic granite (OGp), 1.03 l/s for medium- to coarse-grained (OGe), 1.17 l/s for pelitic schist undifferentiated (Su), 1.24 l/s for quartz schist and quartzite (Eq), 1.12 l/s for older granite undifferentiated (OGu), 0.5 l/s for slightly migmatised medium-grained granite-gneiss (gg) and 1.23 l/s for fine-grained flaggy quartzite and schists (Sf). The study concluded that borehole data located on or near lineaments or at intersection of lineaments gave higher yields more than those located before lineaments or outside lineaments, while quartz schist and quartzite exhibited the highest average groundwater yield of all the lithological units.

TI  - Susceptibility mapping of gully erosion using GIS-based statistical bivariate models: a case study from Ali Al-Gharbi District, Maysan Governorate, southern Iraq
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to evaluate the predictive capability of three bivariate statistical models, namely information value, frequency ratio, and evidential belief functions, in gully erosion susceptibility mapping in northeastern Maysan Governorate (Ali Al-Gharbi District) in southern Iraq. The gully inventory map, consisting of 21 gullies of different sizes, was prepared based on the interpretation of remotely sensed data supported by field survey. The gully inventory data (polygon format) were randomly partitioned into two sets: 14 gullies for build and training the bivariate model, and the remaining 7 gullies for validating purposes. Twelve gully influential factors were selected based on data availability and the literature review. The selected factors were related to lithology, geomorphology, soil, land cover, and topography (primary and secondary) settings. Analysis of factor importance using information gain ratio proved that out of 12 gully influential factors, eight were of more importance in developing gullies (the average merit was greater than zero). The most important factors and the training gully inventory map were used to generate three gully erosion susceptibility maps based on the three bivariate models used. For validation, the area under the operating characteristics curves for both success and prediction rates was used. The results indicated that the highest prediction rate of 82.9% was achieved using the information value technique. All the bivariate models had prediction rates greater than 80%, and thus they were regarded as very good estimators. The final conclusion was that the bivariate models offer advanced techniques for mapping gully erosion susceptibility.

TI  - Investigating the effects of environmental factors on autism spectrum disorder in the USA using remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the association between exposures to outdoor environmental factors and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence in a diverse and spatially distributed population of 8-year-old children from the USA (n = 2,097,188) using the air quality index (AQI) of the US Environmental Protection Agency as well as satellite-derived data of PM2.5 concentrations, sunlight, and maximum heat index. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether the unhealthy AQI, PM2.5, sunlight, and maximum heat index were related to the odds of ASD prevalence based on gender and race and taking into consideration the confounding factors of smoking and socioeconomic status. The logistic regression odds ratios for ASD per 10% increase in the unhealthy AQI were greater than 1 for all categories, indicating that unhealthy AQI is related to the odds of ASD prevalence. The odds ratio of ASD due to the exposure to the unhealthy AQI was higher for Asians (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.11-7.88) than that for Hispanics (OR = 1.308, 95% CI = 0.607-2.820), and it was higher for Blacks (OR = 1.398, 95% CI = 0.827-2.364) than that for Whites (OR = 1.219, 95% CI = 0.760-1.954). The odds ratio of ASD due to the unhealthy AQI was slightly higher for males (OR = 1.123, 95% CI = 0.771-1.635) than that for females (OR = 1.117, 95% CI = 0.789-1.581). The effects of the unhealthy environmental exposures on the odds ratios of ASD of this study were inconclusive (i.e., statically insignificant; p value > 0.05) for all categories except for Asians. The odds ratios of ASD for Asians were increased by 5, 12, and 14% with increased levels of the environmental exposures of 10 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5, 1000 kJ/m(2) of sunlight, and 1 degrees F of maximum heat index, respectively. The odds ratios of ASD prevalence for all categories, except for Asians, were increased with the inclusion of the smoking covariate, reflecting the effect of smoking on ASD prevalence besides the unhealthy environmental factors.

TI  - Mapping Bahrain's subsurface municipal solid waste
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to map possible subsurface dumpsites of solid waste in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Due to limited land availability, random garbage dumping for waste disposal and reclamation has occurred in the past and continues to occur in the Kingdom. Consequently, the process causes economic stress, creates environmental hazards, and contributes to the failure of many dwellings. The input data used to achieve research objective includes data from 300 boreholes, aerial photos, LandSat images, digital elevation model, and 1969-2015 land use maps. Data on the amounts and types of municipal solid waste (MSW) were collected from 1997 to 2017, as were the locations of 3665 deteriorated houses. All types of data are screened, georeferenced, and converted into geographic information system (GIS) formats. At first, a map of possible dumping areas is produced based on citizen testimonies, government engineer interviews, LandSat, aerial photos, and 1969 topo map, followed by data analysis of the aforementioned input data performed such as image classification, buffering, and others. In the next step, multi-criteria GIS algorithm was developed to identify, locate, and map possible sites. The criteria used are distances from dwelling outskirt and the shoreline, land use, relative elevation, and soil type based on borehole data. Lastly, ground truth validation assesses the accuracy of the obtained result. Overall, the study identified 101 confirmed dumping sites and 590 probable dumping sites. Site size is ranging from 18,000 m(2) to 3.6 km(2) distributed over 100 city blocks which are spread throughout the Kingdom. The Capital Governorate is the most affected by dumping, and the Southern Governorate is the least impacted. A comparison of results and ground observations yielded 87.5% accuracy. The proposed integrated method was effective, and the obtained identification and location accuracy were acceptable. The method can be used to identify, locate, and map random dumping sites in a similar situation.

TI  - A Decadal Historical Satellite Data and Rainfall Trend Analysis (2001-2016) for Flood Hazard Mapping in Sri Lanka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical information on a flood-affected area is needed in a short time frame to initiate rapid response operations and develop long-term flood management strategies. This study combined rainfall trend analysis using Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation ofWater Resources (APHRODITE) gridded rainfall data with flood maps derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral satellite to arrive at holistic spatio-temporal patterns of floods in Sri Lanka. Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data were used to map flood extents for emergency relief operations while eight-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data for the time period from 2001 to 2016 were used to map long term flood-affected areas. The inundation maps produced for rapid response were published within three hours upon the availability of satellite imagery in web platforms, with the aim of supporting a wide range of stakeholders in emergency response and flood relief operations. The aggregated time series of flood extents mapped using MODIS data were used to develop a flood occurrence map (2001-2016) for Sri Lanka. Flood hotpots identified using both optical and synthetic aperture average of 325 km(2) for the years 2006-2015 and exceptional flooding in 2016 with inundation extent of approximately 1400 km(2). The time series rainfall data explains increasing trend in the extreme rainfall indices with similar observation derived from satellite imagery. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-sensor flood mapping approaches, which will aid Disaster Management Center (DMC) and other multi-lateral agencies involved in managing rapid response operations and preparing mitigation measures.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Different Digital Surface Models
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs), which can occur in the form of digital surface models (DSMs) or digital terrain models (DTMs), are widely used as important geospatial information sources for various remote sensing applications, including the precise orthorectification of high-resolution satellite images, 3D spatial analyses, multi-criteria decision support systems, and deformation monitoring. The accuracy of DEMs has direct impacts on specific calculations and process chains; therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate DEM by considering the aim, accuracy requirement, and scale of each study. In this research, DSMs obtained from a variety of satellite sensors were compared to analyze their accuracy and performance. For this purpose, freely available Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 30 m, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30 m, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) 30 m resolution DSM data were obtained. Additionally, 3 m and 1 m resolution DSMs were produced from tri-stereo images from the SPOT 6 and Pleiades high-resolution (PHR) 1A satellites, respectively. Elevation reference data provided by the General Command of Mapping, the national mapping agency of Turkey-produced from 30 cm spatial resolution stereo aerial photos, with a 5 m grid spacing and +/- 3 m or better overall vertical accuracy at the 90% confidence interval (CI)-were used to perform accuracy assessments. Gross errors and water surfaces were removed from the reference DSM. The relative accuracies of the different DSMs were tested using a different number of checkpoints determined by different methods. In the first method, 25 checkpoints were selected from bare lands to evaluate the accuracies of the DSMs on terrain surfaces. In the second method, 1000 randomly selected checkpoints were used to evaluate the methods' accuracies for the whole study area. In addition to the control point approach, vertical cross-sections were extracted from the DSMs to evaluate the accuracies related to land cover. The PHR and SPOT DSMs had the highest accuracies of all of the testing methods, followed by the ALOS DSM, which had very promising results. Comparatively, the SRTM and ASTER DSMs had the worst accuracies. Additionally, the PHR and SPOT DSMs captured man-made objects and above-terrain structures, which indicated the need for post-processing to attain better representations.

TI  - Methods to Remove the Border Noise From Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Data: Implications and Importance For Time-Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 GRD (ground range detected) Level-1 product generated by the Instrument Processing Facility of the European Space Agency has noise artifacts at the image borders, which are quite consistent at both left and right sides of the satellite's cross track and at the start and end of the data take along track. The Sentinel-1 border noise troubles the creation of clean and consistence time series of backscatter. Data quality control and management become very challenging tasks, when it comes to the large-scale data processing, both in terms of spatial coverage and data volume. In this paper, we evaluate three techniques for removing the Sentinel-1 border noise and compare the results with the existing "Sentinel-1 GRD Border Noise Removal" algorithm implemented in the Sentinel-1 toolbox of the Sentinel application platform. 1 Validation and evaluation of the newly proposed algorithms was done using random samples containing 1500 Sentinel-1 scenes selected from a complete Sentinel-1 archive. The newly proposed approach has successfully achieved the required level of accuracy and solved the issue of time-series anomalies due to the border noise.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We investigated complications after laparoscopic sentinel basin dissection (SBD) for patients with gastric cancer who were enrolled in a quality control study, prior to the phase III trial of sentinel lymph node navigation surgery (SNNS).Materials and Methods: We analyzed prospective data from a Korean multicenter prerequisite quality control trial of laparoscopic SBD for gastric cancer and assessed procedure-related and surgical complications. All complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) system and were compared with the results of the previously published SNNS trial.Results: Among the 108 eligible patients who were enrolled in the quality control trial, 8 (7.4%) experienced complications during the early postoperative period. One patient with gastric resection-related duodenal stump leakage recovered after percutaneous drainage (grade IIIa in CDC). The other postoperative complications were mild and patients recovered with supportive care. No complications were directly related to the laparoscopic SBD procedure or tracer usage, and there were no mortalities. The laparoscopic SBD complication rates and patterns that were observed in this study were comparable to those of a previously reported trial.Conclusions: The results of our prospective, multicenter quality control trial demonstrate that laparoscopic SBD is a safe procedure during SNNS for gastric cancer.

TI  - Improvements in the On-Orbit Response Versus Scan Angle Characterization of the Aqua MODIS Reflective Solar Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrora-diometer (MODIS) has been chosen by the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System operational community as the reference sensor in cross-sensor calibration. A number of geostationary orbit and low-earth orbit sensors use the 0.64-mu m band from Aqua MODIS as a calibration reference. After over 15 years on-orbit, the performance characteristics of the MODIS instrument have changed, with effects evident at short wavelengths. MODIS employs a reflectance-based calibration using the solar diffuser measurements with the monthly lunar observations facilitating a response versus scan angle characterization on-orbit. As the instrument continues to operate beyond its design lifetime of 6 years, the on-board calibrators alone are insufficient to accurately characterize the instrument's response at all scan angles. This results in a long-term reflectance drift, particularly observed in the 0.64-and 0.85-mu m bands, while observing the temporally invariant desert sites. Long-term reflectance drifts of up to 2% and 3% are observed at the beginning of scan for the 0.64-and 0.85-mu m bands, respectively. An approach using earth-view response to supplement the on-board calibrator measurements has been shown to overcome these inadequacies and is now implemented for the 0.64-, 0.85-, 0.46-, and 0.55-mu m land bands of Aqua MODIS. This paper presents the details related to the algorithm implementation and an independent evaluation using the Dome Concordia site and deep-convective clouds. This approach has been reviewed, tested, and approved by the MODIS science team and has been implemented in the forward production of the MODIS L1B Collection 6 starting July 9, 2016. This enhanced approach has also been adopted in the MODIS L1B Collection 6.1 reprocess for the entire mission to facilitate an improved quality of downstream science products. The results with the enhanced approach reduce the reflectance drifts to within 0.5% for most cases.

TI  - MODIS EVI-based net primary production in the Sahel 2000-2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa is facing resource problems due to increasing demand combined with potential climate-induced changes in supply. Here we aim to quantify resources in terms of net primary production (NPP [g C m(-2) yr(-1)]) of vegetation in the Sahel region for 2000-2014.Using time series of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS, NPP was estimated for the Sahel region with a 500 x 500 m spatial resolution and 8-day temporal resolution. The estimates were based on local eddy covariance flux measurements from six sites in the Sahel region and the carbon use efficiency originating from a dynamic vegetation model.No significant NPP change was found for the Sahel as a region but, for sub-regions, significant changes, both increasing and decreasing, were observed. Substantial uncertainties related to NPP estimates and the small availability of evaluation data makes verification difficult. The simplicity of the methodology used, dependent on earth observation only, is considered an advantage.

TI  - ENSO- and Rainfall-Sensitive Vegetation Regions in Indonesia as Identified from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing global warming has triggered extreme climate events of increasing magnitude and frequency. Under this effect, a series of extreme climate events such as drought and increased rainfall during the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are expected to be amplified in the coming years. Adequate mapping of regions with climate-sensitive vegetation and its associated time lag is required for appropriate mitigation planning to avoid potential negative ecological impacts towards vegetation. In this study, ENSO and climate indicator time series data, for example, Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data for rainfall were linked with long-term time series vegetation proxies from remote sensing (RS proxies). ENSO- and rainfall-sensitive areas were identified from each RS proxy using the bivariate Granger test, and the areas identified by multiple RS proxies were taken to identify climate-sensitive regions in Indonesia. Of the biome types in Indonesia, savanna was the most sensitive, with approximately 53% of the total savanna area in Indonesia shown to be sensitive to ENSO and rainfall by two or more RS proxies. Rolling correlation analysis also found that the ENSO effect on the vegetation region after rainfall was positively correlated with the RS proxies with a time lag of +5 months. Therefore, rainfall can be taken as a proxy of the effects of ENSO on the temporal dynamics of sensitive vegetation regions in Indonesia.

TI  - Analysis of Secular Ground Motions in Istanbul from a Long-Term InSAR Time-Series (1992-2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and measurement of ground deformations in urban areas is of great importance for determining the vulnerable parts of the cities that are prone to geohazards, which is a crucial element of both sustainable urban planning and hazard mitigation. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis is a very powerful tool for the operational mapping of ground deformation related to urban subsidence and landslide phenomena. With an analysis spanning almost 25 years of satellite radar observations, we compute an InSAR time series of data from multiple satellites (European Remote Sensing satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2, Envisat, Sentinel-1A, and its twin sensor Sentinel-1B) in order to investigate the spatial extent and rate of ground deformation in the megacity of Istanbul. By combining the various multi-track InSAR datasets (291 images in total) and analysing persistent scatterers (PS-InSAR), we present mean velocity maps of ground surface displacement in selected areas of Istanbul. We identify several sites along the terrestrial and coastal regions of Istanbul that underwent vertical ground subsidence at varying rates, from 5 +/- 1.2 mm/yr to 15 +/- 2.1 mm/yr. The results reveal that the most distinctive subsidence patterns are associated with both anthropogenic factors and relatively weak lithologies along the Haramirede valley in particular, where the observed subsidence is up to 10 +/- 2 mm/yr. We show that subsidence has been occurring along the Ayamama river stream at a rate of up to 10 +/- 1.8 mm/yr since 1992, and has also been slowing down over time following the restoration of the river and stream system. We also identify subsidence at a rate of 8 +/- 1.2 mm/yr along the coastal region of Istanbul, which we associate with land reclamation, as well as a very localised subsidence at a rate of 15 +/- 2.3 mm/yr starting in 2016 around one of the highest skyscrapers of Istanbul, which was built in 2010.

TI  - Polarimetric Phase and Implications for Urban Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of urban environments poses significant challenges for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), since rotated urban blocks violate the assumption of reflection symmetry held by many decomposition approaches. Vast sections of cities appear to be dominated by volume scattering due to the introduction of coherent depolarization. Attempts to model this slanted double bounce must contend with the fact that dihedrals rotated about the vertical axis do not support significant backscatter and require a rough ground surface to affect a return path. In this paper, the concept of an effective dihedral is introduced, with one plate coincident with the building wall and one plate associated with some ground facet, oriented so as to support double bounce. The rotation of this effective dihedral can be readily related to the polarization orientation angle and used to quantify co-pol and cross-pol phases. Theoretical results are confirmed with L-band and C-band polarimetric SAR imagery of San Francisco, as well as by broadband laboratory experiments with modeled buildings. In addition, the utility of using cross-pol phase to classify urban regions in the Los Angeles basin is demonstrated with ascending and descending dual-pol Radarsat data.

TI  - A New Approach for Monitoring the Terra Nova Bay Polynya through MODIS Ice Surface Temperature Imagery and Its Validation during 2010 and 2011 Winter Seasons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polynyas are dynamic stretches of open water surrounded by ice. They typically occur in remote regions of the Arctic and Antarctic, thus remote sensing is essential for monitoring their dynamics. On regional scales, daily passive microwave radiometers provide useful information about their extent because of their independence from cloud coverage and daylight; nonetheless, their coarse resolution often does not allow an accurate discrimination between sea ice and open water. Despite its sensitivity to the presence of clouds, thermal infrared (TIR) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides higher-resolution information (typically 1 km) at large swath widths, several times per day, proving to be useful for the retrieval of the size of polynyas. In this study, we deal with Aqua satellite MODIS observations of a frequently occurring coastal polynya in the Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Ross Sea (Antarctica). The potential of a new methodology for estimating the variability of this polynya through MODIS TIR during the 2010 and 2011 freezing season (April to October) is presented and discussed. The polynya is observed in more than 1600 radiance scenes, after a preliminary filter evaluates and discards cloudy and fog-contaminated scenes. This reduces the useful MODIS swaths to about 50% of the available acquisitions, but a revisit time of less than 24 h is kept for about 90% of the study period. As expected, results show a high interannual variability with an opening/closing fluctuation clearly depending on the regime of the katabatic winds recorded by the automatic weather stations Rita and Eneide along the TNB coast. Retrievals are also validated through a comparison with a set of 196 co-located high-resolution ENVISAT ASAR images. Although our estimations slightly underestimate the ASAR derived extents, a good agreement is found, the linear correlation reaching 0.75 and the average relative error being about 6%. Finally, a sensitivity test on the applied thermal thresholds supports the effectiveness of our setting.

TI  - Burned Area Mapping of an Escaped Fire into Tropical Dry Forest in Western Madagascar Using Multi-Season Landsat OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A human-induced fire cleared a large area of tropical dry forest near the Ankoatsifaka Research Station at Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar over several weeks in 2013. Fire is a major factor in the disturbance and loss of global tropical dry forests, yet remotely sensed mapping studies of fire-impacted tropical dry forests lag behind fire research of other forest types. Methods used to map burns in temperature forests may not perform as well in tropical dry forests where it can be difficult to distinguish between multiple-age burn scars and between bare soil and burns. In this study, the extent of forest lost to stand-replacing fire in Kirindy Mitea National Park was quantified using both spectral and textural information derived from multi-date satellite imagery. The total area of the burn was 18,034 ha. It is estimated that 6% (4761 ha) of the Park's primary tropical dry forest burned over the period 23 June to 27 September. Half of the forest burned (2333 ha) was lost in the large conflagration adjacent to the Research Station. The best model for burn scar mapping in this highly-seasonal tropical forest and pastoral landscape included the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and both uni- and multi-temporal measures of greenness. Lessons for burn mapping of tropical dry forest are much the same as for tropical dry forest mapping-highly seasonal vegetation combined with a mixture of background spectral information make for a complicated analysis and may require multi-temporal imagery and site specific techniques.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on time-series satellite-retrieved records of the marine ecological environment from Aqua/MODIS, we investigated changes in the sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), Secchi Disc depth (SDD), and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in 12 Eurasian marginal seas from 2003 to 2014. Results showed that the SST increased in all 12 marginal seas, with the enclosed marginal seas (i.e., Black Sea, Baltic Sea, Japan Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Persian Gulf) exhibiting relatively higher rates of increase. The PAR generally decreased, except in the European marginal seas, though not significantly. Similar to the changes in the SST, the SDD increased in all 12 marginal seas, with a maximum rate of 3.02%/year (or 0.25 m/year, p = 0.0003) found in the Persian Gulf. As expected, Chla generally decreased in the tropical marginal seas, but increased in the high-latitude marginal seas. The different relationships between SST and Chla changes indicate the complexity of global warming effects on marine phytoplankton in different marginal seas.

TI  - Identifying Building Damage Patterns in the 2016 Meinong, Taiwan Earthquake Using Post-Event Dual-Polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 magnitude 6.4 Meinong earthquake caused catastrophic damage to peoples lives and properties in Taiwan. Synthetic Aperture Radar remote sensing is a useful tool to rapidly grasp the near real-time building damage to areas affected by the earthquake. Previous studies employed X-band single polarized high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery to identify building damage. However, suitable X-band single polarized high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery is not always accessible. Therefore, this research applied L-band dual-polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data to analyze the radar scattering characteristics of three types of affected buildings in the 2016 Meinong earthquake. The results show that collapsed buildings are characterized by a weak double-bounce scattering due to a reduced dihedral structure, while the characteristics of slightly damaged buildings are similar to those of undamaged buildings. Furthermore, the discrimination ability of a series of polarimetric, texture, and color features derived from the dual-polarimetric SAR data for three types of buildings affected by the earthquake are quantified based on a statistical analysis using the pixels in the combined areas of layover, shadow, and building footprint of each building. The results of the statistical analysis show that the spaceborne dual-polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images have good potential to distinguish between slightly damaged buildings and collapsed and tilted buildings. However, it is still difficult to distinguish between collapsed and tilted buildings. In addition, the results of the statistical analysis show that the mean value and variance value of the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix of the span image are two suitable features by which the categories of building damage can be distinguished. The polarimetric and color features demonstrated poorer performance in terms of distinguishing between damage categories than the texture features.

TI  - kCCA Transformation-Based Radiometric Normalization of Multi-Temporal Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation normalization is an essential pre-processing step for generating high-quality satellite sequence images. However, most radiometric normalization methods are linear, and they cannot eliminate the regular nonlinear spectral differences. Here we introduce the well-established kernel canonical correlation analysis (kCCA) into radiometric normalization for the first time to overcome this problem, which leads to a new kernel method. It can maximally reduce the image differences among multi-temporal images regardless of the imaging conditions and the reflectivity difference. It also perfectly eliminates the impact of nonlinear changes caused by seasonal variation of natural objects. Comparisons with the multivariate alteration detection (CCA-based) normalization and the histogram matching, on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data, indicate that the kCCA-based normalization can preserve more similarity and better correlation between an image-pair and effectively avoid the color error propagation. The proposed method not only builds the common scale or reference to make the radiometric consistency among GF-1 image sequences, but also highlights the interesting spectral changes while eliminates less interesting spectral changes. Our method enables the application of GF-1 data for change detection, land-use, land-cover change detection etc.

TI  - Biotic and Abiotic Controls Over Canopy Function and Structure in Humid Hawaiian Forests
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliar nitrogen (N) plays a key role in ecosystem function and dynamics, including processes such as photosynthesis, productivity, and decomposition. Aboveground carbon density (ACD Mg C ha(-1)) represents a cumulative functional outcome of these and other ecosystem processes and is an important metric for monitoring current carbon stocks. Despite their importance, multiple interacting controls over landscape-level variation in foliar N and ACD are poorly understood. We assessed the relative importance of individual ecologically important state factors (climate, substrate, age, vegetation, and topography) associated with canopy foliar N and ACD throughout a humid forest landscape. We combined high-resolution remotely sensed data, machine learning, and field data to map and assess canopy foliar N and ACD patterns across a 5016-ha forest reserve in Hawai'i. Distance to non-native forests had the largest relative influence on canopy foliar N concentration, followed by mean annual temperature (MAT), vegetation type, precipitation, soil, canopy height, and substrate age. In contrast, soil type was the strongest determinant of spatial variability in ACD, followed by precipitation, MAT, and vegetation type. Similar to foliar N, climate and vegetation variables were associated with ACD. However, soil type was found to be much more important in the ACD model (30%) than in the foliar N model (4%). Landscape-scale patterns in canopy foliar N and ACD are the result of shifts in vegetation type and composition, most likely due to species' responses to past disturbances, current climate conditions, and available nutrients. Degradation of native forests and future climate changes could result in highly altered biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Widespread distribution of OH/H<sub>2</sub>O on the lunar surface inferred from spectral data
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data from lunar orbiters have revealed spectral features consistent with the presence of OH or H2O on the lunar surface. Analyses of data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper spectrometer onboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft have suggested that OH/H2O is recycled on diurnal timescales and persists only at high latitudes. However, the spatial distribution and temporal variability of the OH/H2O, as well as its source, remain uncertain. Here we incorporate a physics-based thermal correction into analysis of reflectance spectra from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper and find that prominent absorption features consistent with OH/H2O can be present at all latitudes, local times and surface types examined. This suggests the widespread presence of OH/H2O on the lunar surface without significant diurnal migration. We suggest that the spectra are consistent with the production of OH in space-weathered materials by the solar wind implantation of H+ and formation of OH at crystal defect sites, as opposed to H2O sourced from the lunar interior. Regardless of the specific composition or formation mechanism, we conclude that OH/H2O can be present on the Moon under thermal conditions more wide-ranging than previously recognized.

TI  - Human Self as Information Agent: Functioning in a Social Environment Based on Shared Meanings
T2  - REVIEW OF GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A neglected aspect of human selfhood is that people are information agents. That is, much human social activity involves communicating and discussing information. This occurs in the context of incompletely shared information-but also a group's store of collective knowledge and shared understanding. This article elucidates a preliminary theory of self as information agent, proposing that human evolution instilled both abilities and motivations for the various requisite functions. These basic functions include (a) seeking and acquiring information, (b) communicating one's thoughts to others, (c) circulating information through the group, (d) operating on information to improve it, such as by correcting mistakes, and (e) constructing a shared understanding of reality. Sophisticated information agents exhibit additional features, such as sometimes selectively withholding information or disseminating false information for self-serving reasons, cultivating a reputation as a credible source of information, and cooperating with others to shape the shared worldview in a way that favors one's subgroup. Meaningful information is thus more than a resource for individual action: It also provides the context, medium, and content within which the individual self interacts with its social environment.

TI  - Modeling plant invasion on Mediterranean coastal landscapes: An integrative approach using remotely sensed data
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many hypotheses explaining invasion success have been formulated, invasion drivers are usually tested in isolation. This work aims to analyze the combined influence of propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A) and biotic (B) factors (PAB) on determining the invasion process of an exotic plant taxon (Carpobrotus sp.) in Mediterranean coastal landscapes. Specifically, we used a binomial Generalized Additive Model for exploring the relation between the occurrence of the invasive species and a set of PAB proxy variables derived from high-resolution remote sensed imagery (LiDAR - Light Detection - and Ranging and orthophotos). We evaluated the predictive power of the model by computing the mean of the AUC scores obtained through a 5-fold cross-validation and visual inspection of the Hosmer-Lemeshow plot. The integrated PAB approach efficiently captured the different roles played by the drivers of invasion in affecting the presence of the species. Invasion does not proceed homogeneously across the coastal landscape, but is promoted wherever the combined action of the PAB factors is favorable for establishment of the invader. Moreover, the use of remotely sensed data allowed us to model the invader-landscape relationship on a large geographic extent and to highlight the coastal sectors that are most likely to be invaded in the future.

TI  - Quantifying Seagrass Light Requirements Using an Algorithm to Spatially Resolve Depth of Colonization
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Depth of colonization (Z (c)) is a useful seagrass growth metric that describes seagrass response to light availability. Similarly, percent surface irradiance at Z (c) (% SI) is an indicator of seagrass light requirements with applications in seagrass ecology and management. Methods for estimating Z (c) and % SI are highly variable making meaningful comparisons difficult. A new algorithm is presented to compute maps of median and maximum Z (c), Z (c,med), and Z (c,max), respectively, for four Florida coastal areas (Big Bend, Tampa Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, Indian River Lagoon). Maps of light attenuation (K (d)) based on MODIS satellite imagery, PAR profiles, and Secchi depth measurements were combined with seagrass growth estimates to produce maps of % SI at Z (c,med) and Z (c,max). Among estuary segments, mean Z (c,med) varied from (+/- SE) 0.80 +/- 0.13 m for Old Tampa Bay to 2.33 +/- 0.26 m for Western Choctawhatchee Bay. Standard errors for Z (c,med) were 1-10% of the segment means. Percent SI at Z (c,med) averaged 18% for Indian River Lagoon (range = 9-24%), 42% for Tampa Bay (37-48%), and 58% for Choctawhatchee Bay (51-75%). Estimates of % SI were significantly lower in Indian River Lagoon than in the other estuaries, while estimates for Tampa Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay were higher than the often cited estimate of 20%. Spatial gradients in depth of colonization and % SI were apparent in all estuaries. The analytical approach could be applied easily to new data from these estuaries or to other estuaries and could be incorporated routinely in assessments of seagrass status and condition.

TI  - Relationship between Habitat Properties and Composition of Communities in Conifer-Broadleaf Forest
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological and phytocenotic features of forest communities were studied in the southwest of Moscow oblast. Based on the ecomorphological groups of species prevalent in the herb-dwarf shrub and moss layers, five groups of communities typical of the conifer-broadleaf forest zone were distinguished (small-herb, small herb-large herb, large-herb, moist-herb, and mixed-herb communities), and their composition was analyzed. Discriminant analysis of the species composition of lower vegetation layers revealed significant differences between the syntaxa, with the percentage of correct classification being 89.8%. To evaluate ecological determination of the above groups of communities, a hypothesis was tested concerning the correlation of their composition with ecotope properties. This hypothesis was verified by means of (1) ordination by ecological indicator values and interpretation of the axes, (2) revealing differences in ecological regimes between habitats of the syntaxa, and (3) combined analysis of on-ground and remote sensing data, particularly spectral brightness of satellite images and morphometric characteristics of the terrain surface. The results confirmed the informativeness of the syntaxa distinguished based on the species composition of the ground vegetation layer and mapping of the ecological regimes of habitats.

TI  - The connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms: The mediating role of meaning in life
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Depression is characterized by a wide range of emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms. Two prominent features of depressive symptoms are a sense that life has no meaning on the one hand, and that life is not worth living on the other hand. In recent years, the subjective perception of how close one feels to his/her death has gained importance as a significant factor associated with various aspects of physical and psychological wellbeing. Thus, the current study examined the connection between subjective nearness-to-death, meaning in life, and depressive symptoms, and assessed whether meaning in life mediates the connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms. Data was collected from 268 participants between the ages of 28 and 74 (mean age = 46.75), who completed measures of subjective nearness-to-death, meaning in life, and depressive symptoms. Results yielded a significant positive connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms, as well as a negative connection between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Moreover, meaning in life was found to mediate the connection between subjective nearness-to-death and depressive symptoms. Findings are discussed in light of the Terror Management Theory, and potential clinical implications are suggested.

TI  - The Singularity and the Human Condition
T2  - PHILOSOPHY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hannah Arendt's The Human Condition is frequently read as offering a "theory" of what it means to be human. But the bite of Arendt's book is to think through the transformation of the human condition in the modern age. She argues that the rise of a scientific worldview fundamentally alters the earthly and worldly conditions in which human beings live. Since humans are conditioned beings, the change from our pre-modern subjection to fate to our modern human capacity to create a humanly built world threatens a fundamental shift in human being. The transformation Arendt describes is the loss of our human plurality to a technological singularity. She argues, however, that we can choose to hold on to our humanity if we persist in thinking, and thus preserve our human spontaneity and freedom.

TI  - A Methodology to Determine Recipe Adjustments for Multispectral Composites Derived from Next-Generation Advanced Satellite Imagers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) began creating multispectral [i.e., red-green-blue (RGB)] composites in the early 2000s with the advent of the Meteosat-8 Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). As new satellite sensors-for example, the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)-become available, there is a need to adjust the EUMETSAT RGB standard thresholds (i.e., recipes) to account for differences in spectral characteristics, spectral response, and atmospheric absorption in order to maintain an interpretation consistent with legacy composites. For the purpose of comparing RGB composites derived from nonoverlapping geostationary sensors, an adjustment technique was applied to the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to create an intermediate reference sensor (i.e., SEVIRI proxy). Brightness temperature offset values between each AHI and SEVIRI proxy band centered near 3.9, 8.6, 11.0, and 12.0 mu m were determined with this technique and through line-by-line radiative transfer model simulations. The relationship between measured brightness temperature of AHI and the SEVIRI proxy was determined though linear regression similar to research by the Japan Meteorological Agency. The linear regression coefficients were utilized to determine the RGB recipe adjustments. Adjusting the RGB recipes to account for the differences in spectral characteristics results in RGB composites consistent with legacy EUMETSAT composites. The methodology was applied to an example of the Nighttime Microphysics RGB, confirming the Japan Meteorological Agency adjustments and demonstrating a simple methodology to determine recipe adjustments for RGB composites derived with next-generation sensors.

TI  - Tundra plant above-ground biomass and shrub dominance mapped across the North Slope of Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra is becoming greener and shrubbier due to recent warming. This is impacting climate feedbacks and wildlife, yet the spatial distribution of plant biomass in tundra ecosystems is uncertain. In this study, we mapped plant and shrub above-ground biomass (AGB; kgm(-2)) and shrub dominance (%; shrub AGB/plant AGB) across the North Slope of Alaska by linking biomass harvests at 28 field sites with 30 m resolution Landsat satellite imagery. We first developed regression models (p<0.01) to predict plant AGB (r(2) = 0.79) and shrub AGB (r(2) = 0.82) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from imagery acquired by Landsat 5 and 7. We then predicted regional plant and shrub AGB by combining these regression models with a regional Landsat NDVI mosaic built from 1721 summer scenes acquired between 2007 and 2016. Our approach employed a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis that propagated sampling and sensor calibration errors. We estimated that plant AGB averaged 0.74 (0.60, 0.88) kgm(-2) (95% CI) and totaled 112 (91, 135) Tg across the region, with shrub AGB accounting for similar to 43% of regional plant AGB. The new maps capture landscape variation in plant AGB visible in high resolution satellite and aerial imagery, notably shrubby riparian corridors. Modeled shrub AGB was strongly correlated with field measurements of shrub canopy height at 25 sites (r(s) = 0.88) and with a regional map of shrub cover (r(s) = 0.76). Modeled plant AGB and shrub dominance were higher in shrub tundra than graminoid tundra and increased between areas with the coldest and warmest summer air temperatures, underscoring the fact that future warming has the potential to greatly increase plant AGB and shrub dominance in this region. These new biomass maps provide a unique source of ecological information for a region undergoing rapid environmental change.

TI  - Experimental Investigation on Ductile Mode Micro-Milling of ZrO<sub>2</sub> Ceramics with Diamond-Coated End Mills
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - ZrO2 ceramics are currently used in a broad range of industrial applications. However, the machining of post-sintered ZrO2 ceramic is a difficult task, due to its high hardness and brittleness. In this study, micro-milling of ZrO2 with two kinds of diamond-coated end mills has been conducted on a Kern MMP 2522 micro-milling center (Kern Microtechnik GmbH, Eschenlohe, Germany). To achieve a ductile mode machining of ZrO2, the feed per tooth and depth of cut was set in the range of a few micrometers. Cutting force and machined surface roughness have been measured by a Kistler MiniDynamometer (Kistler Group, Winterthur, Switzerland) and a Talysurf 120 L profilometer (Taylor Hobson Ltd., Leicester, UK), respectively. Machined surface topography and tool wear have been examined under SEM. Experiment results show that the material can be removed in ductile mode, and mirror quality surface with Ra low as 0.02 mu m can be achieved. Curled and smooth chips have been collected and observed. The axial cutting force F-z is always bigger than F-x and F-y, and presents a rising trend with increasing of milling length. Tool wear includes delamination of diamond coating and wear of tungsten carbide substrate. Without the protection of diamond coating, the tungsten carbide substrate was worn out quickly, resulting a change of tool tip geometry.

TI  - Global Validation of MODIS C6 and C6.1 Merged Aerosol Products over Diverse Vegetated Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collections 6 and 6.1 merged Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) aerosol products (DTBC6 and DTBC6.1) at 0.55 mu m were validated from 2004-2014 against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 2 Level 2.0 AOD obtained from 68 global sites located over diverse vegetated surfaces. These surfaces were categorized by static values of monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations obtained for the same time period from the MODIS level-3 monthly NDVI product (MOD13A3), i.e., partially/non-vegetated (NDVIP <= 0.3), moderately-vegetated (0.3 < NDVIM <= 0.5) and densely-vegetated (NDVID > 0.5) surfaces. The DTBC6 and DTBC6.1 AOD products are accomplished by the NDVI criteria: (i) use the DT AOD retrievals for NDVI > 0.3, (ii) use the DB AOD retrievals for NDVI < 0.2, and (iii) use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one with highest quality assurance flag (DT: QAF = 3; DB: QAF >= 2) for 0.2 <= NDVI <= 0.3. For comparison purpose, the DTBSMS AOD retrievals were included which were accomplished using the Simplified Merge Scheme, i.e., use an average of the DTC6.1 and DBC6.1 AOD retrievals or the available one for all the NDVI values. For NDVIP surfaces, results showed that the DTBC6 and DTBC6.1 AOD retrievals performed poorly over North and South America in terms of the agreement with AERONET AOD, and over Asian region in terms of retrievals quality as the small percentage of AOD retrievals were within the expected error (EE = +/- (0.05 + 0.15 x AOD). For NDVIM surfaces, retrieval errors and poor quality in DTBC6 and DTBC6.1 were observed for Asian, North American and South American sites, whereas good performance, was observed for European and African sites. For NDVID surfaces, DTBC6 does not perform well over the Asian and North American sites, although it contains retrievals only from the DT algorithm which was developed for dark surfaces. Overall, the performance of the DTBC6.1 AOD retrievals was significantly improved compared to the DTBC6, but still more improvements are required over NDVIP, NDVIM and NDVID surfaces of Asia, NDVIM and NDVID surfaces of North America, and NDVIM surfaces of South America. The performance of the DTBSMS retrievals was better than the DTBC6 and DTBC6.1 retrievals with 11-13% (31%) greater number of coincident observations, 6-9% (14-22%) greater percentage of retrievals within the EE, and 30-100% (46-100%) smaller relative mean bias compared to the DTBC6.1 (DTBC6) at a global scale.

TI  - A New MODIS C6 Dark Target and Deep Blue Merged Aerosol Product on a 3 km Spatial Grid
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection (C6) aerosol products, the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) algorithms provide aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K), and at 10 km resolution (DB10K), respectively. In this study, the DB10K is resampled to 3 km grid (DB3K) using the nearest neighbor interpolation technique and merged with DT3K to generate a new DT and DB merged aerosol product (DTB3K) on a 3 km grid using Simplified Merge Scheme (SMS). The goal is to supplement DB10K with high-resolution information over dense vegetation regions where DT3K is susceptible to error. SMS is defined as "an average of the DT3K and DB3K AOD retrievals or the available one with the highest quality flag". The DT3K and DTB3K AOD retrievals are validated from 2008 to 2012 against cloud-screened and quality-assured AOD from 19 AERONET sites located in Europe. Results show that the percentage of DTB3K retrievals within the expected error (EE = +/-(0.05 + 20%)) and data counts are increased by 40% and 11%, respectively, and the root mean square error and the mean bias are decreased by 26% and 54%, respectively, compared to the DT3K retrievals. These results suggest that the DTB3K product is a robust improvement over DT3K alone, and can be used operationally for air quality and climate-related studies as a high-resolution supplement to the current MODIS product suite.

TI  - Relationships among phenology, climate and biomass across subtropical forests in Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is a key ecosystem process that reflects climate-vegetation functioning, and is an indicator of global environmental changes. Recently, it has been suggested that land-use change and timber extraction promote differences in forest phenology. We use remote-sensing data to describe regional leaf phenological patterns in combination with field data from 131 plots in old-growth and disturbed forests distributed over subtropical forests of Argentina (54-65 degrees W). We assessed how climate is related to phenological patterns, and analysed how changes in forest structural characteristics such as stock of above-ground biomass relate to the observed phenological signals across the gradient. We found that the first three axes of a principal component analysis explained 85% of the variation in phenological metrics across subtropical forests, ordering plots mainly along indicators of seasonality and productivity. At the regional scale, the relative importance of forest biomass in explaining variation in phenological patterns was about 15%. Climate showed the highest relative importance, with temperature and rainfall explaining Enhanced Vegetation Index metrics related to seasonality and productivity patterns (27% and 47%, respectively). Within forest types, climate explains the major fraction of variation in phenological patterns, suggesting that forest function may be particularly sensitive to climate change. We found that forest biomass contributed to explaining a proportion of leaf phenological variation within three of the five forest types studied, and this may be related to changes in species composition, probably as a result of forest use.

AB  - Professional ideals arise from personal worldviews and specify teachers' professional identities. This study aimed to explore how faith is present in the professional ideals of Christian teachers. The professional ideals of 107 Dutch teachers from conservative Protestant primary and secondary schools were explored using an open-ended questionnaire. The ideal educational aims and contents were closely connected: the ultimate essence of teaching was defined as passing on images of the perfect Christian person by modelling. Faith was represented by non-substantial religious ideals that are related to social behavior. Ideals about didactical strategies and teaching materials which demonstrate teachers' Christian worldview were hardly found.

TI  - Optical, microphysical and radiative properties of aerosols over a tropical rural site in Kenya, East Africa: Source identification, modification and aerosol type discrimination
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties is a crucial challenge for climate change studies. In the present study, column-integrated aerosol optical and radiative properties observed at a rural site, Mbita (0.42 degrees S, 34.20 degrees E, and 1125 m above sea level) located in Kenya, East Africa (EA) are investigated using ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data retrieved during January, 2007 to December, 2015. The annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD(500) (nm)), Angstrom exponent (AE(440-870) (nm)), fine mode fraction of AOD(500) tun (FMF500 (nm)), and columnar water vapor (CWV, cm) were found to be 0.23 +/- 0.08, 1.01 +/- 0.16, 0.60 +/- 0.07, and 2.72 +/- 0.20, respectively. The aerosol optical properties exhibited a unimodal distribution with substantial seasonal heterogeneity in their peak values being low (high) during the local wet (dry) seasons. The observed data showed that Mbita and its environs are significantly influenced by various types of aerosols, with biomass burning and/or urban-industrial (BUI), mixed (MXD), and desert dust (DDT) aerosol types contributing to 37.72%, 32.81%, and 1.40%, respectively during the local dry season (JJA). The aerosol volume size distribution (VSD) exhibited bimodal lognormal structure with a geometric mean radius of 0.15 mu m and 3.86-5.06 mu m for fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Further, analysis of single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter (ASY) and refractive index (RI) revealed dominance of fine-mode absorbing aerosols during JJA. The averaged aerosol direct radiative forcing (ARF) retrieved from the AERONET showed a strong cooling effect at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) and significant warming within the atmosphere (ATM), representing the important role of aerosols played in this rural site of Kenya. Finally, the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed that aerosols from distinct sources resulted in enhanced loading during JJA.

AB  - The growth of the telephone network and the availability of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) have both contributed to the availability of a flexible and easy to use artifact for users, but also to a significant increase in cyberecriminal activity. These criminals use emergent technologies to conduct illegal and suspicious activities. For instance, they use VoIP's flexibility to abuse and scam victims. According to (F. I. F.. N. D. N. C. R. D. Book, Available at: https://www. ftc. gov/news-events/press-releases/2016/12/ftc-issues- fy-2016-national-do-not-call-registry-data-book, accessed on: 27 August 2017), US government revealed receiving more than 5.3 million telephony abuse complaints in 2016. Based on this report, more than 226 million phone numbers were registered on the Do Not Call Registry list as not to receive tele-marketing calls. For instance, they use VoIP's flexibility to abuse and scam victims. A lot of interest has been expressed into the analysis and assessment of telephony cyber-threats. A better understanding of these types of abuse is required in order to detect, mitigate, and attribute these attacks. The purpose of this research work is to generate relevant and timely telephony abuse intelligence that can support the mitigation and/or the investigation of such activities. To achieve this objective, we present, in this paper, the design and implementation of a Telephony Abuse Intelligence Framework (TAINT) that automatically aggregates, analyzes and reports on telephony abuse activities. We deploy our framework on a large dataset of telephony complaints, spanning over seven years, to provide in-depth insights and intelligence about emerging telephony threats. The framework presented in this paper is of a paramount importance when it comes to the mitigation, the prevention and the attribution of telephony abuse incidents. We analyze the data and report on the complaint distribution, the used numbers and the spoofed callers' identifiers. In addition, we identify and geo-locate the sources of the phone calls, and further investigate the underlying telephony threats. Moreover, we quantify the similarity between reported phone numbers to unveil potential groups that are behind specific telephony abuse activities that are actually launched as telephony abuse campaigns.

TI  - Mapping of slow landslides on the Palos Verdes Peninsula using the California landslide inventory and persistent scatterer interferometry
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Extremely slow landslides, those with a displacement rate < 16 mm/year, may be imperceptible without proper instrumentation. These landslides can cause infrastructure damage on a long-term timescale. The objective is to identify these landslides through the combination of information from the California landslide inventory (CLI) and ground displacement rates using results from persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) stacking technique, across the Palos Verdes Peninsula in California. A total of 34 ENVISAT radar images (acquired between 2005 and 2010) and 40 COSMO-SkyMed radar images (acquired between 2012 and 2014) were processed. An InSAR landslide inventory (ILI) is created using four criteria: minimum PS count, average measured ground velocity, slope angle, and slope aspect. The ILI is divided into four categories: long-term slides (LTSs), potentially active slides (PASs), relatively stable slopes (RSSs), and unmapped extremely slow slides (UESSs). These categories are based on whether landslides were previously mapped on that slope (in the CLI), if persistent scatterers (PSs) are present, and whether PSs are unstable or stable. The final inventory includes 263 mapped landslides across the peninsula, of them 67 landslides were identified as UESS. Although UESS exhibit low velocity and are relatively small (average area of 8865 m(2) per slide), their presence in a highly populated area such as the Palos Verdes Peninsula could lead to destruction of infrastructure and property over the long term.

TI  - Introducing a globally consistent orbital-based localization system
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of the good performance of space exploratory missions, open issues still await to be solved. In autonomous or composite semi-autonomous exploration of planetary land surfaces, rover localization is such an issue. The rovers of these missions (e.g., the MER and MSL) navigate relatively to their landing spot, ignoring their exact position on the coordinate system defined for the celestial body they explore. However, future advanced missions, like the Mars Sample Return, will require the localization of rovers on a global frame rather than the arbitrarily defined landing frame. In this paper we attempt to retrieve the absolute rover's location by identifying matching Regions of Interest (ROIs) between orbital and land images. In particular, we propose a system comprising two parts, an offline and an onboard one, which functions as follows: in advance of the mission a Global ROI Network (GN) is built offline by investigating the satellite images near the predicted touchdown ellipse, while during the mission a Local ROI Network (LN) is constructed counting on the images acquired by the vision system of the rover along its traverse. The last procedure relies on the accurate VO-based relative rover localization. The LN is then paired with the GN through a modified 2D DARCES algorithm. The system has been assessed on real data collected by the ESA at the Atacama desert. The results demonstrate the system's potential to perform absolute localization, on condition that the area includes discriminative ROIs. The main contribution of this work is the enablement of global localization performed on contemporary rovers without requiring any additional hardware, such as long range LIDARs.

TI  - A novel decision support system for the interpretation of remote sensing big data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of remote sensing (RS) data cover several fields such as: cartography, surveillance, land-use planning, archaeology, environmental studies, resources management, etc. However, the amount of RS data has grown considerably due to the increase of aerial and satellite sensors. With this continuous increase, the necessity of having automated tools for the interpretation and analysis of RS big data is clearly obvious. The manual interpretation becomes a time consuming and expensive task. In this paper, a novel tool for interpreting and analyzing RS big data is described. The proposed system allows knowledge gathering for decision support in RS fields. It helps users easily make decisions in many fields related to RS by providing descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. The paper outlines the design and development of a framework based on three steps: RS data acquisition, modeling, and analysis & interpretation. The performance of the proposed system has been demonstrated through three models: clustering, decision tree and association rules. Results show that the proposed tool can provide efficient decision support (descriptive and predictive) which can be adapted to several RS users' requests. Additionally, assessing these results show good performances of the developed tool.

T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bats carry a great diversity of zoonotic viruses with a high-impact on human health and livestock. Since the emergence of new coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in humans (e.g. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Nipah virus), numerous studies clearly established that bats can maintain some of these viruses. Improving our understanding on the role of bats in the epidemiology of the pathogens they harbour is necessary to prevent cross-species spill over along the wild/domestic/human gradient. In this study, we screened bat faecal samples for the presence of Coronavirus and Paramyxovirus in two caves frequently visited by local people to collect manure and/or to hunt bats in Zimbabwe. We amplified partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of Alpha and Betacoronavirus together with the partial polymerase gene of Paramyxovirus. Identified coronaviruses were related to pathogenic human strains and the paramyxovirus belonged to the recently described Jeilongvirus genus. Our results highlighted the importance of monitoring virus circulation in wildlife, especially bats, in the context of intense human-wildlife interfaces in order to strengthen prevention measures among local populations and to implement sentinel surveillance in sites with high zoonotic diseases transmission potential.

TI  - An above-ground biomass map of African savannahs and woodlands at 25 m resolution derived from ALOS PALSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannahs and woodlands are among the most important biomes in Africa: they cover half of sub-Saharan Africa, provide vital ecosystem services to the rural communities, and play a major part in the carbon budget. Despite their importance and their fragility, they are much less studied than other ecosystems like rainforests. In particular, the distribution and amount of the above-ground woody biomass (AGB) is largely unknown. In this paper, we produce the first continental map of the AGB of African savannahs and woodlands at a resolution of 25 m. The map is built from the 2010 L-band PALSAR mosaic produced by JAXA, along the following steps: a) stratification into wet/dry season areas in order to account for seasonal effects, b) development of a direct model relating the PALSAR backscatter to AGB, with the help of in situ and ancillary data, c) Bayesian inversion of the direct model. A value of AGB and its uncertainty has been assigned to each pixel. This approach allows estimating AGB until 85 Mg.ha(-1) approximately, while dense forests and non-vegetated areas are masked out using the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset. The resulting map is visually compared with existing AGB maps and is validated using a cross-validation approach and a comparison with AGB estimates obtained from LiDAR datasets, leading to an RMSD of 8 to 17 Mg.ha(-1). Finally, carbon stocks for savannahs in Africa and in 50 countries are estimated and compared with estimates by FAO and from AGB maps available over Africa.

TI  - Investigation of optical and radiative properties of aerosols during an intense dust storm: A regional climate modeling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamical and optical properties of aerosols during an intense dust storm event over the Arabian Sea have been studied using Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and space borne instruments such as MODIS, MISR, CALIPSO and CERES during the period 17 to 24 March, 2012. The model captures the spatio-temporal and vertical variations of meteorological and optical parameters, however an overestimation in simulated aerosol optical parameters are observed when compared to satellite retrievals. The correlation coefficients (R) between simulated and observed AOD from MODIS and MISR are found to be 0.54 and 0.32 respectively. Model simulated AOD on dusty days (20 and 21 March 2012) increased by 2-3 times compared to non-dusty days (17 and 24 March 2012) and the single scattering albedo (SSA) and the asymmetry parameter increased from 0.96 to 0.99 and from 0.56 to 0.66, respectively. The R between simulated shortwave (SW) radiation at top of the atmosphere (TOA) and TOA SW radiation obtained from CERES is found to be 0.43, however the model simulated SW radiation at the TOA showed an underestimation with respect to CERES. The shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (SWARF) during the event over surface and TOA are similar to-19.3 and similar to-14.2 Wm(-2) respectively, which is about 2-5 times higher when compared to the respective forcing values during non-dust days. Estimated net radiative forcing was in the range of -13 to -21 Wm(-2) at TOA and -12 to -20 Wm(-2) at the surface. The heating rate during event days within the lower atmosphere near 850 hPa is found to 0.32 - 0.4 K day(-1) and 0.18 - 0.22 K day(-1) on dusty and non-dusty days, respectively. Results of this study may be useful for a better modeling of atmospheric aerosols and its optical and radiative properties over oceanic region.

TI  - Assessment of the Northern Cod (Gadus morhua) stock in NAFO Divisions 2J3KL in 2016.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock that inhabits waters off southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland eastward to the edge of the continental shelf in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Divisions (Divs.) 2J3KL was assessed through a Regional Peer Review Process (RPR) conducted during March 21-24 and March 30-31, 2016 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). This stock is currently under a three-year management cycle, and the current assessment provided catch advice for 2016-18. The assessment also identified an indicator (based on 3 year projections of DFO research vessel (RV) total (2+) biomass) that could be used to determine whether a full assessment is warranted during interim years. The current assessment was based mainly on a new state-space population dynamics model (Northern Cod Assessment Model, NCAM) that integrates much of the existing information about the productivity of the stock. Key features of the new model are that it provides annual estimates of natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) rates along with measures of uncertainty; the model also estimates catch and requires an interval identifying a likely range of catch (upper and lower bounds). The model integrates information from DFO RV autumn trawl surveys (1983-2015), Sentinel fishery surveys (1995-2014), inshore acoustic surveys (1995-2009) fishery catch age compositions, and partial fishery landings (1983--2015), and tagging (1983-2015). The latest assessment indicated that stock abundance (ages 2+) has increased from 194 million cod in 2005 to 894 million in 2015. Total biomass (ages 2+) has increased from 78 Kt in 2005 to 539 Kt in 2015. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased from 25 Kt in 2005 to 300 Kt in 2015. Recruitment (age 2) improved slightly in the last decade and the average number of age 2s from the 2011-13 year classes corresponds to about 25% of the numbers of age 2s observed in year classes of the 1980s. Stock status is improving, increasing from 3% of Blim in 2005 to 34% of Blim in 2015, but SSB has been well into the critical zone since the stock collapse. Three year projections (to 2018) were also undertaken to investigate the potential impact of a range of catch options from zero catch (no fishing) to a 5-fold increase in catch, based on model estimates of total catch for 2015 (6,900 t). The results indicated a high probability of achieving a 3-year 28% SSB interim growth milestone over the full range of catch options. Projections also indicate a low risk (< 4%) that SSB will decline by 2018 to below the 2015 value, but also a low probability (5-8%) that the stock will grow out of the critical zone and exceed Blim in 2018. The stock is projected to grow but still be much less than Blim (60-66%) and remain in the critical zone in 2018 over the full range of catch options considered, including no fishing. Consistency with the DFO decision-making framework incorporating the precautionary approach requires that removals from all sources must be kept at the lowest possible level until the stock clears the critical zone.

TI  - Professional identity development: Learning and journeying together
T2  - RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pharmacy students start to develop their professional values through engagement with the course, practice exposure, staff and fellow students. Group working is an element of pedagogy which draws on the social aspects of learning to facilitate knowledge and skills development, but its potential role in facilitating professional identity formation has as yet been under researched.Objectives: This study aimed to explore the potential of mutual learning through group work to contribute not only to academic knowledge and understanding, but also to the development of students' professional values and selves.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 home and international first year undergraduate pharmacy students in a UK School of Pharmacy, to explore their experiences of interacting for learning with other students on the course.Findings: Thematic analysis of the interview data highlighted four main benefits of mutual learning, which are that it: promotes friendly interactions; aids learning about the subject and the profession; opens the mind through different opinions and ways of thinking; and enables learning about other people. Through working together students developed their communication skills and confidence; reflectively considered their own stance in the light of others' experiences and healthcare perspectives; and started to gain a wider worldview, potentially informing their future interactions with patients and colleagues. Some difficulties arose when group interactions functioned less well.Conclusions: Opportunity for collaboration and exchange can positively influence development of students' professional outlook and values. However, careful management of group working is required, in order to create a mutually supportive environment wherein students feel able to interact, share and develop together. (C) 2017 The Author.

M3  - Article
AB  - In water-limited landscapes, patterns in primary production are highly variable across space and time. Livestock grazing is a common agricultural practice worldwide and a concern is localized overuse of specific pasture resources that can exacerbate grass losses and soil erosion. On a research ranch in New Mexico with average annual rainfall of 217 mm, we demonstrate with a quantitative approach that annual seasons vary greatly and examine foraging patterns in Angus-Hereford (Bos taurus) cows. We define five seasonal stages based on MODIS NDVI: pre-greenup, greenup, peak green, drydown and dormant, and examine livestock movements in 2008. Daily distance traveled by cows was greater and foraging area expanded during periods with higher precipitation. A regression model including minimum NDVI, rainfall and their interaction explained 81% of the seasonal variation in distance traveled by cows (P < 0.01). Cows explored about 81 ha center dot d(-1) while foraging, but tended to explore smaller areas as the pasture became greener (greenup and peak green stages). Cows foraged an average of 9.7 h daily and spent more time foraging with more concentrated search patterns as pastures became greener. Our findings suggest that phenological context can expand the capacity to compare and integrate findings, and facilitate meta-analyses of grazing studies conducted at different locations and times of year.

TI  - Real-Time Fluorescent Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping with Indocyanine Green in Women with Previous Conization Undergoing Laparoscopic Surgery for Early Invasive Cervical Cancer: Comparison with Radiotracer ± Blue Dye
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate the added value of the fluorescence dye indocyanine green (ICG) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with cervical cancer who had undergone previous conization (stage 1A-1B1) by comparing ICG versus Tc99(m) radiotracer + blue dye (BD).Design: Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: Two European academic medical centers, San Gerardo Hospital, Italy and University of Berne, Switzerland.Patients: Sixty-five women with early stage (IA-IB1) cervical cancer who had undergone previous conization and who underwent SLN mapping with Tc99(m) +/- BD (n = 23) or ICG (n = 42) followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy and fertility-sparing surgery or hysterectomy were included in this analysis.Intervention: Overall detection rate and bilateral SLN mapping rates of ICG were compared with those obtained using the standard Tc99(m) radiocolloid and BD.Measurement and Main Results: Overall, 220 SLNs were detected. The median number of SLNs per patient in the Tc99(m) +/- BD group was 2 (range, 1-5) and in the ICG group, 3 (range, 2-15). The detection rate of SLNs was 95.7% in Tc99(m) +/- BD group and 100% in the ICG group (p=.354). The women injected with ICG had a higher rate of bilateral mapping of the SLNs as compared with the Tc99(m) +/- BD group (95.2% vs 69.6%, p=.016%). Only 12% of the patients (8/65) presented metastatic nodes, 2 in the Tc99(m) +/- BD group and 6 in the ICG group.Conclusion: In early-stage cervical cancer patients conization had no significant impact on the SLN detection rate using both techniques (ICG and radiotracer +/- BD). In this scenario a higher bilateral mapping rate was confirmed using the fluorescent dye ICG rather than the standard techniques. (C) 2017 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - IgE promotes type 2 innate lymphoid cells in murine food allergy
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMast cells serve an important sentinel function at mucosal barriers and have been implicated as key early inducers of type 2 immune responses in food allergy. The generation of Th2 and IgE following food allergen ingestion is inhibited in the absence of mast cells. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells are also thought to play an important early role in nascent allergic responses.ObjectiveTo test whether IgE-mediated mast cell activation promotes intestinal ILC2 responses following ingestion of food allergens and whether ILC2 amplify food allergy.MethodsTwo different mouse models of food allergy, one using intraperitoneally ovalbumin (OVA)-primed BALB/c animals and the other using enterally peanut-sensitized inherently atopic IL4raF709 mice, were applied to test the contributions of IgE antibodies and mast cells to ILC2 responses. The effect of ILC2 on mast cell activation and on anaphylaxis was tested.ResultsILC2 responses were significantly impaired in both models of food allergy in Igh7(-/-) mice harbouring a targeted deletion of the gene encoding IgE. A similar reduction in food allergen-induced ILC2 was observed in mast cell-deficient Il4raF709 Kit(W-sh) mice, and this was partially corrected by reconstituting these animals using cultured bone marrow mast cells. Mast cells activated ILC2 for IL-13 production in an IL-4R-dependent manner. Activated ILC2 amplified systemic anaphylaxis by increasing target tissue sensitivity to mast cell mediators.Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceThese findings support an important role for IgE-activated mast cells in driving intestinal ILC2 expansion in food allergy and reveal that ILC2, in turn, can enhance responsiveness to the mediators of anaphylaxis produced by mast cells. Strategies designed to inhibit IgE signalling or mast cell activation are likely to inhibit both type 2 immunity and immediate hypersensitivity in food allergy.

TI  - Pedicled Descending Branch Latissimus Dorsi Mini-flap for Repairing Partial Mastectomy Defect: A New Technique
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Volume loss is 1 of the major factors influencing cosmetic outcomes of breast after partial mastectomy (PM), especially for smaller breasts, and therefore, volume replacement is critical for optimizing the final aesthetic outcome. We present a novel technique of raising a pedicled descending branch latissimus dorsi (LD) mini-flap for reconstruction of PM defects via an axillary incision. After PM, the LD mini-flap is harvested through the existing axillary incision of the axillary dissection or the sentinel lymph node biopsy. The descending branches of thoracodorsal vessels and nerve are carefully identified and isolated. The transverse branches are protected to maintain muscle innervation and function. The LD muscle is then undermined posteriorly and inferiorly to create a submuscular pocket and a subcutaneous pocket between LD muscle and superficial fascia. Once the submuscular plane is created, the muscle is divided along the muscle fibers from the deep surface including a layer of fat above the muscle. Finally, the LD mini-flap is transferred to the breast defect. Given the limited length and mobility of the LD mini-flap, this approach is best utilized for lateral breast defects. However, for medial defects, the lateral breast tissue is rearranged to reconstruct the medial breast defect, and an LD mini-flap is then used to reconstruct the lateral breast donor site. This technique can therefore be employed to reconstruct all quadrants of the breast and can provide aesthetic outcomes without scars on the back, with minimal dysfunction of LD muscle.

TI  - Effect of Topical Anesthetic Cream on Pain During Periareolar Injection of Technetium Tc99m Sulfur Colloid for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: A Randomized Control Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Injection of Tc99m to localize nodes for sentinel lymph node biopsy is reported by patients as very painful. The purpose of this study was to determine if anesthetic cream reduces pain associated with periareolar injection of Tc99m and to help elucidate conflicting literature regarding the efficacy of anesthetic cream for this procedure.Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology was used for adult females with breast cancer undergoing periareolar injection of Tc99m for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pain levels were compared using anesthetic cream (2.5% lidocaine/2.5% prilocaine) vs. placebo. Patient exclusion criteria included use of opioids or adjuvant pain medication or injecting Tc99m the day before surgery. The Numerical Rating Scale was used to assess pain levels immediately after the injections.Results: Comparing 23 experimental and 26 control patients, there was no significant difference between the experimental (median = 4) and the control group (median = 5) on level of pain experienced U = 0.492, P > .05.Conclusions: The experimental group had a slightly lower median pain score; however, there was no statistically significant difference between those who used the cream compared with those who used a placebo, supporting the conclusion that anesthetic cream does not reduce pain during Tc99m injections. This study adds to the current literature to provide a stronger position that there is no benefit to using anesthetic cream for this procedure.

TI  - Use of LANDSAT 8 images for depth and water quality assessment of El Guajaro reservoir, Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of using Landsat 8 spectral images to estimate water quality parameters and depth in El Guajaro Reservoir. On February and March 2015, two samplings were carried out in the reservoir, coinciding with the Landsat 8 images. Turbidity, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH and depth were evaluated. Through multiple regression analysis between measured water quality parameters and the reflectance of the pixels corresponding to the sampling stations, statistical models with determination coefficients between 0.6249 and 0.9300 were generated. Results indicate that from a small number of measured parameters we can generate reliable models to estimate the spatial variation of turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH and depth, as well the temporal variation of electrical conductivity, so models generated from Landsat 8 can be used as a tool to facilitate the environmental, economic and social management of the reservoir.

TI  - Springs as hydrologic refugia in a changing climate? A remote-sensing approach
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring-fed wetlands are ecologically important habitats in arid and semi-arid regions. Springs have been suggested as possible hydrologic refugia from droughts and climate change; however, springs that depend on recent precipitation or snowmelt for recharge may be vulnerable to warming and drought intensification. Springs that are expected to maintain their ecohydrologic function in a warmer, drier climate may be priorities for conservation and restoration. Identifying such springs is difficult because many springs lack hydrologic records of adequate temporal extent and resolution to assess their resilience to water cycle changes. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept for the assessment of certain spring types (i.e., helocrene, hypocrene, and hillslope springs) in terms of hydrologic and ecological resilience to climatic water stress using freely available remote-sensing and climate data. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1985 through 2011 to delineate surface-moisture zones (SMZs) associated with 39 clusters of 172 springs in a montane sage-steppe landscape in southeastern Oregon, USA. We developed and synthesized seven NDVI-based indicators of SMZ resilience to interannual changes in water availability: (1) mean and (2) standard deviation of July NDVI; (3) mean difference in July NDVI and (4) difference in coefficient of variation for July NDVI between each SMZ and its surrounding watershed; (5) response of SMZ July NDVI to 90-day antecedent precipitation; (6) response of SMZ July NDVI to the previous winter's snowpack; and (7) range of NDVI values from an exceptionally wet year followed by three dry years. Because all resilience indicators were highly inter-correlated, we derived an overall metric of SMZ resilience using principal components analysis that accounted for 66% of total variance. This overall resilience score was positively correlated with SMZ elevation, slope, mean annual precipitation, and with the number of associated springs. Resilience was greater for SMZs on topographically shaded, north-facing slopes. Several high-resilience SMZs were located immediately below persistent snowbanks, suggesting a possible source of steady recharge throughout the growing season. The approach presented here-if combined with field assessments of spring hydrogeology, discharge, and groundwater age-could help identify spring-fed wetlands that are most likely to serve as hydrologic refugia from climate change.

TI  - Incidence of human brucellosis in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania in the periods 2007-2008 and 2012-2014
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Brucellosis causes substantial morbidity among humans and their Livestock. There are few robust estimates of the incidence of brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Using cases identified through sentinel hospital surveillance and health care utilization data, we estimated the incidence of brucellosis in Moshi Urban and Moshi Rural Districts, Kilimanjaro Region, Tanzania, for the periods 2007-2008 and 2012-2014.Methods: Cases were identified among febrile patients at two sentinel hospitals and were defined as having either a 4-fold increase in Brucella microscopic agglutination test titres between acute and convalescent serum or a blood culture positive for Brucella spp. Findings from a health care utilization survey were used to estimate multipliers to account for cases not seen at sentinel hospitals.Results: Of 585 patients enrolled in the period 2007-2008, 13 (2.2%) had brucellosis. Among 1095 patients enrolled in the period 2012-2014, 32 (2.9%) had brucellosis. We estimated an incidence (range based on sensitivity analysis) of brucellosis of 35 (range 32-93) cases per 100 000 persons annually in the period 2007-2008 and 33 (range 30-89) cases per 100 000 persons annually in the period 2012-2014.Conclusions: We found a moderate incidence of brucellosis in northern Tanzania, suggesting that the disease is endemic and an important human health problem in this area.

TI  - Fracture characterization in sigmoidal folds: Insights from the Siah Kuh anticline, Zagros, Iran
T2  - AAPG BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Fieldwork and remote-sensing data from the Siah Kuh anticline, simply folded belt, Zagros, Iran indicate that specific structures and fracture systems formed during the development of its sigmoidal shape, and that conceptual fracture models developed for cylindrical folds are inadequate for the correct evaluation and development of hydrocarbon accumulations in this type of anticline. The sigmoidal shape of the Siah Kuh anticline was achieved in the Pliocene due to vertical axis rotations of an already existing anticline. These rotations promoted the development of (1) two systems of normal faults in the outer arcs of the sigmoidal shape, (2) a low-angle thrust, and (3) the north-south Danan anticline in the inner arc of its easternmost bend. The passive margin to syn-folding structures, typically observed in nearby cylindrical and periclinal anticlines, predated the development of the sigmoidal shape and were passively rotated into the segments of the anticline. The sigmoid-related structures are spatially, geometrically, and kinematically related to the bends of the anticline trend, hence they can be predicted and modeled in the subsurface. The sigmoid-related normal faults have a great potential to preserve porosity and promote localized high flow rates or early water breakthrough. However, if they cut through thin reservoir and seal units, sigmoid-related thrusts and normal faults might compromise lateral reservoir continuity and seal integrity. The results of this study can help in reducing risks and uncertainty in the evaluation and development of business opportunities in secondary sigmoidal anticlines within the Zagros or any other fold-thrust belt.

TI  - Wetlands and Malaria in the Amazon: Guidelines for the Use of Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote-Sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, are important health issues in tropical areas. Malaria transmission is a multi-scale process strongly controlled by environmental factors, and the use of remote-sensing data is suitable for the characterization of its spatial and temporal dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is well-adapted to tropical areas, since it is capable of imaging independent of light and weather conditions. In this study, we highlight the contribution of SAR sensors in the assessment of the relationship between vectors, malaria and the environment in the Amazon region. More specifically, we focus on the SAR-based characterization of potential breeding sites of mosquito larvae, such as man-made water collections and natural wetlands, providing guidelines for the use of SAR capabilities and techniques in order to optimize vector control and malaria surveillance. In light of these guidelines, we propose a framework for the production of spatialized indicators and malaria risk maps based on the combination of SAR, entomological and epidemiological data to support malaria risk prevention and control actions in the field.

TI  - MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSIS IN THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM OF LANDSAT-TM IMAGES THROUGH WAVELET TRANSFORM
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite images are tools that allow the analysis of phenomena developed on the Earth's surface without being in contact. It is a raster model so it is possible to decompose it into a digital signal. There is a certain data that presents alterations (noise) due to errors caused by the sensors, atmospheric conditions, among others. Such examples affect its use and its derived products. Satellite images by their nature present difficulty in their processing and handling due to the considerable weight they have; whose problem justified the present work. The objective is to minimize white noise and to compress the image with the least possible loss of information through the Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) technique and Wavelet transformation. The images worked belong to the National Recreation Area "El Boliche" (Ecuador) that is next to the Cotopaxi volcano. Through a standard deviation evaluation of the obtained wavelet coefficients, the order of the "Discrete Wavelet Transform" (DWT) was established in the Daubechies (db) and Haar families With db3 level 4, obtained a compression of 11.268% in respect to the original weight and with Haar level 4 11.288% as the best results. The wavelet db is more effective than the Haar type for the treatment of multispectral satellite images in the elimination of white noise and compression by means of the MRA, with a reconstruction of the signal without loss of information due to the type of wavelet used, which is evidenced in the image.

TI  - Furthering Precision in Sentinel Node Navigational Surgery for Oral Cancer: a Novel Triple Targeting System
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUORESCENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To describe an innovative sentinel lymph node (SLN) guidance approach using a radionuclide tracer, 3D augmented reality-guided imaging, and near infrared (NIR) fluorescence over-lay imaging with hand-held probes to optimize accuracy, efficiency, and precise navigation for sentinel node (SN) localization in head and neck cancer. In a cT1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, pre-operative radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy was performed with a sentinel node-specific radiolabeled tracer. Intraoperatively, a 3D hand-held augmented reality (AR) scanning SPECT probe assessed concordance of the SN with pre-operative SPECT-CT images. The real-time optical video was linked to the SPECT-CT images for added precision. Final guidance to the SN was performed using ICG fluorescence imaging. Dynamic and SPECT-CT showed bilateral lymphatic drainage from the tumor. The 3D hand-held AR SPECT probe SN localization was concordant with pre-operative imaging. The optical video successfully demonstrated the lymphatic drainage in real-time through a unique overlay fluorescence image. The ICG localized to the same nodes identified by both the SPECT-CT and hand-held SPECT images. The use of dual radiation and fluorescence tracers improved SN detection, especially for SN close to the injection site. The hand-held probes allowed the surgeon to dissect continuously, without needing to change tools. The combination of augmented reality, nuclear medicine, and over-lay fluorescence imaging allowed greater accuracy for matching the preoperative imaging with intraoperative identification and precisely guiding the dissection. This method uniquely permitted the surgeon to efficiently dissect the SN with accurate visualization and optimal precision.

TI  - Mapping Forest and Their Spatial-Temporal Changes From 2007 to 2015 in Tropical Hainan Island by Integrating ALOS/ALOS-2 L-Band SAR and Landsat Optical Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring forest dynamics in the tropical regions is essential for ecological studies and forest management. In this study, images from phase-array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR), PALSAR-2, and Landsat in 2006-2010 and 2015 were combined to identify tropical forest dynamics on Hainan Island, China. Annual forest maps were first mapped from PALSAR and PALSAR-2 images using structural metrics. Those pixels with a high biomass of sugarcane or banana, which are widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics and have similar structural metrics as forests, were excluded from the SAR-based forest maps by using phenological metrics from time series Landsat imagery. The optical-SAR-based forest maps in 2010 and 2015 had high overall accuracies (OA) of 92-97% when validated with ground reference data. The resultant forest map in 2010 shows good spatial agreement with public optical- based forest maps (OA = 88-90%), and the annual forest maps (2007-2010) were spatiotemporally consistent and more accurate than the PALSAR-based forest map from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (OA = 82% in 2010). The areas of forest gain, loss, and net change on Hainan Island from 2007 to 2015 were 415 000 ha (+2.17% yr(-1)), 179 000 ha (-0.94% yr(-1)), and 236 000 ha (+1.23% yr(-1)), respectively. About 95% of forest gain and loss occurred in those areas with an elevation less than 400 m, where deciduous rubber, eucalyptus plantations, and urbanization expanded rapidly. This study demonstrates the potential of PALSAR/PALSAR-2/Landsat image fusion for monitoring annual forest dynamics in the tropical regions.

TI  - A practical trial of landslide detection from single-temporal Landsat8 images using contour-based proposals and random forest: a case study of national Nepal
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are frequent all around the world, causing tremendous loss to human beings. Rapid access to the locations where landslides occur is crucial for emergency response. Most researches in landslide detection from remotely sensed images focus on small regions, which are handpicked. That makes it easy to distinguish landslides from background objects, but hard to apply in practical cases. The complicated non-landslide background pixels increase the difficulty to accurately detect landslides. In this study, we propose a technique framework to remove non-landslide background pixels for national Nepal using 12 Landsat8 images and digital elevation model (DEM). DEM is useful in removing flat areas, where landslides are less likely to occur. The framework consists of three sections: image enhancement, landslide proposal extraction, and detection model setup. Bare land, including landslides, is enhanced using vegetation index after haze/ cloud re-movement. Later, calculate connective contours and propose them as potential regions that may contain landslides. For each proposal, calculate texture feature and build detection model using one of the Landsat8 images, which is further applied on other images to check its applicability and robustness. The assessment shows that the method is able to remove 99% of the background pixels in the scale of national Nepal, taking over billions of pixels. Even there is still much to do to achieve high accurate landslide detection results from large-scale images, the experiment validates a strong potential applicability for the proposed method in large-scale landslide-related analysis.

TI  - Fast Automatic Airport Detection in Remote Sensing Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and automatic detection of airports from remote sensing images is useful for many military and civilian applications. In this paper, a fast automatic detection method is proposed to detect airports from remote sensing images based on convolutional neural networks using the Faster R-CNN algorithm. This method first applies a convolutional neural network to generate candidate airport regions. Based on the features extracted from these proposals, it then uses another convolutional neural network to perform airport detection. By taking the typical elongated linear geometric shape of airports into consideration, some specific improvements to the method are proposed. These approaches successfully improve the quality of positive samples and achieve a better accuracy in the final detection results. Experimental results on an airport dataset, Landsat 8 images, and a Gaofen-1 satellite scene demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - Assimilation of Feng-Yun-3B Satellite Microwave Humidity Sounder Data over Land
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ECMWF has been assimilating Feng-Yun-3B (FY-3B) satellite microwave humidity sounder (MWHS) data over ocean in an operational forecasting system since 24 September 2014. It is more difficult, however, to assimilate microwave observations over land and sea ice than over the open ocean due to higher uncertainties in land surface temperature, surface emissivity and less effective cloud screening. We compare approaches in which the emissivity is retrieved dynamically from MWHS channel 1 [150 GHz (vertical polarization)] with the use of an evolving emissivity atlas from 89 GHz observations from the MWHS onboard NOAA and EUMETSAT satellites. The assimilation of the additional data over land improves the fit of short-range forecasts to other observations, notably ATMS (Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder) humidity channels, and the forecast impacts are mainly neutral to slightly positive over the first five days. The forecast impacts are better in boreal summer and the Southern Hemisphere. These results suggest that the techniques tested allow for effective assimilation of MWHS/FY-3B data over land.

TI  - Sequential combination of multi-source satellite observations for separation of surface deformation associated with serial seismic events
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Single satellite geodetic technique has weakness for mapping sequence of ground deformation associated with serial seismic events, like InSAR with long revisiting period readily leading to mixed complex deformation signals from multiple events. It challenges the observation capability of single satellite geodetic technique for accurate recognition of individual surface deformation and earthquake model. The rapidly increasing availability of various satellite observations provides good solution for overcoming the issue. In this study, we explore a sequential combination of multiple overlapping datasets from ALOS/PALSAR, ENVISAT/ASAR and GPS observations to separate surface deformation associated with the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki major quake and two strong aftershocks including the Mw 6.6 Iwaki and Mw 5.8 Ibaraki events. We first estimate the fault slip model of major shock with ASAR interferometry and GPS displacements as constraints. Due to the used PALSAR interferogram spanning the period of all the events, we then remove the surface deformation of major shock through forward calculated prediction thus obtaining PALSAR InSAR deformation associated with the two strong aftershocks. The inversion for source parameters of Iwaki aftershock is conducted using the refined PALSAR deformation considering that the higher magnitude Iwaki quake has dominant deformation contribution than the Ibaraki event. After removal of deformation component of Iwaki event, we determine the fault slip distribution of Ibaraki shock using the remained PALSAR InSAR deformation. Finally, the complete source models for the serial seismic events are clearly identified from the sequential combination of multi-source satellite observations, which suggest that the major quake is a predominant mega-thrust rupture, whereas the two aftershocks are normal faulting motion. The estimated seismic moment magnitude for the Tohoku-Oki, Iwaki and Ibaraki evens are Mw 9.0, Mw 6.85 and Mw 6.11, respectively.

TI  - Wide Swath Stereo Mapping from Gaofen-1 Wide-Field-View (WFV) Images Using Calibration
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of Earth observation systems has changed the nature of survey and mapping products, as well as the methods for updating maps. Among optical satellite mapping methods, the multiline array stereo and agile stereo modes are the most common methods for acquiring stereo images. However, differences in temporal resolution and spatial coverage limit their application. In terms of this issue, our study takes advantage of the wide spatial coverage and high revisit frequencies of wide swath images and aims at verifying the feasibility of stereo mapping with the wide swath stereo mode and reaching a reliable stereo accuracy level using calibration. In contrast with classic stereo modes, the wide swath stereo mode is characterized by both a wide spatial coverage and high-temporal resolution and is capable of obtaining a wide range of stereo images over a short period. In this study, Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide-field-view (WFV) images, with total imaging widths of 800 km, multispectral resolutions of 16 m and revisit periods of four days, are used for wide swath stereo mapping. To acquire a high-accuracy digital surface model (DSM), the nonlinear system distortion in the GF-1WFV images is detected and compensated for in advance. The elevation accuracy of the wide swath stereo mode of the GF-1WFV images can be improved from 103 m to 30 m for a DSM with proper calibration, meeting the demands for 1: 250,000 scale mapping and rapid topographic map updates and showing improved efficacy for satellite imaging.

TI  - A Semi-Analytical Method for Periodic Earth Coverage Satellites Optimization
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we address a problem of designing satellite constellations to deal with a sequence of Earth revisit missions in the presence of limited resource capabilities. In order to fulfill the periodic coverage requirements, we take the repeating ground-track orbit into account and propose a semi-analytical method. After analyzing the coverage capacity of the resource for a random spot target on Earth's surface, we define and calculate the feasible longitude interval of ascending node of the orbit. Subsequently, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and an improved 0/1 programming model are formulated with coverage constraints that considerably reduce the size of the search space. We demonstrate that the new method significantly improves the optimization efficiency and verify the robustness of the solution.

TI  - Discovery of the reticular sand dunes in the Dongsha region of South China Sea and their genesis
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on multi-beam bathymetry and multi-channel seismic reflection data, as well as remote sensing data, we study the subaqueous sand dunes in the Dongsha region of the northern South China Sea, summarize the distribution features of the badforms, and analyze their hydrodynamic genesis. According to the spatial distribution characteristics, the subaqueous sand dunes are divided into parallel, wavy and reticular features. We focus on the distribution and formation mechanism of the reticular dunes which are distributed on the upper continental slope at depths of 352 similar to 420 m in the northeastern area to the Dongsha Atoll. The study shows that there are three directions of sand dune crest/trough extension: NS, NE-SW and EW. The former two are induced by the internal waves of westward propagation. While the last is likely to be formed by northward diffracted internal waves when they encounter the Dongsha Atoll. The northward propagating internal waves induce the southward bottom current. The bottom flow caused from internal waves can flush the seafloor and suspend the sediments, thus can form the subaqueous sand dunes of EW direction. It is worth mentioning that, above the polygonal reticular dunes, the seismic reflection sections reveal that the trough-to-trough wavelength is consistent between the high-frequency oscillating internal waves and subaqueous sand dunes. The relevant diffraction and internal wave interference regions can be recognized in the remote sensing data, and the internal wave interference is likely to cause high-frequency oscillation, thus forming a reticular dune field.

TI  - Cost-benefit Analysis, Values, Wellbeing and Ethics: An Indigenous Worldview Analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In cost-benefit analysis (CBA), values are often invoked to discuss maximization strategies that produce the highest state of social wellbeing expressed in terms of utility. Also, the conception of preferences is what individuals reveal as contributing to their wellbeing. However, as CBA ignores the empirically testable facts of how preferences are constituted, practical question arises about the legitimacy of the values themselves in contributing to welfare maximization. This paper seeks to uncover the meaning of wellbeing from lessons drawn from an extensive field study conducted with a group of indigenous people in Malaysia between 2008 and 2011. It concludes that despite decades of conceptual and analytical refinement, the price-based CBA is still limited in the practical world of evaluation because of the real difficulties it encountered in assessing the non-use and indirect use components of environmental assets that are non-subjectively distinguishable or are not traded in the market. Also, in ignoring individuals' value judgment and the various meanings of wellbeing from different socio-cultural backgrounds, CBA tends to lead to welfare distortions. To address these theoretical and practical deficiencies, it is necessary to embrace the heterodox school of Ecological Economics focusing on the social, cultural, and biophysical aspects of valuation processes.

TI  - Prospective surveillance pilot of rivaroxaban safety within the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel system developed tools for sequential surveillance.MethodsIn patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, we sequentially compared outcomes for new users of rivaroxaban versus warfarin, employing propensity score matching and Cox regression. A total of 36173 rivaroxaban and 79520 warfarin initiators were variable-ratio matched within 2 monitoring periods.ResultsStatistically significant signals were observed for ischemic stroke (IS) (first period) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (second period) favoring rivaroxaban, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (second period) favoring warfarin. In follow-up analyses using primary position diagnoses from inpatient encounters for increased definition specificity, the hazard ratios (HR) for rivaroxaban vs warfarin new users were 0.61 (0.47, 0.79) for IS, 1.47 (1.29, 1.67) for GIB, and 0.71 (0.50, 1.01) for ICH. For GIB, the HR varied by age: <66 HR=0.88 (0.60, 1.30) and 66+ HR=1.49 (1.30, 1.71).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the capability of Sentinel to conduct prospective safety monitoring and raises no new concerns about rivaroxaban safety.

TI  - Radiometric Evaluation of SNPP VIIRS Band M11 via Sub-Kilometer Intercomparison with Aqua MODIS Band 7 over Snowy Scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A refined intersensor comparison study is carried out to evaluate the radiometric stability of the 2257 nm channel (M11) of the first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. This study is initiated as part of the examination into the performance of key shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for SNPP VIIRS ocean color data processing and applications, with Band M11 playing key role over turbid and inland waters. The evaluation utilizes simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) to compare SNPP VIIRS Band M11 against Band 7 of the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Aqua satellite over concurrently observed scenes. The standard result of the radiance comparison is a seemingly uncontrolled and inconsistent time series unsuitable for further analyses, in great contrast to other matching band-pairs whose radiometric comparisons are typically stable around 1.0 within 1% variation. The mismatching relative spectral response (RSR) between the two respective bands, with SNPP VIIRS M11 at 2225 to 2275 nm and Aqua MODIS B7 at 2125 to 2175 nm, is demonstrated to be the cause of the large variation because of the different dependence of the spectral responses of the two bands over identical scenes. A consistent radiometric comparison time series, however, can be extracted from SNO events that occur over snowy surfaces. A customized selection and analysis procedure successfully identifies the snowy scenes within the SNO events and builds a stable comparison time series. Particularly instrumental for the success of the comparison is the use of the half-kilometer spatial resolution data of Aqua MODIS B7 that significantly enhances the statistics. The final refined time series of Aqua MODIS B7 radiance over the SNPP VIIRS M11 radiance is stable at around 0.39 within 2.5% showing no evidence of drift. The radiometric ratio near 0.39 suggests the strong presence of medium-grained snow of a mixed-snow condition in those SNO scenes leading to successful comparison. The multi-year stability indicates the correctness of the on-orbit RSB calibration of SNPP VIIRS M11 whose result does not suffer from long-term drift.

TI  - Investigating the chlorophyll-a variability in the Gulf of Taranto (North-western Ionian Sea) by a multi-temporal analysis of MODIS-Aqua Level 3/Level 2 data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) variability on a long-term basis could allow detecting possible issues in the whole marine ecosystem functioning. The Gulf of Taranto (Southern Italy), in the North-western Ionian Sea (Mediterranean Sea), has been affected by several environmental threats in the last decade, thus deserving the implementation of an adequate monitoring system able to provide accurate indications about the variability of the most relevant bio-optical parameters.In this context, the main objectives of this study are to investigate the long-term chl-a variability in the Gulf of Taranto and identify the occurrence of any past spatiotemporal anomalies by implementing the multi-temporal Robust Satellite Technique (RST) on a 12-year (2003-2015) period of MODIS/AQUA Level 3/Level 2 chlorophyll-a data. The achieved results show well-clustered near-surface positive chl-a anomalies during the January February 2011 period. This detected offshore phytoplankton bloom may be related to sub-basin processes, such as the inflow of the Western Adriatic Coastal Current (WACC), probably fostered by the cyclonic reversal of the Bimodal Oscillating System (BiOS) mechanism. Therefore, the RST approach proved successful in detecting chl-a anomalous variations with a high level of confidence regardless of the absolute value measured, thus suggesting its exportability in other areas with different site-setting conditions.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance data from Eritrean migrants in Italy: The theory of "Healthy Migrants"
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Eritrean migrants accounted for the majority of people who drowned in the Mediterranean this year. Recently, data deficit about international migration has been reported.Methods: One hundred and thirty-three Eritrean migrants, upon their arrival in Italy, were accommodated at the asylum seekers center of Castelnuovo di Porto, together with 25 sanitary workers, and received microbiological surveillance at the Clinical Pathology and Microbiology Unit of the University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome.Results: Gram-negative bacteria, mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca, were frequently recovered in surveillance swabs. Gram-positive bacteria, represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, were also isolated in surveillance swabs. In migrants, polymicrobial swabs were recovered at high frequency, and unusual microorganisms, rarely found in our country, were isolated.Conclusion: The polymicrobial colonization and the high prevalence of gram-negative bacteria represent the baseline characteristics of this migrant population from Eritrea. The presence of unusual micro-organisms can be potentially pathogenic to asymptomatic carriers at risk of developing clinical disease if immunosuppressed or subjected to invasive procedures. In conclusion, active microbiological surveillance can represent an advantage for the host country in terms of data collection and by tracing unusual or resistant microorganisms by monitoring migrants' health status.

TI  - Shortwave Radiation Affected by Agricultural Practices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The albedo of bare soil depends on its organic matter, iron oxide, carbonate contents, and reflectance geometry, features considered stable over time, and also depends on salinity, moisture and roughness, which change dynamically due to agricultural practices. This paper deals with the quantitative estimation of the amount of shortwave radiation that could be reflected by air-dried bare soils in clear-sky conditions within arable lands in Israel throughout the year, assuming that they were shaped by a plough, a disk harrow, or a smoothing harrow. An area of bare soils was extracted from Landsat 8 images, within the contours of arable lands. The radiation reflected from the bare soils was calculated by equations predicting variations in their half-diurnal albedo as the solar zenith angle function. Accordingly, laboratory reflectance data of Israeli soil samples were used. The results clearly showed annual variation in the amount of short-wave radiation reflected from all bare soils within arable lands. The minimum radiation occurred in the winter, between the 1st and 70th day of the year (DOY), and the maximum was identified in the summer between 200th and 250th DOY. This could reach about 3-5 PJ/day and 16-23 PJ/day, respectively.

TI  - Completion axillary lymph node dissection can be avoid in patients with invasive breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases
T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases in invasive breast cancer patients is still widely debated. Even if in the absence of unequivocal guidelines, the axillary lynphadenectomy is not still performed in the routine clinical care of these patients.MATERIALS AND METHOD: We have retrospectively analyzed 897 patients with operable invasive breast cancer and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes underwent conservative surgery or total mastectomy with SLN biopsy. Two groups of patients with SLN micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITC) were considered, the first one treated with completion axillary dissection, the second one not followed by further surgical axillary procedure. The incidence of axillary recurrences has BEEN evaluated in both groups and only in the first group of patients the involvement of the remaining lymph nodes was analyzed.RESULTS: Micrometastases were found in 67 (7.4%) patients and ITC in 8 (0,9%) patients. 14 (20.9%) patients with micrometastases and 1 (12.5%) patient with ITC underwent completion axillary dissection. 53 (79.1%) patients with micrometastases and 7 (87.5%) with ITC didn't receive further surgical axillary procedure. No axillary recurrences were found during a median follow up of 65.7 +/- 8.69 months in both groups of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and according to some recent randomized trials we can say that completion axillary dissection can be safely avoided when micrometastases are found in sentinel lymph nodes. It should be performed anyway, depending on the analysis of the biomedical profile of the tumor.

TI  - Increasing rock-avalanche size and mobility in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska detected from 1984 to 2016 Landsat imagery
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the USA, climate change is expected to have an adverse impact on slope stability in Alaska. However, to date, there has been limited work done in Alaska to assess if changes in slope stability are occurring. To address this issue, we used 30-m Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2016 to establish an inventory of 24 rock avalanches in a 5000-km(2) area of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska. A search of available earthquake catalogs revealed that none of the avalanches were triggered by earthquakes. Analyses of rock-avalanche magnitude, mobility, and frequency reveal a cluster of large (areas ranging from 5.5 to 22.2 km(2)), highly mobile (height/length < 0.3) rock avalanches that occurred from June 2012 through June 2016 (near the end of the 33-year period of record). These rock avalanches began about 2 years after the long-term trend in mean annual maximum air temperature may have exceeded 0 A degrees C. Possibly more important, most of these rock avalanches occurred during a multiple-year period of record-breaking warm winter and spring air temperatures. These observations suggested to us that rock avalanches in the study area may be becoming larger because of rock-permafrost degradation. However, other factors, such as accumulating elastic strain, glacial thinning, and increased precipitation, may also play an important role in preconditioning slopes for failure during periods of warm temperatures.

TI  - Does Activism in Social Science Explain Conservatives' Distrust of Scientists?
T2  - AMERICAN SOCIOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the General Social Survey suggest that conservatives have become less trustful of scientists since the 1970s. Gauchat argues that this is because conservatives increasingly see scientific findings as threatening to their worldview. However, the General Social Survey data concern trust in scientists, not in science. We suggest that conservatives' diminishing trust in scientists reflects the fact that scientists in certain fields, particularly social science, have increasingly adopted a liberal-activist stance, seeking to influence public policy in a liberal direction.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: An update and review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon primary cutaneous neuroendocrine cancer. It most commonly presents as an indurated plaque or nodule on sun-damaged skin in elderly patients and is characterized by high rates of local recurrence and nodal metastasis. Survival at 5 years is 51% for local disease and as low as 14% for distant disease, which underscores the aggressive nature of this tumor and challenges in management. Advances in immunology and molecular genetics have broadened our understanding of the pathophysiology of MCC and expanded our therapeutic arsenal. With this comprehensive review, we provide an update of MCC epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation and prognostic markers. The second article in this continuing medical education series explores the evolving landscape in MCC management.

TI  - Mixed Versus Pure Variants of Desmoplastic Melanoma: The Cleveland Clinic Experience
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is a subvariant of spindle cell melanoma, accounting for less than 4% of all cutaneous melanomas. It occurs later in life and is associated with chronic sun exposure. Desmoplastic melanoma prognosis is considered more favorable than other variants, with lower rates of metastasis and higher survival. Recently, DM has been further subclassified into pure and mixed, calling into question surgical management and patient outcomes as well as viability of current nationwide databases without this distinction.Methods We identified all patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of DM from the Cleveland Clinic electronic melanoma database (n = 58) from 1997 to 2013. Clinical and histopathologic data were collected. Comparison in clinical variables was performed between patients who had pure (n = 15) and mixed (n = 43) variants of DM.Results There were no differences in age, sex, location of lesion, Breslow depth, ulceration, or regression. Patients with mixed DM were more likely to have lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.03) compared with pure DM. There was no difference in performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (P = 0.25) or sentinel lymph node positivity (P = 0.31) between the 2 groups. Recurrence was present in 13.3% of pure and 30.2% of mixed patients. Overall, Kaplan-Meier 3-year survival was 75% for pure and 80% for mixed DM (P = 0.53).Conclusions Pure and mixed DMs seem to have similar clinical characteristics and outcomes. This indicates that analysis of national datasets without this subclassification remains viable.

TI  - Assessing Riparian Vegetation Condition and Function in Disturbed Sites of the Arid Northwestern Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation or modification of vegetation distribution and structure in arid riparian ecosystems can lead to the loss of ecological function. Mexico has 101,500,000 ha of arid lands, however there is a general lack of information regarding how arid riparian ecosystems are being modified. To assess these modifications, we use eight sites in the San Miguel River (central Sonora) to analyze (1) riparian vegetation composition, structure and distribution using field sampling and remote sensing data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV); (2) productivity (proxies), using vegetation indices derived from satellite data; and (3) variability posed by riparian vegetation and vegetation adjacent to riparian habitats. The development of a simple yet informative Anthropogenic-disturbance Index (ADI) allowed us to classify and describe each study site. We found sharp differences in vegetation composition and structure between sites due to the absence/presence of obligate-riparian species. We also report significant difference between EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) values for the dry season among vegetation types that develop near the edges of the river but differ in composition, suggesting that land cover changes form obligate-riparian to facultative-riparian species can lead to a loss in potential productivity. Finally, our tests suggest that sites with higher disturbance present lower photosynthetic activity.

TI  - Potentials and limitations of remote fire monitoring in protected areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) play an important role in maintaining the biodiversity and ecological processes of the site. One of the greatest challenges for the PA management in several biomes in the world is wildfires. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potentialities and limitations of the use of data obtained by orbital remote sensing in the monitoring fire occurrence in PAs. Fire Occurrence Records (FORs) were analyzed in Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2007 to 2015, using photo interpreted data from TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors of the Landsat series and the Hot Spot Database (HSD) from the Brazilian Institute of Space Research - INPE. It was also observed the time of permanence of the scar left by fire on the landscape, through the multitemporal analysis of the behavior of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) indexes, before and after the occurrence. The greatest limitation found for the orbital remote monitoring was the presence of clouds in the passage of the sensor in dates close to the occurrence of the fires. The burned area identified by photo interpretation was 54.9% less than the area contained in the FOR. Although the HSD reported fire occurrences in the buffer zone (up to 10 km from the Park), no FORs were found at a distance greater than 1100 m from the boundaries of the PA. As the main potential of remote sensing, the possibility of identifying burned areas throughout the park and surroundings is highlighted, with low costs and greater accuracy. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An Improved Single-Channel Method to Retrieve Land Surface Temperature from the Landsat-8 Thermal Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the sources of input data for modeling land surface processes. The Landsat satellite series is the only operational mission with more than 30 years of archived thermal infrared imagery from which we can retrieve LST. Unfortunately, stray light artifacts were observed in Landsat-8 TIRS data, mostly affecting Band 11, currently making the split-window technique impractical for retrieving surface temperature without requiring atmospheric data. In this study, a single-channel methodology to retrieve surface temperature from Landsat TM and ETM+ was improved to retrieve LST from Landsat-8 TIRS Band 10 using near-surface air temperature (T-a) and integrated atmospheric column water vapor (omega) as input data. This improved methodology was parameterized and successfully evaluated with simulated data from a global and robust radiosonde database and validated with in situ data from four flux tower sites under different types of vegetation and snow cover in 44 Landsat-8 scenes. Evaluation results using simulated data showed that the inclusion of T-a together with omega within a single-channel scheme improves LST retrieval, yielding lower errors and less bias than models based only on omega. The new proposed LST retrieval model, developed with both omega and T-a, yielded overall errors on the order of 1 K and a bias of -0.5 K validated against in situ data, providing a better performance than other models parameterized using omega and T-a or only omega models that yielded higher error and bias.

TI  - Landscape ecological risk assessment in Qinling Mountain
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, landscape ecological risk in Qinling Mountain was studied. Using the remote sensing images of Landsat TM and DEM data in 1984, 2000, 2005, and 2014, an ecological risk assessment model was constructed, and landscape ecological risk indexes were calculated for four time periods 1984, 2004, 2005 and 2014. The spatial distribution of ecological risk was obtained with ArcGIS and geostatistics, and changes in the landscape patterns and spatiotemporal characteristics of ecological risk were analysed. As shown in the results; (a) from 1984 to 2014, the landscape pattern index of Qinling forest area was relatively stable; fragmentation and segregation decreased, and dominance and area increased. The fragmentation and separation of cultivated land increased over time, and the geographical distribution of cultivated land diversified, while its dominance decreased. (b) The areas of extremely low and extremely high ecological risk level in the study area is gradually reduced. But the area of high ecological risk level increased obviously. The extremely high ecological risk area was mainly distributed in the middle and south-eastern regions. The extremely low and low risk areas were mainly distributed in the low hilly areas of northern Qinling.

TI  - Recent Niger Delta shoreline response to Niger River hydrology: Conflict between forces of Nature and Humans
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Niger River Delta is a prolific hydrocarbon province and a mega-delta of economic and environmental relevance. To understand patterns of its recent shoreline evolution (1923-2013) in response to the Niger River hydrology, and establish the role played by forces of Nature and Human, available topographic and satellite remote sensing data, combined with hydro-climatic (rainfall and runoff) data were analyzed.Results indicate that the entire delta coastline dramatically receded: 82% of the >400 km-long coast retreated, during the period 1950-1987; and 69% between 2007 and 2012. Prior to 1950, there was a continuation of seaward advancement along 53-74% of the delta coast. The 1950-1987 shoreline recession coincided with occurrences of two major events in the Niger River basin; these are downward trends in hydro-climatic conditions (the great droughts of the 1970s-1980s), and dam construction on the Lower Niger River at Kainji (1964-1968). The 2007-2012 event corresponded with the extensive channel dredging during 2009-2012 in the Lower Niger River from the coastal town of Ward in the south to Baro in the north. Remarkably, the largest net shoreline advancement recorded in 74% of the entire delta area occurred within a year (2012-2013), which we link to increased sediment supply to the coast caused by the '2012' floods, adjudged the worst floods in the entire Niger River Basin in the last few decades. With both anthropogenic and environmental factors inducing delta evolution, only innovative river and coastal management can determine the fortune of the future coastal development of the Niger Delta.

TI  - Regional Geomorphological Conditions Related to Recent Changes of Glacial Lakes in the Issyk-Kul Basin, Northern Tien Shan
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the current state of glacial lakes, we examine the seasonal lake-area changes of 339 glacial lakes in the Teskey and Kungoy Ranges of the Issyk-Kul Basin, Kyrgyzstan, during 2013-2016 based on optical satellite images (Landsat7/ETM+ and 8/OLI). The glacial lakes are classified into six types based on their seasonal variations in area: stable, increasing, decreasing, appearing, vanishing, and short-lived. We then track the number of each type in a given year and examine how each number changes from one year to the next. We find that many appearing, vanishing, and short-lived types occurred in both mountain ranges, having a large variability in number that is not directly related to the local short-term summer temperature anomaly, nor to precipitation or glacier recession. However, those in the Teskey Range vary significantly more than those in the Kungoy Range. To determine if the changing number and distribution of the various lake types may be due to changes in ground ice, we apply differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) analysis using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 for the debris landforms behind which glacial lakes appear. In the Teskey Range, ground ice occurs in 416 out of a total of 557 debris landforms, whereas in the Kungoy Range, ground ice occurs in 71 out of 131. In zones with predominant glacier-retreat during 1971-2010 (from Corona KH-4B and ALOS/PRISM), the Teskey Range had 180 new lake depressions as potential lake-basins, whereas the Kungoy Range had just 22. Existing depressions also expanded when melting ice produced subsidence. Such subsidence, together with debris landforms containing ground ice and ice tunnels, appear to cause the observed large number variability. In particular, the deposition of ice and debris by tunnel collapse or the freezing of storage water in a debris landform may close-off an ice tunnel, causing a lake to appear. Subsequent re-opening via melting of such blockage would produce either a vanishing or a short-lived type. In this way, the large variability in the number of each lake type and the distribution of types over this four-year period arises from regional geomorphological conditions and not directly from the local short-term summer temperature anomaly and precipitation or glacier recession.

TI  - Integration of PSI, MAI, and Intensity-Based Sub-Pixel Offset Tracking Results for Landslide Monitoring with X-Band Corner Reflectors-Italian Alps (Corvara)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the integration between interferometric and intensity-offset tracking-based SAR remote sensing for landslide hazard mitigation in the Italian Alps. Despite the advantages of Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) methods for quantifying landslide deformation, some limitations remain. The temporal decorrelation, the 1-D Line Of Sight (LOS) observation restriction, the high velocity rate and the multi-directional movement properties make it difficult to monitor accurately complex landslides in areas covered by vegetation. Therefore, complementary and integrated approaches, such as offset tracking-based techniques, are needed to overcome these InSAR limitations for monitoring ground surface deformations. As sub-pixel offset tracking is highly sensitive to data spatial resolution, the latest generations of SAR sensors, such as TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed, open interesting perspective for a more accurate hazard assessment. In this paper, we consider high-resolution X-band data acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation for Permanent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI), Multi-Aperture Interferometry (MAI) and offset tracking processing. We analyze the offset tracking techniques considering area and feature-based matching algorithms to evaluate their applicability to CSK data by improving sub-pixel offset estimations. To this end, PSI and MAI are used for extracting LOS and azimuthal displacement components. Then, four well-known area-based and five feature-based matching algorithms (taken from computer vision) are applied to 16 X-band corner reflectors. Results show that offset estimation accuracy can be considerably improved up to less than 3% of the pixel size using the combination of the different feature-based detectors and descriptors. A sensitivity analysis of these techniques applied to CSK data to monitor complex landslides in the Italian Alps provides indications on advantages and disadvantages of each of them.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of floating islands and their behavioral changes in Loktak Lake with respect to biodiversity using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of floating islands is a unique characteristic of Loktak Lake. Floating islands play a significant role in ecosystem services and ecological processes and functioning. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and a demand for more resources have led to changes in the landscape patterns at Loktak Lake in past three decades, thereby degrading and threatening the fragile ecosystem. The aim of the present study is to assess the changes in land use practices of the Phumdis by analyzing data from the past 38 years with remote sensing techniques. Landsat images from 1977, 1988, 1999 and an Indian remote sensing image from 2015 were used to assess the land use/land cover changes. The methodology adopted is a supervised classification using the maximum likelihood technique in ERDAS software. Five land used classes were employed: open water bodies, agricultural areas, Phumdis with thick vegetation, and Phumdis with thin vegetation and settlements. The results indicate that the highest loss of land used class was in Phumdis with thin vegetation (49.38 km(2)) followed by Phumdis with thick vegetation (8.59 km(2)), while there was an overall increase in open water bodies (27.00 km(2)), agricultural areas (25.33 km(2)), and settlement (5.75 km(2)). Our study highlights the loss of floating islands from the Loktak as a major concern that will lead to the destruction of the only "floating national park in the world." There is a high probability of extinction of the Sangai, an important keystone species found in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, if floating islands are not protected through sustainable development.

TI  - Impact of LULC change on the runoff, base flow and evapotranspiration dynamics in eastern Indian river basins during 1985-2005 using variable infiltration capacity approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a catchment phenomenon, land use and land cover change (LULCC) has a great role in influencing the hydrological cycle. In this study, decadal LULC maps of 1985, 1995, 2005 and predicted-2025 of the Subarnarekha, Brahmani, Baitarani, Mahanadi and Nagavali River basins of eastern India were analyzed in the framework of the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) macro scale hydrologic model to estimate their relative consequences. The model simulation showed a decrease in ET with 0.0276% during 1985-1995, but a slight increase with 0.0097% during 1995-2005. Conversely, runoff and base flow showed an overall increasing trend with 0.0319 and 0.0041% respectively during 1985-1995. In response to the predicted LULC in 2025, the VIC model simulation estimated reduction of ET with 0.0851% with an increase of runoff by 0.051%. Among the vegetation parameters, leaf area index (LAI) emerged as the most sensitive one to alter the simulated water balance. LULC alterations via deforestation, urbanization, cropland expansions led to reduced canopy cover for interception and transpiration that in turn contributed to overall decrease in ET and increase in runoff and base flow. This study reiterates changes in the hydrology due to LULCC, thereby providing useful inputs for integrated water resources management in the principle of sustained ecology.

TI  - Assessment of spatial changes in forest cover and deforestation rate in Eastern Ghats Highlands of Odisha, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim : The spatial changes in forest cover and deforestation rate over eight decades in Koraput district of Odisha, a mountainous part of Eastern Ghats Highland region was studied using remote sensing and GIS. The dynamics of forest fragmentation was also quantified using patch analysis.Methodology : The multi-source and multi-date mapping was carried out using Survey of India topographical maps (1930's), Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990), IRS P6 LISS III (2004 and 2013) satellite images. Radiometric and contrast correction was done to the images using digital image processing software. On-screen visual interpretation of forest cover was done which was aided by unsupervised classification. Ground truthing was done to determine the classification accuracy. Patch analysis was done to quantify forest fragmentation.Results : The mapping accuracy varied between 71.8% and 93.3 % for different years under study. The results for 1932, 1973, 1990, 2004 and 2013 indicate that the forest cover for the mentioned years were 4413.4 km(2), 3706.0 km(2), 3051.1 km, 2554.4 km(2) and 2284.5 km(2), which were 52.7%, 44.2%, 36.4%, 27.3% and 25.8% of the geographical area of the district, respectively. The deforestation rate was 0.38% per year during 1932-1973, 2.04% per year during 1973-1990, 1.71% per year during 1990-2004 and 0.63% per year during 2004-2013. The decline in overall rate of deforestation in recent years indicates increased emphasis on forest conservation. The number of fragmented forest patches was 398 in 1932, 645 in 1973, 688 in 1990, 697 in 2004 and 702 in 2013, which indicates ongoing anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean forest patch size decreased from 111 km(2) in 1932 to 65.8 km(2) in 2013.Interpretation : This study indicates the effectiveness of remote sensing in indentifying the forest and non-forest area. The change analysis of deforestation provides a decisive component for conservation and helpful in long term rational management of the remaining forests of the district for eco-restoration and sustainable development.

TI  - Lymph node wire localization post-chemotherapy: Towards improving the false negative sentinel lymph node biopsy rate in breast cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate whether the disease status of the pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) core biopsied lymph node (preNACBxLN) in patients with node positive breast cancer corresponds to nodal status of all surgically retrieved lymph nodes (LNs) post-NAC and whether wire localization of this LN is feasible.Materials and methods: HIPPA compliant IRB approved retrospective study including breast cancer patients (a.) with preNACBxLN confirmed metastases, (b.) who received NAC, and (c.) underwent wire localization of the preNACBxLN. Electronic medical records were reviewed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare differences in residual disease post-NAC among breast cancer subtypes.Results: 28 women with node positive breast cancer underwent ultrasound guided wire localization of the preNACBxLN, without complication. There was no evidence of residual nodal disease for 16 patients, with mean 4.4 (median 4) LNs resected. 12 patients had residual nodal metastases, with mean 9.2 (median 7) LNs resected and mean 2.3 (median 2) LNs with tumor involvement. 11 patients had metastases detected within the localized LN. One patient had micrometastasis in a sentinel LN, despite no residual disease in the preNACBxLN. Patients with luminal A/B breast cancer more often had residual nodal metastases (86%) at pathology, as compared to patients with HER2 + (20%) and Triple Negative breast cancer (50%), though not quite achieving statistical significance (p = 0.055).Conclusion: Ultrasound guided wire localization of the preNACBxLN is feasible and may improve detection of residual tumor in patients post-NAC.

T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between different remote sensing data, derived from satellite images, and interrill soil losses obtained in the field by using a portable rainfall simulator. The study was carried out in an area of a hydrographic basin, located in Medio Paraiba do Sul. in the state of Rio de Janeiro - one of the regions most affected by water erosion in Brazil. Evaluations were performed for different vegetation indices (NDVI, Savi, EVI, and EVI2) and fraction images (FI), derived from linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA), obtained from RapidEye, Sentinel2A, and Landsat 8 OLI images. Vegetation indices are more adequate to predict soil loss than FI, highlighting EVI2, whose exponential model showed R-2 of 0.74. The best prediction models are generated from the RapidEye image, which shows the highest spatial resolution among the sensors evaluated.

TI  - Differences in precipitation and evapotranspiration between forested and deforested areas in the Amazon rainforest using remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the constant deforestation observed in the Amazon region in recent decades, changes in local climates are unavoidable. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand such climate changes by evaluating differences in precipitation (PRP), evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) between forested and deforested areas in the Brazilian Amazonia. Eight areas (four forested and four deforested) that maintained their land cover over a period of 15 years (2000-2014) were selected using PRODES (Legal Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) Digital's remote sensing database. The PRP data were retrieved from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM, resolution of 0.25 degrees), and the data of ET and PET were obtained from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor (MODIS, resolution of 0.05 degrees). The differences among PRP, ET and PET in each area were calculated using a regression model. The results show that ET was the only variable which presented a statistically significant difference between forested and deforested areas, mainly due to an intense decrease at the deforested sites during the dry season. Regarding PRP, a modest increase was observed on small areas, probably due to changes in local atmospheric dynamics, but on large areas decrease in PRP was noted. Nevertheless, in both cases there were no statistically significant differences between forested and deforested areas. PET presented a slightly increase value over deforested areas during the dry season, but not statistically significant as well.

TI  - Low Lymphatic Vessel Density Correlates with Lymph Node Metastasis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
T2  - Journal of dentistry (Shiraz, Iran)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Regional lymph nodes are the nodes draining lymph from region around the tumor and presence of metastatic tumor in regional lymph nodes is the most important prognostic factor for malignant tumors of epithelial origin. Lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increased incidence of regional lymph nodes metastasis and is possibly an essential step for metastasis. Tumor cells secrete lymphangiogenic cytokines, which results in formation of lymphatic vessels within and around the tumor and act as portals for tumor spread.PURPOSE: The present study aims to investigate and quantify lymphatic vessel density (LVD) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and determine whether LVD can predict the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis.MATERIAL AND METHOD: 50 specimens of OSCC, without and with lymph node metastasis (25 each) along with 25 specimens of normal oral mucosa were assessed and LVD was quantified by D2-40 immunostaining. Discrete hotspots of intratumoral lymphatics were identified in superficial and deep areas in all carcinomas to calculate LVD.RESULTS: When compared to normal mucosa, LVD decreased in the superficial intratumoral areas and decreased further in deep areas. In addition, LVD in the superficial and deep areas of OSCC without nodal metastasis was significantly higher than that in OSCC with nodal metastasis.CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that lymphangiogenesis varies within the tumor. Lymphatic vessels are either compressed, collapsed, destroyed or absent in deep intratumoral region. Decrease in LVD predicts cervical lymph node metastasis both in superficial and deep areas. Lymphatics in superficial areas are probably major conduit for nodal metastasis in OSCCs.

TI  - Political Claustrophobia in Lars von Trier's Europa and America Trilogies
T2  - CINEJ CINEMA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to trace the specific kind of political pessimism, that can be termed 'political claustrophobia' underlying the filmography of the Danish director Lars von Trier. Elements of this worldview are traced by analyzing two clusters of films categorized under Europa and America trilogies; namely, The Element of Crime, Epidemic, Europa, Dogville and Manderlay. Trier portrays a particularly bleak picture of the European civilization in the aftermath of the II World War. An equally claustrophobic outlook also characterizes his depiction of the life and relationships in American small towns during the 1930s. In both settings, attempts at reform and change are thwarted by entrenched social reality; leading the audience to the conclusion that there can be no political outside to the existing world.

TI  - Monitoring water quality in a hypereutrophic reservoir using Landsat ETM plus and OLI sensors: how transferable are the water quality algorithms?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the Landsat 8 in February 2013 extended the life of the Landsat program to over 40 years, increasing the value of using Landsat to monitor long-term changes in the water quality of small lakes and reservoirs, particularly in poorly monitored freshwater systems. Landsat-based water quality hindcasting often incorporate several Landsat sensors in an effort to increase the temporal range of observations; yet the transferability of water quality algorithms across sensors remains poorly examined. In this study, several empirical algorithms were developed to quantify chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and Secchi disk depth (SDD) from surface reflectance measured by Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. Sensor-specific multiple linear regression models were developed by correlating in situ water quality measurements collected from a semi-arid eutrophic reservoir with band ratios from Landsat ETM+ and OLI sensors, along with ancillary data (water temperature and seasonality) representing ecological patterns in algae growth. Overall, ETM+-based models outperformed (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.70, TSM = 0.81, SDD = 0.81) their OLI counterparts (adjusted R-2 chlorophyll-a = 0.50, TSM = 0.58, SDD = 0.63). Inter-sensor differences were most apparent for algorithms utilizing the Blue spectral band. The inclusion of water temperature and seasonality improved the power of TSM and SDD models.

TI  - Generalization of Roos bias in RC4 and some results on key-keystream relations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CRYPTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - RC4 has attracted many cryptologists due to its simple structure. In [9], Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt reported the results of a large scale computation of RC4 biases. Among the biases reported by them, we try to theoretically analyze a fewwhich show very interesting visual patterns. We first study the bias which relates the key stream byte z(i) with i - k[0], where k[0] is the first byte of the secret key. We then present a generalization of the Roos bias. In 1995, Roos observed the bias of initial bytes S[i] of the permutation after KSA towards fi = Sigma(i)(r-1) r +Sigma(i)(r-0) K[r]. Herewe study the probability of S[i] equaling f(y) = Sigma(y)(r=1) r +Sigma(y)(r=0) K[r] for i not equal y. Our generalization provides a complete correlation between z(i) and i - fy. We also analyze the keykeystream relation z(i) = f(i-1) which was studied by Maitra and Paul [6] in FSE 2008. We provide more accurate formulas for the probability of both z(i) = i-f(i) and z(i) = f(i-1) for different i's than the existing works.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping with Indocyanine Green Using the iSpies Platform: Initial Experience Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: To demonstrate the initial experience in Argentina using the iSpies indocyanine green (ICG) platform in sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with early-stage cervical cancer.Design: Step-by-step demonstration of the technique using a video and pictures (educative video) (Canadian Task Force classification III).Setting: Laparoscopic and robotic sentinel lymph node mapping using ICG has been shown to be safe and feasible; however, in developing countries, the opportunities to use fluorescent imaging through a minimally invasive approach are very limited, given the cost restrictions of acquiring the near-infrared technology and the fluorescent dyes.Intervention: A 47-year-old woman presented with a stage IB1 squamous cervical cancer. Physical examination revealed a 1.5-cm tumor without evidence of parametrial involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging did not show any evidence of metastatic disease. The patient underwent laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node mapping. On laparoscopic exposure of the pelvic spaces, a cervical injection of ICG (1 mL superficial and deep) was administered using a spinal needle at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Sentinel lymph node mapping was then performed using the ICG (Pulsion Medical Systems, Feldkirchen, Germany) and an iSpies near-infrared camera (Karl Storz Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany). Bilateral sentinel lymph nodes were detected on the left external iliac artery and in the right obturator space. Both were confirmed ex vivo. The total operative time was 170 minutes. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported, and the patient was discharged at 48 hours after surgery. Estimated blood loss was minimal. Sentinel lymph node mapping alone is not the standard of care in our institution, and thus bilateral lymphadenectomy was performed. Ultrastaging is routinely performed when a sentinel lymph node is evaluated. Final pathology revealed a tumor confined to the cervix, with tumor-free margins, and a total of 10 lymph nodes that were negative for any evidence of disease. Disadvantages of this technology compared with the Pinpoint ICG system (Novadaq Technologies; Bonita Springs, FL) is the lack of simultaneous white vision and fluorescence ICG detection, and the to manually change normal vision to infrared vision. An advantage of the Storz iSpies system is its availability in our country, considering that the technology developed by Novadaq is not yet approved in Argentina.Conclusion: Although ICG sentinel lymph node mapping is becoming a standard of care [1,2], a lack of ICG dye or laparoscopic near-infrared technologies could be a deterrent to its use in developing countries. Afocus on expanding this technology in countries with limited resources would allow patients the opportunity to avoid the morbidity associated with full lymphadenectomy. (C) 2017 AAGL.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Study Objective: To present our minimally invasive laparoscopic approach for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with indocyanine green (ICG) using 2 fluorescence systems. Design A step-by-step video description of the technique showing the most frequent typical and atypical location of SLNs (educational video).Setting: Lymph node staging in apparent confined endometrial cancer.Patients: Women underwent SLN mapping in a minimally invasive setting.Interventions: Laparoscopic SLN mapping before comprehensive staging including simple hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and aortic bilateral lymphadenectomy in case of unilateral or no identification of SLNs. The PINPOINT 0 degree HD S1 SPY camera (PINPOINT Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System; NOVADAQ, Mississauga, ON, Canada) or the Full HD Image 1S with ICG camera (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany) were used for SLN detection [1,2]. The ICG powder was diluted to a final solution of 1.25 mg/mL of fluorescent dye. After the induction of general anesthesia, a total of 4 mL of the ICG solution was injected into the cervix at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Attention to the technical details is crucial to correctly identify SLNs that sometimes are located in atypical locations [3].Conclusion: Both fluorescence systems are valid and applicable for SLN mapping in the case of apparent confined endometrial cancer. In our experience, the PINPOINT system seems to allow surgeons easier and faster nodal staging of the SLNs, particularly with the color-segmented fluorescence function activated, which can better discriminate between the lymphatic channels and the real SLNs [4,5].

TI  - Assessment of mining-induced damage to structures using InSAR time series analysis: a case study of Jiulong Mine, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence due to underground mining activities can damage surface constructions. In this study, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis was applied to assess the amount of damage sustained by Qiannantai village (Handan, China) constructions built above a coal mining area. The vertical displacements were detected using seven RadarSat-2 images acquired between October 2013 and March 2014. The analysis showed that the accumulated displacement and the maximum deformation rate reached 42 mm and 95 mm yr(-1), respectively, consistent with data obtained from levelling surveying. Based on this, a model of the relationship between the level of deformation/damage to constructions and ground deformation due to mining subsidence was developed, and the grade of mining-induced damage to village constructions was assessed. The method described in this paper is useful for determining the grade of mining-induced damage to constructions, which is a key feature for hazard prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Long-term outcomes after near-infrared sentinel lymph node mapping in non-small cell lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To report the first analysis of long-term outcomes using near-infrared (NIR) image-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with NSCLC enrolled in 2 prospective phase 1 NIR-guided SLN mapping trials, including an indocyanine green (ICG) dose-escalation trial, was performed. All patients underwent NIR imaging for SLN identification followed by multistation mediastinal lymph node sampling (MLNS) and pathologic assessment. Disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with NIR+ SLN (SLN group) and those without (non-SLN group).Results: SLN detection, recurrence, DFS, and OS were assessed in 42 patients with NSCLC who underwent intraoperative peritumoral ICG injection, NIR imaging, and MLNS. NIRthorn SLNs were identified in 23 patients (SLN group), whereas SLNs were not identified in 19 patients enrolled before ICG dose and camera optimization (non-SLN group). Median follow-up was 44.5 months. Pathology from NIRthorn SLNs was concordant with overall nodal status in all 23 patients. Sixteen patients with SLN were deemed pN0 and no recurrences were, whereas 4 of 15 pN0 non-SLN patients developed nodal or distant recurrent disease. Comparing SLN versus non-SLN pN0 patients, the probability of 5-year OS is 100% versus 70.0% (P = .062) and 5-year DFS is statistically significantly improved at 100% versus 66.1% (P = .036), respectively. Among the 11 pN vertical bar patients, 7 were in the SLN group, with >40% showing metastases in the SLN alone.Conclusions: Patients with pN0 SLNs showed favorable disease-free and overall survival. This preliminary review of NIR SLN mapping in NSCLC suggests that pN0 SLNs may better represent true N0 status. A larger clinical trial is planned to validate these findings.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Periadnexal Extension in Cutaneous Melanoma and its Implications for Pathologic Reporting and Staging
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor thickness is the strongest predictor of outcome for clinically localized melanoma. Therefore, accurate assessment is critical for appropriate staging, reliable estimation of prognosis, and management. When melanoma extends alongside skin adnexal structures more deeply than the main tumor mass (periadnexal extension), it is currently unknown whether the prognosis is more accurately reflected by the deepest point of periadnexal tumor extension or the main tumor mass. This study sought to address this question. Survival outcomes of 257 primary cutaneous melanoma patients with periadnexal extension diagnosed between 2005 and 2015 and managed at Melanoma Institute Australia were identified and compared with a control cohort of 514 patients who were matched for tumor thickness, sex, age, mitotic rate, ulceration status, and year of diagnosis but lacked periadnexal extension. The incidence of periadnexal extension at Melanoma Institute Australia was 1.5% (257/16,692 cutaneous melanomas diagnosed between 2005 and 2015). The patient characteristics between the 2 groups were otherwise very similar; median Breslow thickness was 0.9 mm for the periadnexal group and 1.0 mm for the control group. The median extension beyond the Breslow thickness in the tumors with periadnexal extension was 0.45 mm (mean, 0.4 mm). Median follow-up was 46 months for the periadnexal group and 44 months for the control group. Measures of clinical outcomes all showed trends for improved survival in the periadnexal extension group; these were melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44, 1.38), overall survival (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.59, 1.41), disease-free survival (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45, 1.03), and distant disease-free survival (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.4, 1.17), although none were statistically significant. There was a higher rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in the periadnexal group versus the control group in patients whose tumors were > 1 mm thick (24/100 = 24% vs. 23/187 = 12.3%). Periadnexal extension was significantly associated with SLN metastasis on univariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio [95% CI], 2.25 [1.20, 4.24], P = 0.01). If the periadnexal extension had been included in the measurement of tumor thickness, 42.8% of patients would have been upstaged to a higher American Joint Committee on Cancer T category. The findings of this study indicate that periadnexal involvement that extends more deeply than the thickness of the main tumor mass increases the risk of SLN metastasis in tumours > 1 mm thick, however, does not worsen clinical outcomes overall, and tumor thickness measurements should not include deeper foci of periadnexal tumor.

TI  - Radargrammetric DSM generation in mountainous areas through adaptive-window least squares matching constrained by enhanced epipolar geometry
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radargrammetry is a powerful tool to construct digital surface models (DSMs) especially in heavily vegetated and mountainous areas where SAR interferometry (InSAR) technology suffers from decorrelation problems. In radargrammetry, the most challenging step is to produce an accurate disparity map through massive image matching, from which terrain height information can be derived using a rigorous sensor orientation model. However, precise stereoscopic SAR (StereoSAR) image matching is a very difficult task in mountainous areas due to the presence of speckle noise and dissimilar geometric/radiometric distortions. In this article, an adaptive-window least squares matching (AW-LSM) approach with an enhanced epipolar geometric constraint is proposed to robustly identify homologous points after compensation for radiometric discrepancies and geometric distortions. The matching procedure consists of two stages. In the first stage, the right image is re-projected into the left image space to generate epipolar images using rigorous imaging geometries enhanced with elevation information extracted from the prior DEM data e.g. SRTM DEM instead of the mean height of the mapped area. Consequently, the dissimilarities in geometric distortions between the left and right images are largely reduced, and the residual disparity corresponds to the height difference between true ground surface and the prior DEM. In the second stage, massive per-pixel matching between StereoSAR epipolar images identifies the residual disparity. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the matching results, we develop an iterative matching scheme in which the classic cross correlation matching is used to obtain initial results, followed by the least squares matching (LSM) to refine the matching results. An adaptively resizing search window strategy is adopted during the dense matching step to help find right matching points. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using Stripmap and Spotlight mode TerraSAR-X stereo data pairs covering Mount Song in central China. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide a robust and effective matching tool for radargrammetry in mountainous areas.

TI  - An Efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation Approach of Multi-Baseline SAR Interferometry for Refined Topographic Mapping in Mountainous Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For InSAR topographic mapping, multi-baseline InSAR height estimation is known to be an effective way to facilitate phase unwrapping by significantly increasing the ambiguity intervals and maintaining good height measurement sensitivity, especially in mountainous areas. In this paper, an efficient multi-baseline SAR interferometry approach based on maximum likelihood estimation is developed for refined topographic mapping in mountainous areas. In the algorithm, maximum likelihood (ML) height estimation is used to measure the topographic details and avoid the complicated phase unwrapping process. In order to be well-adapted to the mountainous terrain conditions, the prior height probability is re-defined to take the local terrain conditions and neighboring height constraint into consideration in the algorithm. In addition, three strategies are used to optimize the maximum likelihood height estimation process to obtain higher computational efficiency, so that this method is more suitable for spaceborne InSAR data. The strategies include substituting a rational function model into the complicated conversion process from candidate height to interferometric phase, discretizing the continuous height likelihood probability, and searching for the maximum likelihood height with a flexible step length. The experiment with simulated data is designed to verify the improvement of the ML height estimation accuracy with the re-defined prior height distribution. Then the optimized processing procedure is tested with the multi-baseline L-band ALOS/PALSAR data covering the Mount Tai area in China. The height accuracy of the generated multi-baseline InSAR DEM can meet both standards of American DTED-2 and Chinese national 1: 50,000 DEM (mountain) Level 2.

TI  - The Southwest Indian Ocean Bathymetric Compilation (swIOBC)
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comprehensive regional bathymetric data compilation for the southwest Indian Ocean (swIOBC) covering the area from 4 degrees S to 40 degrees S and 20 degrees E to 45 degrees E with a spatial resolution of 250 m. For this, we used multibeam and singlebeam data as well as data from global bathymetric data compilations. We generated the swIOBC using an iterative approach of manual data cleaning and gridding, accounting for different data qualities and seamless integration of all different kinds of data. In comparison to existing bathymetric charts of this region, the new swIOBC benefits from nearly four times as many data-constrained grid cells and a higher resolution, and thus reveals formerly unseen seabed features. In the central Mozambique Basin a surprising variety of landscapes were discovered. They document a deep reaching influence of the Mozambique Current eddies. Details of the N-S trending Zambezi Channel could be imaged in the central Mozambique Basin.Plain Language Summary Maps are crucial not only for orientation but also to set scientific processes and local information in a spatial context. For most parts of the ocean seafloor, maps are derived from satellite data with only kilometer resolution. Acoustic depth measurements from ships provide more detailed seafloor information in tens to hundreds of meters resolution. For the southwest Indian Ocean, all available depth soundings from a variety of sources and institutes are combined in one coherent map. Thus, in areas where depth soundings exist, this map shows the seafloor in so-far unknown detail. This detailed map forms the base for subsequent studies of e.g. the direction of ocean currents, geological and biological processes in the southwest Indian Ocean.

TI  - SLN biopsy in cervical cancer patients with tumors larger than 2 cm and 4 cm
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The aim of this study was to assess the detection rate, false-negative rate and sensitivity of SLN in LN staging in tumors over 2 cm on a large cohort of patients.Methods. Data from patients with stages pT1a - pT2 cervical cancer who underwent surgical treatment, including SLN biopsy followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy, were retrospectively analyzed. A combined technique with blue dye and radiocolloid was modified in larger tumors to inject the tracer into the residual cervical stroma.Results. The study included 350 patients with stages pTla - pT2. Macrometastases, micrometastases, and isolated tumor cells were found in 10%, 8%, and 4% of cases. Bilateral detection rate was similar in subgroups with tumors < 2 cm, 2-3.9 cm, and >= 4 cm (79%, 83%, 76%) (P = 0.460). There were only two cases with false-negative SLN ultrastaging for pelvic IN status among those with bilateral SLN detection. The false negative rate was very low in all three subgroups of different tumor sizes (0.9%, 0.9%, and 0.0%; P = 0.999). Sensitivity reached 96% in the whole group and was high in all three groups (93%, 93%, 100%; P = 0.510).Conclusions. If the tracer application technique is adjusted in larger tumors, SIN biopsy can be equally reliable in pelvic IN staging in tumors smaller and larger than 2 cm. The bilateral detection rate and false negative rate did not differ in subgroups of patients with tumors < 2 cm, 2-3.9 cm, and cm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Risk factors for pertussis among hospitalized children in a high HIV prevalence setting, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In low-and middle-income countries, including South Africa, the epidemiology of pertussis in relation to immunization, nutritional, and HIV status is poorly described. This article reports on risk factors in South African children hospitalized with pertussis.Methods: A prospective, hospital-based, sentinel surveillance programme for pertussis was conducted in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Hospitalized children (<= 10 years) meeting the surveillance criteria for clinically suspected pertussis were screened and enrolled. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected for real-time multiplex PCR and culture of Bordetella species.Results: Bordetella pertussis was detected in 6.2% (61/992) of children. Pertussis was significantly more prevalent in infants younger than 3 months (9.8%; 38/392) and in young children between the ages of 5 and 9 years (12%; 4/34) (p = 0.0013). Of the 61 confirmed pertussis cases, 17 were too young for vaccination. Of the remaining 44 infants, vaccination DTP1 was administered in 73% (32/44) of pertussis-confirmed patients who were eligible, DTP2 in 50% (16/32), DTP3 in 54% (14/26), and DTP4 in 56% (5/9) of vaccine-eligible cases at 18 months of age. B. pertussis infection was less likely in children immunized at least once (5%, 32/692) than in unvaccinated children (10%, 24/230) (p = 0.0001). HIV exposure and infection status were determined in 978 (99%) patients: 69% (678/978) were HIV-unexposed and uninfected and 31% (300/978) were HIV-exposed. Of these HIV-exposed patients, 218 (22%) were proven HIV-exposed and uninfected and 82 patients were HIV-infected (8.4%, 82/978). HIV prevalence was similar in pertussis-positive (6%, 5/82) and pertussis-negative (6%, 55/896) children (p = 0.90). B. pertussis infection was unrelated to poor nutritional status.Conclusions: In South Africa, B. pertussis poses a greater risk to infants who are too young for the first vaccine dose, those who are not vaccinated in a timely manner, and those who do not receive all three primary doses. HIV infection and HIV exposure were not associated with pertussis infection. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

TI  - A comparison and validation of satellite-derived fire severity mapping techniques in fire prone north Australian savannas: Extreme fires and tree stem mortality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe fires in tropical savanna systems are recognised as incurring significant impacts on a variety of ecological attributes, including woody vegetation structure and greenhouse gas emissions. However, knowledge of the frequency and extent of severe fires is restricted given challenges associated with the development of reliable remotely sensed mapping procedures. This study takes advantage of three wildfires, 900-5300 km(2) in extent, containing very severely affected areas, occurring in semi-evergreen, eucalypt-dominated, tropical Australian savanna, which resulted in significant areas of complete canopy scorch, very significant tree stem mortality (24-55%), and associated loss of living above ground biomass (47-69%) at respective sites. Although increased map scale is generally considered to improve the reliability of fire severity mapping, our analysis found > 90% agreement between Landsat and MODIS-derived burnt area mapping, and > 80% for binary (severe vs. non severe) fire severity mapping. Mapping of internal fire (unburnt) patchiness was enhanced with finer resolution Landsat imagery, but the much longer orbital return cycle precluded its use at two of the three sites given extended cloudy conditions. Application of an automated MODIS-derived fire severity mapping algorithm (overall reliability in 2015 = 75%) calibrated for generalised north Australian savanna conditions, suggests that 15% and 12% of Australia's 1.3 M km(2) tropical savannas region were burnt by severe fires in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The study illustrates the potential for MODIS-derived fire severity mapping, the impacts of very severe fires on stand structure, and ongoing challenges associated with deriving reliable fire severity mapping products in Australian savanna systems.

TI  - Vegetation productivity responses to drought on tribal lands in the four corners region of the Southwest USA
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than a decade, the Four Corners Region has faced extensive and persistent drought conditions that have impacted vegetation communities and local water resources while exacerbating soil erosion. These persistent droughts threaten ecosystem services, agriculture, and livestock activities, and expose the hypersensitivity of this region to inter-annual climate variability and change. Much of the intermountainWestern United States has sparse climate and vegetation monitoring stations, making fine-scale drought assessments difficult. Remote sensing data offers the opportunity to assess the impacts of the recent droughts on vegetation productivity across these areas. Here, we propose a drought assessment approach that integrates climate and topographical data with remote sensing vegetation index time series. Multisensor Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from 1989 to 2010 at 5.6 km were analyzed to characterize the vegetation productivity changes and responses to the ongoing drought. A multi-linear regression was applied to metrics of vegetation productivity derived from the NDVI time series to detect vegetation productivity, an ecosystem service proxy, and changes. The results show that around 60.13% of the study area is observing a general decline of greenness (p < 0.05), while 3.87% show an unexpected green up, with the remaining areas showing no consistent change. Vegetation in the area show a significant positive correlation with elevation and precipitation gradients. These results, while, confirming the region's vegetation decline due to drought, shed further light on the future directions and challenges to the region's already stressed ecosystems. Whereas the results provide additional insights into this isolated and vulnerable region, the drought assessment approach used in this study may be adapted for application in other regions where surface-based climate and vegetation monitoring record is spatially and temporally limited.

TI  - Determination of annual and seasonal daytime and nighttime trends of MODIS LST over Greece - climate change implications
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging research topics during the last few decades, as temperature rise has already posed a significant impact on the earth's functions thus affecting all life of the planet. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is identified as a key variable in environmental and climate studies. The present study investigates the distribution of daytime and nighttime LST trends over Greece, a country in the Mediterranean area which is identified as one of the main "hot-spots" of climate change projections. Remotely sensed LST data were obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor in the form of 8-day composites of day and night values at a resolution of 1 km for a 17-year period, i.e. from 2000 to 2017. Spatial aggregates of 10 km x 10 km were computed and the annual and seasonal temporal trends were determined for each one of those sub-areas. Results showed that annual trends of daily LST in the majority of areas demonstrated decrease ranging from -1 * 10(-2) degrees C to -1.3 * 10(-3) degrees C, with some sporadic parts showing a slight increase. A totally different outcome is observed in the fate of night LST, with all areas over Greece demonstrating increasing annual trends ranging from 4.6 * 10(-5) degrees C to 3.1 * 10(-3) degrees C, with highest values in the South-East parts of the country. Seasonal trends in day and night LST showed the same pattern, i.e., a general decrease in the day LST and a definite increase in night. An interesting finding is the increase in winter LST trends observed both for day and night LST, indicating that the absolute minimum annual LST observed during winter in Greece increases. Our results also indicate that the annual diurnal LST range is decreasing. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land use change assessment in coastal mangrove forests of Iran utilizing satellite imagery and CA-Markov algorithms to monitor and predict future change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest stores large organic carbon stocks in a setting that is highly vulnerable to climate change and direct anthropogenic influences. As such there is a need to elucidate the causes and consequences of land use change on these ecosystems that have high value in terms of ecosystem services. We examine the areal pattern of land types in a coastal region located in southern Iran over a period of 14 years to predict future loss and gain in land types to the year 2025. We applied a CA-Markov model to simulate and predict mangrove forest change. Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze the land cover changes between soil, open water and mangroves. Major changes during this period were observed in soil and water which could be attributed to rising sea level. Furthermore, the mangrove area in the more seaward position was converted to open water due to sea-level rise. A cellular automata model was then used to predict the land cover changes that would occur by the year 2025. Results demonstrated that approximately 21 ha of mangrove area will be converted to open water, while mangroves are projected to expand by approximately 28 ha in landward direction. These changes need to be delineated to better inform precise mitigation and adaptation measures.

TI  - Prevalence of multimorbidity in general practice: a cross-sectional study within the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance System (Sentinella)
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity using a list of 75 chronic conditions derived from the International Classification for Primary Care, Second edition and developed specifically to assess multimorbidity in primary care. Our aim was also to provide prevalence data for multimorbidity in primary care in a country in which general practitioners (GPs) do not play a gatekeeping role in the health system.Setting A representative sample of GPs within the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network.Participants 118 GPs completed a paper-based questionnaire about 25 consecutive patients of all ages between September and November 2015. There were no patient exclusion criteria. Recorded data included date of birth, gender and the patients' chronic conditions.Primary and secondary outcome measures We estimated the prevalence of multimorbidity, defined as 22, and 23 chronic conditions stratified by gender and age group, and adjusted for clustering by GPs. We also computed the prevalence of each chronic condition individually and grouped by system.Results Data from 2904 patients were included (mean age (SD)=56.5 (20.5) years; male=43.7%). Prevalence was 52.1% (95% CI 48.6% to 55.5%) for >= 2 and 35.0% (95% CI 31.6% to 38.5%) for >= 3 chronic conditions, with no significant gender differences. Prevalence of two or more chronic conditions was low (6.2%, 95%C1 2.8% to 13.0%) in those below 20 but affected more than 85% (85.8%, 95% CI 79.6% to 90.3%) of those above the age of 80. The most prevalent conditions were cardiovascular (42.7%, 95% CI 39.7% to 45.7%), psychological (28.5%, 95% CI 26.1% to 31.1%) and metabolic or endocrine disorders (24.1%, 95% CI 21.6% to 26.7%). Elevated blood pressure was the most prevalent cardiovascular condition and depression the most common psychological disorder.Conclusion In a country in which GPs do riot play a gatekeeping role within the health system, the prevalence of multimorbidity, as assessed using a list of chronic conditions specifically relevant to primary care, is high and increases with age.

TI  - Monthly luminous efficacy models and illuminance prediction using ground measured and satellite data
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the derivation of the simple monthly luminous efficacy models to be applicable in daylight design and practice. Illuminance and irradiance data from the CIE IDMP station in Bratislava and climatological data from the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute as well as data obtained from the satellite representing the climate of Bratislava are used in this study. Three models of luminous efficacy based on statistical analyses are proposed. New models are compared with the Perez model and results are discussed. Finally the study is devoted to predict exterior illuminance using the proposed luminous efficacy models and derived from satellite irradiance data. The advantage of the presented approach is in application of irradiance data regularly measured on the ground and data from satellite images when no measured illuminance is available. After a simple calculation processing the results have shown good accuracy in terms of the RMSE and MBE when comparing the new model with the Perez model as reference.

TI  - Large-scale detection of vegetation dynamics and their potential drivers using MODIS images and BFAST: A case study in Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics at global scale is equally important in the context of terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere, interactions. The Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a spatial resolution of 250 m were used to detect vegetation dynamics in Quebec during 2000-2011. The overall agreement between BFAST detected breaks and observed disturbances was about 64% with the highest agreement up to 80% for "Fire" disturbance. The results presented in this study indicated that 25.7% of the total study area experienced NDVI trend changes with one or more breaks during 2000-2011, most of which were detected in the Boreal Shield eco-zone along the coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Abrupt vegetation changes barely varied under different eco-zones while considerably varied with different land cover types. The abrupt changes areas in 2002 and 2009 were the two greatest, with area percentages of 17.4% and 29.1% of the whole area, respectively. The area percentages of years with abrupt trend changes indicated that abrupt vegetation greening occurred in 2008 and 2009, especially in 2009, with 58.3% of the overall abrupt greening. Abrupt vegetation browning occurred in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007, especially in 2002, with 28.2% of the overall abrupt browning. Moreover, our results indicated that the detected vegetation trends varied temporally and spatially. Disturbances from existing field observations or remotely sensed images could only interpret < 40% of the vegetation changes. The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamic is particularly worth being investigated in the future work. To our knowledge, this study is one of the few attempting to explore large-scale detection of vegetation dynamics and their potential drivers in eastern Canada.

TI  - Macrophytes as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution in estuarine and coastal environments
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Derwent estuary, in Tasmania (Australia), is highly contaminated with heavy metals with significant levels in both sediments and benthic fauna. However, little is known about metal content in benthic primary producers. We characterized metal content (Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Lead, Selenium and Zinc) in twelve species of macrophyte, including red, green, and brown algae, and seagrasses, from the Derwent. The metals, arsenic, copper, lead, and Zinc were detected in all of the macrophytes assessed, but the levels differed between species. Seagrasses accumulated the highest concentrations of all metals; with Zn levels being particularly high in the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa (from the upper Estuary) and Pb was detected in Zostera muelleri (from the middle estuary). Ulva australis was ubiquitous throughout the middle-lower estuary and accumulated Zn in relatively high concentrations. The findings suggest that analysis of multiple species may be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of estuary-wide metal pollution.

TI  - Trends in Opioid and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Use and Adverse Events
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence and incidence of opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use before and since the start of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) and to assess rates of adverse events (AEs).STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study.METHODS: The OSI began in August 2012 and was fully implemented by the end of fiscal year (FY) 2013. The study timeframe was categorized into baseline (FY 2011-2012), transition (FY 2013), and postimplementation (FY 2014-2015) phases. Prevalence and incidence rates were calculated for opioid and NSAID users by quarter between FY 2011 and FY 2015. For AEs among new users of an NSAID or opioid, Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability weighting were used to adjust for potential confounding.RESULTS: There were 3,315,846 regular users of VHA care with at least 1 opioid and/ or NSAID outpatient prescription between FYs 2011 and 2015. The quarterly opioid prevalence rate was approximately 21% during the baseline and transition phases, then decreased to 17.3% in the postimplementation phase. NSAID prevalence remained constant at about 16%. Opioid incidence rates gradually decreased (2.7% to 2.2%) during the study, whereas NSAID incidence rates remained about 2.2%. After inverse probability weighting, patients receiving opioids had a greater risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.36-1.47), acute kidney injury (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 2.51-2.68), gastrointestinal bleeding (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.56-1.81), and all-cause mortality (HR, 3.73; 95% CI, 3.60-3.87) than NSAID users.CONCLUSIONS: Opioid use declined following implementation of the OSI, whereas NSAID use remained constant. Rates of AEs were higher among opioid users, which provides additional rationale for efforts to use NSAIDs for pain management when appropriate.

TI  - Estimation of the cover and management factor based on stratified coverage and remote sensing indices: a case study in the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We attempt to describe the cover and management (C) factor more comprehensively through the use of a simple and efficient method.We measure the coverage of each vegetation layer and C factor for 152 sampled plots in the Ansai watershed. We propose four stratified coverage indices (green coverage (V (G)), total coverage (V (T)), probability coverage (V (P)), weight coverage (V (W))), derive green and yellow vegetation indices from Landsat 8 OLI images to reflect green and residue cover, and construct and validate C factor estimation models from stratified coverage and remote sensing indices, respectively.(1) V (T) and V (P) present C factor estimation advantages for grassland and shrub land. V (W) can better illustrate the C factor due to the relatively complete spatial structuring of woodland and orchard land. For cropland, four stratified coverage indices present the same estimation capacities for the C factor. Except for cropland and grassland, the estimation capabilities of V (G) are relatively low because the residue layer is ignored. (2) The C factor is more sensitive to yellow vegetation indices, which indicates that senescent fractional cover and litter are important and cannot be ignored. The linear and non-linear models can explain 56.6 and 61.8% of C factor variation, respectively, and the linear model is more accurate than the non-linear model. (3) Compared to traditional indices (projective coverage and single remote sensing indices), stratified coverage indices and a combination of several remote sensing indices can estimate the C factor more effectively.At the field scale, the C value estimation model can be selected according to the land-use type. At the watershed and regional scales, a linear model is recommended for C factor estimation.

TI  - Independent Assessment of Sentinel-3A Wet Tropospheric Correction over the Open and Coastal Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Launched on 16 February 2016, Sentinel-3A (S3A) carries a two-band microwave radiometer (MWR) similar to that of Envisat, and is aimed at the precise retrieval of the wet tropospheric correction (WTC) through collocated measurements using the Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument. This study aims at presenting an independent assessment of the WTC derived from the S3A MWR over the open and coastal ocean. Comparisons with other four MWRs show Root Mean Square (RMS) differences (cm) of S3A with respect to these sensors of 1.0 (Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager, GMI), 1.2 (Jason-2), 1.3 (Jason-3), and 1.5 (Satellite with ARgos and ALtika (SARAL)). The linear fit with respect to these MWR shows scale factors close to 1 and small offsets, indicating a good agreement between all these sensors. In spite of the short analysis period of 10 months, a stable temporal evolution of the S3A WTC has been observed. In line with the similar two-band instruments aboard previous European Space Agency (ESA) altimetric missions, strong ice and land contamination can be observed, the latter mainly found up to 20-25 km from the coast. Comparisons with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and an independent WTC derived only from third party data are also shown, indicating good overall performance. However, improvements in both the retrieval algorithm and screening of invalid MWR observations are desirable to achieve the quality of the equivalent WTC from Jason-3. The outcome of this study is a deeper knowledge of the measurement capabilities and limitations of the type of MWR aboard S3A and of the present WTC retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Burn severity metrics in fire-prone pine ecosystems along a climatic gradient using Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imagery is a widely used source of information to address post-fire ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial bum severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the Mediterranean Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three bum severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for bum severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI). The results showed that Landsat spectral indices have a greater ability to determine site and vegetation bum severity than soil burn severity. We found large differences in indices performances among the three different climatic regions, since most indices performed better in the Mediterranean and Transition regions than in the Oceanic one. In general, the dNBR-EVI showed the best fit to site, vegetation and soil bum severity in the three regions, demonstrating broad transferability along the entire climatic gradient.

TI  - Genetic effects in <i>Helix aspersa</i> near a coal plant revealed by the micronucleus test
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal plants can be a major source of mutagenic pollutants. In this study we used the common land snail Helix aspersa, to detect the mutagenic effect of pollution from a coal plant in central Italy applying the micronucleus test (MN) on snail's haemocytes and evaluating trace elements concentration (As Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn) in soil and snails. Snails from a biological farm were exposed for 13 days in five locations at different distances from the plant. Wild snails collected in the same locations were also analysed. MN frequency in exposed snails was significantly higher in four locations within 10 km from to the plant, with respect to the control and the farthest location. Comparing the MN frequency between farmed and wild snails, a significantly higher frequency emerged for the exposed snails in all locations except the farthest, likely indicating adaptation or selection of the wild organisms due to chronic exposure to pollutants. In natural snails significantly higher MN frequencies with near the plant emerged as well. Trace elements analysis showed significant correlations between MN frequencies and both Zn and As concentrations in soil, for both exposed and wild snails, and Zn and Pb concentrations in exposed snails. Our results were consistent with those previously obtained when evaluating primary DNA damage in natural snails from the same area and show that the snails near the plant were affected by a permanent cytogenetic damage. Moreover, they confirm the suitability of snails for biomonitoring the presence of pollutants with mutagenic effect.

TI  - Consumer Responses to For-Profit Firms Exercising Religious Freedom in the Marketplace
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two judgments are at the heart of the controversy surrounding state-level religious freedom legislation and for-profit firms. For some, firms choosing to limit product/service access due to the owner's religious beliefs are viewed as appropriately asserting their First Amendment rights to religious freedom. Others posit that such laws legalize discrimination. The authors offer a theory in which homophily mediates consumers' perceptions of a firm that chooses to exercise its religious convictions in the for-profit market, and an orthodox worldview moderates this relationship. When these practices are perceived to be discriminatory, there is a strong negative effect on behavior intentions; however, perceptions that the firm is appropriately asserting religious freedoms are unlikely to increase customer traffic. The authors examine the policy implications from these investigations for states and local municipalities.

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping with indocyanine green or isosulfan blue demonstrate similar crossover rates to radiotracer identified sentinel nodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) resection is imperative for breast cancer staging. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) can preserve arm draining nodes and lymphatics during surgery. ARM is generally performed with isosulfan blue (ISB), restricting its use for concurrent SLN biopsy. Indocyanine green (ICG) could serve as an alternative to ISB for ARM procedures.MethodsSLN mapping and biopsy was performed via periareolar injection of (99)technetium-sulfur colloid ((TcSc)-Tc-99m, TSC). ISB and ICG were injected in the upper arm. Blue-stained lymphatics or nodes were visualized in the axilla; ICG was identified using the SPY Elite (R) system.ResultsTwenty-three patients underwent SLN biopsy with or without axillary node dissection and ARM procedures. Twenty of these patients had at least one hot node; 12 patients had SLNs that were only hot, 6 hot/blue/fluorescent, and 2 hot/fluorescent. Overall, crossover of ARM agents with SLNs occurred in 8 cases. Inspection of the axillary cavity after SLN biopsy revealed fluorescent lymphatics and nodes remaining in 14 and 7 patients, respectively. Blue lymphatics and blue nodes were detected in fewer cases.ConclusionNearly one-third of patients showed crossover between breast and arm draining nodes, which provides insight as to why some patients develop lymphedema symptoms after SLN biopsy. ICG and ISB identify similar numbers of SLNs. As such ICG could substitute for ISB in ARM procedures.

AB  - The coastal margin of the Pacific Northwest of the United States is a highly dynamic and productive region. Here, we use satellite, high-frequency mooring, and glider estimates of biologically relevant physical and optical variables to characterize seasonal patterns and latitudinal and cross-shore gradients in particle concentrations between the Washington and Oregon shelves. Consistent with prior research, we find that the Columbia River exerts a strong seasonal influence on the Washington shelf, but smaller coastal rivers and resuspension processes also appear important in determining particle distributions nearshore during winter across the full study region. We find fluorescence-based measurements of chlorophyll to be similar in magnitude across the two shelves over the time period examined, although the much weaker wind stresses off Washington indicate that processes other than upwelling are important determinants of chlorophyll changes in those areas, as previously suggested. These in situ observations contrast with the overall differences observed from satellite data, which consistently show higher chlorophyll concentrations off the Washington coast. This research suggests that latitudinal differences in chromophoric dissolved organic matter may be a partial explanation for perceived trends in satellite-derived chlorophyll. The observations presented are nascent; maturation of temporal and spatial coverage of OOI data sets will be necessary to more conclusively link physical forcing and biogeochemical responses.

TI  - Occupational Therapy in Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waivers
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) 1915(c) waivers are the largest provider of long-term services and supports for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). In this study, we explored how HCBS IDD waivers projected providing occupational therapy services in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.METHOD. Medicaid HCBS IDD waivers across the nation gathered from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to determine how they projected providing occupational therapy services in terms of service expenditures and utilization.RESULTS. In FY 2015, $14.13 million of spending was projected for occupational therapy services of 7,500 participants. However, there was large heterogeneity across states and services in terms of total projected spending, spending per participant, and reimbursement rates.CONCLUSION. Comparisons across states strengthen the profession's ability to assert the value of its services. These findings can help identify best practices and can advocate for the refinement of state occupational therapy programs.

TI  - The similar size of slums
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of the world's population currently resides in urban areas. In the majority of developing countries slums are a defining part of the urban scape. Their supply with energy, basic infrastructure, among others is one of the main challenges of modem civilizations. To provide an optimal supply, the spatial patterns of slums in cities have to be explored. While most of current literature is focused on inter-urban dynamics, this paper is focused on intra-urban pattern (i.e. the spatial pattern of morphological slums within a city) and its link to the inter-urban ones. Therefore, census and remote sensing data are analyzed to create rank size distributions of morphological slums in different cities of developing countries. The observations were compared to rank size distributions of cities in a respective developing country. It is found that typical inter-urban pattern can be transferred to intra-urban pattern. Surprisingly is the fact that the size of slums is independent from city and global region in the analyzed cities. The slums in Mumbai, Manila, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town have an average area of 0.016 km(2) with a standard deviation of only 0.004 km(2).

TI  - Implementation of a Two-Source Model for Estimating the Spatial Variability of Olive Evapotranspiration Using Satellite Images and Ground-Based Climate Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was carried out to evaluate the potential use of the two-source Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) model to compute the intra-orchard spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration (ET) of olive trees using satellite images and ground-based climate data. The study was conducted in a drip-irrigated olive orchard using satellite images (Landsat 7 ETM+), which were acquired on clear sky days during the main phenological stages (2009/10 growing season). The performance of the SW model was evaluated using instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) measurements that were obtained from an eddy correlation system. At the time of satellite overpass, the estimated values of net radiation (Rn-i) and soil heat flux (G(i)) were compared with ground measurements from a four-way net radiometer and soil heat flux plates, respectively. The results indicated that the SW model subestimated instantaneous LE (W m(-2)) and daily ET (mm d(-1)), with errors of 12% and 10% of observed values, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values for instantaneous LE were 26 and 20 W m(-2), while those for daily values of ET were 0.31 and 0.28 mm d(-1), respectively. Finally, the submodels computed Rni and Gi with errors of between 4.0% and 8.0% of measured values and with RMSE and MAE between 25 and 39W m(-2).

TI  - Estimation of the Spatiotemporal Patterns of Vegetation and Associated Ecosystem Services in a Bornean Montane Zone Using Three Shifting-Cultivation Scenarios
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical countries are now facing increasing global pressure to conserve tropical forests, while having to maintain cultivated lands (particularly shifting cultivation) for the subsistence of local people. To accomplish the effective conservation of tropical forests in harmony with subsistence shifting cultivation, we evaluated the influence of shifting cultivation on ecosystem services (i.e., biodiversity and carbon stock) at a landscape level based on three land-use scenarios. The study focus was the upland area between the Kinabalu Park and the Crocker Range Park in Sabah, northern Borneo, where local people conduct shifting cultivation for their subsistence. In this area, vegetation patches of various stages of secondary succession admix with shifting-cultivation lands. An earlier study in the same site depicted significant relationships between the stand ages of vegetation patches (which form a sere of secondary succession after the abandonment of cultivated land) and the above-ground biomass (i.e., carbon stock) and species composition of the stands. We incorporated these significant relationships to a stand-age estimation algorithm that had been developed earlier. We first mapped current (as of 2010) spatial patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community composition for the whole landscape. Subsequently, we simulated the spatiotemporal patterns of the above-ground biomass and plant-community distribution using three land-use scenarios: (1) reducing the area of shifting cultivation by one half and protecting the rest of the area; (2) shortening the minimum fallow period from 7 to 4 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation; and (3) elongating the minimum fallow period from 7 to 10 years while maintaining the same area of cultivation. Results indicated that land use based on scenario 2 could increase the carbon stock while maintaining the cultivation area. Our methods were effective in mapping the structure and composition of highly dynamic forests at a landscape level, and at predicting the future patterns of important ecosystem services based on land-use scenarios.

TI  - Combining satellite image data and field observations to characterize fresh-water carbonates in Kurkur Oasis, Southern Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several fresh-water carbonate deposits (tufa and travertine) were formed at different elevations within the Kurkur paleolake, 50 km west of Aswan, Egypt. Such paleolake was unique and confined in sag between the cuesta and the capping platform of Sin El-Kaddabaa Plateau. This work aims at integrating the remote sensing data together with the chemical and petrographic analyses to map and characterize these tufa and travertine deposits to define their paleo-depositional environment. A DEM with 2.5 m spatial resolution was generated from two ALOS/PRISM images to show geomorphological and hydrological parameters. In addition, full-polarimetric SAR data were used to investigate the scattering response of these tufa and travertine deposits. These deposits show a volume scattering response, with an increase in the pedestal height of the co- and cross-polarized signatures. The tufa and travertine deposits range from Pleistocene (older upper level) to Recent (younger lower level). The young tufa is hard, light brown porous and thinly-laminated, while the old tufa is generally coarse crystalline and consists of columnar pseudo denderitic calcite crystals. The travertine displays a stromatolitic fabric, where thin dark micritic algal laminae alternate with relatively thick calcitic bands (similar to 1 cm). Conducted XRD and chemical analyses reveal that these tufa and travertine are entirely composed of low magnesium calcite, with traces of quartz (<2%). Moreover, the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values suggest that the old tufa have been developed during warm pluvial periods, while the younger ones were precipitated in drier periods. Two hypotheses were introduced to explain the changes in the hydrological regime of Kurkur paleolake; the first proposes a hydrological breaching due to water overflow on the lake's low periphery areas that led to their desiccation (where the tufa and travertine were deposited) and the second is the possible integration into the regional drainage networks of the area presently occupied by Lake Nasser.

TI  - Fault distribution in the Precambrian basement of South Norway
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of the structural pattern by remote sensing methods (Landsat, SPOT, aerial photography, potential field data) and field study of selected structural elements shows that the cratonic basement of South Norway is strongly affected by a regular lineament pattern that encompasses fault swarms of different orientation, age, style, attitude and frequency. Albeit counting numerous fault and fracture populations, the faults are not evenly distributed and N-S to NNE-SSW/NNW-SSE and NE-SE/ENE-WSW-systems are spatially dominant. N-S to NNW-SSE structures can be traced underneath the Caledonian nappes to the Western Gneiss Region in western and central South Norway, emphasizing their ancient roots. Dyke swarms of different ages are found within most of these zones. Also, the Ostfold, Oslo Trondheim and the Mandal-Molde lineament zones coincide with trends of Sveconorwegian post collision granites.We conclude that the N-S-trend includes the most ancient structural elements, and that the trend can be traced back to the Proterozoic (Svecofennian and Sveconorwegian) orogenic events. Some of the faults may have been active in Neoproterozoic times as marginal faults of rift basins at the western margin of Baltica. Remnants of such fault activity have survived in the cores of many of the faults belonging to this system.The ancient systems of lineaments were passively overridden by the Caledonian fold-and-thrust system and remained mostly, but note entirely inactive throughout the Sub-Cambrian peneplanation and the Caledonian orogenic collapse in the Silurian-Devonian. The system was reactivated in extension from Carboniferous times, particularly in the Permian with the formation of the Oslo Rift and parts of it remain active to the Present, albeit by decreasing extension and fault activity.

T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: To assess the patterns of recurrence of node-positive endometrial cancer patients. Patients and Methods: This investigation assessed 82 patients who received different postoperative treatments. Results: Recurrence developed in 36 patients after a median time of 13.5 months, and involved the vagina, pelvic nodes, para-aortic nodes and distant sites in 5, 8, 16 and 17 patients, respectively. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 51.1% and 59.8%. PFS and OS were significantly better for endometrioid than for non-endometrioid tumors. There was a trend towards a better outcome for patients who underwent chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy compared to those who received radiotherapy alone. Among the former, there was a better 5-year PFS (65.8% versus 33.7%, p=0.038) in patients who received platinum/paclitaxel-based regimens compared to those who received platinum-based chemotherapy. Conclusion: Disease recurred in 43.9% of patients, and platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy plus radiotherapy appeared to be the best adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Challenges in Complementing Data from Ground-Based Sensors with Satellite-Derived Products to Measure Ecological Changes in Relation to Climate-Lessons from Temperate Wetland-Upland Landscapes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing climate-related ecological changes across spatiotemporal scales meaningful to resource managers is challenging because no one method reliably produces essential data at both fine and broad scales. We recently confronted such challenges while integrating data from groundand satellite-based sensors for an assessment of four wetland-rich study areas in the U. S. Midwest. We examined relations between temperature and precipitation and a set of variables measured on the ground at individual wetlands and another set measured via satellite sensors within surrounding 4 km(2) landscape blocks. At the block scale, we used evapotranspiration and vegetation greenness as remotely sensed proxies for water availability and to estimate seasonal photosynthetic activity. We used sensors on the ground to coincidentally measure surface-water availability and amphibian calling activity at individual wetlands within blocks. Responses of landscape blocks generally paralleled changes in conditions measured on the ground, but the latter were more dynamic, and changes in ecological conditions on the ground that were critical for biota were not always apparent in measurements of related parameters in blocks. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of decisions and assumptions we made in applying the remotely sensed data for the assessment and the value of integrating observations across scales, sensors, and disciplines.

TI  - Maximin distance based band selection for endmember extraction in hyperspectral images using simplex growing algorithm
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the fast growing technologies in the field of remote sensing, hyperspectral image analysis has made a great breakthrough. It provides accurate and detailed information of objects in the image when compared to any other remotely sensed data. It is possible because of its high redundancy in nature. But this redundancy in hyperspectral images leads to high computational complexity in their analysis. Hence Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a significant task in all hyperspectral image processing. DR can be achieved either by feature extraction or feature selection. Feature selection or Band selection is adopted in this paper because of no compromise in original data. Despite many algorithms that exist for band selection, this paper proposes a new concept of Maximin distance algorithm using Spectral Angle Distance (SAD) as distance measure for band selection. Virtual Dimensionality (VD) is used to provide the number of bands to be selected because it has been proved to be reliable estimate. Simplex Growing Algorithm (SGA) is deployed for endmember extraction in the experiment work. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed band selection algorithm, the Spectral Angle Distance (SAD) and Spectral Similarity Value (SSV) are used as measures. The efficacy of our proposed algorithm has been proved from experimental results in comparison with Constrained Band Selection (CBS), Similarity Based Band Selection (SBBS), Clustering Based Band Selection (CBBS), Uniform Band Selection (UBS), Minimum Variance Principal Component Analysis (MVPCA) and Exemplar Component Analysis (ECA) and Firefly Algorithm Based Band Selection (FABBS).

TI  - Regional Land Subsidence Analysis in Eastern Beijing Plain by InSAR Time Series and Wavelet Transforms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is the disaster phenomenon of environmental geology with regionally surface altitude lowering caused by the natural or man-made factors. Beijing, the capital city of China, has suffered from land subsidence since the 1950s, and extreme groundwater extraction has led to subsidence rates of more than 100 mm/year. In this study, we employ two SAR datasets acquired by Envisat and TerraSAR-X satellites to investigate the surface deformation in Beijing Plain from 2003 to 2013 based on the multi-temporal InSAR technique. Furthermore, we also use observation wells to provide in situ hydraulic head levels to perform the evolution of land subsidence and spatial-temporal changes of groundwater level. Then, we analyze the accumulated displacement and hydraulic head level time series using continuous wavelet transform to separate periodic signal components. Finally, cross wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) are implemented to analyze the relationship between the accumulated displacement and hydraulic head level time series. The results show that the subsidence centers in the northern Beijing Plain is spatially consistent with the groundwater drop funnels. According to the analysis of well based results located in different areas, the long-term groundwater exploitation in the northern subsidence area has led to the continuous decline of the water level, resulting in the inelastic and permanent compaction, while for the monitoring wells located outside the subsidence area, the subsidence time series show obvious elastic deformation characteristics (seasonal characteristics) as the groundwater level changes. Moreover, according to the wavelet transformation, the land subsidence time series at monitoring well site lags several months behind the groundwater level change.

TI  - Analysis of flood inundation in ungauged basins based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most expensive natural hazards experienced in many places of the world and can result in heavy losses of life and economic damages. The objective of this study is to analyze flood inundation in ungauged basins by performing near-real-time detection with flood extent and depth based on multi-source remote sensing data. Via spatial distribution analysis of flood extent and depth in a time series, the inundation condition and the characteristics of flood disaster can be reflected. The results show that the multi-source remote sensing data can make up the lack of hydrological data in ungauged basins, which is helpful to reconstruct hydrological sequence; the combination of MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) surface reflectance productions and the DFO (Dartmouth Flood Observatory) flood database can achieve the macro-dynamic monitoring of the flood inundation in ungauged basins, and then the differential technique of high-resolution optical and microwave images before and after floods can be used to calculate flood extent to reflect spatial changes of inundation; the monitoring algorithm for the flood depth combining RS and GIS is simple and easy and can quickly calculate the depth with a known flood extent that is obtained from remote sensing images in ungauged basins. Relevant results can provide effective help for the disaster relief work performed by government departments.

TI  - Management of antithrombotic agents in dermatologic surgery before and after publication of the corresponding German evidence-based guideline
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundA survey in 2012 revealed marked heterogeneity in the management of antithrombotic agents in dermatologic surgery in Germany. An evidence-based guideline on this topic was published for the first time in 2014.MethodsUsing the same study sample, we conducted an anonymous survey on the management of antithrombotic agents and familiarity with the guideline. We reported the results as relative frequencies and compared them with those from 2012.ResultsWe analyzed a total of 208 questionnaires (response rate: 36.6 %). A large majority of dermatologists reported performing minor procedures without discontinuing low-dose aspirin ( 100 mg), clopidogrel, or direct oral anticoagulants. In contrast, antithrombotic management was still heterogeneous in the context of major procedures, especially among office-based dermatologists. Overall, there was an increase in the proportion of dermatologists who managed phenprocoumon, aspirin, and clopidogrel in compliance with the guideline. For example, while 53.8 % of hospital-based dermatologists and 36.3 % of office-based dermatologists had performed large excisions on continued low-dose aspirin treatment in 2012, these figures showed an increase to 90.2 % and 57.8 %, respectively, by 2017 (phenprocoumon: from 33.8 % and 11.9 % to 63.9 % and 29.9 %, respectively; clopidogrel: from 36.9 % and 23.2 % to 63.9 % and 30.6 %, respectively). Among hospital dermatologists a large proportion was familiar with the guideline and considered it to be useful.ConclusionsOur results suggest that compliance with the German guideline on the perioperative management of antithrombotics in dermatologic surgery has increased for all procedures. Despite this positive development, greater efforts are needed to improve implementation of the guideline and address barriers to its use in everyday practice.

In this study cirrus clouds at temperatures colder than -40 degrees C simulated by the ECHAM-Hamburg Aerosol Module (ECHAM-HAM) general circulation model are compared to Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite data. The model captures the general cloud cover pattern and reproduces the observed median ice water content within a factor of 2, while extinction is overestimated by about a factor of 3 as revealed by temperature-dependent frequency histograms. Two distinct types of cirrus clouds are found: in situ-formed cirrus dominating at temperatures colder than -55 degrees C and liquid-origin cirrus dominating at temperatures warmer than -55 degrees C. The latter cirrus form in anvils of deep convective clouds or by glaciation of mixed-phase clouds, leading to high ice crystal number concentrations. They are associated with extinction coefficients and ice water content of up to 1 km(-1) and 0.1 gm(-3), respectively, while the in situ-formed cirrus are associated with smaller extinction coefficients and ice water content. In situ-formed cirrus are nucleated either heterogeneously or homogeneously. The simulated homogeneous ice crystals are similar to liquid-origin cirrus, which are associated with high ice crystal number concentrations. On the contrary, heterogeneously nucleated ice crystals appear in smaller number concentrations. However, ice crystal aggregation and depositional growth smooth the differences between several formation mechanisms, making the attribution to a specific ice nucleation mechanism challenging.

TI  - Spatial Accuracy Analysis of Aerial and Satellite Imagery of Zagreb
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is spatial accuracy analysis of aerial and satellite imagery. Nowadays, many satellite and aerial imagery are available through publicly and freely accessible sources and services. In this paper spatial accuracy for WorldView-2 (WV2) Ortho Ready Standard imagery (ORS2A), orthorectified WV2 imagery with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), imagery accessed through Google Earth service and accuracy for digital orthophoto (DOF) from 2011 and 2012 will be analysed. The study area is located in the central part of Zagreb, and covers the area of 131 square km part of the mountain Medvednica in the north, along with river Sava and lowland areas in the south. WV2 imagery were purchased within project GEMINI (Geospatial monitoring of green infrastructure using terrestrial, airborne and satellite imagery). Results of this research show that the ORS2A imagery achieved the worst accuracy, while aerial imagery (DOF) gained the best accuracy. The accuracy of the orthorectified WV2 imagery with SRTM DEM is on average 4.5 times higher than the ORS2A imagery, while the precision of the orthorectified imagery is on average 13 times higher than the ORS2A imagery. The accuracy of the orthorectified and Google Earth imagery is similar, while the precision of the orthorectified imagery is 35% higher than the Google Earth imagery. Entire research was conducted with using open-source software in combination with freely available and public data. In this way, future research can be easily conducted and reproduced for spatial accuracy analysis on other areas in Croatia and other locations.

TI  - Further Studies of Unsuspected Emphysema in Nonsmoking Patients With Asthma With Persistent Expiratory Airflow Obstruction
T2  - CHEST
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previously, we and other investigators have described reversible loss of lung elastic recoil in patients with acute and persistent, moderate-to-severe, chronic, treated asthma who never smoked, and its adverse effect on maximal expiratory airflow. In four consecutive autopsies, we reported the pathophysiologic mechanism(s)has been unsuspected mild, diffuse, middle and upper lobe centrilobular emphysema.METHODS: We performed prospective studies (5 to 22 years) in 25 patients (12 female) with chronic asthma, age 55 +/- 15 years, who never smoked, with persistent moderate-to-severe expiratory obstruction. Studies included measuring blood eosinophils, IgE, total exhaled nitric oxide (NO), central airway NO flux, peripheral airway/alveolar NO concentration, impulse oscillometry, heliox curves, lung elastic recoil, and high-resolution thin-section (1 mm) lung CT imaging at full inspiration with voxel quantification.RESULTS: In 25 patients with stable asthma with varying type 2 phenotype, after 270 mg of aerosolized albuterol sulfate had been administered with a metered dose inhaler with space chamber, FVC was 3.1 +/- 1.0 L (83% +/- 13% predicted) (mean +/- SD), FEV1 was 1.8 +/- 0.6 L (59% +/- 11%), the FEV1/FVC ratio was 59% +/- 10%, and the ratio of single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide to alveolar volume was 4.8 +/- 1.1 mL/min/mmHg/L (120% +/- 26%). All 25 patients with asthma had loss of static lung elastic recoil pressure, which contributed equally to decreased intrinsic airway conductance in limiting expiratory airflow. Lung CT scanning detected none or mild emphysema. In all four autopsied asthmatic lungs previously reported and one unreported explanted lung, microscopy revealed unsuspected mild, diffuse centrilobular emphysema in the upper and middle lung fields, and asthma-related remodeling in airways. In eight cases, during asthma remission, there were increases in measured static lung elastic recoil pressure-calculated intrinsic airway conductance, and measured maximal expiratory airflow at effort-independent lung volumes.CONCLUSIONS: As documented now in five cases, unsuspected microscopic mild centrilobular emphysema is the sentinel cause of loss of lung elastic recoil. This contributes significantly to expiratory airflow obstruction in never-smoking patients with asthma, with normal diffusing capacity and near-normal lung CT scan results.

TI  - Role of sentinel node in differentiated thyroid cancer: a prospective study comparing patent blue injection technique, lymphoscintigraphy and the combined technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of the sentinel lymph node (SLNs) biopsy in differentiated thyroid cancer using patent blue injection, lymphoscintigraphy and the combined techniques.Methods Between January 2011 and January 2013, 82 consecutive patients were enrolled in our prospective multicentre study. Inclusion criteria were 18 years of age, preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, no evidence of lymph node enlargement and multifocal neoplasm. To investigate the benefits of each procedure, all patients underwent total thyroidectomy plus central compartment lymphadenectomy, and in all cases, the SLN was identified via one of three techniques using the same protocol.Results Lymphoscintigraphy was used in five patients, patent blue injection was used in 40 patients, and a combined technique was used in 40 patients to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). SLNs were identified in 61 cases. In the patent blue injection technique, the sensitivity, specificity and false negative rates were 88.9, 94.4 and 3.8%, respectively. In the lymphoscintigraphy technique, the percentages of sensitivity and specificity were 100%, and the percentage false negative was 0%. For the combined techniques, the corresponding values were, respectively, 69.2, 90, and 17.4%. Metastases were detected in nine cases of lateral-cervical nodes, ipsilateral tumour metastases were observed in eight cases, and contralateral tumour metastasis was observed in one case.Conclusion Additional well-designed randomized studies are needed to validate and further optimize the SLN biopsy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer-Feasibility, safety and lymphatic complications
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To compare the rate of lymphatic complications in women with endometrial cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy versus a full pelvic and infrarenal paraaortic lymphadenectomy, and to examine the overall feasibility and safety of the former.Methods. A prospective study of 188 patients with endometrial cancer planned for robotic surgery. Indocyanine green was used to identify the sentinel lymph nodes. In low-risk patients the lymphadenectomy was restricted to removal of sentinel lymph nodes whereas in high-risk patients also a full lymphadenectomy was performed. The impact of the extent of the lymphadenectomy on the rate of complications was evaluated.Results. The bilateral detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes was 96% after cervical tracer injection. No intraoperative complication was associated with the sentinel lymph node biopsy per se. Compared with hysterectomy alone, the additional average operative time for removal of sentinel lymph nodes was 33 min whereas 91 min were saved compared with a full pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone resulted in a lower incidence of leg lymphedema than infrarenal paraaortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy (1.3% vs 18.1%, p = 0.0003).Conclusion. The high feasibility, the absence of intraoperative complications and the low risk of lymphatic complications supports implementing detection of sentinel lymph nodes in low-risk endometrial cancer patients. Given that available preliminary data on sensitivity and false negative rates in high-risk patients are confirmed in further studies, we also believe that the reduction in lymphatic complications and operative time strongly motivates the sentinel lymph node concept in high-risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - The Fragile State of the National Institutes of Health Pediatric Research Portfolio, 1992-2015: Doing More With Less?
T2  - JAMA PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this article, we examine the status of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) pediatric research portfolio between start of federal fiscal year (FY) 1992 and end of FY 2015. The NIH experienced the greatest mean annual growth rate during the "doubling era" (FY 1998-2003): both the NIH budget (13.5%) and pediatric research portfolios (11.5%) increased annually by double digits. However, in the "postdoubling" era (FY 2004-2009), both the NIH (2.0%) and pediatric (-0.2%) mean annual growth rates decreased dramatically. In the most recent era (FY 2010-2015), the NIH mean annual growth rate has been flat (-0.1%) and pediatric research funding has posted very modest gains (3.5%) without accounting for 1-time increases under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We offer recommendations to protect against further erosion of the pediatric research portfolio because continuation of these trends will have a negative effect on the health of children during their childhood and as adults. As capacity to conduct basic and applied research is further constrained, it will be a challenge for pediatric researchers to do more with less and less.

TI  - Urban expansion dynamics and modes in metropolitan Guangzhou, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization changes urban landscapes and results in ecological and environmental problems. To solve these problems, it is essential to quantify the dynamics of urban expansion and better understand the modes of urban sprawl. This study evaluated urbanization in metropolitan Guangzhou, China from 1990 to 2020 and explored its modes of urban growth using Landsat Thematic Mapper images and simulated landscape maps based on the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (CLUE) modeling framework. The results indicate that Guangzhou has experienced great expansion, characterized by the tripling of its total urbanized area within the last 20 years, and it is projected to continue expanding into less developed areas (agricultural and forest land). The results also show that adjusting the land-use structure sometime has a greater effect on the formation of the urban landscape than spatial restriction policies. Three urban expansion modes (infilling, edge expanding, and leapfrogging) were observed to occur simultaneously along with a shift in their relative dominance, which reveals a spiraling urban process.

TI  - Application of Imaging Spectroscopy for Mineral Exploration in Alaska: A Study over Porphyry Cu Deposits in the Eastern Alaska Range
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey tested the utility of imaging spectroscopy (also referred to as hyperspectral remote sensing) as an aid to regional mineral exploration efforts in remote parts of Alaska. Airborne imaging spectrometer data were collected in 2014 over unmined porphyry Cu deposits in the eastern Alaska Range using the HyMap (TM) sensor. Maps of the distributions of predominant minerals, made by matching reflectance signatures in the remotely sensed data to reference spectra in the shortwave infrared region, do not uniquely discriminate individual rock units. However, they do highlight hydrothermal alteration associated with porphyry deposits and prospects hosted mostly within the Nabesna pluton. In and around porphyry Cu deposits at Orange Hill and Bond Creek, unique spectral signatures are related to variations in chlorite and white mica abundance and their chemical composition. This is best revealed in the longer-wavelength 2,200-nm Al-OH absorption feature positions in pixels spectrally dominated by white mica proximal to porphyry deposits. Similar spectral signatures of chlorite and white mica wavelength positions were also recognized away from the porphyry deposits; follow-up sampling identified these satellite areas to also contain Cu-Mo-Au mineralized rock. Our study confirms that airborne imaging spectroscopy has application for regional mineral exploration in exposed mountainous terrain in Alaska.

T2  - EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The sex ratio at birth (male divided by total live births: M/T) has been mooted as a potential sentinel health indicator. Several metrics indicate individual countries' health and socioeconomic status. In this study, in all available countries (where such data was accessible), M/T and these indicators were compared in order to ascertain whether better (vis-a-vis health and socioeconomic status) levels of these indicators were associated with higher M/T in available countries.Methods: The following were obtained (by country) from various sources: M/T, infant mortality rate, under 5 years mortality rate, fertility rate, Human Development Index, gross domestic product per capita, life expectancy for both sexes, females, males, as well as both sexes Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE). Pearson correlation was performed comparing W/T and these indicators.Results: Despite weak correlation values, all except for the Human Development Index (HDI) correlated with M/T at statistically significant levels.Discussion: A decrease in mortality and an increase in life expectancy and GDP/capita are indicators of socioeconomic wellbeing. In this study, mortality was negatively correlated with M/T. Life expectancy and GDP/capita were both positively correlated with M/T, indicating that M/T may also serve as a surrogate health indicator, and incidentally, also supporting the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Improving economies lead to increasing education, which in turns tends to lower fertility rate in association with a declining M/T. In conclusion, the global correlation of health and socioeconomic indicators with M/T suggests that M/T may be a useful sentinel health indicator.

TI  - The role of host patch characteristics and dispersal capability in distribution and abundance of <i>Arhopalus rusticus</i> in central Argentina
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Host patch characteristics may influence the abundance of a species, but this will depend on the species' dispersal ability and the distance between suitable patches. In central Argentina, an area of introduced pine forest was planted for wood production in the 1940s. In 2006, an invading longhorn beetle, Arhopalus rusticus (L.) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), was detected in the area. Since then, the species has expanded its range until it occupies the whole area. We analyze how the configuration of host patches and flight performance of A.rusticus affect its distribution. The study was performed in the center-west of Cordoba Province, Argentina, with 24000ha of introduced pine forests the main pine production zone of the province. Land cover was estimated using Landsat 8 scenes. Landscape was quantified by estimating the focal patch's area, fractal dimension index (FRAC), and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENN). Focal patch area showed a positive relationship with A.rusticus abundance, whereas ENN and FRAC had a negative relationship. The dispersal ability of A.rusticus was determined by putting recently emerged individuals to fly in flight mills. The flight performance results indicated that the species was probably introduced in the area by human activity, then rapidly established and expanded to the whole area. This indicates the importance of preventing its arrival in other pine production areas of Argentina, as it has proved to be an extremely successful invader.

TI  - Predicting forest height using the GOST, Landsat 7 ETM+, and airborne LiDAR for sloping terrains in the Greater Khingan Mountains of China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sloping terrain of forests is an overlooked factor in many models simulating the canopy bidirectional reflectance distribution function, which limits the estimation accuracy of forest vertical structure parameters (e.g., forest height). The primary objective of this study was to predict forest height on sloping terrain over large areas with the Geometric-Optical Model for Sloping Terrains (COST) using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and Landsat 7 imagery in the western Greater Khingan Mountains of China. The Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) algorithm was used to generate image end members and corresponding abundances in Landsat imagery. Then, LiDAR-derived forest metrics, topographical factors and SMACC abundances were used to calibrate and validate the COST, which aimed to accurately decompose the SMACC mixed forest pixels into sunlit crown, sunlit background and shade components. Finally, the forest height of the study area was retrieved based on a back-propagation neural network and a look-up table. Results showed good performance for coniferous forests on all slopes and at all aspects, with significant coefficients of determination above 0.70 and root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 0.50 m and 1.00 m based on ground observed validation data. Higher RMSEs were found in areas with forest heights below 5 m and above 17 m. For 90% of the forested area, the average RMSE was 3.58 m. Our study demonstrates the tremendous potential of the COST for quantitative mapping of forest height on sloping terrains with multispectral and LiDAR inputs.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Trend analysis is an important issue for the decision-making processes. Thus, trends of rainfall, consecutive dry days (CDD), and consecutive wet days (CWD) in the Upper Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil, using daily rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for recent 18 years, were analyzed. Instead of analyzing the trend of one average time series for one specific confidence level, a spatiotemporal analysis over the entire area with 169 continuous time series is done by applying the nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Sen tests for simultaneously 13 confidence levels and a new integrated confidence classification is proposed. The results show that the rainfall has increased during the less rainy periods (from June to October) and has decreased in the rainy periods (from November to May), with the highest and lowest confidence levels, respectively. An analysis of CDD and CWD shows that the number of CDD has decreased, while the number of CWD has increased, which revealed that the dry periods are more frequently interrupted for the period studied.

TI  - Integrating airborne lidar and satellite imagery to model habitat connectivity dynamics for spatial conservation prioritization
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of regional-level airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data to characterize habitat patches and model habitat connectivity over large landscapes has not been well explored. Maintaining a connected network of habitat in the presence of anthropogenic disturbances is essential for regional-level conservation planning and the maintenance of biodiversity values.We quantified variation in connectivity following simulated changes in land cover and contrasted outcomes when different conservation priorities were emphasized.First, we defined habitat patches using vegetation structural attributes identified via lidar. Second, habitat networks were constructed for different forest types and assessed using network connectivity metrics. And finally, land cover change scenarios were simulated using a series of habitat patch removals, representing the impact of implementing different spatial prioritization schemes.Networks for different forest structure types produced very different patch distributions. Conservation scenarios based on different schemes led to contrasting changes during land cover change simulations: the scheme prioritizing only habitat area resulted in immediate near-term losses in connectivity, whereas the scheme considering both habitat area and their spatial configurations maintained the overall connectivity most effectively. Adding climate constraints did not diminish or improve overall connectivity.Both habitat area and habitat configuration should be considered in dynamic modeling of habitat connectivity under changing landscapes. This research provides a framework for integrating forest structure and cover attributes obtained from remote sensing data into network connectivity modeling, and may serve as a prototype for multi-criteria forest management and conservation planning.

TI  - Change Detection in Optical Satellite Images Based on Local Binary Similarity Pattern Technique
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a binary descriptor-based approach is proposed to provide change detection in bitemporal optical satellite images. Multitemporal satellite images suffer from illumination variation. In order to tackle this problem, a variant of a local binary similarity pattern (LBSP) descriptor, which has a good resistance to illumination variation, is proposed. The proposed technique consists of two steps: binary feature vector creation and generation of binary change map using Hamming distance as a similarity metric. To get the binary feature vectors, inter-LBSP, which utilizes the region information across images, is applied on both images. Before applying LBSP, both images are partitioned into overlapping patches. This letter proposes two methods taking different combinations of patches at each pixel position. First one uses the center of one image and neighborhood information of two images, whereas the second one uses the center of two images and neighborhood information of one image. Unlike the conventional LBSP technique, a new threshold calculation technique is used for the generation of binary feature vectors. Experiments are conducted on three data sets acquired by the Landsat satellite, and results show that the proposed technique performs better compared with the earlier reported techniques.

TI  - Endoplasmic reticulum chaperones tweak the mitochondrial calcium rheostat to control metabolism and cell death
T2  - CELL CALCIUM
M3  - Review
AB  - The folding of secretory proteins is a well-understood mechanism, based on decades of research on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones. These chaperones interact with newly imported polypeptides close to the ER translocon. Classic examples for these proteins include the immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP/GRP78), and the lectins calnexin and calreticulin. Although not considered chaperones per se, the ER oxidoreductases of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family complete the folding job by catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds through cysteine oxidation. Research from the past decade has demonstrated that ER chaperones are multifunctional proteins. The regulation of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ crosstalk is one of their additional functions, as shown for calnexin, BiP/GRP78 or the oxidoreductases Ero1 alpha and TMX1. This function depends on interactions of this group of proteins with the ER Ca2+ handling machinery. This novel function makes perfect sense for two reasons: i. It allows ER chaperones to control mitochondrial apoptosis instantly without a lengthy bypass involving the upregulation of pro-apoptotic transcription factors via the unfolded protein response (UPR); and ii. It allows the ER protein folding machinery to fine-tune ATP import via controlling the speed of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, the role of ER chaperones in regulating ER-mitochondria Ca2+ flux identifies the progression of secretory protein folding as a central regulator of cell survival and death, at least in cell types that secrete large amount of proteins. In other cell types, ER protein folding might serve as a sentinel mechanism that monitors cellular well-being to control cell metabolism and apoptosis. The selenoprotein SEPN1 is a classic example for such a role. Through the control of ER-mitochondria Ca2+-flux, ER chaperones and folding assistants guide cellular apoptosis and mitochondrial metabolism. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effectiveness of deservingness-based advertising messages: The role of product knowledge and belief in a just world
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Are advertisements that tell consumers they deserve a product effective? Given evidence showing people are motivated to get what they deserve, we argue that for certain consumers this is the case. In two experiments, we manipulated the type of ad participants viewed for a luxury product and then assessed ad effectiveness. We also measured participants' belief in a just world (BJW) and product knowledge. Deservingness-based ads were (a) more effective for strong BJW participants, mediated by the degree to which the ads matched participants' worldview and justified buying the product, and (b) less effective for high knowledge participants. We conclude that deservingness-based advertising can be successful, depending on consumer characteristics. Copyright (c) 2016 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Updated Inventory of Glacial Lakes in Teesta Basin Using Remote Sensing Data for Use in GLOF Risk Assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed inventory of glacial lakes in a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) prone area is vital for disaster mitigation. Availability of cheaper high resolution satellite data from Indian remote sensing satellites enables us to create up-to-date inventory for use in prioritisation of glacial lakes for GLOF risk assessment. Earlier inventories show presence of more glacial lakes in Brahmaputra basin in Indian Himalaya. Teesta River is one of the tributary of Brahmaputra and previous studies have shown that the inventory of glacial lakes in Teesta basin varies from 143 to 320. In the present study, the inventory carried out using satellite data of years 2000, 2007 and 2014 show presence of 301 (25.789 km(2)), 302 (26.081 km(2)) and 644 (29.706 km(2)) glacial lakes in Teesta basin respectively. The steep increase in number of lakes in the latest inventory is primarily due to the finer spatial resolution of satellite data used. Analysis of water spread area of glacial lakes at different altitudes shows that most of the lakes in the higher altitudes are small in size. It is observed that more than 66% of lakes are in the altitude beyond 4500 m and of size less than 50,000 sqm (5 ha). Out of 301 glacial lakes inventoried during 2000, water spread area of 6 lakes have decreased in 2014 and 31 lakes have shown increase in area. Out of these 31 lakes, 17 lakes are classified as end moraine dammed lakes and among them, 14 are located in Upper Teesta sub-basin and in higher altitudes (beyond 5000 m). The prioritisation of these lakes for GLOF risk needs to be carried out with detailed field investigation.

TI  - More for Us or More for Me? Social Dominance as Parochial Egoism
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intergroup interactions allow members of advantaged groups to cooperate with in-group and out-group members alike (universal cooperation), cooperate with in-group members exclusively (parochial cooperation), or withhold cooperation altogether. These behaviors impact the intergroup hierarchy differently; therefore, individuals' ideological support of intergroup hierarchy may predict their choices among them. Universal cooperation is inherently egalitarian and hence inconsistent with social dominance orientation (SDO). Although parochial cooperation strengthens the in-group relative to the out-group, and hence consistent with SDO, it is unclear to what extent members of advantaged groups higher in SDO are willing to pay the costs associated with participation in parochial cooperation. Studies conducted across three distinct intergroup contexts in the United States and Israel consistently find that SDO coincides with behavioral selfishness, a pattern we label parochial egoism. These findings illuminate a gap between individuals' ideological worldview and their social behavior and elucidate the motivational meaning of SDO.

TI  - Post-War Land Cover Changes and Fragmentation in Halgurd Sakran National Park (HSNP), Kurdistan Region of Iraq
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: The fundamental driving force of land use and land cover (LULC) change is related to spatial and temporal processes caused by human activities such as agricultural expansion and demographic change. Landscape metrics were used to analyze post-war changes in a rural mountain landscape, the protected area of Halgurd-Sakran National Park (HSNP) in north-east Iraq. Therefore, the present work attempts to identify the temporal trends of the most fragmented land cover types between two parts of the national park. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to compare two land cover classification algorithms, maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and random forest (RF) in the upper and lower parts of HSCZ, and to examine whether landscape configuration in the park has changed over time by comparing the fragmentation, connectivity and diversity of LULC classes. Methods: Two Landsat images were used to analyze LULC fragmentation and loss of habitat connectivity (before and after the Fall of Baghdad in 2003). Seven landscape pattern metrics, percentage of land (PLAND), number of patch (NP), largest patch index (LPI), mean patch size (MPS), euclidian nearest neighborhood distance (ENN_AM), interspersion and juxtaposition (IJI) and cohesion at class level were selected to assess landscape composition and configuration. Results: A significant change in LULC classes was noticed in the lower part of the park, especially for pasture, cultivated and forest-lands. The fragmentation trends and their changes were observed in both parts of the park, however, more were observed in the lower part. The inherent causes of these changes are the socio-economic factors created by the 1991-2003 UN post-war economic sanctions. The changes increased during sanctions and decreased afterwards. The fall of Baghdad in 2003, followed by rapid economic boom, marked the greatest cause in land use change, especially in changes-susceptible cultivated areas. Conclusions: Shrinkage of forest patches in the lower part of the park increases the distance between them, which contributes to a decline in biological diversity from decreasing habitat area. Lastly, the results confirm the applicability of the combined method of remote sensing and landscape metrics.

TI  - The GF-3 SAR Data Processor
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data processor was developed as a workstation-based GF-3 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing system. The processor consists of two vital subsystems of the GF-3 ground segment, which are referred to as data ingesting subsystem (DIS) and product generation subsystem (PGS). The primary purpose of DIS is to record and catalogue GF-3 raw data with a transferring format, and PGS is to produce slant range or geocoded imagery from the signal data. This paper presents a brief introduction of the GF-3 data processor, including descriptions of the system architecture, the processing algorithms and its output format.

AB  - Ore prediction based on the Operational Land Imager (ETM+) image within the heavily vegetated and sediments-covered areas is always a difficulty for geological remote sensing. Here, we report a new scheme for extraction of near-ore alteration information in such localities: Terrain Analysisprincipal component analysisFractalSpatial Overlay and the Fe3+-OH- integrated anomalies that are punctate and probably ore-caused were reasonably exposed. Findings showed a satisfactory result that the spatial, if not genetic, dependency relationship between the remotely sensed anomalies and geochemical anomalies, as well as the ore-controlling geological bodies, is significant. However, no substantial spectral anomalies of vegetation immediately responsible for local mineralization and alteration were detected. This study may have contributed a useful case study for in-depth remote sensing exploration.

TI  - An integrated approach for extraction of lithology information using the SPOT 6 imagery in a heavily Quaternary-covered regionNorth Baoji District of China
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the applicability of SPOT (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre) 6 satellite imagery for red sandstone interpretation in the heavily loess-covered northern Baoji District, China, which is always a crucial but challenging issue in remote sensing geological mapping. First, the non- or sparsely vegetated subareas were outlined in order to narrow the interpretation target area; second, band-math and the fractal DN-N (digital number-frequency) algorithm was conducted to extract the sandstone-associated anomalies; third, a series of spatial analysis, for example, overlaying and clumping, was employed for elimination of the false anomalies; finally, we took advantage of matched filtering to discern the non- (red) sandstone outcrops in local areas. Generally, the interpretation accuracy based on this novel technical proposal is acceptable74% or slightly less (taking the geological sketch as reference criteria)and can be well proven by field investigation. This study may have contributed a useful case study for remote-sensing lithological mapping in the Quaternary-covered areas.

TI  - Uneven accountability in the wake of political violence: Evidence from Kenya's ashes and archives
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The government faces a principal-agent problem with lower-level state officers. Officers are often expected to use the state coercive capacity endowed to them to politically benefit the government. But officers can shirk from the government's demands. An officer's actions during bouts of large-scale and highly visible electoral violence reveal the officer's type, thereby providing the government with the information necessary to solve its principal-agent problem for the future. The government holds officers who used their authority to perpetuate incumbent-instigated violence accountable through positive rewards, while holding officers who used their authority to perpetuate opposition-instigated violence accountable through negative sanctions. We find evidence in support of the theory using micro-level archival data on 2,500 local officer appointments and fine-grained satellite data on the locations of violence in the aftermath of Kenya's 2007 election. The Kenyan government was more likely to fire officials whose jurisdictions saw opposition-instigated violence that targeted government supporters. But we find the opposite result where violence was instigated by incumbent supporters: there, officers were less likely to be fired if violence occurred in their jurisdiction. Our results indicate that leaders can manipulate accountability processes after political violence to further politicize the state.

TI  - Australian mean land-surface temperature
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mean land-surface temperature represents an important boundary condition for many geothermal studies. This boundary is particularly important to help constrain the models made to analyse resource systems, many of which are shallow in nature and observe relatively small thermal gradients. Consequently, a mean land-surface temperature map of the Australian continent has been produced from 13 years of MODIS satellite imagery, for the period 2003-2015. The map shows good agreement with independent methods of estimating mean land surface temperature, including borehole surface -temperature extrapolation and long-term, near-surface ground measurements. In comparison to previously used methods of estimating mean land-surface temperature, our new estimates are up to 12 degrees C warmer. The MODIS-based method presented in this study provides spatially continuous estimates of land-surface temperature that can be incorporated as the surface thermal boundary condition in geothermal studies. The method is also able to provide a quantification of the uncertainties expected in the application of these estimates for the purposes of thermal modelling.

TI  - Regional Crop Gross Primary Productivity and Yield Estimation Using Fused Landsat-MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop yield assessments using satellite remote sensing-based methods are of interest for regional monitoring and the design of policies that promote agricultural resiliency and food security. However, the application of current vegetation productivity algorithms derived from global satellite observations is generally too coarse to capture cropland heterogeneity. The fusion of data from different sensors can provide enhanced information and overcome many of the limitations of individual sensors. In thitables study, we estimate annual crop yields for seven important crop types across Montana in the continental USA from 2008-2015, including alfalfa, barley, maize, peas, durum wheat, spring wheat and winter wheat. We used a satellite data-driven light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over croplands at 30-m spatial resolution and eight-day time steps using a fused NDVI dataset constructed by blending Landsat (5 or 7) and Terra MODIS reflectance data. The fused 30-m NDVI record showed good consistency with the original Landsat and MODIS data, but provides better spatiotemporal delineations of cropland vegetation growth. Crop yields were estimated at 30-m resolution as the product of estimated GPP accumulated over the growing season and a crop-specific harvest index (HIGPP). The resulting GPP estimates capture characteristic cropland productivity patterns and seasonal variations, while the estimated annual crop production results correspond favorably with reported county-level crop production data (r = 0.96, relative RMSE = 37.0%, p < 0.05) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The performance of estimated crop yields at a finer (field) scale was generally lower, but still meaningful (r = 0.42, relative RMSE = 50.8%, p < 0.05). Our methods and results are suitable for operational applications of crop yield monitoring at regional scales, suggesting the potential of using global satellite observations to improve agricultural management, policy decisions and regional/global food security.

TI  - Satellite-based mapping of daily high-resolution ground PM<sub>2.5</sub> in China via space-time regression modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and statistical modeling provides a promising approach to estimating PM2.5 concentrations for a large region. However, few studies have conducted high spatial resolution assessments of ground-level PM2.5 for China at the national scale, due to the limitations of high-resolution AOD products. To generate high-resolution PM2.5 for the entirety of mainland China, a combined 3 km AOD dataset was produced by blending the newly released 3 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target AOD data with the 10 km-resolution MODIS Deep Blue AOD data. Using this dataset, surface PM2.5 measurements, and ancillary information, a space-time regression model that is an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression(GTWR) with an interior point algorithm (IPA) based efficient mechanism for selecting optimal parameter values, was developed to estimate a large set of daily PM2.5 concentrations. Comparisons with the popular spatiotemporal models (daily geographically weighted regression and two-stage model) indicated that the proposed GTWR model, with an R-2 of 0.80 in cross-validation (CV), performs notably better than the two other models, which have an R-2 in CV of 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. The use of the combined 3-km high resolution AOD data was found not only to present detailed particle gradients, but also to enhance model performance (CV R-2 is only 0.32 for the non-combined AOD data). Furthermore, the GTWR's ability to predict PM2.5 for days without PM2.5-AOD paired samples and to generate historical PM2.5 estimates was demonstrated. As a result, fine-scale PM2.5 maps over China were generated, and several PM2.5 hotspots were identified. Therefore, it becomes possible to generate daily high-resolution PM2.5 estimates over a large area using GTWR, due to its synergy of spatial and temporal dimensions in the data and its ability to extend the temporal coverage of PM2.5 observations.

AB  - For Microwave Humidity and Temperature sounder (MWHTS) measurements over the ocean, a cloud filtering method is presented to filter out cloud- and precipitation-affected observations by analyzing the sensitivity of the simulated brightness temperatures of MWHTS to cloud liquid water, and using the root mean square error (RMSE) between observation and simulation in clear sky as a reference standard. The atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles are retrieved using MWHTS measurements with and without filtering by multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN) and one-dimensional variational (1DVAR) retrieval methods, respectively, and the effects of the filtering method on the retrieval accuracies are analyzed. The numerical results show that the filtering method can improve the retrieval accuracies of the MLR and the 1DVAR retrieval methods, but have little influence on that of the ANN. In addition, the dependencies of the retrieval methods upon the testing samples of brightness temperature are studied, and the results show that the 1DVAR retrieval method has great stability due to that the testing samples have great impact on the retrieval accuracies of the MLR and the ANN, but have little impact on that of the 1DVAR.

TI  - Joint Gaussian Processes for Biophysical Parameter Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solving inverse problems is central in geosciences and remote sensing. The radiative transfer models (RTMs) represent mathematically the physical laws that rule the phenomena in remote sensing applications (forward models). The numerical inversion of the RTM equations is a challenging and computationally demanding problem. For this reason, often the application of a simpler statistical regression is preferred. In general, the regression models predict the biophysical parameter of interest from the corresponding received radiance, learning a mapping from in situ data. However, this approach does not employ the physical information encoded in the RTMs. An alternative strategy, which attempts to include the physical knowledge, consists in learning a regression model trained using simulated data by an RTM code. In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear nonparametric regression model that combines the benefits of the two aforementioned approaches. The inversion is performed considering jointly both real observations and RTMsimulated data. The proposed joint Gaussian process (JGP) provides a solid framework for exploiting the regularities between the two types of data, in order to perform inverse modeling. The JGP automatically detects the relative quality of the simulated and real data, and combines them properly. This occurs by learning an additional hyperparameter with respect to a standard Gaussian process model, so that the novel scheme is at the same time simple and robust, i.e., capable of adapting to different scenarios. The advantages of the JGP method compared with benchmark strategies are shown considering synthetic and real data in different experiments. Specifically, we consider leaf area index retrieval from Landsat data combined with simulated data generated by the PROSAIL model.

TI  - Vichada asteroid impact effects from simulation of regional environmental consequences of a meteoroid impact on Earth
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the regional environmental consequences of the impactor extraterrestrial body that could produce the probable Vichada impact crater structure on the Vichada Plain, in Colombia, South America. This paper details the parameter assumptions upon which the estimation is made. It describes an approach to quantifying the principal impact processes that could have affected the landscape in the vicinity of the probable Vichada impact event in the past. The key parameters are impactor diameter, impactor density, impact velocity before atmospheric entry, impact angle, and the distance from the impact at which the environmental effects are to be calculated, and the target type of sedimentary rock or crystalline rock. These parameters were chosen with support from The Vichada Structure dimensions obtained from remote sensing data interpretation, regional geologic mapping and interpreted satellite data and ground-based gravity and magnetic anomalies. The calculations are based on compiled novel algorithms for estimating the thermal radiation emitted by the impact-generated vapor plume or fireball, and the intensity of seismic shaking. Model validation is performed by obtaining the approximates various dimensions of the Vichada impact crater and ejecta deposit, as well as estimating the severity of the air blastin both crater-forming and air burst impacts. We illustrate the utility of the calculations by examining the predicted environmental consequences in seven localities of the Colombian territory, through hypothetical impact scenarios occurring in Cumaribo and Puerto Carreno (Vichada), Puerto Inirida (Guainia), Puerto Gaitan and Villavicencio (Meta), Mitu (Vaupes) and Bogota, D.C. It is concluded that the most wide-reaching environmental consequence is seismic shaking. Both ejecta deposit thickness and air-blast pressure decay much more rapidly with distance than with seismic ground motion. Close to the impact site the most devastating effect is from thermal radiation; however, the curvature of the Earth implies that distant localities are shielded from direct thermal radiation because the fireball is below the horizon. These results would guide further detailed fieldwork hunting for direct impact crater evidences and/or interpreting high resolution geophysical studies and borehole that could be carried out in the probable Vichada impact crater area in the near future.

TI  - Are root cause analyses recommendations effective and sustainable? An observational study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the strength of root cause analysis (RCA) recommendations and their perceived levels of effectiveness and sustainability.All RCAs related to sentinel events (SEs) undertaken between the years 2010 and 2015 in the public health system in Victoria, Australia were analysed. The type and strength of each recommendation in the RCA reports were coded by an expert patient safety classifier using the US Department of Veteran Affairs type and strength criteria.Thirty-six public health services.The proportion of RCA recommendations which were classified as 'strong' (more likely to be effective and sustainable), 'medium' (possibly effective and sustainable) or 'weak' (less likely to be effective and sustainable).There were 227 RCAs in the period of study. In these RCAs, 1137 recommendations were made. Of these 8% were 'strong', 44% 'medium' and 48% were 'weak'. In 31 RCAs, or nearly 15%, only weak recommendations were made. In 24 (11%) RCAs five or more weak recommendations were made. In 165 (72%) RCAs no strong recommendations were made. The most frequent recommendation types were reviewing or enhancing a policy/guideline/documentation, and training and education.Only a small proportion of recommendations arising from RCAs in Victoria are 'strong'. This suggests that insights from the majority of RCAs are not likely to inform practice or process improvements. Suggested improvements include more human factors expertise and independence in investigations, more extensive application of existing tools that assist teams to prioritize recommendations that are likely to be effective, and greater use of observational and simulation techniques to understand the underlying systems factors. Time spent in repeatedly investigating similar incidents may be better spent aggregating and thematically analysing existing sources of information about patient safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was done to evaluate the utilization of clinical pathway (CP) on open appendectomy as a quality improvement (QI) initiative.METHODS: The CP document was developed from the clinical practice guideline created by the Philippine College of Surgeons using an event-timeline tabular checklist format. After a hospital-wide education, the CP was implemented on January 1, 2010, as the QI intervention. Appendectomies done 4 years before the intervention were assigned to the pre-pathway group while those done 5 years after were assigned to the post-pathway group. Demographic data were collected including the different clinical outcomes such as the average length of stay (ALOS), comorbidity, diagnostic modality used, hospital cost, and variance rate. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation and percentage which ever were applicable. Statistical analysis was done using Student t-test for numerical data and Chi-square for dichotomous data. Significance was set at P < 0.05.RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-five patients were included in the study. Separate analysis was done for uncomplicated (Pre-pathway Group, n = 49 and Post-pathway group, n = 139) and complicated (pre-pathway Group, n = 38 and Post-pathway Group, n = 69) open appendectomies. Results showed that diagnosis was achieved through history and physical examination. Ultrasound use did not significantly differ between groups and types of open appendectomy. Major findings showed a significant decrease in ALOS, hospitalization cost, and variance in the post-pathway group compared with the pre-pathway group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: These findings supported the use of CP in QI of health care in commonly done surgeries like appendectomy.

TI  - An Educational Intervention Decreases Opioid Prescribing After General Surgical Operations
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether an educational intervention was sufficient to decrease opioid prescribing after general surgical operations.Summary of Background Data: We recently analyzed opioid prescription and use for 5 common outpatient operations at our institution: partial mastectomy (PM), PM with sentinel lymph node biopsy (PM SLNB), laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIH), and open inguinal hernia repair (IH). We found that opioids were over-prescribed. We formulated guidelines for opioid prescribing that would halve the number of pills prescribed and also satisfy 80% of patients' opioid requirements.Methods: We discussed our findings and opioid-prescribing guidelines with surgeons at our institution. We recommended that surgeons encourage patients to use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and acetaminophen before using opioids. We then evaluated opioid prescriptions and use in 246 subsequent patients undergoing these same operations.Results: The mean number of opioid pills prescribed for each operation markedly decreased: PM 19.8 versus 5.1; PM SLNB 23.7 versus 9.6; LC 35.2 versus 19.4; LIH 33.8 versus 19.3, and IH 33.2 versus 18.3; all P < 0.0003. The total number of pills prescribed decreased by 53% when compared with the number that would have been prescribed before the educational intervention. Only 1 patient (0.4%) required a refill opioid prescription. Eighty-five percent of patients used either a NSAID or acetaminophen.Conclusions: By defining postoperative opioid requirements through patient surveys and disseminating operation-specific guidelines for opioid prescribing to surgeons, we were able to decrease the number of opioids initially prescribed by more than half. Decreased initial opioid prescriptions did not result in increased opioid refill prescriptions.

TI  - Object-Based Mapping of Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using LiDAR and Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing countries that intend to implement the United Nations REDD-plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, and the role of forest conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) framework and obtain economic incentives are required to estimate changes in forest carbon stocks based on the IPCC guidelines. In this study, we developed a method to support REDD-plus implementation by estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by combining airborne LiDAR with very-high-spatial-resolution satellite data. We acquired QuickBird satellite images of Kampong Thom, Cambodia in 2011 and airborne LiDAR measurements in some parts of the same area. After haze reduction and atmospheric correction of the satellite data, we calibrated reflectance values from the mean reflectance of the objects (obtained by segmentation from areas of overlap between dates) to reduce the effects of the observation angle and solar elevation. Then, we performed object-based classification using the satellite data (overall accuracy = 77.0%, versus 92.9% for distinguishing forest from non-forest land). We used a two-step method to estimate AGB and map it in a tropical environment in Cambodia. First, we created a multiple-regression model to estimate AGB from the LiDAR data and plotted field-surveyed AGB values against AGB values predicted by the LiDAR-based model (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 38.7 Mg/ha), and calculated reflectance values in each band of the satellite data for the analyzed objects. Then, we created a multiple-regression model using AGB predicted by the LiDAR-based model as the dependent variable and the mean and standard deviation of the reflectance values in each band of the satellite data as the explanatory variables (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). We calculated AGB of all objects, divided the results into density classes, and mapped the resulting AGB distribution. Our results suggest that this approach can provide the forest carbon stock per unit area values required to support REDD-plus.

TI  - Using Landsat Spectral Indices in Time-Series to Assess Wildfire Disturbance and Recovery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite earth observation is being increasingly used to monitor forests across the world. Freely available Landsat data stretching back four decades, coupled with advances in computer processing capabilities, has enabled new time-series techniques for analyzing forest change. Typically, these methods track individual pixel values over time, through the use of various spectral indices. This study examines the utility of eight spectral indices for characterizing fire disturbance and recovery in sclerophyll forests, in order to determine their relative merits in the context of Landsat time-series. Although existing research into Landsat indices is comprehensive, this study presents a new approach, by comparing the distributions of pre and post-fire pixels using Glass's delta, for evaluating indices without the need of detailed field information. Our results show that in the sclerophyll forests of southeast Australia, common indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), both accurately capture wildfire disturbance in a pixel-based time-series approach, especially if images from soon after the disturbance are available. However, for tracking forest regrowth and recovery, indices, such as NDVI, which typically capture chlorophyll concentration or canopy 'greenness', are not as reliable, with values returning to pre-fire levels in 3-5 years. In comparison, indices that are more sensitive to forest moisture and structure, such as NBR, indicate much longer (8-10 years) recovery timeframes. This finding is consistent with studies that were conducted in other forest types. We also demonstrate that additional information regarding forest condition, particularly in relation to recovery, can be extracted from less well known indices, such as NBR2, as well as textural indices incorporating spatial variance. With Landsat time-series gaining in popularity in recent years, it is critical to understand the advantages and limitations of the various indices that these methods rely on.

TI  - Phases or regimes? Revisiting NDVI trends as proxies for land degradation
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main challenges in land degradation assessment is that a rigorous and systematic approach to addressing its complex dynamics is still missing. The development and application of operative tools at regional and global scales remain a challenge. Land degradation is usually defined as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity. Due to its temporal and spatial resolution as well as data availability, the use of time series of spectral vegetation indexes obtained from satellite sensors has become frequent in recent studies in this field. Slope of linear trends of the normalized difference vegetation index is usually considered an accurate indicator and is widely used as a proxy for land degradation. Yet this method is built on a number of simplifying conceptual and methodological assumptions that prevent capturing more complex dynamics, such as cyclic or periodic behaviors. Our aim was to examine the limitations associated with using linear normalized difference vegetation index trends as proxies for land degradation by comparing outcomes with an alternative methodological procedure based on wavelet autoregressive methods. We explored these issues in 5 case studies from Africa and South America. We observed that trend explained a marginal portion of total temporal variability, whereas monotonic functions, such as linear trends, were unable to capture dynamics that were non-unidirectional, resulting in misinterpretation of actual trends. Wavelet autoregressive method results were encouraging as a step towards the application of more accurate methods to provide sound scientific information of land degradation and restoration.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of China's economy and high rate of industrialization, environmental pollution has become a major challenge for the country. The present study is aimed at analyzing spatiotemporal heterogeneities and changes in trends of different aerosol optical properties observed over China. To achieve this, Collection 6 Level 3 data retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 2002-2016) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI; 2005-2016) sensors were used to investigate aerosol optical depth (AOD(550)), Angstrom exponent (AE(470-660)), and Absorption Aerosol Index (AAI). The spatial distribution of annual mean AOD(550) was noticed to be high over economically and industrialized regions of the east, south, and northeast of China, while low aerosol loadings were located over rural and less-developed areas of the west and northeast of China. High AE(470-660) (> 1.0) values were characterized by the abundance of fine-mode particles and vice versa, likely attributed to large anthropogenic activities. Similarly, high AOD with corresponding high AE and low AAI was characterized over the urban-industrialized regions of the central, east, and south of China during most of the months, being more pronounced in June and July. On seasonal scale, AOD values were found to be high during spring, followed by the summer and autumn, and low during the winter season. It is also evident that all aerosol parameters showed a single-peak frequency distribution in all seasons over entire China. Further, the annual, monthly, and seasonal spatial trends revealed a decreasing trend in AOD over most regions of China, except in the southwest of China, which showed a positive increasing trend. Significant increasing trends were noted in AAI for all the seasons, particularly during autumn and winter, resulting in a large amount of the absorbing type of aerosols produced from biomass burning and desert dust.

TI  - Policing the Intestinal Epithelial Barrier: Innate Immune Functions of Intraepithelial Lymphocytes
T2  - CURRENT PATHOBIOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review This review will explore the contribution of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) to mucosal innate immunity and highlight the similarities in IEL functional responses to bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasite invasion.Recent Findings IELs rapidly respond to microbial invasion by activating host defense responses, including the production of mucus and antimicrobial peptides to prevent microbes from reaching the epithelial surface. During active infection, IELs promote epithelial cytolysis, cytokine and chemokine production to limit pathogen invasion, replication, and dissemination. Commensal-induced priming of IEL effector function or continuous surveillance of the epithelium may be important contributing factors to the rapidity of response.Summary Impaired microbial recognition, dysregulated innate immune signaling, or microbial dysbiosis may limit the protective function of IELs and increase susceptibility to disease. Further understanding of the mechanisms regulating IEL surveillance and sentinel function may provide insight into the development of more effective targeted therapies designed to reinforce the mucosal barrier.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques in Inferring Phytoplankton Size Classes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The size of phytoplankton not only influences its physiology, metabolic rates and marine food web, but also serves as an indicator of phytoplankton functional roles in ecological and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, some algorithms have been developed to infer the synoptic distribution of phytoplankton cell size, denoted as phytoplankton size classes (PSCs), in surface ocean waters, by the means of remotely sensed variables. This study, using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) database, and satellite match-ups, aimed to compare the effectiveness of modeling techniques, including partial least square (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), and feature selection techniques, including genetic algorithm (GA), successive projection algorithm (SPA) and recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine (SVM-RFE), for inferring PSCs from remote sensing data. Results showed that: (1) SVM-RFE worked better in selecting sensitive features; (2) RF performed better than PLS, ANN and SVM in calibrating PSCs retrieval models; (3) machine learning techniques produced better performance than the chlorophyll-a based three-component method; (4) sea surface temperature, wind stress, and spectral curvature derived from the remote sensing reflectance at 490, 510, and 555 nm were among the most sensitive features to PSCs; and (5) the combination of SVM-RFE feature selection techniques and random forests regression was recommended for inferring PSCs. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in selecting sensitive features and calibrating models for PSCs estimations with remote sensing.

TI  - ARE PRE-OPERATIVE LYMPHOSCINTIGRAMS NEEDED FOR LOCALIZATION PRIOR TO SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY?: AN AUDIT TO ENSURE SAFE PRACTICE AND TO PROVIDE ANOTHER VIEW
T2  - LYMPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally lymphoscintigrams are taken after injection of peri-areolar Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) to quantify sentinel nodes before biopsy (SNB). However, recent research suggests that scintigraphy is not an essential adjunct. For service improvement, we stopped using lymphoscintigraphy so as to minimize delay to operating theater and reduce demand on the Nuclear Medicine Department. We audited early outcomes to ensure quality was maintained. 100 consecutive patients undergoing SNB with lymphoscintigrams were investigated. Lymphoscintigrams were reported by Consultant Radiologists. Reported node count (RNC) was compared to biopsied node count (BNC) using Cohen's kappa statistic. Lymphoscintigrams were then discontinued, and the results on the next 69 consecutive patients undergoing SNB were analyzed. The BNC was then compared to BNC in patients having lymphoscintigrams. Of the first 100 patients, RNC ranged from 05 (mean=1.84, mode=1) and BNC from 1-4 (mean=1.89, mode=1). 90% of lymphoscintigrams were performed on the day of surgery. Cohen's Kappa statistic was 0.34 (95%CI = 0.195 to 0.482, i.e., Fair agreement). RNC was zero in two cases, but SNB was successful. Of 69 patients in the second group with no scan, BNC ranged from 0-4 (mean=1.80, mode=2). There were two cases of failed localization and no significant difference between BNC with or without scans (p=0.16). Sentinel node positivity rate was 36% for those with scans and 25.3% for those without scans, which was not significant (chi-squared, p=0.11). These results correlate to previously published studies. Correlation between RNC and BNC was only in fair agreement, and negative lymphoscintigrams did not result in failed SNB localization. Our study suggests that BNC without scans is safe and effective. Removing the lymphoscintigram will result in measurable cost savings, saving of clinical time (no delay to operating room while waiting for scan or multiple journeys to hospital), freeing the scanner for other scans, and allowing additional time for radiology physicians and staff.

TI  - Can flow cytometry reinvent the sentinel lymph node concept in gastric cancer patients?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The focused sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept we proposed previously relied on real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect tumor cells, which is too elaborate for intraoperative use. Therefore, we evaluated flow cytometry for intraoperative detection of tumor cells in SLNs.Methods: Sixty-five consecutive gastric cancer patients were included. SLN analysis was carried out for a single SLN from each patient, using the molecular methods of RT-qPCR (first 30 patients) and flow cytometry (final 35 patients). All LNs underwent hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical examination.Results: Extraction of the SLN from a high-risk station was an important determinant for accurate prediction of LN metastases. For RT-qPCR, the sensitivity and specificity of detection were 72.7% and 81.8%, respectively, and for flow cytometry, 36.8% and 100%, respectively. When only high-risk SLNs were analyzed and specimens with <10% viability of leukocytes were excluded, the sensitivity and specificity of flow cytometry were 60% and 100%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified significant predictors for LN metastases as the molecular method of SLN analysis (P = 0.021; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.304-24.284) and lympho-vascular invasion (P = 0.002; 95% CI: 2.142-28.555). In subgroup analysis of high-risk SLNs, only RT-qPCR was a significant predictor for LN metastases (P = 0.016; 95% CI: 1.581-91.084).Conclusions: Flow cytometry of high-risk SLNs, excluding specimens with low cell viability is a rapid, cost-effective, widely obtainable, and highly specific method for SLN metastases detection although it lacks the necessary sensitivity. Therefore, it cannot be recommended as a stand-alone method for the detection of LN metastases during operations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A novel approach for epipolar resampling of cross-track linear pushbroom imagery using orbital parameters model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to epipolar resampling of cross-track linear pushbroom imagery using orbital parameters model (OPM). The backbone of the proposed method relies on modification of attitude parameters of linear array stereo imagery in such a way to parallelize the approximate conjugate epipolar lines (ACELs) with the instantaneous base line (IBL) of the conjugate image points (CIPs). Afterward, a complementary rotation is applied in order to parallelize all the ACELs throughout the stereo imagery. The new estimated attitude parameters are evaluated based on the direction of the IBL and the ACELs. Due to the spatial and temporal variability of the IBL (respectively changes in column and row numbers of the CIPs) and nonparallel nature of the epipolar lines in the stereo linear images, some polynomials in the both column and row numbers of the CIPs are used to model new attitude parameters. As the instantaneous position of sensors remains fix, the digital elevation model (DEM) of the area of interest is not required in the resampling process. According to the experimental results obtained from two pairs of SPOT and RapidEye stereo imagery with a high elevation relief, the average absolute values of remained vertical parallaxes of CIPs in the normalized images were obtained 0.19 and 0.28 pixels respectively, which confirm the high accuracy and applicability of the proposed method.

TI  - Application of aerial hyperspectrai images in monitoring tree biophysical parameters in urban areas
T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of trees in urban areas can be conducted using remote sensing, but should be supported by field measurements. The article aims to present the research method used to evaluate discolouration and defoliation of trees and tree damage in the city of Bialystok in Poland. The analyses were done using AISA hyperspectral images. Field measurements encompassed determining the locations, species and levels of discolouration and defoliation of trees. Remote sensing indices of vegetation were calculated and correlated with the field-measured values of discolouration and defoliation. Based on that, values of discolouration and defoliation were calculated and evaluated against the field studies. The RMSE of the acquired data was around 16%. Using parameter values, a map of tree damage was drawn up. Based on the analysis, it can be stated that a significant number of trees is undamaged, although a large portion of the trees falls into the warning class.

TI  - Analysis of forest structural complexity using airborne LiDAR data and aerial photography in a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest in northern Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining forest structural complexity, i.e., a measure of the number of different attributes of a forest and the relative abundance of each attribute, is important for forest management and conservation. In this study, we examined the structural complexity of mixed conifer-broadleaf forests by integrating multiple forest structural attributes derived from airborne LiDAR data and aerial photography. We sampled 76 plots from an unmanaged mixed conifer-broadleaf forest reserve in northern Japan. Plot-level metrics were computed for all plots using both field and remote sensing data to assess their ability to capture the vertical and horizontal variations of forest structure. A multivariate set of forest structural attributes that included three LiDAR metrics (95th percentile canopy height, canopy density and surface area ratio) and one image metric (proportion of broadleaf cover), was used to classify forest structure into structural complexity classes. Our results revealed significant correlation between field and remote sensing metrics, indicating that these two sets of measurements captured similar patterns of structure in mixed conifer-broadleaf forests. Further, cluster analysis identified six forest structural complexity classes including two low-complexity classes and four high-complexity classes that were distributed in different elevation ranges. In this study, we could reliably analyze the structural complexity of mixed conifer-broadleaf forests using a simple and easy to calculate set of forest structural attributes derived from airborne LiDAR data and high-resolution aerial photography. This study provides a good example of the use of airborne LiDAR data sets for wider purposes in forest ecology as well as in forest management.

TI  - A Quality Assessment Method Based on Common Distributed Targets for GF-3 Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite, launched on 10 August 2016, is the first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) satellite in China. The PolSAR system of GF-3 can collect a significant wealth of information for geophysical research and applications. Being used for related applications, GF-3 PolSAR images must be of good quality. It is necessary to evaluate the quality of polarimetric data and achieve the normalized quality monitoring during 8-year designed life of GF-3. In this study, a new quality assessment method of PolSAR data based on common distributed targets is proposed, and the performance of the method is analyzed by simulations and GF-3 experiments. We evaluate the quality of GF-3 PolSAR data by this method. Results suggest that GF-3 antenna is highly isolated, and the quality of calibrated data satisfies the requests of quantitative applications.

TI  - Predictors of sentinel lymph node status of cutaneous melanoma in Serbian patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Presence of metastasis in sentinel lymph node (SLN) is considered to be the most important factor in terms of patient survival. The main aim of this study was to identify predictors of positive SLN in Serbian patients with melanoma.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on 147 patients. Univariate chi-square and univariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the association between prognostic factors and positive SLN. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was conducted to find the Breslow thickness cutoff point at which to perform SLN biopsy (SLNB). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS), and log rank test was applied to compare differences between groups.Results: Breslow thickness and Clark level (p=0.05), presence of ulceration and a high mitotic rate (> 6 mitoses/mm(2)) p<0.001) were significant independent predictors of SLN metastasis. ROC curve showed that Breslow thickness of 2.8 mm was the most suitable cutoff point for SLN positivity (sensitivity 86%, specificity 67%). Furthermore, Breslow thickness and presence of ulceration were found to be associated with DFS (p<0.05).Conclusions: Patients with Breslow thickness >= 2.8 mm, ulceration, and high mitotic rate are at higher risk for SLN metastasis. In addition, high Breslow thickness and presence of ulceration are associated with decreased DFS. These results indicate that multiple selection criteria should be used when performing and predicting SLN metastasis and disease recurrence.

T2  - FARMACIA HOSPITALARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the results of sentinel patient program to monitoring the quality pharmacoterapeutic process in the hospitalized patient through medication errors.Method: Design: Observational, prospective and transversal study. Ambit: General hospital of 1,000 beds. Period: From May 2011 to June 2016. Sample: Patients with treatment prescribe within 24 hours of being admitted with 4 or more medications. Variables: Medication error, drugs prescribed, medications and doses dispensing, drugs administered. Safety indicators were defined based on medication errors at each stage of the pharmacotherapeutic process.Results: Of the 746 patients studied, 334 had at least 1 medication error (44.8%; IC95%: 41.7-478). In the 746 treatments, 564 medication errors were detected (0.75 errors by patient; IC95%: 0.7-0.8). The safety indicators (medication error by stage) were: 5.1% (38/746 patients) for omission of allergy record; 2.3% (156/6724 drugs) for prescription; 0.6% (38/6724 drugs) for validation, 2.6% for dispensing (142/5465 drugs) y 3.7% (190/5 111 administered drugs observed) for administration. The temporal evolution of the indicators, with graphs of statistical control showed stable processes, except for the administration. The proposed improvement actions were of a training, standardization and organizational type.Conclusions: The sentinel patient program provides an overview of the quality of the pharmacotherapeutic process and promotes the safety culture at the center. Statistical control charts have been a useful tool for monitoring medication errors. The analysis of medication errors has served to propose improvement actions in each stage of the pharmacotherapeutic process.

TI  - Forest cover change in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve and its future: The contribution of the 1998 protected natural area decree
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Los Tuxtlas mountain range harbors one of the last remnants of tropical rain forest on the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico. This volcanic range has a high degree of heterogeneity in its geology, climate and ecology, in addition to a very long history of human occupation. The original area covered by tropical forest has been drastically reduced by agricultural activities, and during the last four decades in particular, deforestation has been very intense. In order to protect the remaining forest, in 1998 the Mexican government created the Los Twain Biosphere Reserve (LTBR). While previous studies estimated deforestation rates and the amount of forest cover remaining in some areas of the LTBR, this is the first study to do so for the entire protected area. A retrospective analysis from 1986 to 2011 was conducted to assess the effect of the 1998 decree of the LTBR on deforestation rates, and to predict future changes in forest cover up to the year 2025 using Markov chains and cellular automata based on current deforestation patterns. The results show that shortly after the 1998 decree, deforestation rates in the LTBR not only decreased but reversed, however this trend did not continue. In recent years deforestation has again increased. Our projection shows that if current trends continue unchanged then by the year 2025 we might have lost close to 14% (ca. 9000 ha) of the forest cover that was present in 2011. The decree of the LTBR was part of the federal policy to protect biodiversity in Mexico and our results show that the strategy of establishing this protected area did work to protect tropical forest, at least temporarily in Los Tuxtlas. Also, our results show that it is not only possible to reverse forest loss within the ample buffer zone of the LTBR, it is also still relatively easy to achieve by promoting passive restoration.

TI  - Operational Meteo Fire Danger System Based On Space Information For Chaco Serrano
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present the operational implementation of a fire danger mapping system based on Numerical Weather Prediction and space derived Moisture Content of Live Fuels (LFMC) for the Chaco Serrano sub-region. The system is operative since the end of 2016 and estimates the fire danger index automatically (without any man operator), based on the 72 hours forecast of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model for the meteorological component. In addition, the model implemented here incorporates, in its last version, an automatic estimation of LFMC based on MODIS spectral indexes and a land cover classification. Thus, this operational outcome is part of the suite of products that the Argentinean Space Agency CONAE, in Cooperation with academic institutions, develops in the way to apply geospatial information and satellite based products to help on environmental emergencies/disasters, during pre-disaster planning, response and assistance and reconstruction phases.

TI  - Thinking Sociologically about Religion and Violence: The Case of ISIS
T2  - SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - How do we make sense of a movement like the Islamic State, where violence and religion seem to be inextricably intertwined? Though observers sometimes accuse religion as causing the problem, and other observers think that such movements have nothing to do with it, my approach is to focus on what some scholars have called the culture of violence: the analysis of worldviews. The sociological task is to understand these worldviews in social context, to determine the social and political factors that have shaped communities that embrace distinctive worldviews. This essay focuses on the social and political development of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, explores the notion of worldview analysis in general and as applied to this movement, and determines that there are at least three different kinds of worldviews related to groups of followers who may survive, in different ways, the eventual collapse of the territorial control of the movement.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil mapping relies on field observations, laboratory measurements and remote sensing data, integrated with quantitative methods to map spatial patterns of soil properties. The study was undertaken in a hilly watershed in the Indian Himalayan region of Mandi district, Himachal Pradesh for mapping soil nutrients by employing artificial neural network (ANN), a potent data mining technique. Soil samples collected from the surface layer (0-15 cm) of 75 locations in the watershed, through grid sampling approach during the fallow period of November 2015, were preprocessed and analysed for various soil nutrients like soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Spectral indices like Colouration Index, Brightness Index, Hue Index and Redness Index derived from Landsat 8 satellite data and terrain parameters such as Terrain Wetness Index, Stream Power Index and slope using CartoDEM (30 m) were used. Spectral and terrain indices sensitive to different nutrients were identified using correlation analysis and thereafter used for predictive modelling of nutrients using ANN technique by employing feed-forward neural network with backpropagation network architecture and Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. The prediction of SOC was obtained with an R-2 of 0.83 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.05, whereas for available nitrogen, it was achieved with an R-2 value of 0.62 and MSE of 0.0006. The prediction accuracy for phosphorus was low, since the phosphorus content in the area was far below the normal P values of typical Indian soils and thus the R-2 value observed was only 0.511. The attempts to develop prediction models for available potassium (K) and clay (%) failed to give satisfactory results. The developed models were validated using independent data sets and used for mapping the spatial distribution of SOC and N in the watershed.

TI  - Legendary and Traditional Vehicles of Kazakhs According to Folklore Sources
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional transport system is one of the interesting interdisciplinary, as well as problematic themes. Concerning the transport, there are proofs of many legends, images and tools, which in a moment can bring with person. The concepts are formed in the ancient times. If such mythical images as flying carpets, brooms of witches, a winged dragon are the property of the peoples of the world, then the flying Pyrak (horse), the winged leopard and the Zhelmaya are the mythological images and peculiar transport forms taking place in the traditional outlook of the Kazakh people. A winged Tulpar or Pyrak (horse) is a widespread image in the worldview of Kazakhs. That is an unshakable dream, striving for amazing fictional places, unbridled aspiration, and a philanthropic idea, leading to good and immortal life. The winged leopard, which is the symbol of glamour, courage, speed, flexibility and arrogance, is found in archaeological excavations in East Kazakhstan and Zhetysu. The winged leopard is a fictional image of a mountain leopard that lived in this region. The Zhelmaya is a mythical image of a camel faster than the wind. According to Kazakh legends, Korkut Ata and Asan Kaygy got on the Zhelmaya. Carts and phaetons are among the main characters of the life of the Kazakhs, which are familiar to Kazakhs as ancient transport communications. Images of carts or phaetons have been reflected in ancient petroglyphs, on parts of bogies in barrows of the Bronze and Iron Age. Also, found a whole cart in the Pazyryk Saka mound. If the carts were used as means of transportation of people and cargo, then the phaeton was used only to transport the person. Luxury phaeton paid much attention. This is evidenced by the sources of folklore. Even today, it is important to use carts in the economic life of the villages. It is important to study the national heritage of the transport system, which is reflected in folklore sources.

TI  - Topographical influence on recent deforestation and degradation in the Sikkim Himalaya in India; Implications for conservation of East Himalayan broadleaf forest
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Land-cover change in tropical mountains is a significant concern for the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem function. In the eastern Himalaya, knowledge on the factors driving these changes is currently inadequate to development conservation and management plans.Objectives: We computed land-cover change over a 23-year period for the Sikkim Himalaya in India for the elevation range 800-2800 m using Landsat satellite data and an extensive set of ground measurements of vegetation types and other landuse. We then tested how these land-cover changes may be influenced by topography, mediated through decisions on landuse.Methods: We carried out supervised classification using 'Random Forests', and ensemble-based classification algorithm that is robust and accurate. We then used linear discriminant analyses to test which of seven common topographical variables can be used to discriminate the different land-cover types.Results: The primary forest in the 800-2200 m elevation range was warm broadleaf forest, whereas the primary forest in the elevation 2200 m-2800 m was Fagaceae dominated forest. Forest cover declined by over 30% in warm broadleaf forest, and primary forest declined by 16% overall, with concomitant increases in secondary forest and agriculture. Elevation was the strongest discriminant of landuse, followed by slope and aspect, presumably reflecting peoples' choice on landuse based on topography.Conclusions: Tropical montane forests continue to decline in the Sikkim Himalaya, particularly at lower elevations. Topographical factors determine landuse decisions by local communities.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric circulation types on southwest Asian dust and Indian summer monsoon rainfall
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the meteorological feedback on dust aerosols and rainfall over the Arabian Sea and India during the summer monsoon using satellite data, re-analysis and a regional climate model. Based on days with excess aerosol loading over the central Ganges basin during May September, two distinct atmospheric circulation types (weather clusters) are identified, which are associated with different dust-aerosol and rainfall distributions over south Asia, highlighting the role of meteorology on dust emissions and monsoon rainfall. Each cluster is characterized by different patterns of mean sea level pressure (MSLP), geopotential height at 700 hPa (Z700) and wind fields at 1000 hPa and at 700 hPa, thus modulating changes in dust-aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea. One cluster is associated with deepening of the Indian/Pakistan thermal low leading to (i) increased cyclonicity and thermal convection over northwestern India and Arabian Peninsula, (ii) intensification of the southwest monsoon off the Horn of Africa, iii) increase in dust emissions from Rub-Al-Khali and Somalian deserts, (iv) excess dust accumulation over the Arabian Sea and, (v) strengthening of the convergence of humid air masses and larger precipitation over Indian landmass compared to the other cluster. The RegCM4.4 model simulations for dust-aerosol and precipitation distributions support the meteorological fields and satellite observations, while the precipitation over India is positively correlated with the aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea on daily basis for both weather clusters. This study highlights the key role of meteorology and atmospheric dynamics on dust life cycle and rainfall over the monsoon-influenced south Asia.

TI  - Disease understanding in patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation
T2  - HEART
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To describe self-reported disease understanding for newly diagnosed patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and assess (1) how disease understanding changes over the first 6 months after diagnosis and (2) the relationship between patient understanding of therapies at baseline and treatment receipt at 6 months among treatment-naive patients.Methods We analysed survey data from SATELLITE (Survey of Patient Knowledge and Personal Priorities for Treatment), a substudy of patients with new-onset AF enrolled in the national Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT) II registry across 56 US sites. Patients were surveyed at the baseline and 6-month follow-up clinic visits using Likert scales.Results Among 1004 baseline survey responses, patients' confidence in their understanding of rhythm control, ablation, anticoagulation and cardioversion was suboptimal, with 'high' understanding ranging from 8.5% for left atrial appendage closure to 71.3% for rhythm therapy. Of medical history and demographic factors, education level was the strongest predictor of reporting 'high' disease understanding. Among the 786 patients with 6-month survey data, significant increases in the proportion reporting high understanding were observed (p<0.05) only for warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). With the exception of ablation, high understanding for a given therapeutic option was not associated with increased use of that therapy at 6 months.Conclusions A bout half of patients with new-onset AF understood the benefits of oral anticoagulant at the time of diagnosis and understanding improved over the first 6 months. However, understanding of AF treatment remains suboptimal at 6 months. Our results suggest a need for ongoing patient education.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 76-year-old female underwent breast-conserving surgery of the right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy for primary breast cancer. Three years later, mammography and ultrasonography showed a small nodule in the right breast. There was nothing abnormal in the left breast. Three months later, she complained of a huge and rapid growing mass in the left breast. Malignant cells were obtained on fine needle aspiration biopsy in the right breast tumor. But it was not possible to diagnose whether the left breast tumor was benign or malignant on fine needle aspiration biopsy and needle biopsy. Bilateral mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy of the right side were performed. Pathological diagnosis were squamous cell carcinoma of the right breast and spindle cell carcinoma of the left breast. Although the patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, she had an early relapse with pleural, lung and bone metastases. The patient died approximately 8 months after operation. Spindle cell carcinoma presents many problems about therapy and prognosis. Further accumulation analysis is necessary.

TI  - Evaluation of soil loss estimation using the RUSLE model and SCS-CN method in hillslope mining areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining operations result in the generation of barren land and spoil heaps which are subject to high erosion rate during the rainy season. The present study uses the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number) process to estimate in Kiruburu and Meghahatuburu mining sites areas. The geospatial model of annual average soil loss rate was determined by integrating environmental variables parameters in a raster pixels-based GIS framework. GIS layers with, rainfall passivity and runoff erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management(C) and conservation practice (P) factors were calculated to determine their effects on annual soil erosion in the study area. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) was 0.834, which indicates a strong correlation of soil loss with runoff and rainfall. Sub-watersheds 5,9,10 and 2 experienced high level of highly runoff. Average annual soil loss was calculated (30*30 m raster grid cell) to determine the critical soil loss areas (Sub-watershed 9 and 5). Total soil erosion area was classified into five class, slight (10,025 ha), moderate (3125 ha), high (973 ha), very high (260 ha) and severe (53 ha). The resulting map shows greatest soil erosion of > 40 t h-1 y-1 (severe) through connection to grassland, degraded and open forestry on the erect mining side-escutcheon. The Landsat pan sharpening image and DGPS survey field data were used in the verification of soil erosion results.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Analysis over the Land Use Zoning Plan of Bangkok by Means of Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat island (SUHI) maps retrieved from spaceborne sensor data are increasingly recognized as an efficient scientific support to be considered in sustainable urban planning. By means of reflective and thermal data from Landsat 8 imagery in the time interval 2014-2016, this work deals with the SUHI pattern identification within the different land use categories of Bangkok city plan. This study first provides an overview of the SUHI phenomenon in Bangkok, then singles out the surface heating behavior in each land use category. To describe the SUHI dynamics within the different classes, the main statistics of the SUHI intensity (mean, standard deviation, maximum and minimum) are computed. Overall, the analysis points out that the categories placed in the city core (high-density residential; commercial; historical and military classes) exhibit the highest mean SUHI intensities (around 4 degrees C); whilst the vegetated pixels exert a less cool effect with respect to the greenery of categories mainly placed farther from the city center. The proposed analysis can help to identify if the land use plan requires targeted future actions for the SUHI mitigation; or if the maintenance of the current urban development model is in line with the environmental sustainability.

TI  - Using GPS-surveyed intertidal zones to determine the validity of shorelines automatically mapped by Landsat water indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been used extensively in a variety of shoreline studies and validated using aerial photography. This ground truth method only represents an instantaneous depiction of the shoreline at the time of acquisition and does not take into account the spatial and temporal variability of the dynamic shoreline boundary. Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager sensor's capability to accurately delineate a shoreline is assessed by comparing all known Landsat water index-derived shorelines with two GPS-surveyed intertidal zones that coincide with the satellite flyover date, one of which had near-neap tide conditions.Seven indices developed for automatically classifying water pixels were evaluated for their ability to delineate shorelines. The shoreline is described here as the area above and below maximum low and high tide, otherwise known as the intertidal zone. The high-water line, or wet/dry sediment line, was chosen as the shoreline indicator to be mapped using a handheld GPS. The proportion of the Landsat-derived shorelines that fell within this zone and their alongshore profile lengths were calculated. The most frequently used water index and the predecessor to Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was found to be the least accurate by a significant margin. Other indices required calibration of their threshold value to achieve accurate results, thus diminishing their replicability success for other regions. MNDWI was determined to be the best index for automated shoreline mapping, based on its superior accuracy and repeatable, stable threshold value.

TI  - Quaternion-Based Texture Analysis of Multiband Satellite Images: Application to the Estimation of Aboveground Biomass in the East Region of Cameroon
T2  - ACTA BIOTHEORETICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the last decade, several approaches using quaternion numbers to handle and model multiband images in a holistic manner were introduced. The quaternion Fourier transform can be efficiently used to model texture in multidimensional data such as color images. For practical application, multispectral satellite data appear as a primary source for measuring past trends and monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks. In this work, we propose a texture-color descriptor based on the quaternion Fourier transform to extract relevant information from multiband satellite images. We propose a new multiband image texture model extraction, called FOTO++, in order to address biomass estimation issues. The first stage consists in removing noise from the multispectral data while preserving the edges of canopies. Afterward, color texture descriptors are extracted thanks to a discrete form of the quaternion Fourier transform, and finally the support vector regression method is used to deduce biomass estimation from texture indices. Our texture features are modeled using a vector composed with the radial spectrum coming from the amplitude of the quaternion Fourier transform. We conduct several experiments in order to study the sensitivity of our model to acquisition parameters. We also assess its performance both on synthetic images and on real multispectral images of Cameroonian forest. The results show that our model is more robust to acquisition parameters than the classical Fourier Texture Ordination model (FOTO). Our scheme is also more accurate for aboveground biomass estimation. We stress that a similar methodology could be implemented using quaternion wavelets. These results highlight the potential of the quaternion-based approach to study multispectral satellite images.

TI  - Hydrological effects of paddy improvement and abandonment on amphibian populations; long-term trends of the Japanese brown frog, <i>Rana japonica</i>
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In rice fields, the cultivation area itself can play an essential role as a habitat for wetland organisms. Many previous studies showed negative impact of agricultural intensification and abandonment on biodiversity in wet farmland ecosystems. However, verification of the direct impact of aquatic environmental change by the paddy improvement and abandonment still remains. Here, we investigated the effects of the intensification and abandonment on the area of wet fields remaining in paddies during the fallow season, as well as the factors driving the population decline of the Japanese brown frog (Rana japonica), using data of long-term monitoring numbers of egg masses at multiple sites. To quantitatively estimate the spatial and temporal variation in saturated areas with water in the paddies where the frogs spawn in early spring, we used infrared bands of Landsat images. Both paddy improvements and abandonment have affected R. japonica populations through the reduction of wet areas in the fields. Furthermore, the frog's population size was positively associated with the area of surrounding forest. Our findings suggest that conservation in wet farmland requires appropriate water management inside the cultivation area as well as in other landscape elements that serve as secondary habitats.

TI  - Effect of Mudflat Trampling on Activity of Intertidal Crabs
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Many people visit intertidal mudflats to collect bait and seafood, or for eco-tourism and recreation, and as a consequence trample on the mudflats frequently. Trampling would not be life threatening to most animals in the intertidal flats as they have evolved hiding behavior to escape predation. However, what is the effect of trampling on the behavior of intertidal animals? In this study, the effect of mudflat trampling on the activity of crabs (e.g. fiddler crabs, sentinel crabs) living on the mudflat was explored. The number of crabs active on the mudflat surface in experimental plots (1.5 x 1.5 m(2)) before and after (10 min. and 30 min.) trampling of three different intensities (Heavy trampling = 60 steps; Moderate trampling = 20 steps; and No trampling) was compared in two different mudflat systems. After trampling, the number of crabs active on the surface decreased and was significantly lower than that of control plots. The more intensively trampled the mudflat was, the fewer crabs were active on the mudflat surface. Surprisingly, the number of active crabs did not recover even 30 min. after trampling. The results clearly support the hypothesis that trampling can severely interfere with the behavior of crabs living on intertidal mudflats.

M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of high quality training samples and high-dimensional data is encountered in high-resolution image change detection. To address these problems, a novel automatic change detection algorithm in bitemporal multispectral images of the same scene using multiindex information is presented. The conspicuous advantages of the proposed algorithm are: (i) the complicated urban scenes are represented by a set of low-level semantic information index (e. g., textural and structural features), the information indices can directly indicate the primitive urban classes and (ii) change detection is carried out automatically using unsupervised approach. The multiindex information map contains vegetation, water and building extracted using enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index and developed efficient morphological building index respectively. The proposed algorithm is validated on the multitemporal Landsat ETM+ images over Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India where auspicious results were achieved by the proposed method. Moreover, the traditional method based on the pixel based change detection has also been implemented for the purpose of comparison to further validate the advantages of the proposed model.

TI  - Examining heat treatment for stabilization of the lipidome
T2  - BIOANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To confidently determine lipid-based biomarkers, it is important to minimize variation introduced during preanalytical steps. We evaluated reducing variation associated with lipid measurements in invertebrate sentinel species using a state-of-the-art heat treatment technique. Materials and Methods: Earthworms (Eisenia fetida), house crickets (Acheta domestica) and ghost shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus) were euthanized either by flash freezing or heat treatment. For both experiments, samples were either immediately extracted after removal from -80 degrees C storage or incubated on ice for one hour prior to sample weighing and extraction. Lipidomics was performed on resulting extracts using liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. LipidMatch and LipidSearch were used for lipid identification. Results: Lipid enzymatic products (e.g., phosphatidylmethanols, diglycerides, lysoglycerophospholipids and ether-linked/oxidized lysoglycerophospholipids), were in higher concentrations in flash-frozen samples, when compared with heat-treated samples. Results suggest that heat treatment reduces phospholipase A and phospholipase D activity. Conclusion: Heat treatment reduced enzymatic products and increased precursors of these enzymatic products. We believe heat treatment warrants a closer interrogation for improving the robustness of lipid biomarker research, especially in tissue samples, where enzyme stabilizers are difficult to apply, and for use in field studies, where the stabilization of the collected sample is critical.

TI  - Lymph node dissection for melanoma using tumescence local anaesthesia: an observational study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The possibility that tumescence local anaesthesia (TLA) may lead to dissemination of tumour cells in lymph nodes is presently unclear. Objectives: To evaluate whether infiltration by TLA influences metastatic spread and survival probability, compared to general anaesthesia (GA), based on lymph node dissection in melanoma patients. Patients & methods: In total, 281 patients (GA: 162; TLA: 119) with cutaneous melanoma and clinically or histologically-confirmed metastases in regional lymph nodes were included. All patients underwent complete lymph node dissection. Results: Median follow-up was 70 months. The rate of lymph node recurrence at the dissection site was 25.3% in the GA group and 17.6% in the TLA group (p = 0.082). No significant difference was found concerning 10-year melanoma-specific survival (GA: 56.2%, TLA: 67.4%; p = 0.09), disease-free survival (GA: 72.8 %, TLA: 81.1%; p = 0.095), or lymph node-free survival (GA: 72.8%, TLA: 81.1 %; p = 0.095). Distant metastases-free survival appeared to be slightly reduced in the TLA group (GA: 49.9%, TLA: 64.0%; p = 0.025). Conclusion: No differences were identified between the GA and TLA groups regarding prognostic outcome for overall survival or disease-free survival.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection and Mapping Using Sentinel 2 Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two object-based image analysis methods are developed for detecting oil spills from known natural outflows as well as light oil spill events using Sentinel 2 imagery. The methods are applied to Sentinel 2 images of a known area of natural oil outflow as well as on a Sentinel 2 image of a recent oil spill event along the south coast of Athens, Greece. The preliminary results are considered very successful and consistent, with a high degree of applicability to other Sentinel 2 satellite images. Further testing and fine tuning of the proposed object-based methodology should be carried out using atmospheric correction and ground truth.

M3  - Article
AB  - The actinometric system installed aboard the Yak-42D "Roshydromet" research aircraft is presented. It is designed to study radiation processes in the troposphere. The system is based on standard Kipp&Zonen actinometric instruments for measuring solar, thermal, and ultraviolet radiation fluxes as well as on specially developed radiation models with high-precision methods for solving radiative transfer equations (Monte Carlo, k-distribution, and line-by-line calculations). The combination of actinometric measurements and detailed simulation of radiative transfer in the atmosphere allows examining the radiation balance components throughout the troposphere using in situ measurements at the aircraft location. Some results of studying radiation fluxes obtained during the flights over the Arctic region of the Russian Federation are presented. The data of measurements carried out using the presented system are useful for validating radiation codes utilized in general atmospheric circulation models and for processing satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> infection and serological prevalence, ocular onchocerciasis and parasite transmission in northern and central Togo after decades of <i>Simulium damnosum</i> s.l. vector control and mass drug administration of ivermectin
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin has become the main intervention to control onchocerciasis or "river blindness". In Togo, after many years of MDA, Onchocerca volvulus infection has declined dramatically, and elimination appears achievable, but in certain river basins the current situation remains unknown. We have conducted parasitological, serological, ophthalmological, and entomological assessments in northern and central Togo within the river basins of Oti, Keran and Mo.Methodology/Principal findingsExaminations were completed in 1,455 participants from 11 onchocerciasis sentinel villages, and O. volvulus transmission by Simulium damnosum sensu lato (s.l.) was evaluated. In children (aged 1-10 years), the prevalence of microfilariae (Mf) was 2.3% and in adults it ranged from 5.1 to 13.3%. Positive IgG4 responses to O. volvulus adult (crude) worm antigen (OvAg) and the recombinant Ov16 antigen were in all-ages 48.7% and 34.4%, and 29.1% and 14.9% in children, respectively. In the river basin villages of Keran, Mo and Oti, the IgG4 seroprevalences to OvAg in children were 51.7%, 23.5% and 12.7%, respectively, and to the Ov16 antigen 33.3% (Ke A ran) and 5.2% (O A ti). Onchocerciasis ocular lesions (punctate keratitis, evolving iridocyclitis and chorioretinitis) were observed in children and young adults. O. volvulus-specific DNA (Ov150) was detected by poolscreen in vector samples collected from Tchitchira/Ke A ran(22.8%), Bouzalo/Mo A (11.3%), Baghan/Mo A (2.9%) and Pancerys/Oti(4.9%); prevalences of O. volvulus infection in S. damnosum s.l. were, respectively, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1% and 0.2%.Conclusions/SignificanceIn the northern and central river basins in Togo, interruption of O. volvulus transmission has not yet been attained. Patent O. volvulus infections, positive antibody responses, progressive ocular onchocerciasis were diagnosed, and parasite transmission by S. damnosum s.l. occurred close to the survey locations. Future interventions may require approaches selectively targeted to non-complying endemic populations, to the seasonality of parasite transmission and national onchocerciasis control programs should harmonize cross-border MDA as a coordinated intervention.

TI  - Development of generalized loss functions for rapid estimation of flood damages: a case study in Kelani River basin, Sri Lanka
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of infrastructural vulnerability to natural hazards, and subsequent economic loss, can make important contributions to future disaster risk minimization. The recent endeavor is to ascertain and evaluate risk globally, which can provide a framework to identify unique regional vulnerabilities, the mobilization of international investments, and cross-country risk comparison. This would require a concerted effort for the detailed classification of building exposures and vulnerability models. This study presents the design and efficacy of flood-vulnerability models for structural building types. The study uses an empirical approach, with data gathered from survey questionnaire, for direct estimation of flood damages in the Kelani River basin in Sri Lanka. Survey questionnaires were administered in the flood-prone areas of the basin, and depth-damage functions were established for four (4) structural building types that were identified based on the relationship between inundation depths and flood damage ratio. Event-based flood hazards were simulated using the Flo-2D model. Building exposures and densities were derived from remote sensing data, using integrated thematic land cover feature indices and supervised image classification. A modified mathematical loss model was employed to simulate flood damages to each building category for a disastrous flood event in the Kelani River basin. Simulated damages and post-flood survey showed reasonable comparativeness. The models can be employed for loss estimation of future damages and risk-reduction planning for flood disaster in Sri Lanka.

TI  - What to Know About Medicines With New Active Ingredients Approved in FY 2016/2016 in Japan and EU: A Brief Comparison of New Medicines Approved in Japan and the EU in 2016
T2  - THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have a long-standing experience of reviews of new medicines, and they meet their target pre-market review periods. In FY 2016 / 2016, 112 and 83 new medicines were approved in Japan and EU, respectively. Out of these medicines, 41 and 27 medicines containing new active ingredients were approved with total pre-market review periods of 209 days and 428 days in Japan and EU, respectively. Approximately one-third of these medicines were reviewed by the Agencies in close timing, within 1 year between pre-market review applications in Japan and in EU. Taking into account the increasing number of global clinical trials and constant number of consultations or scientific advice related to global clinical trials in Japan, it is clear that the importance of the continuous, collaborative relationship between EMA and PMDA is more and more crucial, as it does facilitate close and timely exchange of information and opinions on products and technologies under development. There already are effective collaborative frameworks between PMDA and EMA in addition to daily communication, and our findings support the development and best use of regulatory tools such as consultation services and scientific advice/protocol assistance for the benefit of the pharmaceutical industry but mostly of patients.

TI  - Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks for Online Disturbance Detection in Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite image time series (SITS) contains a significant amount of temporal information. By analysing this type of data, the pattern of the changes in the object of concern can be explored. The natural change in the Earth's surface is relatively slow and exhibits a pronounced pattern. Some natural events (for example, fires, floods, plant diseases, and insect pests) and human activities (for example, deforestation and urbanisation) will disturb this pattern and cause a relatively profound change on the Earth's surface. These events are usually referred to as disturbances. However, disturbances in ecosystems are not easy to detect from SITS data, because SITS contain combined information on disturbances, phenological variations and noise in remote sensing data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for online disturbance detection from SITS. The framework is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. First, LSTM networks are trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Last, the predicted data are compared with real data, and the noticeable deviations reveal disturbances. Experimental results using 16-day compositions of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MOD13Q1) illustrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach for online disturbance detection.

TI  - THE WORD AS A "SPELL ON THINGS" (THE PHENOMENON OF CHILDREN'S SPEECH IN ANDREI BELY'S <i>KOTIK LETAEV</i> AND LEV VYGOTSKY'S THINKING AND SPEECH)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the concept of children's speech as an ontological phenomenon. The research is based on Andrei Bely's Kotik Letaev and Lev Vygotsky's Thinking and Speech. The main symbolic principles of Bely's word formation are explored in this paper through the connection with the etymology of the child's word. Vygotsky's analysis of child's mind and speech is used to investigate the psychological aspect of this theme. Bely determines the creation of a symbol as a "resurrection" of words, a return to their original, inner form. The term "inner form" was clarified by the famous linguist A. A. Potebnja. Both Vygotsky and Bely were familiar with his works. The child purifies words from the weight of their historical meanings and interpretations to a clean phenomenon that defines particular things. The inner form of the word is emphasized during this process. As a structure of great importance it contains our ancestors' emotions about things and a predicative undertone ( the concept of the purpose of a thing): the first person who possessed the power of speech tried to put a "spell on a thing" in the process of naming. Bely was especially interested in similarity between child's words and the first human words in the era of irrational thinking, in the age of mythology. Children are able to hear the inner form and inner expressiveness of the word. Adults have to symbolize reality to return the feeling of the original sacrality of the word. As a result, the narrator in Bely's novel Kotik Letaev has two voices: the first one can feel the power and beauty of the word inner form; the second one sanctifies the reality by symbols-occasionalisms. According to Vygotsky, child's speech and thinking are usually separated at the age of two, after that they start to affect each other. The structure of the novel Kotik Letaev repeats Vygotsky's thoughts about the connection between thinking and speaking: one could name the period before Kasianovo the sensual stage of thinking, after Kasianovo the intellectual stage, when a child could operate pseudo-notions but without abstract elements in them. Therefore, children often make logical mistakes while speaking. Most errors are based on metaphors, which children refuse to understand. Kotik Letaev simplifies the metaphor and during this process returns to the mythological reality, which has a strong impact on the symbolic worldview. Child's words are free of historical meanings and have the ability to bewitch the reality. They contain the whole sentence in one sign; they are highly predicative and emotional because of the purified inner form. The article proves that Andrey Bely created a system of authorial occasionalisms using methods of child's word formation such as increasing the number of predicates, derivations of new verbs from nouns, free usage of prefixes.

TI  - Mapping of new HIV infections in Morocco and impact of select interventions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess HIV modes of exposure in Morocco at the national level and also for Souss-Massa-Draa, the region most affected by HIV. Another aim was to assess the impact of different scenarios of select intervention packages.Methods: The Modes of Transmission Model was adapted and used, and was parameterized using quality bio-behavioral surveillance data among key populations, routine data sources, and literature reviews.Results: Nationally in 2013, the largest number of new infections occurred among clients of female sex workers (FSWs) (25%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 14-37%), followed by men who have sex with men (MSM) (22%; 95% CI 12-35%), HIV serodiscordant couples (22%; 95% CI 12-34%), FSWs (11%; 95% CI 6-18%), and people who inject drugs (5%; 95% CI 2-9%). A similar pattern of results was observed in Souss-Massa-Draa, but the HIV incidence rate was four-fold that at the national level. Different scenarios of feasible intervention packages reduced HIV incidence by 8-44%.Conclusions: Commercial heterosexual sex networks continue as the leading driver of the epidemic, with half of HIV incidence. A quarter of new infections occurred among MSM, a third of which in Souss-Massa-Draa. Feasible expanded coverage of interventions could lead to large reductions in incidence. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes the concept of detecting illegal waste landfills in a part of the City of Zagreb by using remote sensing methods on high-resolution satellite images WorldView-2. Pixel base segmentation of the high-resolution satellite images was performed, and then the object-oriented classification (in the Deffiniens Professional 5.0 software) was performed on the selected source and pan-sharpened images of the satellite images according to the parameters: mean and standard deviation. After the classification had been carried out, the results obtained were filtered using indicators of illegal waste disposal landfills in the GIS ArcGIS software package. The final results were interpreted (by matrix confusion parameters) and verified by overlapping with reference data about known illegal laundered waste landfills and by checking them in the field.

TI  - Interannual variability of Danube waters propagation in summer period of 1992-2015 and its influence on the Black Sea ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The propagation of the Danube River plume has strong interannual variability that impacts the local balance of nutrients and the thermohaline structure in the western Black Sea. In the present study, we use a particle tracking model based on satellite altimetry measurements and wind reanalysis data, as well as satellite measurements (SeaWiFS, MODIS), to investigate the interannual variability in the Danube plume pathways during the summer from 1993 to 2015. The wind conditions largely define the variability in the Danube water propagation. Relatively low-frequency variability (on periods of a week to months) in the wind stress curl modulates the intensity of the geostrophic Rim Current and related mesoscale eddy dynamics. High-frequency offshore wind-drift currents transport the plume across isobaths and provide an important transport link between shelf and offshore circulation. Inherent plume dynamics play an additional role in the near-mouth transport of the plume and its connection with offshore circulation.During the years with prevailing northeast winds (similar to 30% of studied cases), which are usually accompanied by increased wind curl over the Black Sea and higher Danube discharge, an alongshore southward current at the NorthWestern Shelf (NWS) is formed near the western Black Sea coast. Advected southward, the Danube waters are entrained in the Rim Current jet, which transports them along the west coast of the basin. The strong Rim Current, fewer eddies and downwelling winds substantially decrease the cross-shelf exchange of nutrients.During the years with prevailing southeastern winds (similar to 40%), the Rim Current is less intense. Mesoscale eddies effectively trap the Danube waters, transporting them to the deep western part of the basin. The low- and high-frequency southeastern wind-drift currents contribute significantly to cross-isobath plume transport and its connection with offshore circulation. During several years (similar to 15%), the Danube waters moved eastward to the west coast of Crimea. They were transported on the north periphery of the mesoscale anticyclones due to prevailing eastward wind-drift currents. During the years with hot summers, a monsoon effect induced the formation of a strong anticyclonic wind cell over the NorthWestern Shelf (NWS), and the plume moved northward (similar to 15%). Anticyclonic wind circulation leads to the Ekman convergence of brackish surface waters in the centre of the shelf and the formation of a baroclinic geostrophic anticyclone north of the NWS. This anticyclone traps the Danube waters and forces them to remain on the shelf for a long period of time. The impact of the propagation of the plume on the variability in chlorophyll a chlorophyll a in the NWS and the western Black Sea is analysed in this study based on satellite data.

TI  - Urban Growth in the Bucharest Metropolitan Area: Spatial and Temporal Assessment Using Logistic Regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bucharest Metropolitan Area (BMA) is witnessing rapid urban growth under the form of urban sprawl, which leads to a continuous expansion of the city over wider territories beyond its outskirts. The relationship between urban growth and proximity explanatory driving factors is one of the most important in understanding and forecasting the spatial and temporal dynamics of sprawl. Thus, the current study only considers distance variables in explaining the process of urban growth and identifying areas most propitious to future urban development. The authors used spatial data extracted from Landsat satellite images and map imagery software using geographical information system (GIS) techniques resulting in five thematic mapsbuilt-up areas, roads, forests, water bodies, and major commercial centersfor two periods: 1990-2002 (T1) and 2002-2015 (T2). In order to identify and quantify urban growth, binary logistic regression was performed to identify empirical relationships between a binary dependent (urban growth) variable and nine independent variables: distance to Bucharest, nearest urban centers, nearest major roads, secondary roads, nearest road junction, existing built-up areas, major commercial centers, forested areas, and water bodies (water courses and lakes). Modeling results demonstrate that urban growth in the BMA has been mainly triggered by transportation networks (both major and secondary) and the proximity of existing built-up areas, whereas natural features (e.g.,rivers, lakes, forests) have had no significant influence on urban growth processes, especially after 2002. Therefore, future growth is more likely to occur in areas that have good accessibility and connectivity to the transportation network and in areas close to the existing built-up areas, mainly within localities neighboring the city of Bucharest.

TI  - Ensemble classification of individual <i>Pinus</i> crowns from multispectral satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing tree species is relevant in many contexts of remote sensing assisted forest inventory. Accurate tree species maps support management and conservation planning, pest and disease control and biomass estimation. This study evaluated the performance of applying ensemble techniques with the goal of automatically distinguishing Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus uncinata Mill. Ex Mirb within a 1.3 km(2) mountainous area in Barcelonnette (France). Three modelling schemes were examined, based on: (1) high-density LiDAR data (160 returns m(-2)), (2) Worldview-2 multispectral imagery, and (3) Worldview-2 and LiDAR in combination. Variables related to the crown structure and height of individual trees were extracted from the normalized LiDAR point cloud at individual-tree level, after performing individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. Vegetation indices and the Haralick texture indices were derived from Worldview-2 images and served as independent spectral variables. Selection of the best predictor subset was done after a comparison of three variable selection procedures: (1) Random Forests with cross validation (AUCREcv), (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and (3) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To classify the species, 9 regression techniques were combined using ensemble models. Predictions were evaluated using cross validation and an independent dataset. Integration of datasets and models improved individual tree species classification (True Skills Statistic, TSS; from 0.67 to 0.81) over individual techniques and maintained strong predictive power (Relative Operating Characteristic, ROC = 0.91). Assemblage of regression models and integration of the datasets provided more reliable species distribution maps and associated tree-scale mapping uncertainties. Our study highlights the potential of model and data assemblage at improving species classifications needed in present-day forest planning and management.

TI  - Evaluation and utilization of MODIS and CALIPSO aerosol retrievals over a complex terrain in Himalaya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study elucidate upon the evaluation of satellite retrievals with ground based aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements, their utilization in LiDAR ratio (LR) estimation, boundary layer (BL) height determination and the case studies on aerosol transport over Himalayan region. The AOD retrievals from the latest level-2 data collections (C5.1 and C6.0) of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and Terra satellites and Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) versions (4.10 and 3) are subjected for quantitative analysis to assess the level of agreement with the quality assured level-2 ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements over Manora peak (29.36 degrees N, 79.46 E), a high altitude site in the Himalayas. Analysis revealed that the AOD from the latest MODIS Terra C6.0 deep blue (DB) 30 km x 30 km and CALIPSO ver. 4.10 (overpass within similar to 100 km distance) are in a very good agreement (R >= 0.9) with that from coincident AERONET measurements averaged over the span of 30 min. About 77% of the AOD retrieved using MODIS and similar to 87% from CALIPSO were found to be within the expected error (EE) limits. The AOD comparison between MODIS Terra C6.0 DB and CALIPSO ver. 4.10, suggested their synergic use for aerosol characterization over Himalayas. In comparison to the ver. 3, CALIPSO ver. 4.10 is found to have undergone substantial changes, and their long term inter-comparison in the grid 28.86 degrees-29.86 degrees N and 78.96 degrees-79.96 degrees E revealed that their vertical feature and aerosol sub-types are in agreement of similar to 94.6% and similar to 68.6%, respectively. Utilizing the AOD retrievals from AERONET and MODIS collections, the iteratively computed LR for three LiDAR systems was found to be lower (< 16) during winter and higher (> 43) during summer. Study on the BL height estimations suggested that the wavelet covariance transform (WCT) method for CALIPSO could be the best choice as compared to the threshold method, and complements well with the specific humidity gradient method used with the radiosonde observation. Case studies on the continental transport of smoke plumes emanating from crop-residue burning in post-monsoon, and long range transport of aerosols and dust over the region in summer are also discussed using the collocated measurements from ground-based AERONET and LiDAR, in conjunction with MODIS, CALIPSO, reanalysis data and trajectory modeling.

TI  - Examining the Effect of Ancillary and Derived Geographical Data on Improvement of Per-Pixel Classification Accuracy of Different Landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective conservation and management of natural resources requires up-to-date information of the land cover (LC) types and their dynamics. Multi-resolution remote sensing (RS) data coupled with additional ancillary topographical layers (both remotely acquired or derived from ground measurements) with appropriate classification strategies would be more effective in capturing LC dynamics and changes associated with the natural resources. Ancillary information would make the decision boundaries between the LC classes more widely separable, enabling classification with higher accuracy compared to conventional methods of RS data classification. In this work, we ascertain the possibility of improvement in classification accuracy of RS data with the addition of ancillary and derived geographical layers such as vegetation indices, temperature, digital elevation model, aspect, slope and texture, implemented in three different terrains of varying topography-urbanised landscape (Greater Bangalore), forested landscape (Western Ghats) and rugged terrain (Western Himalaya). The study showed that use of additional spatial ancillary and derived information significantly improved the classification accuracy compared to the classification of only original spectral bands. The analysis revealed that in a highly urbanised area with less vegetation cover and contrasting features, inclusion of elevation and texture increased the overall accuracy of IKONOS data classification to 88.72% (3.5% improvement), and inclusion of temperature, NDVI, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect, Panchromatic band along with texture measures, significantly increased the overall accuracy of Landsat ETM+ data classification to 83.15% (7.6% improvement). In a forested landscape with moderate elevation, temperature was useful in improving the overall accuracy by 6.7 to 88.26%, and in a rugged terrain with temperate climate, temperature, EVI, elevation, slope, aspect and Panchromatic band significantly improved the classification accuracy to 89.97% (10.84% improvement) compared to the classification of only original spectral bands, suggesting selection of appropriate ancillary data depending on the terrain.

TI  - Correction of Sensor Saturation Effects in MODIS Oceanic Particulate Inorganic Carbon
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The highly reflective nature of high particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) from calcifying plankton, such as surface blooms of Emiliana huxleyi in the latter stages of their life cycle, can cause the saturation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) visible spectrum ocean color bands. This saturation results in errors in the standard MODIS oceanic PIC product, resulting in the highest PIC levels being represented as cloud-like gaps (missing data) in daily level 2 data, and as either gaps or erroneously low PIC values in temporally averaged data (e.g., 8-day level 3 data). A method is described to correct this error and to reconstruct the missing data in the ocean color band data by regressing the 1-km spatial resolution ocean color bands against MODIS higher resolution (500 m spatial resolution) bands with lower sensitivities. The method is applied to all North Atlantic MODIS data from 2002 to 2014. This shows the effect on mean PIC concentration over the whole North Atlantic to be less than 1% annually and 2% monthly, but with more significant regional effects, exceeding 10% in peak months in some coastal shelf regions. Effects are highly localized and tend to annually reoccur in similar geographical locations. Ignoring these missing data within intense blooms is likely to result in an underestimation of the influence that coccolithophores, and their changing distributions, are having on the North Atlantic carbon cycle. We see no evidence in this 12-year time series of a temporal poleward movement of these intense bloom events.

TI  - Fifteen-Year Decrease in General Surgery Resident Breast Operative Experience: Are We Training Proficient Breast Surgeons?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to evaluate trends in general surgery resident breast cases over the past 15 years.& para;& para;STUDY DESIGN: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Case Logs Statistics Reports from 2000 to 2015 were reviewed for average breast-specific case numbers and trends over time. ACGME data were available for all cases and breast-specific cases including the following: excisional biopsy/lumpectomy, simple mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, and sentinel lymph node excision.& para;& para;SETTING: The study evaluation was conducted at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.& para;& para;PARTICIPANTS: No individuals directly participated in this project. However, all general surgery residents at ACGME-accredited programs are represented in this analysis by virtue of the ACGME Case Logs Statistics Reports.& para;& para;RESULTS: Total residency case volume increased by 2% (2000-2015, p = 0.0159), with 2015 graduates logging 985.5 cases. In contrast, breast cases decreased by 17.1%. The largest drops were in modified radical mastectomy (61.5% decrease, p = 0.0001) and excisional biopsy/ lumpectomy (25.8% decrease). Simple mastectomy increased from 6.0 to 10.8 cases (p = 0.0001). Sentinel lymph node excision fluctuated, but has been down-trending recently (67.3% decrease from 2010 to 2015, p = 0.0001). Decreased experience is occurring at both junior and senior resident levels.& para;& para;CONCLUSIONS: Breast case operative experience for general surgery residents decreased by 17% between 2000 and 2015, despite increase in overall operative volume. Residents have less experience in more advanced cases including axillary management, raising concern about the proficiency of graduating surgeons with respect to these procedures. It is reasonable to set national minimums for resident breast operative experience to ensure that individuals are appropriately trained to perform these cases in practice.

TI  - Transepithelial migration of mucosal hemocytes in <i>Crassostrea virginica</i> and potential role in <i>Perkinsus marinus</i> pathogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have recently described the presence of hemocytes associated with mucus covering the pallial organs (mantle, gills, and body wall) 3 of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. These hemocytes, hereby designated "pallial hemocytes" share common general characteristics with circulating hemocytes but also display significant differences particularly in their cell surface epitopes. The specific location of pallial hemocytes as peripheral cells exposed directly to the marine environment confers them a putative sentinel role. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the source of these pallial hemocytes by evaluating possible exchanges between circulatory and pallial hemocyte populations and whether these exchanges are regulated by pathogen exposure. Bi-directional transepithelial migrations of hemocytes between pallial surfaces and the circulatory system were monitored using standard cell tracking approaches after staining with the vital fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Results showed bi-directional migration of hemocytes between both compartments and suggest that hemocyte migration from the pallial mucus layer to the circulatory system may occur at a greater rate compared to migration from the circulatory system to the pallial mucus layer, further supporting the role of pallial hemocytes as sentinel cells. Subsequently, the effect of the obligate parasite Perkinsus marinas and the opportunistic pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus on transepithelial migration of oyster hemocytes was investigated. Results showed an increase in hemocyte migration in response to P. marinas exposure. Furthermore, P. marinas cells were acquired by pallial hemocytes before being visible in underlying tissues and the circulatory system suggesting that this parasite could use pallial hemocytes as a vehicle facilitating its access to oyster tissues. These results are discussed in light of new evidence highlighting the role of oyster pallial organs as a portal for the initiation of P. marinas infections in oysters.

AB  - This paper explores how Africana Studies offer the opportunity for a new worldview that may supplant the assumption that Western history is history. It considers how new knowledge of the human migration bodes for the future of Africana Studies. It has the following research questions: (1) Does new ancestry data reveal or clarify African narratives that may have been missing or suppressed?; (2) What heritage do participants over- or under-predict?; (3) Do participants over-predict indigenous American heritage?; and (4) How is unexpected heritage received? Data from the DNA Discussion Project is used to answer these questions, and implications for bridging discussions of human history using Ancestry DNA are discussed.

TI  - From Field Data to Ecosystem Services Maps: Using Regressions for the Case of Deforested Areas Within the Amazon
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying and mapping ecosystem services (ES) is seen as one way to improve decision making and land management to better integrate environmental issues. This study aimed to characterize ES supply in deforestation context where an improvement of scientific knowledge should help develop more efficient environmental management. For three case studies in the Brazilian Amazon impacted by deforestation, seven indicators of potential ES supply were mapped at a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m: biodiversity index (indicator of food web support); richness of pollinators (pollination); index of soil chemical quality (support to production); water available for plants (water regulation); soil carbon stocks (support to production and climate regulation); rate of water infiltration into the soil (soil erosion control); and vegetation carbon stocks (climate regulation). To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts. From a methodological viewpoint, the study highlights the importance of choices inherent in all cartographic practices and that need to be considered, especially in the context of rendering ES maps operational.

TI  - Axillary Ultrasound Identifies Residual Nodal Disease After Chemotherapy: Results From the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1071 Trial (Alliance)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine lymph node features on axillary ultrasound (US) images obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy that are associated with residual nodal disease in patients with initial biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer.SUBJECTS AND METHODS. All patients had axillary US performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Axillary US images were centrally reviewed for lymph node size, cortical thickness, and cortical morphologic findings (type I indicated no visible cortex; type II, a hypoechoic cortex <= 3 mm; type III, a hypoechoic cortex > 3 mm; type IV, a generalized lobulated hypoechoic cortex; type V, focal hypoechoic cortical lobulation; and type VI, a totally hypoechoic node with no hilum). Lymph node characteristics were compared with final surgical pathologic findings.RESULTS. Axillary US images obtained after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical pathologic findings were available for 611 patients. Residual nodal disease was present in 373 patients (61.0%), and 238 (39.0%) had a complete nodal pathologic response. Increased cortical thickness (mean, 3.5 mm for node-positive disease vs 2.5 mm for node-negative disease) was associated with residual nodal disease. Lymph node short-axis and long-axis diameters were significantly associated with pathologic findings. Patients with nodal morphologic type I or II had the lowest rate of residual nodal disease (51 of 91 patients [56.0%] and 138 of 246 patients (56.1%), respectively), whereas those with nodal morphologic type VI had the highest rate (44 of 55 patients [80.0%]) (p = 0.004). The presence of fatty hilum was significantly associated with node-negative disease (p = 0.0013).CONCLUSION. Axillary US performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is useful for nodal response assessment, with longer short-axis diameter, longer long-axis diameter, increased cortical thickness, and absence of fatty hilum significantly associated with residual nodal disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Meat-ing Demand: Is <i>In Vitro</i> Meat a Pragmatic, Problematic, or Paradoxical Solution?
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF WOMEN AND THE LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Even in the midst of an ecological crisis, population and income continue to increase and so too does the global appetite for meat. One response by scientists has been to work towards making in vitro meat (IVM) a commercial reality, which would allow meat to be produced on a large scale without the husbandry and slaughter of enormous numbers of animals, as under the current industrial meat production system. Proponents of IVM technology claim that it could cut hunger, offer public health benefits, mitigate the environmental effects of conventional industrial meat production, and improve animal welfare. However, taking a critical, ecofeminist perspective on IVM highlights the need to assess not only the technical attributes and possibilities of the technology but also its underlying worldview as well as the unintended social and environmental consequences that could result. Reflecting on the question of whether IVM is a pragmatic, problematic, or paradoxical solution to the ills associated with industrial meat production and increasing meat consumption, this article argues that optimistic claims trumpeting the promissory potential of IVM are over-simplistic and warrant closer scrutiny. The importance of careful deliberation on the implications of emerging technologies like IVM cannot be understated because how the ethical discourse unfolds in the early stages will be significant in influencing public perception and social acceptance as well as shaping policy and regulatory design.

AB  - The surveillance of influenza activity is critical to early detection of epidemics and pandemics and the design of disease control strategies. Case reporting through a voluntary network of sentinel physicians is a commonly used method of passive surveillance for monitoring rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) worldwide. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to the processes underlying the observation, collection, and spatial aggregation of sentinel surveillance data, and its subsequent effects on epidemiological understanding. We harnessed the high specificity of diagnosis codes in medical claims from a database that represented 2.5 billion visits from upwards of 120,000 United States healthcare providers each year. Among influenza seasons from 2002-2009 and the 2009 pandemic, we simulated limitations of sentinel surveillance systems such as low coverage and coarse spatial resolution, and performed Bayesian inference to probe the robustness of ecological inference and spatial prediction of disease burden. Our models suggest that a number of socio-environmental factors, in addition to local population interactions, state-specific health policies, as well as sampling effort may be responsible for the spatial patterns in U.S. sentinel ILI surveillance. In addition, we find that biases related to spatial aggregation were accentuated among areas with more heterogeneous disease risk, and sentinel systems designed with fixed reporting locations across seasons provided robust inference and prediction. With the growing availability of health-associated big data worldwide, our results suggest mechanisms for optimizing digital data streams to complement traditional surveillance in developed settings and enhance surveillance opportunities in developing countries.

TI  - Real-Time Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Float-Point Imaging System Using Optimized Mapping Methodology and a Multi-Node Parallel Accelerating Technique
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of satellite load technology and very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit technology, on-board real-time synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems have facilitated rapid response to disasters. A key goal of the on-board SAR imaging system design is to achieve high real-time processing performance under severe size, weight, and power consumption constraints. This paper presents a multi-node prototype system for real-time SAR imaging processing. We decompose the commonly used chirp scaling (CS) SAR imaging algorithm into two parts according to the computing features. The linearization and logic-memory optimum allocation methods are adopted to realize the nonlinear part in a reconfigurable structure, and the two-part bandwidth balance method is used to realize the linear part. Thus, float-point SAR imaging processing can be integrated into a single Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip instead of relying on distributed technologies. A single-processing node requires 10.6 s and consumes 17 W to focus on 25-km swath width, 5-m resolution stripmap SAR raw data with a granularity of 16,384 x 16,384. The design methodology of the multi-FPGA parallel accelerating system under the real-time principle is introduced. As a proof of concept, a prototype with four processing nodes and one master node is implemented using a Xilinx xc6vlx315t FPGA. The weight and volume of one single machine are 10 kg and 32 cm x 24 cm x 20 cm, respectively, and the power consumption is under 100 W. The real-time performance of the proposed design is demonstrated on Chinese Gaofen-3 stripmap continuous imaging.

TI  - Heterogeneous decadal glacier downwasting at the Mt. Everest (Qomolangma) from 2000 to ∼ 2012 based on multi-baseline bistatic SAR interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based geodetic observations can be used as alternatives data to map glacier height changes because the harsh environment complicates in situ observations. In this study, we analysed five pairs of X-band bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images from 2011 and 2014 for Mt. Everest (Qomolangma). Glacier height changes were derived using the D-InSAR method respect to SRTM DEM of 2000. An iterative D-InSAR method using multi -baseline bistatic SAR interferograms was employed, which increased reliability and accuracy of glacier height changing observations. From 2000 to similar to 2012, the geodetic glacier mass balance for the Mt. Everest and the surrounding region was - 0.38 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1). The spatial pattern of the glacier mass loss was heterogeneous. The regional heterogeneity may possibly reflect debris-covering rates, terminating type, temperature rising rates and glacier flow rates. Comparison to long-period geodetic glacier mass balance data provided by previous studies since 1970 revealed that our results showed more rapid increases in the glacier mass loss rates after 2000 in the area around Khumbu Glacier in the southern slope of the Mt. Everest, whereas glacier mass loss rates kept stable in the Rongbuk Catchment at its northern slope.

TI  - Increase of surface solar irradiance across East China related to changes in aerosol properties during the past decade
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previously, it was widely documented that an overall decrease in surface solar radiation occurred in China at least until 2005, in contrast to the general background of 'global brightening'. Increased anthropogenic aerosol emissions were speculated to be the source of the reduction. In this study, we extend the trend analysis to the most recent decade from 2005-2015 and find that surface solar radiation has shifted from 'dimming' to 'brightening' over East China, with the largest increase over the northeast and southeast parts. Meanwhile, satellite and ground observation both indicate a reduction in aerosol optical depth (AOD) during the same period, whereas no significant trends in cloud amount show up. Detailed analysis using co-located radiation and aerosol observation at the XiangHe station in North China suggests that both AOD and single scattering albedo (SSA) changes contribute to the radiation trends. AOD reduction contributes to the increase of direct solar radiation, also decreasing the diffuse radiation, while the increase of SSA serves to increase the diffuse fraction. Simple calculations using a radiative transfer model confirm that the two effects combined explain changes in the global solar radiation and its components effectively. Our results have implications for potential climate effects with the reduction of China's aerosol emissions, and the necessity to monitor aerosol composition in addition to its loading.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of the urban impervious surface and its driving forces in the central city of Harbin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Associated with the rapid economic development of China, the level of urbanization is becoming a serious concern. Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang Province, China and one of the political, economic, cultural, and transportation centers of the northeastern region of China, has experienced rapid urbanization recently. To examine the spatial patterns of long-term urbanization and explore its driving forces, we employed the impervious surface fraction derived from remote sensing image as a primary indicator. Specifically, urban impervious surface information for the central city of Harbin in 1984, 1993, 2002, and 2010 was extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper image using a Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LMSA). Then, the spatial and temporal variation characteristics and the driving factors of percent impervious surface area (ISA) changes were analyzed throughout this 26-year period (1984 to 2010). Analysis of results suggests that: (1) ISAs in the central city of Harbin constantly increased, particularly from 1993 to 2010, a rapid urbanization period; (2) the gravity center of impervious surface area in the central city was located in Nangang District in 1984, moving southeast from 1984 to 1993, northwest from 1993 to 2002, and continuing toward the southeast from 2002 to 2010; and (3) the urban growth of the central city can be characterized as edge-type growth.

TI  - VBRT: A novel voxel-based radiative transfer model for heterogeneous three-dimensional forest scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling the radiative transfer (RT) in heterogeneous forest scenes is important for understanding biophysical processes, as well as retrieving information from remotely sensed data. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is capable of providing highly detailed three-dimensional (3D) canopy structural information that can be used to parameterize RT models. In previous studies, point cloud data (such as terrestrial LiDAR data) are often vox-elized with coarse resolutions, and the foliage voxels are often assumed to be turbid medium. In this study we propose a new voxel-based RT model, namely VBRT, that uses high resolution solid voxels to approximate 3D structure of forest more accurately than coarse resolution turbid medium voxels used in previous studies. Parallel computing techniques are used to speed up computation and the model can run on high performance computing (HPC) platforms. VBRT was tested in four virtual forest scenes, using the well-known physically based ray tracer (PBRT) as a benchmark. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model, which is based on turbid medium voxels, was also compared. Experimental results show that simulated digital imagery and bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) by VBRT and PBRT are in good agreement, and the difference in simulation results can be reduced by using higher resolution voxels or larger number of samples per pixel. According to our test, parameterizing VBRT using high resolution terrestrial LiDAR data with 0.02 m voxels can produce more accurate results than DART with turbid medium voxels (0.1 m), although VBRT is more computation-intensive due to the use of higher resolution voxels. Our results indicate that VBRT has good potential in modeling radiation transfer in forests, as it is possible to parameterize the model using high density point cloud data such as terrestrial LiDAR data.

TI  - Predicting future urban impervious surface distribution using cellular automata and regression analysis
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surfaces are considered as key indicator of urbanization intensity and environmental quality. Due to their significant impact on surface runoff, flood frequency, and water quality, impervious surfaces have been identified as an important indicator for examining the hydrological impact of urbanization. The amount and distribution of impervious surfaces have been estimated using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Little research, however, has been conducted to predict future impervious surface distributions. To address this problem, we developed an integrated residential/commercial growth and impervious surface distribution model to predict urban impervious surface distribution. Taking Milwaukee River Basin, Wisconsin as a case study, we simulated future residential and commercial developments using a CA model. Further, we developed a linear regression model to predict impervious surface distributions in residential and commercial land uses. Analysis of results suggests that the proposed model performs significantly better than the traditional approaches.

TI  - Creating a seamless 1 km resolution daily land surface temperature dataset for urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) datasets are increasingly needed in a variety of fields such as ecology, hydrology, meteorology, epidemiology, and energy systems. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily LST is one of such high spatiotemporal datasets that are widely used. But, it has a large amount of missing values primarily because of clouds, shadows, and other atmospheric conditions. Gapfilling the missing values is an important approach to create seamless high spatiotemporal LST datasets. However, current gapfilling methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency to assemble the data over large areas (e.g., national and continental levels). In this study, we developed a 3-step hybrid method by integrating daily merging (gapfilling missing values at one overpass using values at the other three overpasses each day), spatiotemporal gapfilling (estimating missing values based on values of their spatial and temporal neighbors), and temporal interpolation (gapfilling missing values based on values of their neighboring days), to create a seamless high spatiotemporal LST dataset using the four daily LST observations from the two MODIS instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites. We applied this method in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. in 2010. The evaluation of the gapfilled LST product indicates its root mean squared error (RMSE) to be 3.3 K for mid-daytime (1:30 pm) and 2.7 K for mid-nighttime (1:30 am) observations. The method can be easily extended to other years and regions and is also applicable to other satellite products for large areas. This seamless daily (mid-daytime and mid-nighttime) LST product with 1 km spatial resolution is of great value for studying urban climate (e.g., quantifying surface urban heat island intensity, creating seamless high spatiotemporal air temperature dataset) and the related impacts on people (e.g., health and mortality), ecosystems (e.g., phenology), and energy systems (e.g., building energy use).

AB  - A challenge of phenological research is to integrate remotely sensed observations obtained at different spatial and temporal scales to provide information that contains both a high temporal density and fine spatial scale observations. This study aims to improve the level of spatial detail and the temporal density required for efficient monitoring of vegetation phenology by applying two remote sensing techniques, MODIS and digital camera images. Based on the vegetation indices extracted from each measurement, we analyzed phenological changes of vegetation and deduced phenophases transition dates, such as start dates of green-up and senescence by applying different two methods, the rate of change of curvature, K and HMV. The start and end of the growing season of Mongolian oak expressed in ExG-DC, which were extracted from digital camera image, were agreed well with that of visual assessment. EVI among three vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI and ExG-MI) showed the high correlation with ExG-DC and visual assessment. Based on RMSE, the transition dates assessed by visual observation were agreed better with the dates, which were estimated based on curvature K than with the dates estimated from HMV in all vegetation indices. Sap flow time-series estimates for the phenological transition dates were closely accorded with the estimates derived from near-surface time-series, and coincided better with the dates estimated based on curvature K than that based on HMV. In conclusion, based on the result of this study, we suggest that it is effective to use EXG-DC obtained from digital camera and EVI from MODIS when these two instrument are integrated as the vegetation indices and that curvature K is an effective method for extracting the phenological event dates of vegetation.

TI  - A Four-Band Semi-Analytical Model for Estimating Phycocyanin in Inland Waters From Simulated MERIS and OLCI Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing remote-sensing algorithms to estimate the phycocyanin (PC) concentration in turbid inland waters have high associated uncertainties, especially at low PC concentrations in diverse phytoplankton communities. This paper provides the theoretical framework for a four-band semi-analytical algorithm (FBA_PC) which isolates PC absorption from second-order variability caused by yellow matter and other phytoplankton pigment absorption. The algorithm suits the band configuration of both the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI). Calibration of the algorithm was based on absorption data from 12 inland water bodies in the USA, The Netherlands, and China, combined with measurements from laboratory-grown cultures, which demonstrated that the assumptions underlying FBA-PC are an improvement over existing three-band approaches. Validation of FBA_PC in seven inland water bodies in the USA, The Netherlands, and China showed good agreement of FBA_PC adjusted to the MERIS/OLCI band configuration with measured PC, with root-mean-square error = 27.691 mg.m(-3), mean absolute percentage error = 172.863%, and coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.730. FBA_PC outperformed previously proposed PC algorithms that can be applied to MERIS or OLCI data, and is expected to be more robust when applied to a wider range of water bodies.

TI  - Progressive Sample Processing of Band Selection for Hyperspectral Image Transmission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Band selection (BS) is one of the important topics in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. Many types of BS algorithms were proposed in the last decade. However, most of them were designed for off-line use. They can only be used with pre-collected data, and are sometimes ineffective for applications that require timeliness, such as disaster prevention or target detection. This paper proposes an online BS method that allows us obtain instant BS results in a progressive manner during HSI data transmission, which is carried out under band-interleaved-by-sample/pixel (BIS/BIP) format. Such a revolutionary method is called progressive sample processing of band selection (PSP-BS). In PSP-BS, BS can be done recursively pixel by pixel, so that the instantaneous BS can be achieved without waiting for all the pixels of an image. To develop a PSP-BS algorithm, we proposed PSP-OMPBS, which adopted the recursive version of a self-sparse regression BS method (OMPBS) as a native algorithm. The experiments conducted on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate that PSP-OMPBS can progressively output the BS with extremely low computing time. In addition, the convergence of BS results during transmission can be further accelerated by using a pre-defined pixel transmission sequence. Such a significant advantage not only allows BS to be done in a real-time manner for the future satellite data downlink, but also determines the BS results in advance, without waiting to receive every pixel of an image.

TI  - Synoptic Environments and Characteristics of Convection Reaching the Tropopause over Northeast China
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Overshooting convection that penetrates the lapse rate tropopause is defined globally using 3 years of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) observations and ERA-Interim data. Overshooting convection in the subtropics is mainly found over a few hot spot regions, including central North America and Argentina. A relatively high density of events with overshooting convection is also found over northeast China in the summer months, where 203 events are identified during 2014-16. These convective events extending above the tropopause occur under various synoptic conditions. The synoptic conditions during these events are categorized into three different types, namely, trough, cutoff low, and ridge types, with a subjective analysis based on the wind and pressure fields at 500 hPa. The precipitation systems with overshooting convection ahead of a deep trough have larger sizes than other types. Those in the cutoff low environment are mostly embedded within a large precipitation system. The ridge-type systems have a stable midtroposphere and a high moist instability at low levels and are mostly isolated convective systems, characterized by smaller sizes, higher radar echo top, and larger convective area and precipitation fraction than the other two types.

TI  - Assessment of the Performance of Three Dynamical Climate Downscaling Methods Using Different Land Surface Information over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the performance of different dynamical downscaling methods using updated land surface information. Particular attention is given to obtaining high-resolution climate information over China by the combination of an appropriate dynamical downscaling method and updated land surface information. Two group experiments using two land surface datasets are performed, including default Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) land surface data (OLD) and accurate dynamically accordant MODIS data (NEW). Each group consists of three types of experiments for the summer of 2014, including traditional continuous integration (CT), spectral nudging (SN), and re-initialization (Re) experiments. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to dynamically downscale ERA-Interim (reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast, ECMWF) data with a grid spacing of 30 km over China. The simulations are evaluated via comparison with observed conventional meteorological variables, showing that the CT method, which notably overestimates 2 m temperature and underestimates 2 m relative humidity across China, performs the worst; the SN and Re runs outperform the CT method, and the Re shows the smallest RMSE (root means square error). A comparison of observed and simulated precipitation shows that the SN simulation is closest to the observed data, while the CT and Re simulations overestimate precipitation south of the Yangtze River. Compared with the OLD group, the RMSE values of temperature and relative humidity are significantly improved in CT and SN, and there is smaller improved in Re. However, obvious improvements in precipitation are not evident.

TI  - A Variational Pan-Sharpening Method Based on Spatial Fractional-Order Geometry and Spectral-Spatial Low-Rank Priors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening refers to the fusion of a low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image to obtain an HR MS image (i.e., pan-sharpened MS image). From the point of view of variational complementary data fusion, it becomes an optimization problem with geometry and spectral preserving constraints. In this paper, a novel unified optimizing pan-sharpening model is proposed by integrating a data-generative fidelity term and a compound prior term, which incorporates both spatial fractional-order geometry and spectral-spatial low-rank priors. Specifically, the proposed model consists of three important ingredients: 1) data-generative fidelity term, which models the degradation relationship between the LR and HR MS images to enforce the geometry and spectral preserving constraints; 2) fractional-order total variation-based spatial fractional-order geometry prior term, which especially exploits the spatial fractional-order gradient feature consistence between the PAN and pan-sharpened MS images to transfer the spatial structure information of the PAN image into the pan-sharpened MS image; and 3) weighted nuclear norm-based spectral-spatial low-rank prior term, which exploits the nonlocal patches-based low-rank structural sparsity simultaneously in the pan-sharpened MS image and the LR MS image for further preserving image spatial structures and spectral information. Thus, the main novelty behind the proposed model is an optimizing mechanism by fully taking advantage of the spatial details and texture expressive power of the spatial fractional-order geometry prior as well as the spectral-spatial correlation preserving capacity of the low-rank prior. Finally, the proposed model can be implemented in an alternating direction method of multipliers framework, and thus, an efficient algorithm is presented. To verify the validity, the new proposed method is systematically compared with some state-of-the-art techniques using the Pleiades, GeoEye-1, QuickBird, and WorldView2 satellite data sets in the subjective, objective, and efficiency aspects. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the compared methods in terms of higher spatial and spectral qualities.

TI  - Quantifying Impacts of Land-Use/Cover Change on Urban Vegetation Gross Primary Production: A Case Study of Wuhan, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantified the impacts of land-use/cover change (LUCC) on gross primary production (GPP) during 2000-2013 in a typical densely urbanized Chinese city, Wuhan. GPP was estimated at 30-m spatial resolution using annual land cover maps, meteorological data of the baseline year, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which was generated with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) based on Landsat and MODIS images. The results showed that approximately 309.95 Gg C was lost over 13 years, which was mainly due to the conversion from cropland to built-up areas. The interannual variation of GPP was affected by the change of vegetation composition, especially the increasing relative fraction of forests. The loss of GPP due to the conversion from forest to cropland fluctuated through the study period, but showed a sharp decrease in 2007 and 2008. The gain of GPP due to the conversion from cropland to forest was low between 2001 and 2009, but increased dramatically between 2009 and 2013. The change rate map showed an increasing trend along the highways, and a decreasing trend around the metropolitan area and lakes. The results indicated that carbon consequences should be considered before land management policies are put forth.

TI  - Extraction of Collapsed Bridges Due to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake from Post-Event SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors onboard satellites can work under all weather and sunlight conditions, they are suitable for information gathering in emergency response after disasters occur. This study attempted to extract collapsed bridges in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, which was affected by more than 15-m high tsunamis due to the Mw 9.0 earthquake on March 11, 2011. First, the locations of the bridges were extracted using GIS data of roads and rivers. Then, we attempted to detect the collapsed or washed-away bridges using visual interpretation and thresholding methods. The threshold values on the SAR backscattering coefficients and the percentage of non-water regions were applied to the post-event high-resolution TerraSAR-X images. The results were compared with the optical images and damage investigation reports. The effective use of a single SAR intensity image in the extraction of collapsed bridges was demonstrated with a high overall accuracy of more than 90%.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Parametric Models for Estimating Directional Thermal Radiation from Simulation, Airborne, and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An appropriate model to correct thermal radiation anisotropy is important for the wide applications of land surface temperature (LST). This paper evaluated the performance of three published directional thermal radiationmodels-the Roujean-Lagouarde (RL) model, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model, and the Vinnikov model-at canopy and pixel scale using simulation, airborne, and satellite data. The results at canopy scale showed that (1) the three models could describe directional anisotropy well and the Vinnikov model performed the best, especially for erectophile canopy or low leaf area index (LAI); (2) the three models reached the highest fitting accuracy when the LAI varied from 1 to 2; and (3) the capabilities of the three models were all restricted by the hotspot effect, plant height, plant spacing, and three-dimensional structure. The analysis at pixel scale indicated a consistent result that the three models presented a stable effect both on verification and validation, but the Vinnikov model had the best ability in the erectophile canopy (savannas and grassland) and low LAI (barren or sparsely vegetated) areas. Therefore, the Vinnikov model was calibrated for different land cover types to instruct the angular correction of LST. Validation with the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD)-measured LST demonstrated that the root mean square (RMSE) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product could be decreased by 0.89 K after angular correction. In addition, the corrected LST showed better spatial uniformity and higher angular correlation.

TI  - Interferometric SAR Time Series Analysis for Ground Subsidence of the Abandoned Mining Area in North Peixian Using Sentinel-1A TOPS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Peixian mining area of China has rich coal resources, with total proven reserves of 2.37 billion tons. However, the underground coal mining activities have resulted in ground collapse, which has caused serious harm to the environment and threatened the lives and properties of local residents. In this study, 12 Sentinel-1A terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode acquisitions between 30 July 2015 and 13 May 2016 over the abandoned mining area in North Peixian were analyzed using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series method to detect the ground subsidence, with the maximum ground subsidence reaching 83 mm/a and an average value of about 12.7 mm/a. The subsidence results derived from the Sentinel-1A TOPS mode dataset were proven to be effective in investigating and monitoring the ground subsidence in the North Peixian mining area. Compared to the rapid deformation during the ongoing period of mining excavation, the ground subsides slowly in abandoned mining areas and shows a linear relationship with time over a relatively long period of time. Spatial correlation between the subsidence distribution and land cover was found, in that the magnitude of the subsidence in urban areas was smaller than that in rural areas, which is associated with the controlled coal mining activities under buildings, railways, and water bodies. The results demonstrate that Sentinel-1A TOPS SAR images can be used to effectively and accurately detect and monitor ground subsidence in a mining area, which is critically important when investigating land subsidence in a large-scale mining area.

TI  - Spectral and stratigraphic mapping of hydrated minerals associated with interior layered deposits near the southern wall of Melas Chasma, Mars
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Orbital remote sensing data acquired from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), in conjunction with other datasets, are used to perform detailed spectral and stratigraphic analyses over a portion of south Melas Chasma, Mars. The Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model is used to retrieve atmospherically corrected single scattering albedos from CRISM IMF data for mineral identification. A sequence of interbedded poly- and monohydrated sulfates associated with interior layered deposits (ILDs) is identified and mapped. Analyses from laboratory experiments and spectral unmixing of CRISM hyperspectral data support the hypothesis of precipitation and dehydration of multiple inputs of complex Mg-Ca-Fe-SO4-CI brines. In this scenario, the early precipitated Mg sulfates could dehydrate into monohydrated sulfate due to catalytic effects, and the later-precipitated Mg sulfates from the late-stage "clean" brine could terminate their dehydration at mid-degree of hydration to form a polyhydrated sulfate layer due to depletion of the catalytic species (e.g., Ca, Fe, and CI). Distinct jarosite-bearing units are identified stratigraphically above the hydrated sulfate deposits. These are hypothesized to have formed either by oxidation of a fluid containing Fe(II) and SO4, or by leaching of soluble phases from precursor intermixed jarosite-Mg sulfate units that may have formed during the later stages of deposition of the hydrated sulfate sequence. Results from stratigraphic analysis of the ILDs show that the layers have a consistent northward dip towards the interior of the Melas Chasma basin, a mean dip angle of similar to 6 degrees, and neighboring strata that are approximately parallel. These strata are interpreted as initially sub-horizontal layers of a subaqueous, sedimentary evaporite deposits that underwent post-depositional tilting from slumping into the Melas Chasma basin. The interbedded hydrated sulfate units and jarosite-bearing units, which have distinct stratigraphic relationships, are indicative of a complex sedimentary and aqueous history in south Melas Chasma.

TI  - Satellite-derived LAI products exhibit large discrepancies and can lead to substantial uncertainty in simulated carbon and water fluxes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the terrestrial carbon and water cycles is crucial for mitigation and adaptation for climate change. Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical parameter in process-based ecosystem models for simulating gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). The uncertainty in satellite-derived LAI products and their effects on the simulation of carbon and water fluxes at regional scales remain unclear. We evaluated three satellite-derived LAI products - MODIS (MCD15), GLASS, and Four-Scale Geometric Optical Model based LAI (FSGOM) over the period 2003-2012 using fine-resolution (30 m) LAI data and field LAI measurements. GLASS had higher accuracy than FSGOM and MCD15 for forests, while FSGOM had higher accuracy than MCD15 and GLASS for grasslands. The three LAI products differed in magnitude, spatial patterns, and trends in LAI. We then examined the resulting discrepancies in simulated annual GPP and ET over China using a process-based, diagnostic terrestrial biosphere model. Mean annual total GPP for China's terrestrial ecosystems based on GLASS (6.32 Pg C yr(-1)) and FSGOM (6.15 Pg C yr(-5)) was 22.5% and 19.2% higher than that based on MCD15 (5.16 Pg C yr(-1)), respectively. Annual GPP based on GLASS and MCD15 increased over larger fractions of China's vegetated area (15.9% and 17.3%, respectively) than that based on FSGOM (12.6%). National annual ET based on GLASS (379.9 mm yr(-1)) and FSGOM (374.4 mm yr(-1)) was 7.9% and 6.3% higher than that based on MCD15 (352.1 mm yr(-1)), respectively.(-)Simulated ET increased in larger fractions of the vegetated area for GLASS (5.7%) and MCD15 (5.8%) than for FSGOM (3.9%). Our study shows that there were large discrepancies in LAI among satellite-derived LAI products and the biases of the LAI products could lead to substantial uncertainties in simulated carbon and water fluxes.

TI  - A risk-based model for grassland management using MODIS data: The case of Gannan region, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The grassland classification management model is considered to be a sustainable approach for grassland resources use. However, it is difficult to accurately calculate the index of classification management of grasslands (ICG) due to high variability of grassland productivity and livestock prices. Inaccurate ICG indices may lead to adoption of unreliable grassland management strategies. To overcome the problem, this article introduces a risk based ICG model accounting for sheep prices, grassland productivity, and their variability. In this model, grassland forage dry biomass and coverage from 2001 to 2016 were estimated with enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of each pixel in MODIS using the power model and logarithmic model, respectively. A simple linear regression model was employed to estimate sheep prices. Finally, the ICG was estimated by variability of grassland productivity and sheep prices derived from the models. A test of the performance of the model showed that the area of conservative and moderately productive grassland predicted with the risk-based model fits very well with the observed area. This risk-based ICG model thus provides a reliable tool for classification management of grassland.

TI  - Oxyresveratrol prevents murine H22 hepatocellular carcinoma growth and lymph node metastasis via inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of oxyresveratrol (Oxyres) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. The MTT and Transwell assays were performed to investigate the effects of Oxyres on cell proliferation and migration of two HCC cell lines, QGY-7701 and SMMC-7721 cells. H22 cells were subcutaneously injected into hind foot pads of 70 male mice to establish a lymph node metastasis model. These mice were randomly divided into seven groups as follows, control group, HCC group, Oxyres 20 mg/kg group, Oxyres 40 mg/kg group, Oxyres 60 mg/kg group, Resveratrol (Res) group, and Adriamycin (ADM) group. Oxyres, Res, and ADM were intraperitoneally injected daily for consecutive 21 days. Tumors and popliteal lymph node were isolated and embedded for histology analysis. Expressions of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR3) in tumors were detected by immunohistocehmistry. Expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) were measured by Western blot. Oxyres significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of QGY-7701 and SMMC-7721 cells. Oxyres significantly inhibited tumor growth (p < 0.001) and metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes (70%) in a dose-dependent manner. Oxyres showed a similar inhibition rate as Res. Oxyres also significantly decreased micro-blood vessel density and micro-lymphatic vessel density in tumors (p < 0.05). Expressions of CD31, VEGFR3, and VEGF-C of tumors were also inhibited by Oxyres (p < 0.05). Oxyres exerts anti-tumor effects against HCC through inhibiting both angiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, which suggests Oxyres be a potential therapeutic agent.

TI  - Impact of Ice Cloud Microphysics on Satellite Cloud Retrievals and Broadband Flux Radiative Transfer Model Calculations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cloud particles exhibit a range of shapes and sizes affecting a cloud's single-scattering properties. Because they cannot be inferred from passive visible/infrared imager measurements, assumptions about the bulk single-scattering properties of ice clouds are fundamental to satellite cloud retrievals and broadband radiative flux calculations. To examine the sensitivity to ice particle model assumptions, three sets of models are used in satellite imager retrievals of ice cloud fraction, thermodynamic phase, optical depth, effective height, and particle size, and in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface broadband radiative flux calculations. The three ice particle models include smooth hexagonal ice columns (SMOOTH), roughened hexagonal ice columns, and a two-habit model (THM) comprising an ensemble of hexagonal columns and 20-element aggregates. While the choice of ice particle model has a negligible impact on daytime cloud fraction and thermodynamic phase, the global mean ice cloud optical depth retrieved from THM is smaller than from SMOOTH by 2.3 (28%), and the regional root-mean-square difference (RMSD) is 2.8 (32%). Effective radii derived from THM are 3.9 mu m (16%) smaller than SMOOTH values and the RMSD is 5.2 mu m (21%). In contrast, the regional RMSD in TOA and surface flux between THM and SMOOTH is only 1% in the shortwave and 0.3% in the longwave when a consistent ice particle model is assumed in the cloud property retrievals and forward radiative transfer model calculations. Consequently, radiative fluxes derived using a consistent ice particle model assumption throughout provide a more robust reference for climate model evaluation compared to ice cloud property retrievals.

TI  - Voice of the Clergy Wife: A Phenomenological Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PASTORAL CARE & COUNSELING
M3  - Article
AB  - The clergy wife is an understudied and silenced population. While the minister himself is well represented in the literature concerning burnout, psychological distress, and diminishing years of service, his wife remains unheard and desperate for her needs to be understood and addressed. The lived experience of nine Wesleyan pastors' wives was investigated using a qualitative methodology and phenomenological approach. Themes arose surrounding both protective factors (faith, calling, support) and stressors (performance expectations and loss of identity, loneliness, low income, sacrifice of time). The theoretical underpinnings of Kanter's (1977) Work-Family Agenda are applied in relation to the occupation of one family member affecting the entire family system. Kanter claims work and family as mutually exclusive entities is a myth. Her framework, including five concepts (rewards/resources, absorption, time/timing, occupational cultures/worldview, emotional climate), allowed for exploration of the results. Interestingly, the stressors in the role of pastor's wife far outweighed the protective factors; yet, clergy wives remain positive and even willing to continue apparent hardships. This is discussed and future research is suggested.

TI  - Innovative landslide susceptibility mapping supported by geomorphon and geographical detector methods
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are among the most common and dangerous natural hazards in mountainous regions that can cause damage to properties and loss of lives. Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a critical tool for preventing or mitigating the negative impacts of landslides. Although many previous studies have employed various statistical methods to produce quantitative maps of the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) based on inventories of past landslides and contributing factors, they are mostly ad hoc to a specific area and their success has been hindered by the lack of a methodology that could produce the right mapping units at proper scale and by the lack of a general framework for objectively accounting for the differing contribution of various preparatory factors. This paper addresses these issues by integrating the geomorphon and geographical detector methods into LSM to improve its performance. The geomorphon method, an innovative pattern recognition approach for identifying landform elements based on the line of sight concept, is adapted to delineate ridge lines and valley lines to form slope units at self-adjusted spatial scale suitable for LSM. The geographical detector method, a spatial variance analysis method, is integrated to objectively assign the weights of contributing factors for LSM. Applying the new integrated approach to I-Lan, Taiwan produced very significant improvement in LSI mapping performance than a previous model, especially in highly susceptible areas. The new method offers a general framework for better mapping landslide susceptibility and mitigating its negative impacts.

TI  - Post-Processing Approach for Refining Raw Land Cover Change Detection of Very High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, land cover change detection (LCCD) using very high-spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has been a major research topic. However, VHR remote sensing images usually lead to a large amount of noises in spectra, thereby reducing the reliability of the detected results. To solve this problem, this study proposes an object-based expectation maximization (OBEM) post-processing approach for enhancing raw LCCD results. OBEM defines a refinement of the labeling in a detected map to enhance its raw detection accuracies. Current mainstream change detection (preprocessing) techniques concentrate on proposing a change magnitude measurement or considering image spatial features to obtain a change detection map. The proposed OBEM approach is a new solution to enhance change detection accuracy by refining the raw result. Post-processing approaches can achieve competitive accuracies to the preprocessing methods, but in a direct and succinct manner. The proposed OBEM post-processing method synthetically considers multi-scale segmentation and expectation maximum algorithms to refine the raw change detection result. Then, the influence of the scale of segmentation on the LCCD accuracy of the proposed OBEM is investigated. Four pairs of remote sensing images, one of two pairs (aerial image with 0.5 m/pixel resolution) which depict two landslide sites on Landtau Island, Hong Kong, China, are used in the experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed approach is applied, and validated by two case studies, LCCD in Tianjin City China (SPOT-5 satellite image with 2.5 m/pixel resolution) and Mexico forest fire case (Landsat TM images with 30 m/pixel resolution), respectively. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed OBEM post-processing approach can achieve better performance and higher accuracies than several commonly used preprocessing methods. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this type of post-processing framework is first proposed here for the field of LCCD using VHR remote sensing images.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a substantial contributor to anthropogenic environmental change, and often occurs at a rapid pace that demands frequent and accurate monitoring. Time series of satellite imagery collected at fine spatial resolution using stable spectral bands over decades are most desirable for this purpose. In practice, however, temporal spectral variance arising from variations in atmospheric conditions, sensor calibration, cloud cover, and other factors complicates extraction of consistent information on changes in urban land cover. Moreover, the construction and application of effective training samples is time-consuming, especially at continental and global scales. Here, we propose a new framework for satellite-based mapping of urban areas based on transfer learning and deep learning techniques. We apply this method to Landsat observations collected during 1984-2016 and extract annual records of urban areas in four cities in the temperate zone (Beijing, New York, Melbourne, and Munich). The method is trained using observations of Beijing collected in 1999, and then used to map urban areas in all target cities for the entire 1984-2016 period. The method addresses two central challenges in long term detection of urban change: temporal spectral variance and a scarcity of training samples. First, we use a recurrent neural network to minimize seasonal urban spectral variance. Second, we introduce an automated transfer strategy to maximize information gain from limited training samples when applied to new target cities in similar climate zones. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved comparable or even better accuracy: the average change detection accuracy during 1984-2016 is 89% for Beijing, 94% for New York, 93% for Melbourne, and 89% for Munich, and the overall accuracy of single-year urban maps is approximately 96 +/- 3% among the four target cities. The results demonstrate the practical potential and suitability of the proposed framework. The method is a promising tool for detecting urban change in massive remote sensing data sets with limited training data.

TI  - Modeling variations in soil salinity in the oasis of Junggar Basin, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization leads to a significant degradation for oasis land. Variations in soil salinity are controlled by geologic, geomorphic, climatic, and hydrologic factors that are scale dependent. Many factors characterize soil salinity and its variations. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and correlation analysis are usually applied to examine the variations of soil salinity at different scales. However, few researches have been conducted on the modeling of these variations among different scales that requires further development and refinement. This paper investigates the potential of assessing scale-specific variations in soil salinity via EMD using 2 modeling approaches (random forest and linear models). The remotely sensed environmental factors including land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation, and digital elevation model products were used as inputs for the models. The Junggar Basin in Xinjiang Province of China was selected as study area because the oasis was quite typical in the whole country and even in mid-Asia. Soil salinity data and environmental factors were first decomposed using the EMD algorithm. Then, the decomposed components of the remotely sensed environmental factors were evaluated, and the most important components of each factor were selected to model the salinity variations that were represented by the decomposed components of soil salinity. The salinity variations estimated from the environmental factors were favorably consistent with the decomposed components of the soil salinity data, with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.24-0.52 and 0.73-0.98 for the linear and random forest models, respectively. In addition, land surface temperature and salinity were coupled well at the 326- and 334-km scale. Our results showed that reasonably accurate results can be obtained using the proposed approach.

TI  - A Human Settlement Composite Index (HSCI) Derived from Nighttime Luminosity Associated with Imperviousness and Vegetation Indexes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived nighttime light data have been increasingly used for studying urbanization and socioeconomic dynamics, because there are notable quantitative relationships between anthropogenic nocturnal radiance and the degree of human activity over time and space at different scales. When considering the visible impacts of saturation and over-glow effects from original nighttime light images, several composite indexes, which mainly include the introduction of vegetation index, have been studied to improve the application of nighttime light data for investigating the spatial patterns in human settlements. To overcome the shortcomings of previous composite indexes, especially in areas of highly intensified human activity, such as urban, non-man-made surfaces, and low density human activity, such as in rural residential sites, we propose a new human settlement composite index (HSCI). The establishment of this proposed HSCI is based on a combination of three different remote sensing datasets: nighttime light brightness (derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, DMSP), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS), and the percent impervious surface area (PISA, derived from the GlobeLand30 land cover and land use dataset produced from Landsat data). We defined the calculation of HSCI as the arithmetic mean of the normalized difference urban index and normalized difference imperviousness index with respect to both the magnitude of socioeconomic activity and the distribution of artificial surface across human settlement, respectively. Analysis results clearly demonstrate the utility of HSCI in delineating spatial patterns for different kinds of human settlement, particularly for identifying non-man-made surfaces in urbanized areas, various densities of human activities in peripheral areas and small human settlements in rural and remote areas. Our method and findings provide an effective way to investigate human settlements with a nighttime brightness-based composite index, as well as valuable insights into further studies of the composite index related to nocturnal luminosity data.

TI  - Tobacco and alcohol use disorders: Evaluating multimorbidity
T2  - ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing interest in applying the multimorbidity model for mental health disorders - i.e. the interactive effects of co-occurring diagnoses. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and tobacco use disorder (TUD) often occur together, but distinctive correlates of their co-occurrence have not been studied. Veterans treated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) nationally in FY 2012 with diagnoses of both AUD and TUD were compared to those with only AUD or only TUD on socio-environmental factors, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, and service use. Multimorbid effects were defined as those in which patients with both AUD and TUD had more serious problems greater likelihood of specific co-occurring conditions than those with either AUD alone or TUD alone. Veterans with concurrent AUD and TUD (N = 153,397), as compared to those with AUD only (N = 191,900) or with TUD only (N = 643,377), had significantly higher rates of homelessness [odd ratios (ORs) = 1.24, 1.68], hepatic disease (ORs = 1.11, 2.18), substance use disorders (ORs = 1.42, 3.14), receipt of a VA disability pension (ORs = 1.26, 1.30) and use of substance and mental health outpatient services (ORs = 1.04, 1.12). Veterans with AUD and TUD appear to have more severe problems in some, but not all, socio-environmental, medical, psychiatric, and service use domains than veterans with either of these diagnoses alone. The combination of AUD and TUD yield generally more adverse effects in diverse areas and thus reflect an emergent phenomenon that may a require a distinctive treatment approach.

TI  - Influence of Habitat Heterogeneity on Structure and Composition of a Chrysomelidae (Coleoptera) Assemblage in a Temperate Forest in Northeast Mexico
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbance in natural areas occurs as a result of various processes on various spatio-temporal scales, generating a heterogeneous mosaic of environmental characteristics. The effect of such change on diversity patterns has been explained by the hypothesis of habitat heterogeneity. Modifications in abiotic and biotic factors such as plant density influence the composition and structure of assemblages of phytophagous insects. Response of the leaf beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) assemblage to such changes was evaluated in an oak (Quercus spp.) forest in the Altas Cumbres Natural Protected Area, Victoria, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The delimited mosaic was classified into four categories according to the length of time since the last disturbance: 1 year, 10 years, 30 years, and 40 years. Disturbance time categories were delimited using remote sensing techniques from LANDSAT satellite scenes. Leaf beetles were sampled each month from February to April 2016 in 10 plots per category. The numbers of herbaceous and shrubby plants in each plot were counted with the aim of estimating the plant density of each category and relating values with differences among communities of Chrysomelidae. In total, 1,056 individuals of six subfamilies and 37 species were obtained, with Centralaphthona sp. 1 the most abundant. Thirteen species were specialists, while Helocassis crucipennis (Boheman, 1855) occurred in the most niches. Leaf beetles preferred high plant densities and were most abundant and had most species richness in the category of 10 years since the last disturbance. The community had aggregate spatial distribution that might reflect significant biological patterns. Alpha diversity indices indicated the 10-year category was most even, with Hypolampsis sp. 1 the dominant species. In contrast, least evenness was in the 1-year category where Centralaphthona sp. 1 was dominant; the species might indicate permanent disturbance. The community had low species turnover among the categories of disturbance and is therefore expected to have high gamma diversity. Inventory of the study area had 82.4% completeness; however, categories of 10 and 30 years required more sampling effort. Results supported the hypothesis of habitat heterogeneity, because observed community patterns did not occur by chance. This suggested that environmental heterogeneity because of disturbance positively influenced composition and community structure of Chrysomelidae, and observed patterns responded to intra- and interspecific interactions.

TI  - Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis of coherency matrix for wetland classification using Po1SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide a wide variety of environmental services globally and detailed wetland inventory maps are always necessary to determine the conservation strategies and effectively monitor these productive ecosystems. During the last two decades, satellite remote sensing data have been extensively used for wetland mapping and monitoring worldwide. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PoISAR) imagery is a complex and multi-dimensional data, which has high potential to discriminate different land cover types. However, despite significant improvements to both information content in PoISAR imagery and advanced classification approaches, wetland classification using PoISAR data may not provide acceptable classification accuracy. This is because classification accuracy using PoISAR imagery strongly depends on the polarimetric features that are incorporated into the classification scheme. In this paper, a novel feature weighting method for PoISAR imagery is proposed to increase the classification accuracy of complex land cover. Specifically, a new coefficient is determined for each element of the coherency matrix by integration of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and physical interpretation of the PoISAR data. The proposed methodology was applied to multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 data in the Avalon Peninsula, Deer Lake, and Gros Morne pilot sites in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Different combinations of input features, including original PoISAR features, polarimetric decomposition features, and modified coherency matrix were used to evaluate the capacity of the proposed method for improving the classification accuracy using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results demonstrated that the modified coherency matrix obtained by the proposed method, Van Zyl, and Freeman-Durden decomposition features were the most important features for wetland classification. The fine spatial resolution maps obtained in this study illustrate the distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the three wetland pilot sites in Newfoundland using the modified coherency matrix and other polarimetric features. The classified maps provide valuable baseline data for effectively monitoring climate and land cover changes, and support further scientific research in this area.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysing Land Use/Cover Changes in an Arid Region Based on Multi-Satellite Data: The Kashgar Region, Northwest China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid regions, oases ecosystems are fragile and sensitive to climate change, and water is the major limiting factor for environmental and socio-economic developments. Understanding the drivers of land use/cover change (LUCC) in arid regions is important for the development of management strategies to improve or prevent environmental deterioration and loss of natural resources. The Kashgar Region is the key research area in this study; it is a typical mountain-alluvial plain-oasis-desert ecosystem in an arid region, and is one of the largest oases in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. In addition, the Kashgar Region is an important cotton and grain production area. This study's main objectives are to quantify predominant LUCCs and identify their driving forces, based on the integration of multiple remote sensors and applications of environmental and socio-economic data. Results showed that LUCCs have been significant in the Kashgar Region during the last 42 years. Cultivated land and urban/built-up lands were the most changed land cover (LC), by 3.6% and 0.4% from 1972 to 10.2% and 3% in 2014, respectively. By contrast, water and forest areas declined. Grassland and snow-covered areas have fluctuated along with climate and human activities. Bare land was changed slightly from 1972 to 2014. According to the land use transfer matrix, cultivated land replaced grass-and forestland. Urban/built-up land mainly expanded over cultivated and bare land. LUCCs were triggered by the interplay of natural and social drivers. Increasing runoff, caused by regional climate changes in seasonal variation, and snow melt water, have provided water resources for LC changes. In the same way, population growth, changes in land tenure, and socio-economic development also induced LUCCs. However, expansion of cultivated land and urban/built-up land led to increased water consumption and stressed fragile water systems during on-going climate changes. Therefore, the selection of adaption strategies relating to climate change and oasis development is very important for sustainable development in the Kashgar Region.

TI  - Evaluating Efficacy of Landsat-Derived Environmental Covariates for Predicting Malaria Distribution in Rural Villages of Vhembe District, South Africa
T2  - ECOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria in South Africa is still a problem despite existing efforts to eradicate the disease. In the Vhembe District Municipality, malaria prevalence is still high, with a mean incidence rate of 328.2 per 100,0000 persons/year. This study aimed at evaluating environmental covariates, such as vegetation moisture and vegetation greenness, associated with malaria vector distribution for better predictability towards rapid and efficient disease management and control. The 2005 malaria incidence data combined with Landsat 5 ETM were used in this study. A total of nine remotely sensed covariates were derived, while pseudo-absences in the ratio of 1: 2 (presence/absence) were generated at buffer distances of 0.5-20 km from known presence locations. A stepwise logistic regression model was applied to analyse the spatial distribution of malaria in the area. A buffer distance of 10 km yielded the highest classification accuracy of 82% at a threshold of 0.9. This model was significant (q < 0.05) and yielded a deviance (D 2) of 36%. The significantly positive relationship (q < 0.05) between the soil-adjusted vegetation index and malaria distribution at all buffer distances suggests that malaria vector (Anopheles arabiensis) prefer productive and greener vegetation. The significant negative relationship between water/moisture index (a1 index) and malaria distribution in buffer distances of 0.5, 10, and 20 km suggest that malaria distribution increases with a decrease in shortwave reflectance signal. The study has shown that suitable habitats of malaria vectors are generally found within a radius of 10 km in semi-arid environments, and this insight can be useful to aid efforts aimed at putting in place evidence-based preventative measures against malaria infections. Furthermore, this result is important in understanding malaria dynamics under the current climate and environmental changes. The study has also demonstrated the use of Landsat data and the ability to extract environmental conditions which favour the distribution of malaria vector (An. arabiensis) such as the canopy moisture content in vegetation, which serves as a surrogate for rainfall.

TI  - Lithologic and structural mapping of the Abiete-Toko gold district in southern Cameroon, using Landsat 7 ETM+/SRTM
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The geology of the Abiete-Toko gold district in South Cameroon is investigated using a combination of Landsat 7 ETM+/SRTM image processing techniques, conventional geologic field mapping and geostatistical analysis. The satellite images were treated using Principal Component Analysis and Sobel filters to separate the background noise from lithotectonic structures which were matched with field data. The results show that this area has been affected by a polyphase deformation represented by S-1 foliation, S-c1 schistosity, L-1 lineation, S-2 foliation, F-2 folds, and F-3 shear zones and faults. A detailed analysis of all the structures led to the identification of two major networks of dextral and sinistral shear zones oriented WNW-ESE and NE-SW, respectively. These results may serve in mining prospection, especially in the search for tectonically controlled primary mineralization and so may significantly guide the exploration of primary gold mineralization in the Abiete-Toko area subjected to years of artisanal gold mining.

TI  - Intercalibration of Polar-Orbiting Spectral Radiometers Without Simultaneous Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new intercalibration method for two polarorbiting satellite instruments or two instrument constellations' Fundamental Climate Data Records (FCDRs) is presented. It is based on statistical fitting of reflectance data from the two instruments covering the same area during the same period, but not simultaneously. A Deming regression with iterative weights is used. The accuracy of the intercalibration method itself was better than 0.5% for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) versus MODIS and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) versus AVHRR test data sets. The intercalibration of an AVHRR FCDR generated by NOAA versus a combined MODIS Terra and Aqua data set of red and near-infrared (NIR) channels was carried out and showed a difference in the reflectance values of about 2% (red) and 6% (NIR). The presented intercalibration method can be used for checking the calibration of two instruments or FCDRs in all viewing angles used separately.

TI  - Modelling the area of occupancy of habitat types with remote sensing
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A current challenge of biodiversity and conservation is the estimation of the spatial extent of habitat types across broad territories. In the absence of fine-resolution maps, predictive modelling helps in assessing the spatial distribution of vegetation cover. However, such approaches are still uncommon in regional planning and management. Here, we present a framework for mapping the area of occupancy (AOO) of habitat types that allows highly suitable estimates at different scales. We model the potential AOO with abiotic variables related to topography and climate, resulting in broad AOO estimates that are subsequently downscaled to the local AOO with remote sensing. The combination of individual local AOO estimates allows the defining of the realized AOO, comprising locations with a high suitability and low uncertainty for each habitat. We applied this framework to mapping 24 protected habitat types of Natura 2000 sites in northern Spain.Local and realized AOO were highly accurate, with a 70% overall accuracy for the realized AOO. Remote sensing data, and especially LiDAR, were the most important predictors in habitat types related to forests and shrubs, followed by rock outcrops and pastures. Environmental variables were also relevant for specific habitats subject to abiotic constraints. The combination of ecological modelling with remote sensing offers multiple advantages over traditional field surveys and image interpretation, allowing the harmonization of habitat maps across large regions and through time. This is particularly useful for implementing conservation actions under Natura 2000 principles or assessing IUCN criteria for ecosystems.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change on Tibetan Lakes: Patterns and Processes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-altitude inland-drainage lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the earth's third pole, are very sensitive to climate change. Tibetan lakes are important natural resources with important religious, historical, and cultural significance. However, the spatial patterns and processes controlling the impacts of climate and associated changes on Tibetan lakes are largely unknown. This study used long time series and multi-temporal Landsat imagery to map the patterns of Tibetan lakes and glaciers in 1977, 1990, 2000, and 2014, and further to assess the spatiotemporal changes of lakes and glaciers in 17 TP watersheds between 1977 and 2014. Spatially variable changes in lake and glacier area as well as climatic factors were analyzed. We identified four modes of lake change in response to climate and associated changes. Lake expansion was predominantly attributed to increased precipitation and glacier melting, whereas lake shrinkage was a main consequence of a drier climate or permafrost degradation. These findings shed new light on the impacts of recent environmental changes on Tibetan lakes. They suggest that protecting these high-altitude lakes in the face of further environmental change will require spatially variable policies and management measures.

TI  - Simulating the characteristics of tropical cyclones over the South West Indian Ocean using a Stretched-Grid Global Climate Model
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of the most devastating natural phenomena. This study examines the capability of a global climate model with grid stretching (CAM-EULAG, hereafter CEU) in simulating the characteristics of TCs over the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO). In the study, CEU is applied with a variable increment global grid that has a fine horizontal grid resolution (0.5A degrees x 0.5A degrees) over the SWIO and coarser resolution (1A degrees x 1A degrees-2A degrees x 2.25A degrees) over the rest of the globe. The simulation is performed for the 11 years (1999-2010) and validated against the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) best track data, global precipitation climatology project (GPCP) satellite data, and ERA-Interim (ERAINT) reanalysis. CEU gives a realistic simulation of the SWIO climate and shows some skill in simulating the spatial distribution of TC genesis locations and tracks over the basin. However, there are some discrepancies between the observed and simulated climatic features over the Mozambique channel (MC). Over MC, CEU simulates a substantial cyclonic feature that produces a higher number of TC than observed. The dynamical structure and intensities of the CEU TCs compare well with observation, though the model struggles to produce TCs with a deep pressure centre as low as the observed. The reanalysis has the same problem. The model captures the monthly variation of TC occurrence well but struggles to reproduce the interannual variation. The results of this study have application in improving and adopting CEU for seasonal forecasting over the SWIO.

TI  - Retrieval of daily gross primary production over Europe and Africa from an ensemble of SEVIRI/MSG products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to derive a method for a daily gross primary production (GPP) product over Europe and Africa taking the full advantage of the SEVIRI/MSG satellite products from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) sensors delivered from the Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis (LSA SAF) system. Special attention is paid to model the daily GPP response from an optimized Montheith's light use efficiency model under dry conditions by controlling water shortage limitations from the actual evapotranspiration and the potential evapotranspiration (PET). The PET was parameterized using the mean daily air temperature at 2 m (T-a) from ERA-Interim data. The GPP product (MSG GPP) was produced for 2012 and assessed by direct site-level comparison with GPP from eddy covariance data (EC GPP). MSG GPP presents relative bias errors lower than 40% for the most forest vegetation types with a high agreement (r > 0.7) when compared with EC GPP. For drylands, MSG GPP reproduces the seasonal variations related to water limitation in a good agreement with site level GPP estimates (RMSE = 2.11 g M-2 day(-1); MBE = -0.63 g m(-2) day(-1)), especially for the dry season. A consistency analysis against other GPP satellite products (MOD17A2 and FLUXCOM) reveals a high consistency among products (RMSD < 1.5 g M-2 day-1) over Europe, North and South Africa. The major GPP disagreement arises over moist biomes in central Africa (RMSD > 3.0 g M-2 day(-1)) and over dry biomes with MSG GPP estimates lower than FLUXCOM (MBD up to -3.0 g M-2 day(-1)). This newly derived product has the potential for analysing spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of GPP at the MSG spatial resolutions on a daily basis allowing to better capture the GPP dynamics and magnitude.

TI  - Analysis of Flood Risk Due to Sea Level Rise in the Menor Sea (Murcia, Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the coastal vulnerability and flood risk due to sea level rise in the Menor Sea, Murcia (Spain). The vulnerability has been estimated from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite imagery using Remote Sensing techniques. The risk of coastal flooding was calculated based on various time scenarios (X-0-current, X-1-100 years, X-2-500 years, X-3-1000 years, X-4-Storm, X-5-Tsunami). Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing techniques were used to build a regional model to predict changes in the mean sea level for several future scenarios, showing susceptible areas to be flooded. We have included new parameters to the model such as swell, mareal range or neotectonic factors aiming to better adjust it to the local conditions. The results showed a high risk of flooding in the barrier beach and coastal areas of the Menor Sea, with a medium to very high degree of vulnerability for the most populated and touristic areas. The maximum and minimum expected increase of the water sheet for the 100 year scenarios ranged from +4.22 to +5.69 m. This methodology can establish sectors that need structural measures to minimize the impact of the sea level rise occurring due to natural tendency in the short or long term, as well as by extreme events such as storm surges or tsunamis. Furthermore, it can be used in other areas to assist land management decision makers to reduce or mitigate the vulnerability and risk presented against the rise of the sea level.

TI  - EFFECT OF SALVAGE LOGGING AND CHECK DAMS ON SIMULATED HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY IN A BURNED AREA
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the effect of a wildfire and different post-fire practices (salvage logging, skid trails and check dams) and vegetation recovery (eight scenarios) on the hydrological connectivity (HC) in 11 sub-catchments (SubCs; 330 ha) affected by a wildfire (213 ha) in 2012 in Spain. According to the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor images, moderate, high and extreme burn severity affected 42.1% of the area. HC was calculated with an updated version of the Borselli index. Within the burned area (BA), HC increased in all SubCs after the wildfire (PostF-1), the salvage logging and the new skid trails (PostF-2), and the development of new gullies (PostF-3). Check dams reduced connectivity but did not prevent the general trend. Afterwards, the incipient (PostF-4 and PostF-5) and future vegetation recovery made slightly decrease HC. In the three forestry SubCs with check dams and large BA (67% of the study area), connectivity markedly increased (11.4%, 18.2% and 22.9%) during the three first post-fire scenarios. In the three SubCs with urban areas and small BA (5%), HC decreased a little because the linear elements connected the hillslopes between them. In the three SubCs with urban areas and large BA (12%), HC increased less than in the forestry SubCs (3.0%, 8.2% and 9.1%). In the two forestry SubCs without check dams and small BA (16%), the increment of connectivity was low (2.5%, 4.6% and 6.3%). Monitoring of check-dam siltation and of the actual vegetation regrowth is necessary to minimize the off-site consequences of high HC. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Recognition of Thermal Hot and Cold Spots in Urban Areas in Support of Mitigation Plans to Counteract Overheating: Application for Athens
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigation plans to counteract overheating in urban areas need to be based on a thorough knowledge of the state of the thermal environment, most importantly on the presence of areas which consistently demonstrate higher or lower urban land surface temperatures (hereinafter referred to as "hot spots" or "cold spots", respectively). The main objective of this research study is to develop a methodological approach for the recognition of thermal "hot spots" and "cold spots" in urban areas during summer; this is accomplished with (a) the combined use of high and medium spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat 8 and Terra-MODIS, respectively); (b) the downscaling of the Terra-MODIS satellite data so as to acquire spatial resolution similar to the Landsat one and at the same time take advantage of the high revisit time as compared to the respective one of Landsat (16 days); and (c) the application of a statistical clustering technique to recognize "hot spots" and "cold spots". The methodological approach was applied as a case study for the urban area of Athens, Greece for a summer period. Results demonstrated the capacity of the methodological approach to recognize "hot spots" and "cold spots", revealed a strong relationship between land use and "hot spots" and "cold spots", and showed that the average land surface temperature (LST) difference between the "hot spots" and "cold spots" can reach 9.1 degrees K.

TI  - THE EVENKS OF WESTERN SIBERIA IN FICTIONALIZED JOURNALISM OF THE 20TH AND 21ST CENTURIES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fictionalized journalism is a historical and ethnographic source that can be fruitful but is difficult to analyze. Russian researchers agree that this source is especially important for ethnographers, since it reflects a specific everyday situation of a certain place and time. The main problem is the lack of methodology for verifying ethnographic data contained in such texts.In this regard, contemporary fictionalized journalism is of special interest because, thanks to the possibility of comparing historical and ethnographic facts set forth in journalistic works with field, archival and other data, we are able not only to assess reliability of a particular work, but also to try to develop general principles for using this type of sources. As a working hypothesis, it can be assumed that the reliability of ethnographic information contained in works of fictionalized journalism can be influenced by the following factors:- genre (fiction - sketch - memories);- possibility that authors are aware of ethnographic realities (they were born and/or lived for a long time in a region, or visited it from time to time);- professional training (the author is an ethnographer/historian, journalist/writer, just a witness);- time of writing, which determines the extent to which it is affected by the official ideology and worldview.The subject of the study is the Sym-Ket group of the Evenks (Tungus) who inhabited basins of the rivers Sym, Ket, Tym, Vasyugan and Chulym in the late 19th - early 21st centuries.Works by various authors of the 19th - 20th centuries who addressed the Evenks were analyzed. No direct connection between the reliability of historical and ethnographic facts presented in works, a genre chosen by authors, and the extent to which they were aware of ethnographic realities was revealed. Historical facts were most accurately reflected in sketches. However, interpretations of events were tied to the dominant ideology. Personality of characters and the overall environment were most accurately conveyed in memoirs and stories based on them, but names were almost always changed.Ethnographic facts were most adequately reflected in works of fiction dedicated to the "old times", but in this case much depended on author's honesty, as well as his/her objectives.The most reliable works dated back to the 1920s. Later, the image of the "Tungus" was becoming more and more conditional, evolving from the "builder of the bright future" in the 1930s-1950s, to the "noble savage" in the 1970s-1980s and the carrier of existential knowledge in first decade of the 21st century.Thus, fictionalized journalism can be used as an additional source on history and ethnography of indigenous peoples only with careful analysis of the author's general approach to presenting ethnographic data and in comparison with other types of sources (archival, field and other data).

TI  - [Reducing drug administration errors using "Do not disturb" tabards and signs].
T2  - Professioni infermieristiche
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: According to the report published by the Italian Ministry Health on sentinel events collected between 2005-2010, 873 events were reported, of which 4% (about 35) led to mortality, coma or serious functional disorders due to drug administration errors made by nurses. The link between interruptions and patient safety has been emphasized in the USA by the Institute of Medicine as a pivotal variable to improve the quality of nursing care. Airline companies have studied this problem since the 1960s, with a significant reduction of accidents.OBJECTIVE: This study emphasized that nurses who are never interrupted or distracted, by using 'Do not disturb' tabards and signs, reduce errors during the administration of drugs.METHODS: Quasi-experimental study on a convenience sample to explore the cause-effect relationship that reduces errors during drug administration by wearing a 'Do not disturb' tabard and signs. This study was conducted in 8 similar medicine and surgery units within 4 teaching hospitals in Rome. Of these 8 units, 4 were identified for the experimental group and 4 for the control group. Data were collected using the Medication Administration Distraction Observation Sheet tool. Data were analysed using SPSS 10.00 software.RESULTS: In the four hospitals that participated to the research were filled out 688 observational sheets, 356 (51,7%) for the control group and 332 (48,3%) for the experimental group. 132 were completed in the hospital 1, 143 in the hospital 2, 144 in the hospital 3 e 269 in the hospital 4. Analyzing the four hospitals, it emerged that in the experimental cohort some of the distractions calculated by the mean were lower compared with the control group (distractions by nurses and conversation). Yet, some distractions resulted greater in the experimental group respect to the control group (phone calls, other patients, external noise). At last, it did not emerge a significant difference in the distractions connected to variables such as: physicians, other personnel, visitors, and emergency situations.CONCLUSIONS: Distractions can lead to many errors throughout the drug administration phase. Wearing a high visibility vest while administering drugs proved to be very useful. However, this needs to be supported by effective teamwork, 'do not disturb' signs in all the workplace rooms, and by an education program that should not be limited only to those who administer drugs.
AB  - INTRODUZIONE: In Italia i dati pervenuti dallOsservatorio degli eventi sentinella tra il 2005 e il 2010 hanno descritto 873 eventi di cui il 4%, circa 35 casi, ha provocato morte, coma o gravi alterazioni funzionali per errori di somministrazione, dovuti allinfermiere. La connessione tra le interruzioni e la sicurezza dei pazienti sono state sottolineate negli Usa dallInstitute of Medicine come aspetto chiave per migliorare la sicurezza dellassistenza infermieristica. Le compagnie aeree studiano il problema gia dagli anni 60; cio ha ridotto notevolmente gli incidenti da distrazione.OBIETTIVO: Lipotesi dello studio e stata di dimostrare che gli infermieri che somministrano la terapia, se non vengono interrotti e in presenza di un abbigliamento dedicato ed una cartellonistica di non disturbo, riducono gli errori in fase di somministrazione dei farmaci.METODI: Studio quasi sperimentale con campione di convenienza diretto alla scoperta di relazioni causa-effetto che portano alla riduzione di errori in fase di somministrazione dei farmaci, attraverso un abbigliamento dedicato ed una cartellonistica di non disturbo. Lo studio e stato condotto in quattro ospedali di Roma con polo universitario associato. I dati sono stati raccolti con lo strumento (Medication Administration Distraction Observation Sheet).RISULTATI: Nei quattro ospedali che hanno partecipato allo studio sono state compilate 688 schede di osservazione delle distrazioni, 356 (51,7%) per il gruppo controllo e 332 (48,3%) per il gruppo sperimentale, di cui 132 nellospedale 1, 143 nellospedale 2, 144 nel terzo ospedale e 269 nellospedale 4. Analizzando i 4 ospedali emerge che nel gruppo sperimentale alcune delle distrazioni medie sono significativamente pio basse rispetto al gruppo controllo (distrazioni degli infermieri e conversazioni). Alcune distrazioni risultano, tuttavia, maggiori nel gruppo sperimentale rispetto al gruppo controllo (distrazione telefoniche, altri degenti, rumori). Infine, non emerge una differenza significativa nelle distrazioni dovute alle variabili: medici, altro personale, visite dei parenti e visitatori, prescrizioni ed emergenze.CONCLUSIONI: Le distrazioni degli infermieri possono causare molti errori durante tutta la fase di somministrazione dei farmaci. Lutilizzo della casacca ad alta visibilita per la somministrazione dei farmaci si e dimostrato utile. Tuttavia, deve essere supportato da un efficace lavoro in team, da una cartellonistica di non disturbo estesa a tutti gli ambienti di lavoro e da una formazione che non puo limitarsi al solo personale che somministra i farmaci.

TI  - The Dark Side of Light Traps
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-baited suction traps are one of the most widely used tools for vector surveillance. Their popularity stems from ease of use even in remote locations, range and abundance of species caught, and low cost. The availability of smaller, portable models, like the CDC miniature light trap, have further increased their ubiquity in entomological field studies. However, when researchers have looked, light trap collections are usually biased in ways that may affect data interpretation for epidemiological studies. If used alone, light traps may fail to collect important or infected vectors, and light traps are inefficient or ineffective when competing ambient light is present. In this article, we discuss these biases and limitations in terms of their effect on collection efficiency, population data, and pathogen detection. While light trap data certainly have a purpose, an over-reliance on light trapping risks drawing false conclusions about vector populations and vector-borne disease epidemiology. These concerns are especially troubling when light trap data are used to inform policy decisions meant to protect human and animal health. Particularly when a species' response to light is unknown or poorly characterized, light traps should be used in conjunction with supplemental sampling methods. Researchers conducting vector surveillance field studies should carefully consider their study design and objectives when deciding on a trapping method or methods, and specifically endeavor to understand the limitations of their data. Only then can researchers take advantage of the best attributes of light traps while avoiding their dark side.

TI  - Eliminating Preoperative Lymphoscintigraphy in Extremity Melanomas
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) is an imaging procedure routinely used to identify the draining nodal basin in melanomas. At our institute, we have traditionally performed preoperative LSG followed by intraoperative LSG for logistical and evaluative reasons. We sought to determine if preoperative LSG could be safely eliminated in the treatment of extremity melanomas, which exhibit consistent and predictable lymphatic drainage patterns.Methods: We reviewed the Yale Melanoma Registry 1308012545 for cutaneous extremity melanomas treated at our institution. From this registry, we calculated the incidence of atypical lymph node drainage patterns outside the axillary and inguinal regions. Based on these data, we eliminated preoperative LSG in 21 cases (8 upper extremities and 13 lower extremities). Additionally, we calculated the potential hospital charge reduction of forgoing preoperative LSG.Results: Upper and lower extremity melanomas treated at our institution exhibited atypical lymph node drainage at a rate of 3.4% and 2.0%, respectively. The sites of atypical drainage were to the epitrochlear and popliteal regions. In all 21 cases where preoperative LSG was eliminated, we were able to correctly identify the sentinel lymph node. The potential hospital charge reduction of forgoing preoperative LSG totaled $2,393.Conclusions: Preoperative LSG can be safely eliminated in the management of upper and lower extremity melanomas. Exceptions may be considered for primary lesions of the posterior calf, ankle, and heel as well as for patients with history of prior surgery or radiation. Forgoing preoperative LSG results in a hospital charge reduction of $2,393 and provides additional benefits to the patient. Ultimately, there is potential for significant charge reduction if applied across health care systems.

TI  - The shelf-life of airborne laser scanning data for enhancing forest inventory inferences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The term shelf-life is used to characterize the elapsed time beyond which a commodity loses its usefulness. The term is most often used with reference to foods and medicines, but herein it is used to characterize the elapsed time beyond which airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are no longer useful for enhancing inferences for forest inventory population parameters. National forest inventories (NFI) have a long history of using remotely sensed auxiliary information to enhance inferences. Although the combination of model-assisted estimators and ALS auxiliary data has been demonstrated to be particularly useful for this purpose, the expense associated with the acquisition of the ALS data has been an argument against their operational use. However, the longer the shelf-life of ALS data, the less the continuing acquisition costs and the greater the utility of the data.The objective of the study was to assess the shelf-life of ALS data for enhancing inferences in the form of confidence intervals for mean aboveground, live tree, stem biomass per unit area. Confidence intervals were constructed using both model-assisted estimators and post-stratified estimators, four measurements of mostly the same forest inventory plots at 5-year intervals over a 17-year period, and a single set of ALS data acquired near the end of the 17-year period. The study area in north central Minnesota in the USA was characterized by naturally regenerated, uneven-aged, mixed species stands on both lowland and upland sites. The primary conclusions were twofold. First, the shelf-life of ALS data when used with model-assisted estimators exceeded 10 years, and second, even for 12 years elapsed time between plot measurement and ALS data acquisition, the variance of the model-assisted estimator of the mean was smaller by a factor of at least 1.75 than the variance of the stratified estimator used by the national forest inventory.

AB  - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a form of hemolytic anemia in which red cells lysis occurs due to presence of an autoantibody. Association of AIHA is well known with lymphoproliferative disorders, especially with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, AIHA in association with Hodgkin's lymphoma is seen occasionally. Of the AIHA associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, most are of warm type or mixed type. Cold AIHA, as seen in our case, is very rare in Hodgkin's lymphoma.

TI  - Evaluating Eight Global Reanalysis Products for Atmospheric Correction of Thermal Infrared Sensor-Application to Landsat 8 TIRS10 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global reanalysis products have been widely used for correcting the atmospheric effects of thermal infrared data, but their performances have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this paper, we evaluate eight global reanalysis products (NCEP/FNL; NCEP/DOE Reanalysis2; MERRA-3; MERRA-6; MERRA2-3; MERRA2-6; JRA-55; and ERA-Interim) commonly used in the atmospheric correction of Landsat 8 TIRS10 data by referencing global radiosonde observations collected from 163 stations. The atmospheric parameters (atmospheric transmittance, upward radiance, and downward radiance) simulated with MERRA-6 and ERA-Interim were accurate than those simulated with other reanalysis products for different water vapor contents and surface elevations. When global reanalysis products were applied to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from simulated Landsat 8 TIRS10 data, ERA-Interim and MERRA-6 were accurate than other reanalysis products. The overall LST biases and RMSEs between the retrieved LSTs and LSTs that were used to generate the top-of-atmosphere radiances were less than 0.2 K and 1.09 K, respectively. When eight reanalysis products were used to estimate LSTs from thirty-two Landsat 8 TIRS10 images covering the Heihe River basin in China, the various reanalysis products showed similar validation accuracies for LSTs with low water vapor contents. The biases ranged from 0.07 K to 0.24 K, and the STDs (RMSEs) ranged from 1.93 K (1.93 K) to 2.02 K (2.04 K). Considering the above evaluation results, MERRA-6 and ERA-Interim are recommended for thermal infrared data atmospheric corrections.

TI  - Improving the Quality of Satellite Imagery Based on Ground-Truth Data from Rain Gauge Stations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal imagery is by and large geometrically and radiometrically accurate, but the residual noise arising from removal clouds and other atmospheric and electronic effects can produce outliers that must be mitigated to properly exploit the remote sensing information. In this study, we show how ground-truth data from rain gauge stations can improve the quality of satellite imagery. To this end, a simulation study is conducted wherein different sizes of outlier outbreaks are spread and randomly introduced in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the day and night land surface temperature (LST) of composite images from Navarre (Spain) between 2011 and 2015. To remove outliers, a new method called thin-plate splines with covariates (TpsWc) is proposed. This method consists of smoothing the median anomalies with a thin-plate spline model, whereby transformed ground-truth data are the external covariates of the model. The performance of the proposed method is measured with the square root of the mean square error (RMSE), calculated as the root of the pixel-by-pixel mean square differences between the original data and the predicted data with the TpsWc model and with a state-space model with and without covariates. The study shows that the use of ground-truth data reduces the RMSE in both the TpsWc model and the state-space model used for comparison purposes. The new method successfully removes the abnormal data while preserving the phenology of the raw data. The RMSE reduction percentage varies according to the derived variables (NDVI or LST), but reductions of up to 20% are achieved with the new proposal.

AB  - Men's mental health and how they think about their health are critical to the future of men's health. Poor health choice patterns are established under age 50 years, when men are twice more likely to die than women. As the future of medicine focuses on quality and value, a better understanding of the social determinants of men's health will identify areas for improvement. The presentation of a man with a sexual health complaint to a clinician's office presents an opportunity for more complete evaluation. The future of men's health will be well served by integrated men's health centers that focus on the entire man.

TI  - Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Winter Vegetation Quality Mapping via Multitemporal SAR Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping winter vegetation quality is a challenging problem in remote sensing. This is due to cloud coverage in winter periods, leading to a more intensive use of radar rather than optical images. The aim of this letter is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for winter vegetation quality mapping through the use of deep learning techniques. Analysis is carried out on a multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area around Charentes-Maritimes, France. This data set was processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from October 2016 to February 2017. Two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers were employed. Our work revealed that the results of the proposed RNN models clearly outperformed classical machine learning approaches (support vector machine and random forest).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates an approach for Land-Use Land-Cover classification (LULC) using multispectral satellite images. This proposed approach uses the Bagging Ensemble (BE) technique with Random Forest (RF) as a base classifier for improving classification performance by reducing errors and prediction variance. A pixel-based supervised classification technique with Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection from available attributes using a Landsat 8 image is developed. These attributes include coastal, visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared and thermal bands in addition to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The study is performed in a heterogeneous coastal area divided into five classes: water, vegetation, grass-lake-type, sand, and building. To evaluate the classification accuracy of BE with RF, it is compared to BE with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN) as base classifiers. The results are evaluated using the following output: commission, omission errors, and overall accuracy. The results showed that the proposed approach using BE with RF outperforms SVM and NN classifiers with 93.3% overall accuracy. The BE with SVM and NN classifiers yielded 92.6% and 92.1% overall accuracy, respectively. It is revealed that using BE with RF as a base classifier outperforms other base classifiers as SVM and NN. In addition, omission and commission errors were reduced by using BE with RF and NN classifiers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is an attempt to assess the spatial variability and the changes in the population of Prosopis cineraia (khejri) trees in the agroforestry systems of arid part of western Rajasthan. This tree is regarded as an important natural resource for the rural livelihood of desert dwellers because of its multifarious uses. The tree populations were mapped in a geographical information system using available information from aerial photographs, google earth images and IRS-LISS-III satellite images to compare their populations between the past and the very recent period. Mapping carried out in a part of Nagaur district in western part of Rajasthan, indicated increase in khejri trees in the region in 2013-2014 compared to 1960s. The number and tree density were higher under irrigated croplands than under rainfed. Increase in rainfall, multiple uses of the tree, societal and scientific support are the key reasons for the observed changes in their population.

TI  - Modeling Wildfire-Induced Permafrost Deformation in an Alaskan Boreal Forest Using InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The discontinuous permafrost zone is one of the world's most sensitive areas to climate change. Alaskan boreal forest is underlain by discontinuous permafrost, and wildfires are one of the most influential agents negatively impacting the condition of permafrost in the arctic region. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images, we mapped extensive permafrost degradation over interior Alaskan boreal forest in Yukon Flats, induced by the 2009 Big Creek wildfire. Our analyses showed that fire-induced permafrost degradation in the second post-fire thawing season contributed up to 20 cm of ground surface subsidence. We generated post-fire deformation time series and introduced a model that exploited the deformation time series to estimate fire-induced permafrost degradation and changes in active layer thickness. The model showed a wildfire-induced increase of up to 80 cm in active layer thickness in the second post-fire year due to pore-ice permafrost thawing. The model also showed up to 15 cm of permafrost degradation due to excess-ice thawing with little or no increase in active layer thickness. The uncertainties of the estimated change in active layer thickness and the thickness of thawed excess ice permafrost are 27.77 and 1.50 cm, respectively. Our results demonstrate that InSAR-derived deformation measurements along with physics models are capable of quantifying fire-induced permafrost degradation in Alaskan boreal forests underlain by discontinuous permafrost. Our results also have illustrated that fire-induced increase of active layer thickness and excess ice thawing contributed to ground surface subsidence.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing provides a unique capability for soil parameter retrievals. Therefore, various soil parameters estimation models have been developed using brightness temperature (BT) measured by passive microwave sensors. Due to the low resolution of satellite microwave radiometer data, the main goal of this study is to develop a downscaling approach to improve the spatial resolution of soil moisture estimates with the use of higher resolution visible/infrared sensor data. Accordingly, after the soil parameters have been obtained using Simultaneous Land Parameters Retrieval Model algorithm, the downscaling method has been applied to the soil moisture estimations that have been validated against in situ soil moisture data. Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS BT data in Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 region in the south and north of Oklahoma have been used to this end. Results illustrated that the soil moisture variability is effectively captured at 5 km spatial scales without a significant degradation of the accuracy.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increasing awareness of Indigenous legal traditions. Spurred in part by the work of Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics researching in this field of law and the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which speaks to the importance of recognizing, teaching, and operationalizing Indigenous legal traditions in many of their calls to action, such as Call to Action no. 27, 28, 42, and 50. As a result, Indigenous legal traditions are informing aspects of law school curricula and are being discussed and explored in professional legal training seminars. However, many questions remain as to the most appropriate manner in which to carry out this important work, lest it become yet another avenue of colonizing Indigenous peoples and their legal traditions. In this article, I hope to examine some of these issues with respect to Coast Salish laws and methodologyin particular, the legal tradition of the Hul'qumi'num Mustimuhw, the Island Hul'quminum' people of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. By exploring my own research journey, as a Hul'qumi'num Mustimuhw (Hul'qumi'num person), I demonstrate how methodology is the necessary starting point for any individual wishing to understand more fully how to engage in and with the Indigenous legal traditions. It provides an introduction to the worldview, legal institutions, skills and theories of Indigenous peoples, like the Island Hul'qumi'num People. Each legal traditionIndigenous and non-Indigenousis complex and must be learned and practised within its proper context over many life times to facilitate social order. One of the goals of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to bring about a greater recognition of Indigenous legal traditions and engage with Indigenous laws, according to their own research methodologies; it is one of the first steps forward.

TI  - Using Multispectral Airborne LiDAR Data for Land/Water Discrimination: A Case Study at Lake Ontario, Canada
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas are environmentally sensitive and are affected by nature events and human activities. Land/water interaction in coastal areas changes over time and, therefore, requires accurate detection and frequent monitoring. Multispectral Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems, which operate at different wavelengths, have become available. This new technology can provide an effective and accurate solution for the determination of the land/water interface. In this context, we aim to investigate a set of point features based on elevation, intensity, and geometry for this application, followed by a presentation of an unsupervised land/water discrimination method based on seeded region growing algorithm. The multispectral airborne LiDAR sensor, the Optech Titan, was used to acquire LiDAR data at three wavelengths (1550, 1064, and 532 nm) of a study area covering part of Lake Ontario in Scarborough, Canada for testing the discrimination methods. The elevationand geometry- based features achieved an average overall accuracy of 75.1% and 74.2%, respectively, while the intensity- based features achieved 63.9% accuracy. The region growing method succeeded in discriminating water from land with more than 99% overall accuracy, and the land/water boundary was delineated with an average root mean square error of 0.51 m. The automation of this method is restricted by having double returns from water bodies at the 532 nm wavelength.

TI  - A new top-down approach for directly estimating biomass burning emissions and fuel consumption rates and totals from geostationary satellite fire radiative power (FRP)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional to global-scale biomass burning emissions inventories are primarily based on satellite-derived bumed area or fire radiative power (FRP), and most rely on conversions to fuel consumption prior to the emissions estimation stage. This is generally considered the step introducing greatest uncertainty, and some apparently discrete inventories are not fully independent, as they have been cross-calibrated to aid this stage. We present a novel emissions inventory approach that bypasses the fuel consumption step, directly linking geostationary FRP measures to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM), via coefficients derived from observations of smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). The approach is fully top-down', being based on spacebome observations alone, is performed at or close to the FRP data's original pixel resolution, and avoids the need to assume or model fuel consumption per unit area prior to the emissions calculation. Rates and totals of trace gas and carbon emission can be inferred from the TPM fluxes, and in combination with satellite burned area (BA) products the approach provides an innovative top down approach to mapping fuel consumption per unit area (kgm(-2)) as a last step in the calculation. Using this innovative methodology, which we term 'FREemissions' (FREM), we generate a 2004-2012 fire emissions inventory for southern Africa, based on Meteosat FRP-PIXEL data. We find basic annual average TPM emissions 45% higher than the widely used GFASv1.2 inventory, with our higher totals in line with independent assessments that necessitate a significant upscaling of GFAS TPM emissions to match observed AODs. Our estimates are also 12% higher than GFEDv4.1s, which already includes a substantial upward adjustment for fires too small to be detected by the MODIS MCD64A1 BA product. If we adjust the FREM-derived emissions for SEVIRI's inability to detect the lower FRP component of the regions fire regime then the differences between FREM and GFAS/GFED grow further, to a mean of 64% with respect to GFED4.1s TPM emissions for example. These upwardly adjusted FREM estimates agree very well with FEER, an FRP- and AOD-based inventory driven by polar-orbiting MODIS FRP 'snapshots' rather than geostationary observations. Similarly higher totals are seen for FREM's fire-emitted trace gases, derived using the emission factor ratios of gases to particulates. Our exploitation of geostationary FRP requires fewer assumptions than use of polar orbiter FRP measures, avoids biases coming from incomplete sampling of the fire diurnal cycle, and enables the FREM approach to provide fire emissions and fuel consumption estimates at a higher spatio-temporal resolution than any inventory currently available (e.g. 0.05 degrees and hourly averages or better), including per km(2) of area burned. The approach offers great potential to generate very high resolution fire emissions datasets for the tropics, sub-tropics and potentially temperate zones, with updates available in near real-time from the global suite of geostationary meteorological satellites operated by organisations such as EUMETSAT (Meteosat), NOAA (GOES) and JMA (Himawari).

TI  - Mesoscale Simulations of Australian Direct Normal Irradiance, Featuring an Extreme Dust Event
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Direct normal irradiance (DNI) is the main input for concentrating solar power (CSP) technologiesan important component in future energy scenarios. DNI forecast accuracy is sensitive to radiative transfer schemes (RTSs) and microphysics in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Additionally, NWP models have large regional aerosol uncertainties. Dust aerosols can significantly attenuate DNI in extreme cases, with marked consequences for applications such as CSP. To date, studies have not compared the skill of different physical parameterization schemes for predicting hourly DNI under varying aerosol conditions over Australia. The authors address this gap by aiming to provide the first Weather and Forecasting (WRF) Model DNI benchmarks for Australia as baselines for assessing future aerosol-assimilated models. Annual and day-ahead simulations against ground measurements at selected sites focusing on an extreme dust event are run. Model biases are assessed for five shortwave RTSs at 30- and 10-km grid resolutions, along with the Thompson aerosol-aware scheme in three different microphysics configurations: no aerosols, fixed optical properties, and monthly climatologies. From the annual simulation, the best schemes were the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for global climate models (RRTMG), followed by the new Goddard and Dudhia schemes, despite the relative simplicity of the latter. These top three RTSs all had 1.4-70.8 W m(-2) lower mean absolute error than persistence. RRTMG with monthly aerosol climatologies was the best combination. The extreme dust event had large DNI mean bias overpredictions (up to 4.6 times), compared to background aerosol results. Dust storm-aware DNI forecasts could benefit from RRTMG with high-resolution aerosol inputs.

TI  - Particle Swarm Optimization for Object-Based Feature Selection of VHSR Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the advent of very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery, object-based classification (OBC) has attracted a great deal of attention in the remote sensing community. However, due to the numerous spectral, textural, and structural features which can be extracted for each object, feature selection is needed to address the curse-of-dimensionality issue. In this letter, a new wrapper object-based feature (OBF) selection method was applied in order to select the best combination of spectral, textural, and structural OBFs. In the first step, the image is segmented into objects using the multiresolution segmentation method. Subsequently, OBFs are extracted for each object. Last, optimal OBFs are selected using the proposed method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with the minimum distance classifier. Two VHSR remotely sensed images, acquired by a WorldView-2 sensor, were used to test the proposed method. The results of the experiment indicated that OBC using optimal OBFs led to significant improvement over the case where all extracted features were used. Furthermore, PSO has a better performance than do the three metaheuristic optimization algorithms: genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony, and honey-bee mating, according to the technique of order of preference by similarity to ideal solution analysis.

TI  - Visualization of murine lymph vessels using photoacoustic imaging with contrast agents
T2  - PHOTOACOUSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis frequently occurs even in the early stage of breast cancer. This research studied the feasibility of using photoacoustic (PA) imaging for identifying metastasis in the lymph vessels of mice. The photoacoustic efficiency of various contrast agents was investigated, and the influence of scattered light was evaluated by using a lymph vessel phantom. The lymph vessels of mice were then visualized using the selected contrast agents: indocyanine green (ICG) and gold nanorods (AuNR). The attenuation of the PA imaging was -1.90 dB/mm, whereas that of the fluorescence imaging was -4.45 dB/mm. The results indicate the potential of identifying sentinel lymph nodes by using PA imaging with these contrast agents. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Northern tamarisk beetle (<i>Diorhabda carinulata</i>) and tamarisk (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.) interactions in the Colorado River basin
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern tamarisk beetles (Diorhabda carinulata) were released in the Upper Colorado River Basin in the United States in 2004-2007 to defoliate introduced tamarisk shrubs (Tamarix spp.) in the region's riparian zones. The primary purpose was to control the invasive shrub and reduce evapotranspiration (ET) by tamarisk in an attempt to increase stream flows. We evaluated beetle-tamarisk interactions with MODIS and Landsat imagery on 13 river systems, with vegetation indices used as indicators of the extent of defoliation and ET. Beetles are widespread and exhibit a pattern of colonize-defoliate-emigrate, so that riparian zones contain a mosaic of completely defoliated, partially defoliated, and refoliated tamarisk stands. Based on satellite data and ET algorithms, mean ET before beetle release (2000-2006) was 416 mm/year compared to postrelease (2007-2015) ET of 355 mm/year (p < 0.05) for a net reduction of 61 mm/year. This is lower than initial literature projections that ET would be reduced by 300-460 mm/year. Reasons for the lower-than-expected ET reductions are because baseline ET rates are lower than initially projected, and percentage ET reduction is low because tamarisk stands tend to regrow new leaves after defoliation and other plants help maintain canopy cover. Overall reductions in tamarisk green foliage during the study are 21%. However, ET in the Upper Basin has shown a steady decline since 2007 and equilibrium has not yet been reached. Defoliation is now proceeding from the Upper Basin into the Lower Basin at a rate of 40 km/year, much faster than initially projected.

TI  - Clinical impact of ulceration width, lymphovascular invasion, microscopic satellitosis, perineural invasion, and mitotic rate in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma: a retrospective observational study at a comprehensive cancer center
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The prognostic significance of the width of the ulceration in primary melanomas remains unclear, and there is a relative paucity of data for lymphovascular invasion (LVI), microscopic satellitosis (MS), perineural invasion (PNI), and mitotic rate when compared with other pathological elements currently required for reporting. To evaluate the prognostic importance of the ulceration width and other important pathologic measurements, a single-institutional retrospective study was conducted using records of cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2003 and 2008. We identified 1898 eligible patients with median tumor thickness of 1.25 mm and median follow-up of 6.7 years. By multivariable analyses, the strongest risk factor for SLN positivity was high tumor thickness followed by the presence of LVI. The pathologic measures with the strongest influence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) were tumor thickness and positive SLN status. Ulceration width and presence of MS were also significantly associated with RFS while PNI was not. Factors with the strongest influence on melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were positive SLN status and mitotic rate. In conclusion, SLN biopsy should probably be offered if the primary tumor has LVI. MS is an adverse prognostic factor for RFS, but its influence on outcome is modest. Ulceration width predicts RFS but loses its independent prognostic significance for MSS when adjusting for currently used clinicopathological factors. In view of its impact on MSS, mitotic rate should be recorded for cutaneous invasive melanomas across all T categories.

TI  - Impact of Biopsy Modality on the Management of Cutaneous Melanoma of the Head and Neck
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to examine how biopsy modality affects the treatment course and outcomes of patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck. Specifically, we investigated if partial biopsy techniques are associated with positive margins on definitive wide local excision (DWLE), the need for early reoperation to obtain adequate margins or sentinel lymph node biopsy, and survival.Study Design Retrospective case series.Setting Tertiary care academic center.Subjects and Methods Subjects (N = 170) included all patients who were surgically treated for primary cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck at the University of Missouri-Columbia between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015. For analysis, patients were divided into 4 groups based on biopsy modality: shave (n = 61), excisional (n = 62), punch (n = 33), and incisional (n = 14).Results The shave biopsy group (P = .0324) and the punch biopsy group (P = .0479) were significantly more likely to have positive margins on DWLE. The shave biopsy group (P = .0042) and the punch biopsy group (P = .0479) were also significantly more likely to need early reoperation. The mean number of sentinel nodes and incidence of positive sentinel nodes detected on pathologic examination did not differ significantly across biopsy modality (P = .3600). Overall survival (P = .4605) and disease-free survival (P = .5011) did not differ significantly among the groups.Conclusions Patients diagnosed with shave and punch biopsy techniques are significantly more likely to have positive margins after DWLE and more frequently require early reoperation. Biopsy modality does not appear to influence the number of sentinel nodes detected, the incidence of detecting regional metastases in sentinel nodes, the overall survival, or the disease-free survival.

TI  - Evaluation of the diagnostic value of preoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging in penile carcinoma patients without palpable inguinal lymph nodes via single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) as compared to planar scintigraphy
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy represents a well-established diagnostic tool for the assessment of lymphatic metastasis. Correct pre-and intraoperative visualization of SLN is of the utmost importance to ensure the safety and feasibility of the procedure. Aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of preoperative SLN imaging via single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and planar scintigraphy in patients with penile carcinoma with nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes.Materials and methods: After peritumoral intradermal tracer injection (150 MBq/4.05 mCi Tc-99m nanocolloid), we acquired planar scintigraphies including indirect body contouring using a twin head gamma camera. Subsequently we acquired SPECT/CT images of the abdomen via a hybrid system. Prospective evaluation of 52 groins in 26 examined patients was done for all image files obtained with both techniques by 2 trained experts in consensual assessment.Results: A total of 71 SLNs in 37 groins were identified by means of planar scintigraphy. In these images, no radiolabeled lymph nodes were visualized in 15 out of 52 groins (28.8%). The SPECT/CT images showed a total of 82 SLNs in 42 groins. In 19.2% (10 of the 52 groins), there was no visualization of lymph nodes in SPECT/CT. 8 SLNs in 7 groins that were visualized in the planar technique were found to be false positive by SPECT/CT. In total, 19 SLNs in 16 groins that were overlooked by planar imaging could only be detected by SPECT/CT. In contrast to planar scintigraphy, SPECT/CT imaging enabled clear and precise anatomical localization of SLNs in all 42 groins where radiolabeled SLNs were visible. Even under consideration of all lymphatic drainage regions, statistical evaluation showed a significantly higher number of detected SLNs with SPECT/CT in comparison to the planar technique (P = 0.0022).Conclusion: In these patients SPECT/CT is capable of visualizing SLNs that cannot be detected with planar imaging. The SPECT/CT technique reduces the number of false positive findings from planar SLN imaging and is able to show anatomic SLN localization more precisely. If possible, preoperative SLN imaging should be performed by means of the SPECT/CT technique in patients with this tumor entity. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ground Deformations around the Toktogul Reservoir, Kyrgyzstan, from Envisat ASAR and Sentinel-1 Data-A Case Study about the Impact of Atmospheric Corrections on InSAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present ground deformations in response to water level variations at the Toktogul Reservoir, located in Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. Ground deformations were measured by Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Sentinel-1 Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) imagery covering the time periods 2004-2009 and 2014-2016, respectively. The net reservoir water level, as measured by satellite radar altimetry, decreased approximately 60m (similar to 13.5km(3)) from 2004-2009, whereas, for 2014-2016, the net water level increased by approximately 51m (similar to 11.2km(3)). The individual Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) interferograms were heavily influenced by atmospheric effects that needed to be minimized prior to the time-series analysis. We tested several approaches including corrections based on global numerical weather model data, such as the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational forecast data, the ERA-5 reanalysis, and the ERA-Interim reanalysis, as well as phase-based methods, such as calculating a simple linear dependency on the elevation or the more sophisticated power-law approach. Our findings suggest that, for the high-mountain Toktogul area, the power-law correction performs the best. Envisat descending time series for the period of water recession reveal mean line-of-sight (LOS) uplift rates of 7.8mm/yr on the northern shore of the Toktogul Reservoir close to the Toktogul city area. For the same area, Sentinel-1 ascending and descending time series consistently show a subsidence behaviour due to the replenishing of the water reservoir, which includes intra-annual LOS variations on the order of 30mm. A decomposition of the LOS deformation rates of both Sentinel-1 orbits revealed mean vertical subsidence rates of 25 mm/yr for the common time period of March 2015-November 2016, which is in very good agreement with the results derived from elastic modelling based on the TEA12 Earth model.

TI  - Comparison of hyperspectral transformation accuracies of multispectral Landsat TM, ETM plus , OLI and EO-1 ALI images for detecting minerals in a geothermal prospect area
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing generally provides more detailed spectral information and greater accuracy than multispectral remote sensing for identification of surface materials. However, there have been no hyperspectral imagers that cover the entire Earth surface. This lack points to a need for producing pseudo-hyperspectral imagery by hyperspectral transformation from multispectral images. We have recently developed such a method, a Pseudo-Hyperspectral Image Transformation Algorithm (PHITA), which transforms Landsat 7 ETM+ images into pseudo-EO-1 Hyperion images using multiple linear regression models of ETM+ and Hyperion band reflectance data. This study extends the PHITA to transform TM, OLI, and EO-1 ALI sensor images into pseudo-Hyperion images. By choosing a part of the Fish Lake Valley geothermal prospect area in the western United States for study, the pseudo-Hyperion images produced from the TM, ETM+, OLI, and ALI images by PHITA were confirmed to be applicable to mineral mapping. Using a reference map as the truth, three main minerals (muscovite and chlorite mixture, opal, and calcite) were identified with high overall accuracies from the pseudo-images (>95% and >42% for excluding and including unclassified pixels, respectively). The highest accuracy was obtained from the ALI image, followed by ETM+, TM, and OLI images in descending order. The TM, OLI, and ALI images can be alternatives to ETM+ imagery for the hyperspectral transformation that aids the production of pseudo-Hyperion images for areas without high-quality ETM+ images because of scan line corrector failure, and for long-term global monitoring of land surfaces.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Pattern Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on MODIS AOD and Meteorological Data Using the Back Propagation Neural Network
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the economic growth and increasing urbanization in the last three decades, the air quality over China has continuously degraded, which poses a great threat to human health. The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) directly affects the mortality of people living in the polluted areas where air quality is poor. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the well organized urban regions in northern China, has suffered with poor air quality and atmospheric pollution due to recent growth of the industrial sector and vehicle emissions. In the present study, we used the back propagation neural network model approach to estimate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration in the BTH region for the period January 2014-December 2016, combining the satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (S-DAOD) and meteorological data. The results were validated using the ground PM2.5 data. The general method including all PM2.5 training data and 10-fold cross-method have been used for validation for PM2.5 estimation (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 20.99 for general validation; R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 24.13 for cross-method validation). The study provides a new approach to monitoring the distribution of PM2.5 concentration. The results discussed in the present paper will be of great help to government agencies in developing and implementing environmental conservation policy.

TI  - Combined Use of Remote Sensing Data, Mineralogical Analyses, Microstructure Studies and Geographic Information System for Geological Mapping of Antiparos Island (Greece)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the combined use of field mapping, remote sensing data analysis, mineralogy, spectroscopy and GIS techniques for the geological mapping of Antiparos Island. Antiparos is part of the Cyclades Blueschist Belt located in central Aegean, where gneisses, schists and Pliocene volcanic rocks occurred. During the extended field work, a number of volcanic rock samples were collected from the southern part of Antiparos. The sampling strategy was to collect samples from the primary as well as the altered rocks in specific areas in which they were previously located from the remote sensing data processing. In this study, high resolution satellite images have been carried out in order to detect, allocate and separate the different geological formations. Furthermore, the existing geological map was georeferenced and all the tectonic lines and boundaries were digitized. All these features were implemented in a Mobile Mapper CE GPS using Arcpad GIS and checked in situ. The collected samples were analyzed in the laboratory using various techniques including XRD, Petrographic Microscopy and SEM. The qualitative mineralogical analyses were conducted by using XRD. The study was supplemented by the petrographic observations providing a detailed characterization of rock textures. In addition, SEM study and SEM- EDS analyses of the samples were emphasized on the genetic relations of the minerals. The laboratory results revealed that specific corrections should be made in the previous geological map of Antiparos concerning the volcanic rocks, especially at the southern part of the island. A significant conclusion is that the rock described as volcanic in the previous map proved to be a fossiliferous limestone which includes micritic matrix of calcite with an insignificant amount of fossils. All the analogical and digital data and the results of the petrographic analysis were imported in a geodatabase specially designed for geological data. After the necessary topological control and corrections, the data were unified and processed in order to create the final layout at 1/25.000 scale.

TI  - Investigation of RS and GIS techniques on MPSIAC model to estimate soil erosion
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion due to surface water is a standout among the serious threat land degradation problem and an hazard environmental destruction. The first stage for every kind of soil conservation planning is recognition of soil erosion status. In this research, the usability of two new techniques remote sensing and geographical information system was assessed to estimate the average annual specific sediments production and the intensity erosion map at two sub-basins of DEZ watershed, southwest of Lorestan Province, Iran, namely Absorkh and Keshvar sub-basins with 19,920 ha, using Modified Pacific Southwest Inter-Agency Committee (MPSIAC) soil erosion model. At the stage of imagery data processing of IRS-P6 satellite, the result showed that an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 90.3% and 0.901, respectively, which were considered acceptable or good for imagery data. According to our investigation, the study area can be categorized into three level of severity of erosion: moderate, high, and very high erosion zones. The amount of specific sediments and soil erosion predicted by MPSIAC model was 1374.656 and 2396.574 m(3) km(-2) year(-1), respectively. The areas situated at the center and south parts of the watershed were subjected to significant erosion because of the geology formation and ground cover, while the area at the north parts was relatively less eroded due to intensive land cover. Based on effective of nine factors, the driving factors from high to low impact included: Topography > Land use > Upland erosion > Channel erosion > Climate > Ground cover > Soil > Runoff > Surface geology. The measured sediment yield of the watershed in the hydrometric station (Keshvar station) was approximately 2223.178 m(3) km(-2) year(-1) and comparison of the amount of total sediment yield predicted by model with the measured sediment yield indicated that the MPSIAC model 38% underestimated the observed value of the watershed.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Properties Based on Soil Colour Index
T2  - Agriculturae Conspectus Scientificus
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on soil properties is an important aspect in the implementation of precision agriculture. For this study was used an image taken by Sentinel 2 depicting fields of one farm with 8,261 ha in the South Moravian region of the Czech Republic.For the determination of soil properties, soil samples were taken at a density of 1 sample per 3 hectares and analyzed by Mehlich III methodology. The content of available nutrients phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium have been determined together with soil pH, soil texture and sand. The specified sampling revealed high variability for phosphorus, potassium and calcium. Lower variability has been observed with magnesium and pH. An identification of bare soil area without vegetation cover was tested by different threshold values of Normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) (0.15 - 0.3).The correlations between the multispectral bands and the soil properties were weak. In the analysis of soil samples was detected positive correlation (r = 0.505) between soil texture and Colour Index (CI). In area was found a negative correlation between CI and Ca (r = - 0.618), then between CI and pH (r = - 0.504). Weak correlation were found between CI, phosphorus and magnesium. At the level of lower NDVI values (0.16 - 0.15) we found correlation between CI and the sand content.The observed level of correlation found in the data of remote sensing can predict some soil properties in fields that have not been subjected to soil sampling and facilitate learning about soil properties for decisions in precision agriculture.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma is a serious disease, the incidence of which rises. Since the most important treatment method is sufficient wide skin and subcutaneous tissue excision, plastic surgeon is often the only specialist who is able to close the resulting defect. This paper deals with recommendations and treatment options for malignant melanoma from the point of a plastic surgeon. The primary width of excised safety rim of healthy tissue with regards to the depth of melanoma invasion differs. Safety margin is 0.5 cm for melanoma in situ, 1 cm in Breslow up to 2 mm and 2 cm in Breslow over 2 mm. Furthermore, there is indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy, which should be performed in melanoma with Breslow over 1 mm, and in risky melanoma in Breslow above 0.75 mm. Every patient with stage IIB malignant melanoma and above according to TNM classification should undergo adjuvant therapy in a specialized centre. Ideal condition for the patient is a permanent and close cooperation between a dermatologist, oncologist and plastic surgeon, who supplement each other in diagnostics, therapy and follow up of the patients.

M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of the linguoculturological competence is the topical issue in the modern linguomethodical science. In the course of learning, development and education of the school student the role of Russian language as the worldview subject providing the unity and interaction of language, culture and the personality is indisputable. Russian language learning is built with account of the establishing in the linguodidatics of culture-studying approach which allows solving problems of the formation of skills of communication, of the actualization of the meaning-formative, reflexive and other functions of students. In the article the authors study main selection criteria of the learning content at formation of linguoculturological competence of pupils. According to the research authors' opinion studied in the article selection criteria of the learning material allow defining the character of the didactic material - special texts reflecting history of language and culture. The author's come to the conclusion that the formation of the linguoculturological competence of the students considers as well the formation of the world picture which is usually regarded as the education belonging to human consciousness and the way of the perception of the surrounding world. Besides, the author's of the article think that for the formation of linguoculturological competence of pupils it is necessary to use the means of cross-cultural communication: development of speech etiquette, national stereotypes of speech behavior, language units with a national and cultural component of semantics as the sources of extralinguistic information in course of the dialogue of the native and studied languages and cultures.

AB  - This article is devoted to the colour picture of the world of O.E. Mandelstam representing the individual poet's idea of the colour through the system of colour meanings. The analysis of the language expression of the poet's colour attitude is carried out on the example of the colouratives of black tone which are dominant in his lyric poetry.The analysed ways of the verbalization of author's meanings at the level of contact and distant connections allow revealing cognitive, mental and emotional spheres of the consciousness of the poet as well as allow interpreting the phenomenon of Mandelstam's Universum as a difficult phenomenon defining his unique character and originality in the Russian literature. It is noted that the text realization of words in the conditions of the poetic discourse leads to the integration of various aspects of reality and reproduces the author's perception of the world based on the indissoluble, interpenetrating unity of the objective and the subjective, the logical and the sensual, the rational and the emotional.The research is done on the synthesis of traditional and modern methods of the analysis of the realization of a poetic word: component, discourse and text analysis of names as well as the cognitive and hermeneutical analysis of the text that allowed to reveal the correspondence between text units, the information coded by them and mental structures or their elements presenting by this information by means of studying of the nature of connections between them.

TI  - Successful management of severe red blood cell alloimmunization in pregnancy with a combination of therapeutic plasma exchange, intravenous immune globulin, and intrauterine transfusion
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDAntibodies to Rhesus and Kell antigens have been associated with severe hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) necessitating intrauterine transfusion (IUT) of red blood cells (RBCs). We report a case series of five women with severe HDFN secondary to maternal RBC alloimmunization who were successfully managed with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), and IUT.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSThis is a retrospective case series of five women with severe HDFN who underwent a total of three TPE procedures during Weeks 10 to 13 of pregnancy, followed by weekly IVIG infusions. They were followed with serial middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity studies beginning at 16 weeks' gestation to detect fetal anemia. For IUT, fetuses were administered RBC units that fully matched the maternal phenotype to D, C, E, K, Fy, Jk, and S antigen groups. The delivery outcomes and newborn information were followed.RESULTSAnti-D and anti-K alloantibodies were implicated in HDFN. A two- to fourfold dilution reduction in anti-D and anti-K titers was observed after TPE. IUT was initiated between 21 to 27 weeks' gestation. The total number of IUTs for each patient ranged from four to seven. All five women delivered healthy infants at 33 to 38 weeks' gestation.CONCLUSIONA combined regimen of TPE and IVIG early in pregnancy and IUT later in pregnancy results in successful management of severe maternal RBC alloimmunization and HDFN. IUT with fully phenotypically matched RBC units may help prevent further RBC alloimmunization in complex cases of HDFN.

TI  - Infrared intraoperative fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green in thoracic surgery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Thoracic surgery faces many unique challenges that require innovative solutions. The increase in utilization of minimally invasive practices, poor overall cancer survival and significant morbidity of key operations remain key obstacles to overcome. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging is a process by which fluorescent dyes and imaging systems are used as adjuncts for surgeons in the operating room. Other surgical subspecialists have shown that intraoperative fluorescence imaging can be applied as a practical adjunct to their practices. Thoracic surgeons over the last 15 years have also used intraoperative fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node mapping, lung mapping, oesophageal conduit vascular perfusion and lung nodule identification. This review describes some of the key studies that demonstrate the applications of intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence imaging.

TI  - Heparan sulfate potentiates leukocyte adhesion on cardiac fibroblast by enhancing Vcam-1 and Icam-1 expression
T2  - BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cardiac fibroblasts (CF) act as sentinel cells responding to chemokines, cytokines and growth factors released in cardiac tissue in cardiac injury events, such as myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac injury involves the release of various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including heparan sulfate (HS), a constituent of the extracellular matrix (ECM), through the TLR4 receptor activation triggering a strong inflammatory response, inducing leukocytes recruitment. This latter cells are responsible of clearing cell debris and releasing cytokines that promote CF differentiation to myofibroblast (CMF), thus initiating scar formation.CF were isolated from adult male rats and subsequently stimulated with HS or LPS, in the presence or absence of chemical inhibitors, to evaluate signaling pathways involved in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were used to evaluate participation of these adhesion molecules on leukocytes recruitment.HS through TLR4, PI3K/Ala and NF-KB increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, which favored the adhesion of spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) and bone marrow granulocytes (PMN) to CF. These effects were prevented by siRNA against ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Co-culture of CF with SMC increased alpha-SMA expression, skewing CF towards a pro-fibrotic phenotype, while CF pretreatment with HS partially reverted this effect.Conclusion: These data show the dual role of HS during the initial stages of wound healing. Initially, HS enhance the pro-inflammatory role of CF increasing cytokines secretion; and later, by increasing protein adhesion molecules allows the adhesion of SMC on CF, which trigger CF-to-CMF differentiation.

TI  - Interferon is associated with improved survival for node-positive cutaneous melanoma: a single-institution experience
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: We assessed the role of adjuvant interferon on relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS) in node-positive melanoma patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 385 node-positive patients without distant metastatic disease treated from 1998 to 2015. The surgery was therapeutic lymph node dissection (LND, n = 86) or sentinel lymph node biopsy +/- completion LND (n = 270). 128 patients (33.2%) received adjuvant interferon. Results: After a median follow-up of 70 months, interferon was associated with improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.55; p < 0.001), DMFS (HR: 0.59; p < 0.001) and OS (HR: 0.61; p = 0.003), controlling for tumor and nodal stage, node size, sex, primary site, adjuvant therapy and extracapsular extension. In an exploratory age-matched comparison of patients treated with (n = 67) and without (n = 233) adjuvant immunotherapy, interferon still showed improved RFS, DMFS and OS. Conclusion: Adjuvant interferon appears to improve OS among node-positive melanoma patients in a modern experience, providing context for comparison in the adjuvant therapy landscape.

TI  - How do treatment aims in the last phase of life relate to hospitalizations and hospital mortality? A mortality follow-back study of Dutch patients with five types of cancer
T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the relation between treatment aims, hospitalizations, and hospital mortality for Dutch patients who died from lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, or pancreatic cancer.Methods A mortality follow-back study was conducted within a sentinel network of Dutch general practitioners (GPs), who recorded the end-of-life care of 691 patients who died from one of the abovementioned cancer types between 2009 and 2015. Differences in care by type of cancer were analyzed using multilevel analyses to control for clustering within general practices.Results Among all cancer types, patients with prostate cancer most often and patients with pancreatic cancer least often had a palliative treatment aim a month before death (95% resp. 84%). Prostate cancer patients were also least often admitted to hospital in the last month of life (18.5%) and least often died there (3.1%), whereas lung cancer patients were at the other end of the spectrum with 41.8% of them being admitted to hospital and 22.6% dying in hospital. Having a palliative treatment aim and being older were significantly associated with less hospital admissions, and having a palliative treatment aim, having prostate cancer, and dying in a more recent year were significantly associated with less hospital deaths.Conclusion There is large variation between patients with different cancer types with regard to treatment aims, hospital admissions, and hospital deaths. The results highlight the need for early initiation of GP palliative care to support patients from all cancer types to stay at the place they prefer as long as possible.

TI  - Ontologies of language, Second Language Acquisition, and world Englishes
T2  - WORLD ENGLISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - What has strained the relations between the fields of world Englishes and Second Language Acquisition (SLA), denounced by Sridhar and Sridhar (1986; Sridhar, 1994) and felt by many others during these past 30 years? I first characterize a number of the differences in disciplinary goals and orientations that have contributed to the tensions. I then argue that it is ultimately differences in the ontologies of language that are the largest hurdle to establishing synergies between the two fields. I weigh what has been gained and lost in SLA by the unquestioned adoption of essentialist ontologies and argue that it has locked SLA research into a monolingual worldview that the field can no longer afford. I also call for the continuation of research that illuminates multilingual success but also addresses the phenomenological and emic reality of the native' and nonnative' dichotomy, as many multilinguals experience their nonnativeness' as oppression that they must constantly manage and negotiate under the hegemony of monolingual ideologies. I close with four recommendations for changes in SLA that might help a new future where WE and SLA mutually benefit from their disciplinary achievements.

TI  - Impact of the Ataturk Dam Lake on Agro-Meteorological Aspects of the Southeastern Anatolia Region, Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the spatial and temporal impacts of the Ataturk Dam on agro-meteorological aspects of the Southeastern Anatolia region have been investigated. Change detection and environmental impacts due to water-reserve changes in Ataturk Dam Lake have been determined and evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries and meteorological datasets within a period of 1984-2011. These time series have been evaluated for three time periods. Dam construction period constitutes the first part of the study. Land cover/use changes especially on agricultural fields under the Ataturk Dam Lake and its vicinity have been identified between the periods of 1984-1992. The second period comprises the 10-year period after the completion of filling up the reservoir in 1992. At this period, Landsat and meteorological time-series analyses are examined to assess the impact of the Ataturk Dam Lake on selected irrigated agricultural areas. For the last 9-year period from 2002 to 2011, the relationships between seasonal water-reserve changes and irrigated plains under changing climatic factors primarily driving vegetation activity (monthly, seasonal, and annual fluctuations of rainfall rate, air temperature, humidity) on the watershed have been investigated using a 30-year meteorological time series. The results showed that approximately 368 km(2) of agricultural fields have been affected because of inundation due to the Ataturk Dam Lake. However, irrigated agricultural fields have been increased by 56.3% of the total area (1552 of 2756 km(2)) on Harran Plain within the period of 1984-2011.

TI  - The polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB) and its fungal symbiont <i>Fusarium euwallaceae:</i> a new invasion in South Africa
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), an ambrosia beetle (Coleoptera: Curculeonidae: Scolytinae) native to Asia, together with its fungal symbiont Fusarium euwallaceae, has emerged as an important invasive pest killing avocado and other trees in Israel and the United States. The PSHB is one of three cryptic species in the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex, the taxonomy of which remains to be resolved. The surge in the global spread of invasive forest pests such as the PSHB has led to the development of programmes utilising sentinel tree plantings to record new host-pest interactions. During routine surveys of tree health in botanical gardens of South Africa undertaken as part of a sentinel project, an ambrosia beetle/fungal associate was detected damaging Platanus x acerifolia (London Plane) in the KwaZulu-Natal National Botanical Gardens, Pietermaritzburg. Identification of the beetle by sequencing part of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) gene confirmed its identity as PSHB, and specifically one of the invasive haplotypes of the beetle. The associated fungus F. euwallaceae was identified based on phylogenetic analysis of elongation factor (EF 1-alpha) sequences. Koch's postulates have confirmed the pathogenicity of fungal isolates to P. x acerifolia. This is the first report of PSHB and its fungal symbiont causing Fusarium dieback in South Africa. This report also represents the first verified case of a damaging invasive forest pest detected in a sentinel planting project, highlighting the importance of such studies. Given the potential impact these species present to urban trees, native biodiversity and agriculture, both the PSHB and its fungal symbiont should be included in invasive species regulations in South Africa.

TI  - Intra-Urban Microclimate Effects on Phenology
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect is commonly defined as the thermal differences between cooler rural and warmer urban areas, but it also refers to microclimatic differences within an urban area that arises from varied combinations of land cover related to different land uses. Microclimatic variations should also produce intra-urban differences in vegetation phenophases, although few studies have investigated urban phenology. Most phenological studies are usually regional to continental in scale, predominantly tracking changes in start of season related to climate change. This study reports results of an exploratory analysis using TIMESAT (Lund University, Lund, Sweden) software and MODIS NDVI 250-m resolution data (Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA) to identify intra-urban differences in start of season for the City of Roanoke, Virginia. We compare these results to our in-situ temperature collection campaign. Additionally, we completed an in-situ start of season data collection by observing select tree species. Our results demonstrate that MODIS, processed by TIMESAT software, identified intra-urban start of season variations, and these variations are consistent with differing intra-urban microclimates and our in-situ start of season observations. Furthermore, results from such analyses can aid plans for increasing the urban tree canopy or in cultivating locations for urban agriculture-i.e., warmer areas with a longer growing season could accommodate warmer weather trees and crops.

TI  - Efficient Thermal Noise Removal for Sentinel-1 TOPSAR Cross- Polarization Channel
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of a Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans synthetic aperture radar image is disturbed by additive thermal noise, particularly in the crosspolarization channel. Although the European Space Agency provides calibrated noise vectors for noise power subtraction, residual noise contributions are significant when considering the relatively narrow backscattering distribution of the crosspolarization channel. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of noise and propose an efficient method for noise reduction based on a three-step correction process comprised of azimuth descalloping, noise scaling and interswath power balancing, and local residual noise power compensation. The core idea is to find the optimal correction coefficients resulting in the most noise-uncorrelated gentle backscatter profile over a homogeneous region and to combine them with the scalloping gain for a reconstruction of the complete 2-D noise field. Denoising is accomplished by subtracting the reconstructed noise field from the original image. The performance improvement in some applications by adopting the denoising procedure shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Effects of Climate Change and Ozone Concentration on the Net Primary Productivity of Forests in South Korea
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric ozone impacts the health and productivity of forest ecosystems. The concentration of ozone on Earth will increase in the future, particularly in China and its neighboring countries, including Korea, due to a projected rise in nitrogen dioxide and ozone precursors as a result of China's emissions. This study aims to estimate the effect of changes in ozone concentration and climate change on the forests in Korea, based on expected nitrogen dioxide emissions in Korea and China in the future. To do this, we developed an empirical model that represents the statistical relationship between the net primary productivity (NPP) of the forests and ozone concentration using historical data; and, estimated the future NPP of the forests under future ozone concentration scenarios based on nitrogen dioxide emissions of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The analysis suggests that the ozone concentration begin exerting effects to the NPP, about 68.10 tC/km(2)/year decrement per 0.01 ppm increment. We estimated that the NPP of Korean forests has been reduced by 8.25% due to the current concentration of ozone, and the damage is estimated to increase to a range between 8.47% and 10.55% in the 2050s, and between 5.85% and 11.15% in the 2090s depending on the scenarios.

TI  - Classification and Mapping of Paddy Rice by Combining Landsat and SAR Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is an important food resource, and the demand for rice has increased as population has expanded. Therefore, accurate paddy rice classification and monitoring are necessary to identify and forecast rice production. Satellite data have been often used to produce paddy rice maps with more frequent update cycle (e.g., every year) than field surveys. Many satellite data, including both optical and SAR sensor data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, and ALOS PALSAR), have been employed to classify paddy rice. In the present study, time series data from Landsat, RADARSAT-1, and ALOS PALSAR satellite sensors were synergistically used to classify paddy rice through machine learning approaches over two different climate regions (sites A and B). Six schemes considering the composition of various combinations of input data by sensor and collection date were evaluated. Scheme 6 that fused optical and SAR sensor time series data at the decision level yielded the highest accuracy (98.67% for site A and 93.87% for site B). Performance of paddy rice classification was better in site A than site B, which consists of heterogeneous land cover and has low data availability due to a high cloud cover rate. This study also proposed Paddy Rice Mapping Index (PMI) considering spectral and phenological characteristics of paddy rice. PMI represented well the spatial distribution of paddy rice in both regions. Google Earth Engine was adopted to produce paddy rice maps over larger areas using the proposed PMI-based approach.

AB  - Himalayan glaciers show large spatial variation in glacial retreat and mass loss due to their unique climate setting, altitude and topography. Large variability of glacier response to climate in this region may be due to various factors such as climatic (precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) and non-climatic (topography and debris cover). In this study, an attempt has been made to understand the role of topographical parameters and debris cover for glacier recession in Miyar basin, Western Himalaya. Miyar basin is one of the major contributors of water discharge to Indus basin, which has significant population dependent upon the glacier runoff. A total of 29 glaciers covering an area of similar to 227 km(2) were studied. The glacier retreat for the period 1989-2014 was estimated using the satellite data of Landsat series (TM, ETM and OLI). Topographical features such as size, aspect, slope and debris cover were extracted from the Landsat Operational Imager scene and ASTER GDEM V2 data. These glaciers were classified based on flow direction, area covered, slope and debris coverage. Observations revealed almost 9 +/- 0.7 km(2) recessions in glacier area (4%) for studied glaciers of Miyar basin during 1989-2014. Within the Miyar basin glaciers with large size, having a steep slope with high debris cover and northward aspect showed low retreat than glaciers of small size, gentle slope and low debris cover with southward aspect.

TI  - Acreage estimation of mango orchards using hyperspectral satellite data
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Horticultural crop plays a unique role in India's economy, therefore reliable and timely estimates of area under horticulture crops are of vital importance. Present methods of crop acreage estimation rely heavily on sample survey approach which is time consuming for a diversified and large country like India. Modern space technology with advance tools of Remote Sensing, GIS and GPS may be an alternative option for estimating area under horticultural crops. The advantage of using satellite data is that it provides both synoptic view and the economies of scale, since data over large areas could be gathered quickly from such platforms. This study has been undertaken to estimate the acreage under mango and to map existing orchards of Mango using hyperspectral satellite data. The study was conducted for Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. The hyperion hyperspectral satellite data was evaluated to estimate the area under all mango orchards. These estimates were compared with actual area under mango orchards measured using Global Positioning System (GPS) and the total area under mango was predicted as 961.88 ha which was 92% close to ground data 889.65 ha. The results indicated the scope of hyperspectral remote sensing in acreage estimation of fruit crops.

TI  - Application of Object Oriented Image Classification and Markov Chain Modeling for Land Use and Land Cover Change Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Object oriented image classification (OOIC) and neural network aided Markov Chain (MC) modeling tools were used to map and predict land use and land cover (LULC) changes. A case study in the Kiskatinaw River Watershed (KRW) of Canada was presented. With an overall classification accuracy of 90.45%, the multi-temporal Landsat satellite images of KRW were analyzed for 11 selected LULC types. It was found that KRW experienced a significant wetland depletion along with a change in forest cover types from 1984 to 2010. The vulnerability of LULC change in different parts of KRW was predicted through MC modeling based on the obtained transition probability, and the results indicated slight LULC changes from 2010 with a wetland depletion of 67.89 km(2). In summary, the proposed methods generated valuable results for informed LULC management and hold the potential to be applied to other watersheds.

TI  - Remote Sensing of River Erosion on the Colville River, North Slope Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Colville is an Arctic river in the Alaska North Slope. The residents of Nuiqsut rely heavily on the Colville for their subsistence needs. Increased erosion has been reported on the Colville, especially along bluffs, which shaped the goals of this study: to use remote sensing techniques to map and quantify erosion rates and the volume of land loss at selected bluff sites along the main channel of the Colville, and to assess the suitability of automated methods of regional erosion monitoring. We used orthomosaics from high resolution aerial photos acquired in 1955 and 1979/1982, as well as high resolution WorldView-2 images from 2015 to quantify long-term erosion rates and the cubic volume of erosion. We found that, at the selected sites, erosion rates averaged 1 to 3.5 m per year. The erosion rate remained the same at one site and increased from 1955 to 2015 at two of the four sites. We estimated the volume of land loss to be in the magnitude of 166,000 m(3) to 2.5 million m(3) at our largest site. We also found that estimates of erosion were comparable for manual hand-digitized and automated methods, suggesting our automated method was effective and can be extended to monitor erosion at other sites along river systems that are bordered by bluffs.

TI  - Predicting 72-hour emergency department revisits
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To develop a predictive model that hospitals or healthcare systems can use to identify patients at high risk of revisiting the ED within 72 h so that appropriate interventions can be delivered.Methods: This study employed multivariate logistic regression in developing the predictive model. The study data were from four Veterans medical centers in Upstate New York; 21,141 patients in total with ED visits were included in the analysis. Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 data were used to predict revisits in FY 2014. The predictive variables were patient demographics, prior year healthcare utilizations, and comorbidities. To avoid overfitting, we validated the model by the split-sample method. The predictive power of the model is measured by c-statistic.Results: In the first model using only patient demographics, the c-statistics were 0.55 (CI: 0.52-0.57) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.51-0.56) for the development and validation samples, respectively. In the second model with prior year utilization added, the c-statistics were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.68-0.72) for both samples. In the final model where comorbidities were added, the c-statistics were 0.74 (CI: 0.72-0.76) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71-0.75) for the development and validation samples, respectively.Conclusions: Reducing ED revisits not only lowers healthcare cost but also shortens wait time for those who critically need ED care. However, broad intervention for every ED visitor is not feasible given limited resources. In this study, we developed a predictive model that hospitals and healthcare systems can use to identify "frequent flyers" for early interventions to reduce ED revisits. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Hybrid Stripmap-ScanSAR Interferometry: Extension to the X-Band COSMO-SkyMed Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter aims to investigate the applicability of the hybrid stripmap-ScanSAR differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry to data collected by the X-band RADAR sensors of the Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation. The presented analysis relies on the experiments carried out on two sets of stripmap and ScanSAR CSK images collected over the Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile and the Mojave Desert in Southern California, respectively. As a result of our investigation, a spurious phase modulation has been recognized in the generated hybrid stripmap-ScanSAR interferograms along the azimuth direction. This effect is due to the specific staggered topology of the used active phased array antennas that introduces half-wavelength residuals during the electronic antenna steering in the elevation plane. A straightforward solution to compensate for such spurious phase modulation effects has been provided, and the achieved results demonstrate its effectiveness. The outcomes of our analysis may be relevant in the perspective of the future CSK Second Generation Program.

TI  - Resolution test of GOCE satellite data applied to density anomalies at crustal and upper mantle levels
T2  - GEOLOGICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite mission was devised by the European Space Agency to study the Earth's gravity field with an unprecedented accuracy using gravity gradient data. The goal of this study' is to analyze the resolution in terms of size, burial depth and density contrast of anomalous bodies related to geological structures that can he identified from GOCE data. A parametric study is performed by calculating the gravity gradients associated with rectangular prisms with fixed aspect ratio of 9:3:1 and varying the size, burial depth, and density contrast, selecting those structures showing amplitudes and wavelength variations comparable to the accuracy of GOCE data. Results show that the minimum size for crustal anomalies to be resolved for the vertical component of the gravity gradient is 22.5x7.5x2.5km for a Delta rho,500kg/m(3), burial depth of 0km, and at computation height of 255km. To generate a sufficient signal in amplitude and wavelength in all the components, the size of the anomalous body is 270x90x30km. For a body' with Delta rho = 50kg/m(3) and 0km burial depth a minimum size of 41.4x13.8x4.6km is required for the vertical component at a computation height of 255km. In addition, the application to the 31) case of a passive continental margin which broadly resembles the crustal structure of the NW-Iberia shows that the signal of all gravity gradient components is dominated by the crustal thinning associated with the passive continental margins and the corresponding isostatic response.

T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used in situ spectral remote sensing reflectance data, R-rs, (lambda), coincident with chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) measurements obtained by the Brazilian High Latitude Oceanography Group (GOAL, FURG) and provided by the SeaWiFS Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP). These data span the period between 2002 and 2010. The objective of this work was to evaluate the existing MODIS/Aqua chlorophyll algorithms and show an alternative atmospheric correction scheme based on the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave near-infrared (SWIR) bands that could be used in the turbid coastal waters of the NAP. The current OC2M and OC3M empirical and GSMO1 semi-analytical algorithms tend to underestimate Chla, which was determined by using Chla estimated by either high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or fluorometry. The GSMO1 algorithm showed the best performance. The NIR-SWIR atmospheric correction scheme (Wang et al., 2009) was applied for the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) in the presence of sea ice and deicing waters and showed an increase in Chla in the range from 0.75 to 2.5 mg(-3) and a slight decrease in the values above 2.5 mg m(-3). Regional empirical chlorophyll algorithms based on the 3-band OC3M operational algorithm were derived and showed better performance in estimating Chla than the global algorithms.

TI  - Melanoma & nuclear medicine: new insights & advances
T2  - MELANOMA MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The contribution of nuclear medicine to management of melanoma patients is increasing. In intermediate-thickness N0 melanomas, lymphoscintigraphy provides a roadmap for sentinel node biopsy. With the introduction of single-photon emission computed tomography images with integrated computed tomography (SPECT/CT), 3D anatomic environments for accurate surgical planning are now possible. Sentinel node identification in intricate anatomical areas (pelvic cavity, head/neck) has been improved using hybrid radioactive/fluorescent tracers, preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT together with modern intraoperative portable imaging technologies for surgical navigation (free-hand SPECT, portable gamma cameras). Furthermore, PET/CT today provides 3D roadmaps to resect F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid melanoma lesions. Simultaneously, in advanced-stage melanoma and recurrences, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT is useful in clinical staging and treatment decision as well as in the evaluation of therapy response. In this article, we review new insights and recent nuclear medicine advances in the management of melanoma patients.

TI  - The contribution of mast cells to bacterial and fungal infection immunity
T2  - IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are hematopoietic progenitor-derived, granule-containing immune cells that are widely distributed in tissues that interact with the external environment, such as the skin and mucosal tissues. It is well-known that mast cells are significantly involved in IgE-mediated allergic reactions, but because of their location, it has also been long hypothesized that mast cells can act as sentinel cells that sense pathogens and initiate protective immune responses. Using mast cell or mast cell protease-deficient murine models, recent studies by our groups and others indicate that mast cells have pleiotropic regulatory roles in immunological responses against pathogens. In this review, we discuss studies that demonstrate that mast cells can either promote host resistance to infections caused by bacteria and fungi or contribute to dysregulated immune responses that can increase host morbidity and mortality. Overall, these studies indicate that mast cells can influence innate immune responses against bacterial and fungal infections via multiple mechanisms. Importantly, the contribution of mast cells to infection outcomes depends in part on the infection model, including the genetic approach used to assess the influence of mast cells on host immunity, hence highlighting the complexity of mast cell biology in the context of innate immune responses.

TI  - Effects of truck-mounted, ultra low volume mosquito adulticides on honey bees (Apis mellifera) in a suburban field setting.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have examined the impact of mosquito adulticides on honey bees under conditions that reflect actual field exposure. Whereas several studies have evaluated the toxicity of mosquito control products on honey bees, most have been laboratory based and have focused solely on acute mortality as a measure of impact. The goal of this study was to determine effects of routine applications of truck-based ultra-low volume ( ULV) mosquito adulticides ( i.e., Scourge, Duet, and Deltagard) on honey bees in a suburban setting. The mosquito adulticides used in this study were pyrethroids with active ingredients resmethrin ( Scourge), prallethrin and sumithrin ( Duet), and deltamethrin ( Deltagard), in which resmethrin, prallethrin, and sumithrin were synergized with piperonyl butoxide. We measured and compared mortality and detoxification enzyme activities ( esterase and glutathione S-transferase) from sentinel beehives within and outside of mosquito control areas. Concurrently, colony health ( i.e., number of adult bees, brood quantity and brood quality) was compared throughout the study period. No significant differences were observed in honey bee mortality, colony health or detoxification enzyme activities between treated ( five sprayed areas each received one to three insecticide treatment) and control sites ( four unsprayed areas that did not receive insecticide treatment) over the seven week study period. However, our laboratory study showed that exposure to resmethrin, the active ingredient in Scourge, caused significant inhibition of esterase activity compared with the control group. Our findings suggest that proper application of truck based insecticides for mosquito control results in little or no exposure and therefore minimal effects on domestic honey bees.

TI  - SEMIOTIC APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THE KEY CONTRADICTIONS OF THE MODERN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author believes that there are contradictions in the education system due to the incongruity of the "big metaphor" of education, through the prism of which it is thought of by the representatives of state power and the majority of the researchers, and the real mission of education in the modern context. Edusemiotics is a relatively new branch of the philosophy of education, which, in the author's view, has the potential for rethinking and resolving the contradictions that have accumulated in the system of modern Russian education. Having been established as a separate branch of the philosophy of education in the United States in 2010-2016, the semiotics of education is called upon to resist the Cartesian dualism of the subject and object, the labyrinths of analytical philosophy and the objective method of the modern era, which rejects human subjectivity as the only basis for the study of education. The author considers the principles of the edusemiotics to be topical at present: the primacy of the process of education over the result, the rejection of the principle of consistency and the logic of the "excluded middle" (i.e. the direct transfer of knowledge or skills from the teacher to the student, bypassing the stage of their interpretation), the holistic approach to education and the ethics of integration, continuity and experimental character of education. The article discusses the sharp contradictions revealed by the author at various levels of the education system (the level of the content of education, institutional and global levels) caused by the imbalance of the processes of integration and differentiation in education. At the level of the content of education, the conflict between differentiation and integration is expressed in the fragmentation of knowledge, on the one hand, and the objective necessity of forming an integral worldview of the individual on the other hand. In the educational system as a public institution, the discreteness of the level preparation comes into conflict with the continuity of continuous education in the knowledge society. And, finally, at the global level, the desire to preserve the identity of Russian educational traditions resists the objective tendencies of the internationalization of higher education according to the Western pattern. Then, from the standpoint of edusemiotics, an attempt is made to philosophize them. The author proposes and discusses options for resolving these contradictions. The author comes to the conclusion that the semiotics of education has the potential for formulating a new metaphor for education that views education as a value, process and result; applies to a holistic, integrative approach to determining the outcome of education; pays attention to all the levels of education: pragmatic, social and existential; and, finally, takes into account the cultural appropriateness of education.

TI  - Quantifying the Trends in Land Surface Temperature and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity in Mediterranean Cities in View of Smart Urbanization
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key parameter for the estimation of urban fluxes as well as for the assessment of the presence and strength of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). In an urban environment, LST depends on the way the city has been planned and developed over time. To this end, the estimation of LST needs adequate spatial and temporal data at the urban scale, especially with respect to land cover/land use. The present study is divided in two parts: at first, satellite data from MODIS-Terra 8-day product (MOD11A2) were used for the analysis of an eighteen-year time series (2001-2017) of the LST spatial and temporal distribution in five major cities of the Mediterranean during the summer months. LST trends were retrieved and assessed for their statistical significance. Secondly, LST values and trends for each city were examined in relation to land cover characteristics and patterns in order to define the contribution of urban development and planning on LST; this information is important for the drafting of smart urbanization policies and measures. Results revealed (a) positive LST trends in the urban areas especially during nighttime ranging from +0.412 degrees K in Marseille to +0.923 degrees K in Cairo and (b) the SUHI has intensified during the last eighteen years especially during daytime in European Mediterranean cities, such as Rome (+0.332 degrees K) and Barcelona (+0.307 degrees K).

TI  - Serbian consensus of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer: NeoPULSE
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though surgery is the primary treatment of operable breast cancer, it has been known for decades that the administration of postoperative adjuvant or preoperative neoadjuvant therapy is extremely important. Indications for neodjuvant therapy administration have been expanded over the years, and nowadays this kind of treatment represents an inevitable option in early breast cancer treatment. The NeoPULSE project, which gathered a group of experts in the field of breast cancer from five Serbian university centres, was formed with the aim to define optimal breast cancer diagnosis, indications for neoadjuvant therapy, therapeutic combinations in relation to molecular/ biological parameters of breast cancer, as well as the treatment after neoadjuvant therapy.During two separate expert meetings involving surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, a pathologist, and a "Blueprint" workshop, the project participants answered questions over the indications for neoadjuvant therapy.The first part covered local practice and referred to the existence and work of a multidisciplinary team, as well as com-monly applied therapeutic regimens in the neoadjuvant setting. Experts analysed personal views regarding indications for the administration and benefits of neoadjuvant therapy, their perception on the correlation between achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) and the outcome of treatment, as well as the attitude towards controversies about this type of treatment, primarily regarding a possible change in the receptor status after therapy and therapeutic options after a suboptimal response.The analysis of the answers pointed to problems and deviations from recommendations in everyday clinical practice, based on which appropriate solutions were proposed.The establishment of such a panel and consensus is an attempt to modernize multidisciplinary teams in Serbia, achieve reaching uniform decisions of all subjects dealing with breast cancer, and therefore, at least in one segment, improve breast cancer treatment in Serbia.

TI  - Landsat Super-Resolution Enhancement Using Convolution Neural Networks and Sentinel-2 for Training
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat is a fundamental data source for understanding historical change and its effect on environmental processes. In this research we test shallow and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) for Landsat image super-resolution enhancement, trained using Sentinel-2, in three study sites representing boreal forest, tundra, and cropland/woodland environments. The analysis sought to assess baseline performance and determine the capacity for spatial and temporal extension of the trained CNNs. This is not a data fusion approach and a high-resolution image is only needed to train the CNN. Results show improvement with the deeper network generally achieving better results. For spatial and temporal extension, the deep CNN performed the same or better than the shallow CNN, but at greater computational cost. Results for temporal extension were influenced by change potentiality reducing the performance difference between the shallow and deep CNN. Visual examination revealed sharper images regarding land cover boundaries, linear features, and within-cover textures. The results suggest that spatial enhancement of the Landsat archive is feasible, with optimal performance where CNNs can be trained and applied within the same spatial domain. Future research will assess the enhancement on time series and associated land cover applications.

TI  - Absence-Neglect and the Origins of Great Strategies
T2  - STRATEGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Great business strategies originate in a top management worldview that seeks to implement bold strategic change in the external world. This worldview generates confident strategic actions capable of producing extreme success. However, it also generates catastrophic failures and lower returns on average. This is because action-oriented managers pay abnormal attention to the observables of sense experience while neglecting the world of absence, a bias I refer to as absence-neglect. Absence-neglect is the cognitive tendency to notice presence more than absence-for example, movement more than stillness and noise more than silence. This paper examines the origins of absence-neglect and its consequences for strategy formation, firm performance, and social welfare. I argue that societies can reduce the economic and moral risks of "great" strategies by cultivating a more balanced discernment of presence and absence.

TI  - Sentinel: A Codesigned Platform for Semantic Enrichment of Social Media Streams
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce the Sentinel platform that supports semantic enrichment of streamed social media data for the purposes of situational understanding. The platform is the result of a codesign effort between computing and social scientists, iteratively developed through a series of pilot studies. The platform is founded upon a knowledge-based approach, in which input streams (channels) are characterized by spatial and terminological parameters, collected media is preprocessed to identify significant terms (signals), and data are tagged (framed) in relation to an ontology. Interpretation of processed media is framed in terms of the 5W framework (who, what, when, where, and why). The platform is designed to be open to the incorporation of new processing modules, building on the knowledge-based elements (channels, signals, and framing ontology) and accessible via a set of user-facing apps. We present the conceptual architecture for the platform, discuss the design and implementation challenges of the underlying stream-processing system, and present a number of apps developed in the context of the pilot studies, highlighting the strengths and importance of the codesign approach and indicating promising areas for future research.

TI  - Plastic adaptations of foraging strategies to variation in forage quality in Alpine chamois (<i>Rupicapra rupicapra</i>)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Foraging efficiency strongly affects individual fitness and is influenced by diverse factors such as food quality and quantity, as well as intra-and inter-specific interactions. We investigated whether Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra (Linnaeus, 1758)) in a protected area in the Swiss Alps adapted their foraging behaviour to forage availability and quality by modeling the bite and step rates of individuals on vegetation nitrogen content, relative plant cover, sex, daytime, air temperature, and slope. Vegetation characteristics were derived using remote sensing data from airborne imaging spectroscopy data sets and feeding locations determined using a theodolite. Chamois increased their bite rates with decreasing forage nitrogen content, decreasing slope, and increasing temperature. Step rates were higher at high temperatures and decreased with increasing relative plant cover. Males showed higher bite rates and lower step rates than females. Daytime had no influence on either bite or step rates. An increase in bite rate may represent a plastic adaptation of foraging behaviour to compensate for lower nutritional quality of the available vegetation. Our results show variability in foraging behaviour according to both vegetation characteristics and physical environment and emphasize the use of remote sensing data to investigate relationships between habitat and subtle behavioural adaptations in ungulates.

TI  - An Improved Novel Nonlinear Algorithm of Area-Wide Near-Surface Air Temperature Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing air temperature mostly relies on linear algorithms that produce significantly variable results depending on various weather conditions. Recently, a novel nonlinear algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) was reported with improved prediction accuracy by using multiple types of data including satellite and unmanned weather station, land coverage imagery, digital elevation model, astronomy, and calendar. To further improve the accuracy and consistence, this paper reports a selective arithmetic mean (SAM) approach for optimization of a previously reported SVM algorithm for area-wide near surface air temperature remote sensing using satellite and other types of data. Using Guangxi province as the study area, the results show that this new SAM approach significantly improved the overall retrieving quality over the previously reported simple arithmetic mean approach. The SAM approach has high tolerance to cloud, ground vegetation, and vertical and spatial spectrum variations, with superb prediction errors (absolute error, AE) and root mean square errors concentrated around 0.7 and 0.8 degrees C, respectively. The prediction error patterns with different atmosphere water content, enhanced vegetation index, and spatial spectrum were similar under all examined conditions. After SAM operations, the prediction error patterns showed a deep gap near a set error threshold di, especially near delta(0) (delta(0) +/- 0.2) in every examined situation. SAM also produces significantly lower errors at AE >= delta(0) >= 0. The SVM model with SAM optimization minimizes the shortcomings of the classical temperature remote sensing technologies and is suitable for area-wide retrieving under natural conditions. Four modeling principles are summarized for building superb models.

TI  - Discriminating satellite IR anomalies associated with the MS 7.1 Yushu earthquake in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of exploring pre-earthquake thermal anomalies using satellite infrared data, Blackett et al. (2011) found that the previously reported anomalies before the 2001 Mw 7.7 Gujarat earthquake, in India, were related to positive biases caused by data gaps due to cloud cover and mosaicing of neighboring orbits of MODIS satellite data. They supposed that such effects could also be responsible for other cases. We noted a strip-shaped TIR anomaly on March 17th, 2010, 28 days before the Ms. 7.1 Yushu earthquake (Qin et al., 2011). Here we again investigate multi-year infrared satellite data in different bands to discriminate whether the anomaly is associated with the earthquake, or is only bias caused by the data gaps. From the water vapor images, we find lots of clouds that have TIR anomalies. However, on the cloudiness background, there is an obvious strip-shaped gap matching the tectonic faults almost perfectly. In particular, the animation loops of hourly water vapor images show that the cloud kept moving from west to east, while they never covered the strip-shaped gap. We consider that the cloud with this special spatial pattern should have implied the abnormal signals associated with the seismogenic process. Based on current physical models, the satellite IR anomalies both on TIR and water vapor bands can qualitatively be explained using synthetic mechanisms (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - Satellite Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Soil Moisture Observations Lead to Advances in the Predictive Understanding of Global Terrestrial Coupled Carbon-Water Cycles
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are coupled through a multitude of connected processes among soil, roots, leaves, and the atmosphere. The strength and sensitivity of these couplings are not yet well known at the global scale, which contributes to uncertainty in predicting the terrestrial water and carbon budgets. We now have synchronous, global-scale satellite observations of critical terrestrial carbon and water cycle components: solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and soil moisture. We used these observations within the framework of a global terrestrial biosphere model (Simplified Simple Biosphere Model version 2.0, SSiB2) to investigate carbon-water coupling processes. We updated SSiB2 to include a mechanistic representation of SIF and tested the sensitivity of model parameters to improve the simulation of both SIF and soil moisture with the ultimate objective of improving the first-order terrestrial carbon component, gross primary production. Although several vegetation parameters, such as leaf area index and the green leaf fraction, improved the simulated SIF, and several soil parameters, such as hydraulic conductivity, improved simulated soil moisture, their effects were mainly limited to their respective cycles. One root-mean-square error parameter emerged as the key coupler between the carbon and water cycles: the wilting point. Updates to the wilting point significantly improved the simulations for SIF and gross primary production although substantial mismatches with the satellite data still existed. This study demonstrates the value of synchronous global measurements of the terrestrial carbon and water cycles in improving the understanding of coupled carbon-water cycles.

TI  - Evolution in sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically node-negative (cNO) breast cancer patients without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The application of SLNB in patients receiving NAC has also been explored. Evidence supports its use after NAC in pretreatment cNO patients. Nonetheless, its routine use in all the pretreatment node-positive patients who become cNO after NAG is unjustified due to the unacceptably high false-negative rate, which can be improved in a subset of patients. Axillary surgery omission in selected patients with a low risk of ALN metastasis has gained more and more research interest because the SLNs are tumor-free in more than 70% of all patients. To avoid drawbacks of conventional mapping methods, novel techniques for SLN detection have been developed and shown to be highly accurate in patients with early breast cancer. This article reviews the progress in SLNB in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping Spring Ephemeral Plants in Northern Xinjiang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring ephemeral plants (SEP) are a particular component of flora that take full advantage of water resources and temperature conditions to rapidly complete their life cycle in about two months. In China, they are mainly distributed in northern Xinjiang. They play important roles in dune stability and are precious food for the livestock and wild animals in the early spring. Northern Xinjiang is under dramatic climate changes and land-use/land-cover changes, which can affect the growth of SEP in this region. To explore how the distribution of SEP have varied under these changes, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrodiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series of two years (2000 and 2014) were applied to detect SEP in each period. The TIMESAT software was used to extract the seasonality information from the EVI data. The results show that SEP in northern Xinjiang are mainly located in the south of the Gurbantunggut desert and along the Ili Valley and piedmont hills of the mountains. In 2000, its total area was 3.83 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for 10% of the entire region. By 2014, the total area was about 2.74 x 10(4) km(2), with a decrease of 28.5% relative to 2000. Land-use/land-cover datasets can be used to determine whether changes in SEP over time are caused by human activities or natural factors. Combing the SEP maps with the synchronous land-use/land-cover datasets indicates that the decrease is mainly caused by natural factors, which are possibly related with the temperature and precipitation changes in this region. Human activities only contributed 4% to the decrease, with most SEP areas being replaced by croplands. The observed SEP dynamics and changes pertain only to the years with below-average precipitation.

TI  - Considerations for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients with biopsy proven axillary disease prior to neoadjuvant treatment
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary disease can be downstaged with neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer. We attempted to identify factors to consider in determining whether to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with biopsy proven axillary metastases (cNthorn) prior to neoadjuvant treatment.Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients at a single tertiary care center who underwent neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery between 9/2013 and 2/2017.Results: 47% of patients with node positive disease prior to neoadjuvant treatment were downstaged to node negative (ypN0) disease. These patients were more likely to have triple negative or Her2 positive disease than those patients who remained node positive (ypNthorn) as these were more likely to have hormone receptor positive disease. These patients were also more likely to demonstrate complete clinical imaging response of the primary tumor and axilla on preoperative breast MRI.Conclusions: Tumor biology and clinical response noted on breast MRI can help guide the decision to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with axillary node positive disease prior to neoadjuvant treatment.

TI  - An integrated model for generating hourly Landsat-like land surface temperatures over heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing has greatly limited the availability of concurrently high spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) data for wide applications. Although many efforts have been made to resolve this dilemma, most have difficulties in generating diurnal fine-resolution LSTs with high spatial details for landscapes with significant heterogeneity and land cover type change. This study proposes an integrated framework to BLEnd Spatiotemporal Temperatures (termed BLEST) of Landsat, MODIS and a geostationary satellite (FY-2F) to one hour interval and 100 m resolution, where (1) a linear temperature mixing model with conversion coefficients is combined to better characterize heterogeneous landscapes and generate more accurate predictions for small and linear objects; (2) residuals are downscaled by a thin plate spline interpolator and restored to the primary fine-resolution estimations to include information about land cover type change; and (3) separate operations at annual and diurnal scales with nonlinear temperature modeling are designed to neutralize the hybrid impacts of large scale gap and land cover type change. BLEST was tested on both simulated data and actual satellite data at annual, diurnal and combined scales, and evaluations were conducted with the simulated/actual fine-resolution data, in-situ data, and with three popular fusion methods, i.e., the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) and the spatiotemporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM). Results show higher accuracy by BLEST with more spatial details and pronounced temporal evolutions, particularly over heterogeneous landscapes and changing land cover types. BLEST is proposed to augment the spatiotemporal fusion system and further support diurnal dynamic studies in land surfaces.

TI  - Improved crop residue cover estimates obtained by coupling spectral indices for residue and moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing assessment of crop residue cover (f(R)) and tillage intensity can improve predictions of the environmental impact of agricultural practices and promote sustainable management. Spectral indices for estimating f(R) are sensitive to soil and crop residue water contents, therefore the uncertainty of f(R) estimates increases when moisture conditions vary. Our goals were to evaluate the robustness of spectral residue indices based on the shortwave infrared region (SWIR) for estimating f(R) and to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions on f(R) estimates. Ten fields with center pivot irrigation systems (eight partially irrigated and two uniformly dry fields) were identified in Worldview-3 satellite imagery acquired for a study site in Maryland (USA). The fields were mid-irrigation at the time of imagery acquisition, allowing comparison of residue cover under dry and wet conditions. Fields were subdivided into approximately equal-size wedges within the dry and wet portions of each field, and the SWIR bands were extracted for each pixel. Two crop residue indices (Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI); Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) and a water index (WI) were calculated. Reflectance in each band was moisture-adjusted based on the WI difference between wet and dry wedges, and updated NDTI and SINDRI were calculated. Finally, the probability density distributions of f(R) estimated from the residue indices were calculated for each field. SINDRI was more robust than NDTI for estimating f(R). Moisture corrections of spectral bands reduced the root mean square error of NDTI f(R) estimates from 22.7% to 4.7%, and SINDRI f(R) estimates from 6.0% to 2.2%. The mean and variance of the probability density distribution of f(R) estimated from residue indices, before and after moisture correction, were greatly reduced in the partially irrigated fields, but only slightly in fields with uniform water distribution. The estimation of f(R) should be based on SINDRI if appropriate bands are available, but f(R) can be reliably estimated by combining NDTI with a water content index to mitigate the uncertainty caused by variable moisture conditions.

TI  - Hydrological inferences through morphometric analysis of lower Kosi river basin of India for water resource management based on remote sensing data
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite based remote sensing technology has proven to be an effectual tool in analysis of drainage networks, study of surface morphological features and their correlation with groundwater management prospect at basin level. The present study highlights the effectiveness and advantage of remote sensing and GIS-based analysis for quantitative and qualitative assessment of flood plain region of lower Kosi river basin based on morphometric analysis. In this study, ASTER DEM is used to extract the vital hydrological parameters of lower Kosi river basin in ARC GIS software. Morphometric parameters, e.g., stream order, stream length, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, drainage frequency, drainage texture, form factor, circularity ratio, elongation ratio, etc., have been calculated for the Kosi basin and their hydrological inferences were discussed. Most of the morphometric parameters such as bifurcation ratio, drainage density, drainage frequency, drainage texture concluded that basin has good prospect for water management program for various purposes and also generated data base that can provide scientific information for site selection of water-harvesting structures and flood management activities in the basin. Land use land cover (LULC) of the basin were also prepared from Landsat data of 2005, 2010 and 2015 to assess the change in dynamic of the basin and these layers are very noteworthy for further watershed prioritization.

TI  - Statistically optimal estimation of Greenland Ice Sheet mass variations from GRACE monthly solutions using an improved mascon approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an improved mascon approach to transform monthly spherical harmonic solutions based on GRACE satellite data into mass anomaly estimates in Greenland. The GRACE-based spherical harmonic coefficients are used to synthesize gravity anomalies at satellite altitude, which are then inverted into mass anomalies per mascon. The limited spectral content of the gravity anomalies is properly accounted for by applying a low-pass filter as part of the inversion procedure to make the functional model spectrally consistent with the data. The full error covariance matrices of the monthly GRACE solutions are properly propagated using the law of covariance propagation. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the importance of a proper data weighting and of the spectral consistency between functional model and data. The developed methodology is applied to process real GRACE level-2 data (CSR RL05). The obtained mass anomaly estimates are integrated over five drainage systems, as well as over entire Greenland. We find that the statistically optimal data weighting reduces random noise by 35-69%, depending on the drainage system. The obtained mass anomaly time-series are de-trended to eliminate the contribution of ice discharge and are compared with de-trended surface mass balance (SMB) time-series computed with the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO 2.3). We show that when using a statistically optimal data weighting in GRACE data processing, the discrepancies between GRACE-based estimates of SMB and modelled SMB are reduced by 24-47%.

TI  - A Hierarchical Approach of Hybrid Image Classification for Land use and Land cover Mapping
T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data analysis can provide thematic maps describing land-use and land-cover (LULC) in a short period. Using proper image classification method in an area, is important to overcome the possible limitations of satellite imageries for producing land-use and land-cover maps. In the present study, a hierarchical hybrid image classification method was used to produce LULC maps using Landsat Thematic mapper TM for the year of 1998 and operational land imager OLI for the year of 2016. Images were classified using the proposed hybrid image classification method, vegetation cover crown percentage map from normalized difference vegetation index, Fisher supervised classification and object-based image classification methods. Accuracy assessment results showed that the hybrid classification method produced maps with total accuracy up to 84 percent with kappa statistic value 0.81. Results of this study showed that the proposed classification method worked better with OLI sensor than with TM. Although OLI has a higher radiometric resolution than TM, the produced LULC map using TM is almost accurate like OLI, which is because of LULC definitions and image classification methods used.

TI  - Assessment of Water Management Changes in the Italian Rice Paddies from 2000 to 2016 Using Satellite Data: A Contribution to Agro-Ecological Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensive rice cultivation area in northwestern Italy hosts the largest surface of rice paddies in Europe, and it is valued as a substantial habitat for aquatic biodiversity, with the paddies acting as a surrogate for the lost natural wetlands. The extent of submerged paddies strictly depends on crop management practices: in this framework, the recent diffusion of rice seeding in dry conditions has led to a reduction of flooded surfaces during spring and could have contributed to the observed decline of the populations of some waterbird species that exploit rice fields as foraging habitat. In order to test the existence and magnitude of a decreasing trend in the extent of submerged rice paddies during the rice-sowing period, MODIS remotely-sensed data were used to estimate the extent of the average flooded surface and the proportion of flooded rice fields in the years 2000-2016 during the nesting period of waterbirds. A general reduction of flooded rice fields during the rice-sowing season was observed, averaging -0.86 +/- 0.20% per year (p-value < 0.01). Overall, the loss in submerged surface area during the sowing season reached 44% of the original extent in 2016, with a peak of 78% in the sub-districts to the east of the Ticino River. Results highlight the usefulness of remote sensing data and techniques to map and monitor water dynamics within rice cropping systems. These techniques could be of key importance to analyze the effects at the regional scale of the recent increase of dry-seeded rice cultivations on watershed recharge and water runoff and to interpret the decline of breeding waterbirds via a loss of foraging habitat.

TI  - QUANTIFYING THE VEGETATION HEALTH BASED ON THE RESILIENCE IN AN ARID SYSTEM
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper management of natural ecosystems is not possible without the knowledge of the health status of its components. Vegetation, as the main component of the ecosystem, plays an important role in its health. One of the key determinants of vegetation health is its resilience in the face of environmental disorders. This research was conducted in parts of the Namakzar-e Khaf watershed in Northeast of South Khorasan Province with the aim of quantifying the vegetative resilience on behalf of the ecosystem health in response to long-term precipitation changes. First, the annual precipitation standardization was performed during a thirty-year period by the SPI method. Then, the average variation in TNDVI index obtained from the Landsat satellite images was examined and the resilience was tested by calculating the four effective factors (amplitude, malleability, damping and hysteresis). According to the results, the amplitude in the survey period was 6.04% and the vegetation has had different values of damping over the years. The most prominent example of vegetation resilience occurred between 1986 and 1996, with malleability of 0.7 and damping of zero. Vegetation in this period, after the elimination of drought effects (1986), has not only returned to the amount of vegetation of reference year with severe precipitation (1996) but also increased by 0.25%. This increase, as the index of hysteresis, has been presented for the first time in the ecosystem health discussion quantitatively in the present study. A set of quantitative calculations showed that despite reduced annual precipitation and drought events, the vegetation has been able to maintain its resilience, which indicates the health of vegetation in the studied ecosystem.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a proliferation of studies concerning Ethiopian Jews (formerly known as "Beta Israel") and their lives while still in Ethiopia, a topic that has not been studied enough is their lives during the turbulent period of the 1974 revolution and the civil war that followed (ending 1991). According to most existing (Israeli) literature, this group was completely cut off from these events, or at most passively affected by them.The present study, based on 17 in-depth interviews with Ethiopian-born Israelis, shows that some members of the community were indeed deeply involved in these historical events, as political activists and/or military rebels in one of two major political parties: the TPLF and the EPRP. After a short historical introduction, the study discusses the central themes that emerged from the interviews: (1) the interviewees' deep identification with universal and contemporary ideology, (2) their deep solidarity with Ethiopia and with the organizations they belonged to, (3) abandonment of revolutionary ideology and politics after arrival in Israel. The central argument in the concluding part is that this chapter in the community's history was forgotten because it did not accord with the Ethiopian Jews' intended role as reinforcement of the official Zionist narrative of the negation of exile. This oblivion meant that the community was constructed in the Israeli public imagination as pre-modern, detached from modern ideologies and characterized by a very limited worldview.

TI  - Appraisal of Soil Conservation Capacity Using NDVI Model-Based C Factor of RUSLE Model for a Semi Arid Ungauged Watershed: a Case Study
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) have been used to map and quantify vulnerability of soil erosion in a semi arid ungauged Jhagrabaria watershed of Allahabad district of state Uttar Pradesh, India. The spatial pattern of average annual soil erosion rate was estimated by integrating different thematic layers at GIS platform. GIS vector layers including, rainfall erosivity (Ro), slope length and steepness (LS) factor, soil erodibility (K), conservation practices (P), and cover management factor (C) have been estimated using satellite data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), respectively. The resultant map of average annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss in range of 0.3 to 0.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) (82.41 km(2) and 54.92% of watershed area). While maximum soil loss ranges from > 9.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) (0.67 km(2) and 0.45% of watershed) was reported under hillocks (lower part) of the study area. The work outlines that the vegetation cover arrests the soil erosion in the region. The study provides spatial erosion risk maps of 30 m. These maps will be useful in developing better strategies for land planning and management in the environmentally sensitive small hillocks areas.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Punjab, Pakistan is famous for rice production in all over the world, but economic indicators are low toward rice contribution in the regional economy. Climatic and physical factors are responsible for rice yield degradation. Suitable land for rice cultivation can be mapped keeping in view these climatic and physical factors. In this research, rice cultivation season was calculated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) time series datasets for the complete year 2014. Landsat 8 thermal datasets were obtained for the rice cultivation season and temperature based growth variability maps were generated. The total area under investigation was 13,657 km(2) out of which 931.61 km(2) (6.8%) was found to be least suitable, 3316.69 km(2) (24.2%) was moderately suitable, 6019.63 km(2) (44%) was highly suitable and 3395.28 km(2) (24.85%) was not suitable for rice crop cultivation. Results showed that highly suitable area was characterized by a temperature range between 21 and 32 degrees C, soil pH level between 5.5 and 7.2, soil type was < 78% clay and the soil was imperfectly drained. We compared land suitability map covering the complete land use with rice cultivated area only and found the results as follows: 592 km(2) (5.9%) rice cultivation was in least suitable, 4385 km(2) (44%) cultivation was in highly suitable, 2210 km(2) (23.2%) cultivation was in moderately suitable and 1674 km(2) (16.8%) cultivation was in not suitable regions. The techniques applied in this research may be used by local farmers to select cropping patterns and land suitability for rice crop.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - We suffer due to almost all types of natural hazards. Yet, there is no permanent solution to these disaster related negative impacts. One can understand our limitations in addressing earthquakes, tsunamis, avalanches and unusual cloud bursts. Many wonder why do we continue to suffer year after year due to floods and droughts, when there is vast data available about location and magnitude of these two disasters. Even after significant technological developments in locating drought prone locations and area specific dynamics of droughts through remote sensing our efforts to lessen the impact due to droughts continue to persist due to various factors including lack of co-ordination between experts and suffering common man and farmers.Occurrence of Droughts and floods in one part of the country or the other has become a regular feature, affecting almost entire population of our country directly or indirectly. 2017 Southwest monsoon has created havoc in the north eastern states, especially Assam. Even though experts predict good rains in 2017, the prolonged dry spells followed by good showers is hurting the farmer in ensuring proper sowing operations. Monsoon aberrations and absence of a set pattern of rains has enhanced percentage of occurrence of agriculture drought. As per standard definition a drought is a period of drier-than-normal conditions that results in water-related problems. Precipitation (rain or snow) falls in uneven patterns across the country leading to indecision regarding sowing operations. The resultant setbacks due to insufficient water availability make farming community socio-economically vulnerable and distraught. This set back reflects in escalation of food prices and over all despondency in the part of rural and urban labour and water crisis resultant setbacks to middle class and at places even upper middle and rich. Drought can have many devastating effects on communities and the surrounding environment. The amount of devastation depends on the strength of the drought and the length of time an area is considered to be in drought conditions. Drought has greater impacts on poorer communities than on more prosperous communities who have better opportunities to bring in resources from other areas. Drought, however, can be very harsh at times on any type of community, including the rich. Drought prediction at least couple of months before can help agricultural operations significantly. In spite of noteworthy scientific studies involving remote sensing data and on land hydrological parameters we are yet to master the art of proper forecasting. However, in the recent past reasonable success has been achieved. All the details pertaining to basics and state of the art drought forecasting are detailed in this write up, hoping details at one place can help focused future research studies.

TI  - Constraints on the geomorphological evolution of the nested summit craters of Lascar volcano from high spatio-temporal resolution TerraSAR-X interferometry
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale geomorphological changes that are associated with the formation, development, and activity of volcanic craters and eruptive vents are often challenging to characterize, as they may occur slowly over time, can be spatially localized, and difficult, or dangerous, to access. Using high-spatial and high-temporal resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected by the German TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite in SpotLight mode in combination with precise topographic data as derived from Pleiades-1A satellite data, we investigate the surface deformation within the nested summit crater system of Lascar volcano, Chile, the most active volcano of the central Andes. Our aim is to better understand the structural evolution of the three craters that comprise this system, to assess their physical state and dynamic behavior, and to link this to eruptive activity and associated hazards. Using multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) from ascending and descending orbital geometries, we retrieve the vertical and east-west components of the displacement field. This time series indicates constant rates of subsidence and asymmetric horizontal displacements of all summit craters between June 2012 and July 2014, as well as between January 2015 and March 2017. The vertical and horizontal movements that we observe in the central crater are particularly complex and cannot be explained by any single crater formation mechanism; rather, we suggest that short-term activities superimposed on a combination of ongoing crater evolution processes, including gravitational slumping, cooling and compaction of eruption products, as well as possible piston-like subsidence, are responsible for the small-scale geomorphological changes apparent in our data. Our results demonstrate how high-temporal resolution synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) time series can add constraints on the geomorphological evolution and structural dynamics of active crater and vent systems at volcanoes worldwide.

TI  - Changing northern vegetation conditions are influencing barren ground caribou (<i>Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus</i>) post-calving movement rates
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo quantify changes in vegetation productivity over the past three decades across five barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) herd ranges and assess how these changes are influencing caribou movement rates.LocationNorthwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada.MethodsAs an indicator of vegetation productivity, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was calculated on newly developed cloud-free, gap-free, Landsat surface reflectance image composites representing 1984-2012. Changes in EVI were assessed on a pixel basis using Theil-Sen's nonparametric regression and compared across herd ranges and land cover types using generalized least squares regression. Animal movement velocity was calculated from caribou telemetry data and generalized additive mixed models were used to link movement rates with vegetation productivity during the post-calving phase of the year (July and August).ResultsVegetation productivity increased across the five caribou herd ranges examined. The largest productivity increase occurred over the ranges of the most western herds, with the largest observed changes in grassland or shrub habitats. Caribou tended to move more slowly through tundra habitats with elevated levels of productivity to a point, while grasslands movement rates decreased linearly with increasing productivity. Movement velocities peaked at intermediate productivity levels in shrub habitats.Main conclusionsOver the three decades of collected data, barren ground caribou habitats have become more productive, which is consistent with other studies that have documented increases in Arctic vegetation productivity. The more western herds, whose ranges are also closest to the Arctic Ocean, experienced the largest increases in productivity. Finally, we demonstrate that barren ground caribou movement patterns will likely change as a result of changing vegetation productivity in complex manners depending on herd, habitat type and the magnitude of change in vegetation productivity.

TI  - Quantifying the Spatiotemporal Pattern of Urban Expansion and Hazard and Risk Area Identification in the Kaski District of Nepal
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study utilized time-series Landsat images to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and land use/land-cover (LULC) change in the Kaski District of Nepal from 1988 to 2016. For the specific overtime analysis of change, the LULC transition was clustered into six time periods: 1988-1996, 1996-2000, 2000-2004, 2004-2008, 2008-2013, and 2013-2016. The classification was carried out using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and 11 LULC categories were identified. The classified images were further used to predict LULC change scenarios for 2025 and 2035 using the hybrid cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model. Major hazard risk areas were identified using available databases, satellite images, literature surveys, and field observations. Extensive field visits were carried out for ground truth data acquisition to verify the LULC maps and identify multihazard risk areas. The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map for each year was observed to be from 85% to 93%. We explored the remarkable increase in urban/built-up areas from 24.06 km(2) in 1988 to 60.74 km(2) by 2016. A majority of urban/built-up areas were sourced from cultivated land. For the six time periods, totals of 91.04%, 78.68%, 75.90%, 90.44%, 92.35%, and 99.46% of the newly expanded urban land were sourced from cultivated land. Various settlements within and away from the city of Pokhara and cultivated land at the river banks were found at risk. A fragile geological setting, unstable slopes, high precipitation, dense settlement, rampant urbanization, and discrete LULC change are primarily accountable for the increased susceptibility to hazards. The predicted results showed that the urban area is likely to continue to grow by 2025 and 2035. Despite the significant transformation of LULC and the prevalence of multiple hazards, no previous studies have undertaken a long-term time-series and simulation of the LULC scenario. Updated district-level databases of urbanization and hazards related to the Kaski District were lacking. Hence, the research results will assist future researchers and planners in developing sustainable expansion policies that may ensure disaster-resilient sustainable urban development of the study area.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of land surface temperature and temperature lapse rate over mountainous Kashmir Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its lapse rate over the mountainous Kashmir Himalaya was estimated using MODIS data and correlated with the observed in-situ air temperature (T (air)) data. Comparison between the MODIS LST and T (air) showed a close agreement with the maximum error of the estimate +/- 1A degrees C and the correlation coefficient > 0.90. Analysis of the LST data from 2002-2012 showed an increasing trend at all the selected locations except at a site located in the southeastern part of Kashmir valley. Using the GTOPO30 DEM, MODIS LST data was used to estimate the actual temperature lapse rate (ATLR) along various transects across Kashmir Himalaya, which showed significant variations in space and time ranging from 0.3A degrees C to 1.2A degrees C per 100 m altitude change. This observation is at variance with the standard temperature lapse rate (STLR) of 0.65A degrees C used universally in most of the hydrological and other land surface models. Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was used to determine the efficacy of using the ATLR for simulating the stream flows in one of the glaciated and snow-covered watersheds in Kashmir. The use of ATLR in the SRM model improved the R2 between the observed and predicted streamflows from 0.92 to 0.97. It is hoped that the operational use of satellite-derived LST and ATLR shall improve the understanding and quantification of various processes related to climate, hydrology and ecosystem in the mountainous and data-scarce Himalaya where the use of temperature and ATLR are critical parameters for understanding various land surface and climate processes.

TI  - Computed tomographic-lymphography as a complementary technique for lymph node staging in dogs with malignant tumors of various sites
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Locoregional lymph nodes are routinely examined in order to define the spatial extent of neoplastic disease. As draining patterns of certain tumor types can be divergent from expected anatomical distribution, it is critical to sample the lymph nodes truly representing the draining area. The aim of this bicenter prospective pilot study was to describe the technique of computed tomographic (CT)-lymphography for primary draining lymph node mapping in tumor staging in dogs. Forty-five dogs with macro- or microscopic tumors in specified localizations were evaluated. Depending on body weight, 0.8-2ml contrast agent (iohexol) was injected into four quadrants around the tumor, and CT-images were obtained at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12minutes post-injection. Attenuation of chosen regions of interest (Hounsfield units (HU)) and patterns of enhancement were assessed for 284 lymph nodes in the precontrast study with median HUs of 31.1 (Interquartile range (IQR)=18.4) and for 275 in the intravenous postcontrast study with 104.3 HU (IQR=31.2) (paired Wilcoxon test, P<0.001). In the CT-lymphography study, 45 primary draining lymph nodes with a significantly higher median HU value of 348.5 (IQR=591.4) (one-sample t-test, P<0.001) were identified. Primary draining lymph nodes were found to be clearly visible after 1-3 minutes after local injection, often concurrent with a good visibility of the lymphatic vessel system. The herein described technique of peritumorally injected CT-contrast agent followed by subsequent CT-lymphography for primary draining lymph node mapping works well in a majority of cases in all investigated sites and warrants further validation for different tumor entities.

TI  - Open digital mapping as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and assessing the carbon stock of tropical peatlands
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatland holds a large amount of carbon in the terrestrial ecosystem. Indonesia, responding to the global climate issues, has legislation on the protection and management of the peat ecosystem. However, this effort is hampered by the lack of fine-scale, accurate maps of peat distribution and its thickness. This paper presents an open digital mapping methodology, which utilises open data in an open-source computing environment, as a cost-effective method for mapping peat thickness and estimating carbon stock in Indonesian peatlands. The digital mapping methodology combines field observations with factors that are known to influence peat thickness distribution. These factors are represented by multi-source remotely-sensed data derived from open and freely available raster data: digital elevation models (DEM) from SRTM, geographical information, and radar images (Sentinel and ALOS PALSAR). Utilising machine-learning models from an open-source software, we derived spatial prediction functions and mapped peat thickness and its uncertainty at a grid resolution of 30 m. Peat volume can be calculated from the thickness map, and based on measurements of bulk density and carbon content, carbon stock for the area was estimated. The uncertainty of the estimates was calculated using error propagation rules. We demonstrated this approach in the eastern part of Bengkalis Island in Riau Province, covering an area around 50,000 ha. Results showed that digital mapping method can accurately predict the thickness of peat, explaining up to 98% of the variation of the data with a median relative error of 5% or an average error of 0.3 m. The accuracy of this method depends on the number of field observations. We provided an estimate of the cost and time required for map production, i.e. 2 to 4 months with a cost between $0.3 and $0.5/ha for an area of 50,000 ha. Obviously, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. The advantages and limitations of the method were further discussed. The methodology provides a blueprint for a national-scale peat mapping.

TI  - Forest fire spread simulation algorithm based on cellular automata
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional models result in low efficiency and poor accuracy when simulating the spread of large-scale forest fires. We constructed an improved model that couples cellular automata with an existing forest fire model to ensure better time accuracy of forest fire spread. Our model considers the impact of time steps on simulation accuracy to provide an optimal time step value. The model was tested using a case study of forest fire spread at Daxing'an Mountain in May 2006. The results show that the optimal time step for the forest fire spread geographic cellular automata simulation algorithm is 1/8 of the time taken for cellular material to be completely combusted. When compared with real fire data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, our model was found to have high temporal and spatial consistency, with a mean Kappa coefficient of 0.6352 and mean accuracy of 87.89%. This algorithm can be used to simulate and predict forest fire spread and is also reversible (i.e., it can identify fire source points).

TI  - Application of the Spectral Neighborhood of Soil Line Technique to Analyze the Intensity of Soil Use in 1985-2014 (by the Example of Three Districts of Tula Oblast)
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of separation of the spectral neighborhood of soil line (SNSL) makes it possible to perform quantitative estimates of the intensity of agricultural land use. This is achieved via calculation of the frequency of occurrence of bare soil surface (BSS). It is shown that the frequency of occurrence of BSS in 1984-1994 was linearly related to the soil type within the sequence of soddy strongly podzolic, soddy moderately podzolic, soddy slightly podzolic (Eutric Albic Glossic Retisols (Loamic, Aric, Cutanic, Differentic, Ochric)); light gray forest (Eutric Retisols (Loamic, Aric, Cutanic, Differentic, Ochric)), gray forest (Eutric Retisols (Loamic, Aric, Cutanic, Ochric)), and dark gray forest soils (Luvic Retic Greyzemic Phaeozems (Loamic, Aric)); podzolized chernozems (Luvic Greyzemic Chernic Phaeozems (Loamic, Aric, Pachic)) and leached chernozems (Luvic Chernic Phaeozems (Loamic, Aric, Pachic)). The intensity of exploitation of the least and most fertile soils in this sequence comprised 28 and 48%, respectively. In the next decade (1995-2004) the relationship between the type of soil and the intensity of its exploitation drastically changed; the intensity of exploitation of the leas and most fertile soils comprised 14 and 43%, respectively. Nearly a half of agricultural lands in the zones of soddy-podzolic and gray forest soils were abandoned, because the cultivation of the soils with the natural fertility below that in the podzolized chernozems became economically unfeasible under conditions of the economic crisis of the 1990s. The spatiotemporal relationships between the character of the soil cover and the intensity of exploitation of the agricultural lands manifest themselves by the decreasing frequency of occurrence of BSS from leached chernozems to soddy strongly podzolic soils and from 1985 to 2014.

TI  - Application of lineament density extracted from dual orbit of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to detecting fluids paths in the Wayang Windu geothermal field (West Java, Indonesia)
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineaments appearing on satellite images were used to characterize a regional fracture system. Manual extraction of lineaments is subjective and difficult to extend to a wide area because smaller lineaments may be overlooked. To increase the extraction accuracy of fracture-related lineaments and specify fractures that act as geothermal fluid paths with high permeability, this study adopts Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data because the backscattering intensities of SAR images can enhance small topographical reliefs relevant to fractures by using oblique microwave irradiation. We used two Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite with opposing irradiation directions to reduce the effect of topographic distortion caused by the oblique irradiation. Lineaments are extracted using the modified Segment Tracing Algorithm filtered by the Laplacian of Gaussian for linear features enhancement and noise removal. Surface geothermal features at the Wayang Windu geothermal field, West Java, Indonesia, were confirmed by comparing with soil pH, magnetic susceptibility, and surface roughness measurements. The calculated lineament distribution was spatially characterized by the intersection, occurrence frequency, and length densities of the lineaments. An ordinary kriging map of the lineament length density using 1 x 1-km cells showed good agreement with the geothermal surface features (hydrothermally altered zones, mud pools, and hot springs), which were probably formed by highly permeable fractures and fluid ascent. The high-anomaly zones of length density overlapped two fluid ascent sites and three water recharge sites in the water- and steam-dominated geothermal systems, respectively.

TI  - Generating Continental Scale Pixel-Based Surface Reflectance Composites in Coastal Regions with the Use of a Multi-Resolution Tidal Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating continental-scale pixel composites in dynamic coastal and estuarine environments presents a unique challenge, as the application of a temporal or seasonal approach to composite generation is confounded by tidal influences. We demonstrate how this can be resolved using an approach to compositing that provides robust composites of multi-type environments. In addition to the visual aesthetics of the images created, we demonstrate the utility of these composites for further interpretation and analysis. This is enabled by the manner in which our approach captures the spatial variation in tidal dynamics through the use of a Voronoi mesh, and preserves the band relationships within the modelled spectra at each pixel. Case studies are presented which include continental-scale mosaics of the Australian coastline at high and low tide, and tailored examples demonstrating the potential of the tidally constrained composites to address a range of coastal change detection and monitoring applications. We conclude with a discussion on the potential applications of the composite products and method in the coastal and marine environment, as well as further development directions for our tidal modelling framework.

TI  - On Predictability of Groundwater Level in Shallow Wells Using Satellite Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of groundwater resources needs continuous and efficient monitoring networks. Sparsity of in situ measurements both spatially and temporally creates hindrance in framing groundwater management policies. Remotely sensed data can be a possible alternative. GRACE satellites can trace groundwater changes globally. Moreover, gridded rainfall (RF) and soil moisture (SM) data can shed some light on the hydrologic system. The present study attempts to use GRACE, RF and SM data at a local scale to predict groundwater level. Ground referencing of satellite data were done by using three machine learning techniques- Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Method (RFM) and Gradient Boosting Mechanism (GBM). The performance of the developed methodology was tested on a part of the Indo-Gangetic basin. The analyses were carried out for nine GRACE pixels to identify relationship between individual well measurements and satellite-derived data. These nine pixels are classified on the basis of presence or absence of hydrological features. Pixels with the presence of perennial streams showed reasonably good results. However, pixels with wells located mostly near the stream gave relatively poorer predictions. These results help in identifying wells which can reasonably represent the regional shallow groundwater dynamics.

T2  - JEWISH STUDIES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the encounter between religious Orthodoxy and Liberalism in 19th and early 20th-century America. Studying the writings of Orthodox rabbis who emigrated as adults from Eastern Europe to the United States, it analyzes how these Jewish thinkers, who were raised and shaped within the Orthodox, non-democratic worldview, understand Jewish life in a country with a declared liberal ethos and political reality. While much has been written about Jewish immigration in general, and Orthodox immigrants to America in particular, from the historical, sociological and anthropological points of view, less attention has been given to the political and epistemological dimensions of this encounter. The current paper focuses on this less explored topic, offering a conceptual/political analysis of an encounter between two different and perhaps conflicting political and epistemological worldviews.

TI  - Coral reef connectivity within the Western Gulf of Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The yearlong monthly mean satellite data of the geostrophic velocities, the sea surface temperature and the chlorophyll-a values were used to elucidate any possible pathway among the different coral reef systems of the Western Gulf of Mexico (WGM). The geostrophic current velocities suggested different pathways connecting the coral reef areas. The typical coastal alongshore pathway constricted to the continental shelf, and two open ocean pathway, the first connecting the Campeche Reef System (CRS) with the Veracruz (VRS) and Tuxpan-Lobos Reef Systems (TLRS), and the second pathway connecting the Tuxpan-Lobos Reef System with the Flower Garden Reef System (FGRS). According to the pathways there should be more larvae transport from the southern Gulf of Mexico reef systems toward the FGRS than the other way. The connection from the southern Gulf of Mexico toward the FGRS took place during January, May, July, August and September (2015), while the connection from the FGRS toward the southern Gulf of Mexico reef system took place during January and February (2015), this was also suggested via model outputs. The density radio (R) was used as a first approximation to elucidate the influence of the freshwater continental discharges within the continental shelf. All coral reef areas were located where the Chlorophyll-a monthly mean values had values bellow 1 mg m(-2) with a density radio between 0 and 1, i.e. under the influence of continental discharges.

AB  - Changing atmospheric conditions often result in a data distribution shift in remote sensing images for different dates and locations making it difficult to discriminate between various classes of interest. To alleviate this data shift issue, we introduce a novel supervised classification framework, called Classify-Normalize-Classify (CNC). The proposed scheme uses a two classifier approach where the first classifier performs a rough segmentation of the class of interest (COI) in the input image. Then, the median signal of the estimated COI regions is subtracted from all image pixels values to normalize them. Finally, the second classifier is applied to the normalized image to produce the refined COI segmentation. The proposed methodology was tested to detect deforestation using bitemporal Landsat 8 OLI images over the Amazon rainforest. The CNC framework compared favorably to benchmark masks of the PRODES program and state-of-the-art classifiers run on surface reflectance images provided by USGS.

TI  - Campo Verde Database: Seeking to Improve Agricultural Remote Sensing of Tropical Areas
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical/subtropical regions, the favorable climate associated with the use of agricultural technologies, such as no tillage, minimum cultivation, irrigation, early varieties, desiccants, flowering inducing, and crop rotation, makes agriculture highly dynamic. In this letter, we present the Campo Verde agricultural database. The purpose of creating and sharing these data is to foster advancement of remote sensing technology in areas of tropical agriculture, primarily the development and testing of methods for crop recognition and agricultural mapping. Campo Verde is a municipality of Mato Grosso state, localized in the Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) biome, in central west Brazil. Soybean, maize, and cotton are the primary crops cultivated in this region. Double cropping systems are widely adopted in this area. There is also livestock and forestry production. Our database provides the land-use classes for 513 fields by month for one Brazilian crop year (between October 2015 and July 2016). This information was gathered during two field campaigns in Campo Verde (December 2015 and May 2016) and by visual interpretation of a time series of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images using an experienced interpreter. A set of 14 preprocessed synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 and 15 Landsat-8/OLI mosaic images is also made available. It is important to promote the use of radar data for tropical agricultural applications, especially because the use of optical remote sensing in these regions is hindered by the high frequency of cloud cover. To demonstrate the utility of our database, results of an experiment conducted using the Sentinel-1 data set are presented.

TI  - Mapping Wildfire Ignition Probability Using Sentinel 2 and LiDAR (Jerte Valley, Caceres, Spain)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a major threat to the environment, and this threat is aggravated by different climatic and socioeconomic factors. The availability of detailed, reliable mapping and periodic and immediate updates makes wildfire prevention and extinction work more effective. An analyst protocol has been generated that allows the precise updating of high-resolution thematic maps. For this protocol, images obtained through the Sentinel 2A satellite, with a return time of five days, have been merged with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with a density of 0.5 points/m(2) in order to obtain vegetation mapping with an accuracy of 88% (kappa = 0.86), which is then extrapolated to fuel model mapping through a decision tree. This process, which is fast and reliable, serves as a cartographic base for the later calculation of ignition-probability mapping. The generated cartography is a fundamental tool to be used in the decision making involved in the planning of preventive silvicultural treatments, extinguishing media distribution, infrastructure construction, etc.

TI  - New public health challenges in vector management: black flies in Murcia (Spain)
T2  - GACETA SANITARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, no black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) nuisance has been reported in the Murcia Region. Back in September 2016 the Ojos City Council has contacted the Regional Public Health General Directorate for help regarding a local insect nuisance, most probably based on mosquitoes. After sampling with a BG-sentinel 2 trap, collecting adult specimens with an entomological aspirator, and collect larvae and pupae on submerged giant cane stalks at the river, it turned out that Simulium sergenti was the insect species causing the nuisance. This species is not considered particularly anthropophilic: therefore, a low vector risk for human health was considered. However, the high fly density impaired the life quality of the people at the village. A management plan was recommended, treating the river with Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis.

TI  - Impact of African Traditional Worldviews on Climate Change Adaptation
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies show cultural worldviews are a key determinant of environmental risk perceptions; thus, they could influence climate change adaptation strategies. African traditional worldviews encourage harmony between humans and the environment through a complex metaphysical belief system transmitted through folklore, taboos, and traditional knowledge. However, African traditional worldviews hold a belief in traditional gods that was shown to have a low connectedness to nature and a low willingness to change. In Makueni District, Kenya, 45% of agropastoralists surveyed believed drought was god's plan and could not be changed. In contrast, traditional knowledge, which is shaped by African traditional worldviews, is often used to frame adaptive strategies such as migration, changing modes of production, and planting different crop varieties. Furthermore, traditional knowledge has been used as a complement to science in areas where meteorological data was unavailable. However, the role of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaption remains understudied. Hence, there is a need to systematically establish the influence of African traditional worldviews on climate change risk perception, development of adaptive strategies, and policy formulation and implementation. In this commentary, we discuss the potential impacts of African traditional worldviews on climate change adaptation. (C) 2018 SETAC

TI  - On the synergy of SMAP, AMSR2 AND SENTINEL-1 for retrieving soil moisture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for retrieving soil moisture content (SMC) from synergic use of both active and passive microwave acquisitions is presented. The algorithm takes advantage of the integration of microwave data from SMAP, Sentinel-1 and AMSR2 for overcoming the SMAP radar failure and obtaining a SMC product at enhanced resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) and improved accuracy with respect to the original SMAP radiometric SMC product. A disaggregation technique based on the Smoothing filter based intensity modulation (SFIM) allows combining the radiometric and SAR data. Disaggregated microwave data are used as inputs of an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based algorithm, which is able to exploit the synergy between active and passive acquisitions. The algorithm is defined, trained and tested using the SMEX02 experimental dataset and data simulated by forward electromagnetic models based on the Radiative Transfer Theory. Then the algorithm is adapted to satellite data and tested using one year of SMAP, AMSR2 and Sentinel-1 co-located data on a flat agricultural area located in the Po Valley, in northern Italy. Spatially distributed SMC values at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution generated by the Soil Water Balance Model (SWBM) are considered as reference for this purpose. The synergy of SMAP, Sentinel-1 and AMSR2 allowed increasing the correlation between estimated and reference SMC from R congruent to 0.68 of the SMAP based retrieval up to R congruent to 0.86 of the combination SMAP + Sentinel-1 + AMSR2. The corresponding Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased from RMSE at 0.04 m(3)/m(3) to RMSE congruent to 0.024 m(3)/m(3).

TI  - Satellite view of seasonal greenness trends and controls in South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - South Asia (SA) has been considered one of the most remarkable regions for changing vegetation greenness, accompanying its major expansion of agricultural activities, especially irrigated farming. The influence of the monsoon climate on the seasonal trends and anomalies of vegetation greenness is poorly understood in this area. Herein, we used the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate various spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation activity during summer and winter monsoon (SM and WM) seasons and among irrigated croplands (IC), rainfed croplands (RC), and natural vegetation (NV) areas during 1982-2013. Seasonal NDVI variations with climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) and land use and cover changes (LUCC) have also been investigated. This study demonstrates that the seasonal dynamics of vegetation could improve the detailed understanding of vegetation productivity over the region. We found distinct greenness trends between two monsoon seasons and among the major land use/cover classes. Winter monsoons contributed greater variability to the overall vegetation dynamics of SA. Major greening occurred due to the increased productivity over irrigated croplands during the winter monsoon season; meanwhile, browning trends were prominent over NV areas during the same season. Maximum temperatures had been increasing tremendously during the WM season; however, the precipitation trend was not significant over SA. Both the climate variability and LUCC revealed coupled effects on the long term NDVI trends in NV areas, especially in the hilly regions, whereas anthropogenic activities (agricultural advancements) played a pivotal role in the rest of the area. Until now, advanced cultivation techniques have proven to be beneficial for the region in terms of the productivity of croplands. However, the crop productivity is at risk under climate change.

TI  - A network model for primary production highlights linkages between salmonid populations and autochthonous resources
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variation in fish densities across river networks suggests that the influence of food and habitat resources on assemblages varies greatly throughout watersheds. Conceptual models predict that in situ primary production should vary with river characteristics, but the influence of autochthonous resource availability on the capacity for river reaches to support fish is poorly understood. We estimated primary production throughout the South Fork and Middle Fork of the John Day River, Oregon, by measuring diel cycles in dissolved oxygen (DO) during July 2013. Using these data, we (1) evaluated the extent to which juvenile salmonid abundance and resource limitation correlated with areas of high gross primary production (GPP), (2) developed models to predict GPP from both site-level measurements and remotely sensed data, and (3) made predictions of GPP across the entirety of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD) network and assessed the utility of these spatially continuous predictions for describing variation fish densities at broad scales. We produced reliable estimates of GPP at sites where DO loggers were deployed using measurements of solar exposure, water temperature, and conductivity measured at each site, as well as surrogates for these data estimated from remote sensing data sources. Estimates of GPP across fish sampling sites explained, on average, 58-63% of the variation in juvenile salmonid densities during the summer sampling period, and 51-83% during the fall sampling period, while continuous network predictions of GPP explained 44% of the variation in fish densities across 29 km of the MFJD. Further, GPP explained nearly half of the variation in juvenile steel-head dietary resource limitation, as inferred from bioenergetics modeling results. These results comprise a first effort at quantifying variation in autochthonous production across an entire river network and, importantly, provide a much-needed food-web context for guiding more effective fish and habitat management.

TI  - Multitemporal SAR Data and 2D Hydrodynamic Model Flood Scenario Dynamics Assessment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of floods and the severity of their consequences, which is caused by phenomena, such as climate change and uncontrolled urbanization, create a growing need to develop operational procedures and tools for accurate and timely flood mapping and management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its day, night, and cloud-penetrating capacity, has proven to be a very useful source of information during calibration of hydrodynamic models considered indispensable tools for near real-time flood forecasting and monitoring. The paper begins with the analysis of radar signatures of temporal series of SAR data, by exploiting the short revisit time of the images that are provided by the Cosmo-SkyMed constellation of four satellites, in combination with a Digital Elevation Model for the extraction of flood extent and spatially distributed water depth in a flat area with complex topography during a flood event. These SAR-based hazard maps were then used to perform a bi-dimensional hydraulic model calibration on the November 2010 flood event at the mouth of the Bradano River in Basilicata, Italy. Once the best fit between flood predictions of hydrodynamic models was identified and the efficacy of SAR data in correcting hydrodynamic inconsistencies with regard to reliable assessment of flood extent and water-depth maps was shown by validation with the December 2013 Bradano River event. Based on calibration and validation results, the paper aims to show how the combination of the time series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived water-depth maps with the data from the hydrodynamic model can provide valuable information for flood dynamics monitoring in a flat area with complex topography. Future research should focus on the integration and implementation of the semi-automatic proposed method in an operational system for near real-time flood management.

TI  - Two approaches to calculate TVDI in humid subtropical climate of southern Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean crops occupy most areas in Rio Grande do Sul State and are highly dependent on rainfall since most of them are non-irrigated. Rainfall during the harvest period is often insufficient to meet the water demand, making water indicators an important tool for the crops. This study compared two approaches in the parameterization process of TVDI (Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index) in a subtropical climate region of Brazil. The process used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the surface temperature (TS) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with spatial resolutions of 1,000 m and periods of 8-16 d, respectively. The evaporative triangles for the T-S/NDVI scatter plots were built either for each image (scene-specific parameterization) or for all images at once (crop-type parameterization). The rainfall data were obtained from meteorological stations located in the study site and the analysis period comprised two contrasting harvests regarding soybean yield (most important crop in the region). The scene-specific parameterization allowed to analyze water status in the study site by inspecting the wet and dry edge of each image and identifying the areas of stress in each one. TVDI crop parameterization showed that the model was able to determine the time and frequency of water stress events during the crop-seasons. TVDI crop-parameterization, therefore, is more consistent for crop monitoring and forecasting purposes.

TI  - Properties of laser-produced GaAs plasmas measured from highly resolved X-ray line shapes and ratios
T2  - HIGH ENERGY DENSITY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The properties of hot, dense plasmas generated by the irradiation of GaAs targets by the Titan laser at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were determined by the analysis of high resolution K shell spectra in the 9 keV to 11 keV range. The laser parameters, such as relatively long pulse duration and large focal spot, were chosen to produce a steady-state plasma with minimal edge gradients, and the time-integrated spectra were compared to non-LTE steady state spectrum simulations using the FLYCHK and NOMAD codes. The bulk plasma streaming velocity was measured from the energy shifts of the Ga He-like transitions and Li-like dielectronic satellites. The electron density and the electron energy distribution, both the thermal and the hot non-thermal components, were determined from the spectral line ratios. After accounting for the spectral line broadening contributions, the plasma turbulent motion was measured from the residual line widths. The ionization balance was determined from the ratios of the He-like through F-like spectral features. The detailed comparison of the experimental Ga spectrum and the spectrum simulated by the FLYCHK code indicates two significant discrepancies, the transition energy of a Li-like dielectronic satellite (designated t) and the calculated intensity of a He-like line (x), that should lead to improvements in the kinetics codes used to simulate the X-ray spectra from highly-charged ions.

TI  - Siberian Smoke Haze over European Territory of Russia in July 2016: Atmospheric Pollution and Radiative Effects
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have characterized the large-scale smoke pollution of the European territory of Russia (ETR) and adjoining areas in July 2017, caused by long-range transport from forest-fire areas in Siberia, confirmed by calculations of ten-day back trajectories of air mass motion to the ETR urban area, spanning Archangelsk to Rostov-on-Don. The smoke-laden ETR area with an AOD > 0.3 (average value being 0.43 and maximal value being 2.5) on July 25, 2016, covered 5 million km(2), and the total smoke mass was similar to 1.2 million tons. It is shown that the daily average mass concentration of aerosol with particle sizes less than 2.5 mu m exceeded the corresponding maximum permissible concentration in the Moscow region during the period from July 24 to 27, 2016. The influence of local sources on aerosol and gas pollution of atmospheric air was estimated. The smoke haze in 2016 was found to be deficient in carbon monoxide as compared to smoke pollution in 2010. It is shown that the thermal and wind stratification in the atmospheric boundary layer markedly influenced the pollution level in the smoke-laden urban atmosphere. Smoke aerosol radiative effect was estimated. The average aerosol radiative forcings at the top and bottom of the atmosphere over ETR on July 25, 2016, were -29 and -53 W/m(2), and extreme forcings reached -112 and -215 W/m(2), respectively.

TI  - Natural disturbances are spatially diverse but temporally synchronized across temperate forest landscapes in Europe
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disturbance regimes are changing substantially in forests around the globe. However, large-scale disturbance change is modulated by a considerable spatiotemporal variation within biomes. This variation remains incompletely understood particularly in the temperate forests of Europe, for which consistent large-scale disturbance information is lacking. Here, our aim was to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of forest disturbances across temperate forest landscapes in Europe using remote sensing data and determine their underlying drivers. Specifically, we tested two hypotheses: (1) Topography determines the spatial patterns of disturbance, and (2) climatic extremes synchronize natural disturbances across the biome. We used novel Landsat-based maps of forest disturbances 1986-2016 in combination with landscape analysis to compare spatial disturbance patterns across five unmanaged forest landscapes with varying topographic complexity. Furthermore, we analyzed annual estimates of disturbances for synchronies and tested the influence of climatic extremes on temporal disturbance patterns. Spatial variation in disturbance patterns was substantial across temperate forest landscapes. With increasing topographic complexity, natural disturbance patches were smaller, more complex in shape, more dispersed, and affected a smaller portion of the landscape. Temporal disturbance patterns, however, were strongly synchronized across all landscapes, with three distinct waves of high disturbance activity between 1986 and 2016. All three waves followed years of pronounced drought and high peak wind speeds. Natural disturbances in temperate forest landscapes of Europe are thus spatially diverse but temporally synchronized. We conclude that the ecological effect of natural disturbances (i.e., whether they are homogenizing a landscape or increasing its heterogeneity) is strongly determined by the topographic template. Furthermore, as the strong biome-wide synchronization of disturbances was closely linked to climatic extremes, large-scale disturbance episodes are likely in Europe's temperate forests under climate changes.

TI  - Evaluating glacier dynamics using temporal remote sensing images: a case study of Hunza Valley, northern Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are the largest freshwater repository on the earth surface. Northern Pakistan is covered with some of the largest midlatitude glaciers in the world. Most of the recent studies on the region lead to contradictory results that glaciers in the Karakoram ranges have shown either advancement, retreat or stable behaviors and therefore coin the term "Karakoram anomaly." In the present study, temporal Landsat satellite images, acquired in the years of 1977, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2014, were used to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the selected glaciers in the Hunza Valley, northern Pakistan, including the Batura, Passu, Ghulkin and Gulmit. The glaciers outlines were extracted using NDSI and slope gradient, followed by manual editing. The Landsat-derived glacier inventories were verified through the fine-resolution WorldView-2 satellite image and field observations. Evaluating the temporal glacier inventories reveals that the selected glaciers are retreating; however, the melting rate is varying depending on the supra-glacier debris cover. The melting or advancing of glacier is also influenced by the mean annual temperature and precipitation records. The study should assist in predicting the future climate of the region.

TI  - Empirical estimation of suspended solids concentration in the Indus Delta Region using Landsat-7 ETM<sub>+</sub> imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended Solids Concentration (SSC) in water is related to its quality and transparency. Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an efficient means of monitoring water quality in large deltas because in situ sampling methods are costly, laborious, time consuming, and spatially constrained. In this study, the potential of Landsat's Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor was explored to develop a model for remote sensing-based quantification of SSC within the large, turbid Indus Delta Region (IDR, south of Pakistan). Six scenes were atmospherically corrected using the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method, to formulate a model for monitoring water quality of the IDR. An empirical model was developed and validated using in situ SSC measurements (9.4-761.4 mg/L) from several data collection campaigns coinciding (within an 11-day window) with satellite overpasses. It was found that using Band 1 (blue: 450-520 nm), Band 2 (green: 520-600 nm), Band 3 (red: 630-690 nm), and Band 5 (shortwave infrared: 1550-1750 nm) of Landsat-7 ETM (+) along with the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) can help in precise and accurate estimation of SSC, resulting in a relatively small Root Mean Square Error of 67.24 mg/L, Mean Absolute Error of 54.75 mg/L, and coefficient of determination of 0.88. Further, it was also evident that residuals do not increase with an increasing time window (0-11 days) between the satellite overpass and in situ data collection. Therefore, the established algorithm can potentially be used for frequent (after 8 days) synoptic mapping of SSC in the IDR and other similar estuarine environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We derive the mass balance of Greenland ice sheet from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for the period January 2003-October 2014. Wehave found an ice mass loss with peak amplitude of -15 cm/yr in the southeastern and northwestern parts, and an acceleration of -2.5 cm/yr(2) in the southwestern region. Global warming is a well-known suspected triggering factor of ice melting. We use MODIS-derived Ice Surface Temperature (IST), and continuous and cross wavelet transforms have been determined to investigate the common power and relative phase between GRACE derived time-series of ice mass changes and IST time-series. Results indicate a high common power between the two time-series for the whole study period, but with different time patterns.

TI  - Long-Term Analysis of Aerosol Optical Depth over the Huaihai Economic Region (HER): Possible Causes and Implications
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of air is increasingly affecting regional climate and human activity. Collection 6 aerosol products retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite were validated based on CE-318 sun photometric data to analyze their applicability in the Huaihai economic region (HER) at the Xuzhou and Shouxian sites. The spatio-temporal variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were also analyzed over HER from 2000 to 2016, with analyses of the correlation with potential driving factors, including meteorology, vegetation and human factors. HER is an economic cooperation organization with multiple industrial structures, containing coal resource-based cities, a national transportation hub and agricultural and high-altitude areas, which shows regional differences in AOD. The results suggest that MODIS Terra AOD products show good agreement with ground observations, with correlation coefficients of above 0.84 in HER, and the main pollutants for high AOD values are fine particles (the mean Angstrom exponent was 1.16). The average annual change in AOD varied with a weak growth trend over the past 17 years, while a transition in 2012 made the tendency change from upward to downward due to the extensive cooperation of cities in the joint prevention and control of the deterioration of the ecological environment. The largest monthly mean AOD value appeared in June, which resulted from significant agricultural residue burning. The spatial distribution of multi-year average AOD occurred with a banded high-value center, extending from the north-west to the south-east. The high aerosol loadings were located in resource-based cities, and industrially developed and south-eastern coastal areas, whereas the regions with relatively low AOD in HER were distributed in the southern agricultural and northern high-altitude areas. The AOD value in the western, northern, and eastern coastal areas of HER showed a significant increasing trend, while no area exhibited a decreasing trend. The average wind speed has the largest negative correlation with the AOD value in terms of the natural driving factors, and GDP (gross domestic product) was more positively correlated with AOD with respect to the human factors, in comparison with population density.

TI  - The first validation of the precipitable water vapor of multisensor satellites over the typical regions in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based observations (2014-2015) indicated that the precipitable water vapor (PWV) values in China exhibited large spatial and temporal variations. The annual mean PWV values ranged from 4.0 +/- 2.9 mm to 42.3 +/- 10.6 mm from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the South China Sea, and the seasonal variation ranged from 1.9 +/- 1.2 mm to 50.5 +/- 5.4 mm. The PWV values were retrieved from MODIS, VIRR and MERSI data, and the accuracies varied widely with relative errors from 10% to 899%. VIRR performed the best in the humid southern coastal regions of China (R = 93%) where the annual PWV was as high as 35 mm. MERSI was more suitable in the dry western region of China (R = 84%) where the average PWV value was lower than 15 mm. MODIS PWV products could be used to accurately observe the PWV in the city and urbanized areas of the eastern China Plain (R = 89%) where the annual mean PWV was 20-30 mm. All of the products yielded larger errors in the summer than in the winter. The MOD05 and MOD07 data performed better than the other satellite data in most regions.

TI  - New Method for Estimating Daily Global Solar Radiation over Sloped Topography in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new scheme for the estimation of daily global solar radiation over sloped topography in China is developed based on the Iqbal model C and MODIS cloud fraction. The effects of topography are determined using a digital elevation model. The scheme is tested using observations of solar radiation at 98 stations in China, and the results show that the mean absolute bias error is 1.51 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and the mean relative absolute bias error is 10.57%. Based on calculations using this scheme, the distribution of daily global solar radiation over slopes in China on four days in the middle of each season (15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October 2003) at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km are analyzed. To investigate the effects of topography on global solar radiation, the results determined in four mountains areas (Tianshan, Kunlun Mountains, Qinling, and Nanling) are discussed, and the typical characteristics of solar radiation over sloped surfaces revealed. In general, the new scheme can produce reasonable characteristics of solar radiation distribution at a high spatial resolution in mountain areas, which will be useful in analyses of mountain climate and planning for agricultural production.

TI  - Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery for Early Gastric Cancer: Analysis of Factors Which Affect Direction of Lymphatic Drainage
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - We started performing sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) using infrared ray electronic endoscopy (IREE) with indocyanine green injection from year 2000. The EGCs usually have complex lymphatic drainage, unidirectional or multidirectional lymphatic flow. In this study, we investigated and clarified factors that affect the direction of gastric lymphatic drainage.Consecutive 60 patients with EGC who underwent SNNS by IREE from year 2006 to 2014 were enrolled to this study. Patients' age, gender, location of tumors, operative method, previous treatment by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), presence of pathological ulcerative scar and maximum tumor diameter were enrolled as parameters which may affect direction of lymphatic drainage and analyzed.Bivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of pathological ulcerative scar (P = 0.01), tumor location (g.c vs. a.w vs. p.w vs. l.c, P = 0.01), and maxim tumor diameter (P = 0.0003) were relevant to direction of gastric lymphatic drainage. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor location (g.c/a.w/p.w vs. l.c, odds ratio 8.227, P = 0.011) and the maximum tumor diameter (odds ratio 1.057, P = 0.037) are independent factors that affect direction of gastric lymphatic flow. Of tumors, 78% located at lesser curvature had unidirectional lymphatic drainage, and 93% of tumors whose diameter was 40 mm and more had multidirectional lymphatic drainage.Our investigation revealed that the tumor location and tumor diameter were the key factors which affect the direction of lymphatic drainage, which is useful fact to understand the complexity of gastric lymphatic drainage.

TI  - Cross-Cultural, Aboriginal Language, Discovery Education for Health Literacy and Informed Consent in a Remote Aboriginal Community in the Northern Territory, Australia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Education for health literacy of Australian Aboriginal people living remotely is challenging as their languages and worldviews are quite different from English language and Western worldviews. Becoming health literate depends on receiving comprehensible information in a culturally acceptable manner. Methods: The study objective was to facilitate oral health literacy through community education about scabies and strongyloidiasis, including their transmission and control, preceding an ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) for these diseases. A discovery education approach where health concepts are connected to cultural knowledge in the local language was used. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal educators worked collaboratively to produce an in-depth flip-chart of the relevant stories in the local language and to share them with clan elders and 27% of the population. Results: The community health education was well received. Feedback indicated that the stories were being discussed in the community and that the mode of transmission of strongyloidiasis was understood. Two-thirds of the population participated in the MDA. This study documents the principles and practice of a method of making important Western health knowledge comprehensible to Aboriginal people. This method would be applicable wherever language and culture of the people differ from language and culture of health professionals.

TI  - Comparison of CK-IHC assay on serial frozen sections, the OSNA assay, and in combination for intraoperative evaluation of SLN metastases in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative evaluations of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases are performed for providing appropriate and immediate axillary treatments in breast cancer patients who do not meet Z0011 criteria; however, standard intraoperative procedure has not yet been established.We consecutively performed intraoperative evaluation for SLN metastases using both a cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (CK-IHC) assay on serial frozen sections and a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay of the remaining whole node in patients with invasive breast cancer. In this article, we compared the intraoperative diagnostic ability of CK-IHC assay, the OSNA assay, and in combination.Between August 2009 and May 2017, 1,103 SLNs from 499 consecutive clinically node-negative invasive breast cancers were intraoperatively evaluated for SLN metastases using an OSNA and CK-IHC assay. The detection rates of SLN metastases by the OSNA and CK-IHC assays and in combination were 11.8, 12.1, and 14.5%, respectively. The concordance rate between the intraoperative SLN findings of the OSNA and CK-IHC assays was 94.9% (95% confidence interval 93.6-96.2%). The false negative rate for the OSNA assay was 3.1% (30/973), including 3 (0.3%) macrometastases and 27 (2.8%) micrometastases, and for the CK-IHC assay was 2.7% (26/969), including 1 (0.1%) OSNA ++ and 25 (2.6%) OSNA +.The CK-IHC assay and the OSNA assay have compatible diagnostic abilities in intraoperative evaluations for SLN metastases. The low incidence of false negative results with limited disease burden suggests that both assays can be reliable techniques for intraoperative diagnoses of SLN metastases in breast cancer patients.

AB  - This research reveals major changes of VFC and drivers in 2000 to 2010 in Guangdong province, China. Using MODIS NDVI, VFC directly calculated. Spatial patterns of VFC changes classified into four levels such as low (<50%), medium (50-70%), high (70-90%) and very high (>90%) in 2000, 2005 and 2010 separately. Time series of VFC showed the fitting curve is a straight line of value 0.783 (78.3%). Results showed that level >90% has highest mean of change annually, with values between 3.89% to 21.44% and level <50% has the lowest mean among all levels. The values of level 50-70% are between 7.79% and 19% and values of level 70-90% are between 68.38% and 77.25%. Trend analysis of VFC showed that in the northern mountainous regions, the economy is undeveloped and there is less human disturbance, leads to having higher VFC. In the southern coastal parts, human disturbance such as industrialization and urbanization can be seen, leads to having low VFC. Plus, using DMSP/OLS, CNLI computed. The driving factors of VFC dynamics considered human activities and climatic factors and finally Pearson correlation coefficient confirmed the relationship between VFC, climatic factors and CNLI. Result showed that VFC is positively correlated with sunshine hour, but VFC is not related to CNLI indicates that at provincial scale over research period of about 10 years, Even though urbanization and industrialization had a defined impact on the change of VFC in some cases.

T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article dwells upon the analysis of the image of the moon in K. Balmont's works in poetic and functioning aspects. The work aims to reveal the features of the poetic embodiment and the symbolic content of the image of the moon in K. Balmont's works. It considers the artistic and semantic realization of the image under study, describes the features of the objectification of its symbolic and associative attributes. Identification of the leading motives associated with the image of the moon, helps to establish its individual semantic scope K. Balmont's individual style.In course of the study, the significance of the image of the moon in the poet's artistic view of the world is being proved. The moon is found as one of the central system-forming elements of Balmont's lyric poetry, filled with rich philosophical and symbolic content (the basic element of the cosmogonic worldbuilding, which expresses the involvement of the world in the supernal reality and correlates with the most important attributes of metaphysics (eternity, infinity, silence, universal beauty, etc.). K. Balmont's texts are imbued with pantheistic motives of worshiping this astral image associated with the earthly and noumenal worlds. The image of heavenly body in K. Balmont's lyrics have an intrinsic duality, emphasizing the duality of the picture of the world he creates. With its deep mythopoetic meaning, the image of the moon in Balmont's works is the result of artistic synthesis of various archaic representations refracted through the prism of the author's worldview, and plays a critical part in the philosophical and pantheistic concept of the world created by the poet.Research methods: contextual analysis of literary text, literary interpretation, continuou s sampling, descriptive analysis.

TI  - Bio-Optical Data Assimilation With Observational Error Covariance Derived From an Ensemble of Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble-based approach to specify observational error covariance in the data assimilation of satellite bio-optical properties is proposed. The observational error covariance is derived from statistical properties of the generated ensemble of satellite MODIS-Aqua chlorophyll (Chl) images. The proposed observational error covariance is used in the Optimal Interpolation scheme for the assimilation of MODIS-Aqua Chl observations. The forecast error covariance is specified in the subspace of the multivariate (bio-optical, physical) empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) estimated from a month-long model run. The assimilation of surface MODIS-Aqua Chl improved surface and subsurface model Chl predictions. Comparisons with surface and subsurface water samples demonstrate that data assimilation run with the proposed observational error covariance has higher RMSE than the data assimilation run with optimistic assumption about observational errors (10% of the ensemble mean), but has smaller or comparable RMSE than data assimilation run with an assumption that observational errors equal to 35% of the ensemble mean (the target error for satellite data product for chlorophyll). Also, with the assimilation of the MODIS-Aqua Chl data, the RMSE between observed and model-predicted fractions of diatoms to the total phytoplankton is reduced by a factor of two in comparison to the nonassimilative run.

TI  - Structural Position and Parameters of the Paleoearthquakes in the Area of Vottovaara Mountain (Middle Karelia, Eastern Part of the Fennoscandian Shield)
T2  - SEISMIC INSTRUMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traces of strong earthquakes in the territory of Fennoscandia have been recorded by many scientists already for several decades. The seismogenerating paleostructures, such as postglacial discontinuities in the crystalline basement accompanied by a complex of deformations in the loose deposits are found in the territories of Sweden, Norway, and Finland that border Russia, in which case the spatial correlation of the postglacial faults and modern seismicity is established. Such structures have not yet been discovered in Russia, though the traces of strong earthquakes in the form of rock deformations and postglacial sediments are found by different groups of researchers over the whole territory of Eastern Fennoscandia. The obtained data make it possible to identify the linear zones of concentration of paleoearthquakes (seismic lineaments) that also occur in the modern relief and modern seismicity. However, the problem of postglacial seismicity remains a subject for discussions concerning the localization of the foci, their genesis, and regime. A remaining issue is also distinguishing between seismogenic, cryogenic, and glaciodislocations. The important questions that need to be solved include parametrization of paleoearthquakes and determination of their nature, structures, age, and magnitude. One of the key segments is the area of Vottovaara Mountain in Middle Karelia, which is a part of the Vottovaara-Girvas seismic lineament, where seismic dislocations were found earlier. For studying this probable paleo-focal zone in detail, remote sensing data, field geological and geomorphological observations, and computational methods for estimating the peak values of paleoearthquake mass velocities are used. The typical zones of development of different types of seismic deformations are revealed. A potential seismogenerating fault related to the northwest-striking Vottovaara-Girvas seismic lineament is found; its probable shear kinematics is determined from the ratio of pulse displacements of rock blocks on different wings of the fault. The sequence of a few strong events which occurred here in the interglacial and postglacial periods is identified. The effects of interaction between the seismic activity and the glacial exaration on the formation of the modern image of the focal zone are established. Using alternative approaches to estimating shaking intensity by the macroseismic INQUA scale, the scale by F.F. Aptikayev, and the nomogram by M.V. Rodkin, the intensity of the recent strong Early Holocene seismic event, which occurred here at 8.9 ka according to A.D. Lukashov, is determined. According to the agreed estimates, the intensity reached 9-10 points at a probable magnitude of 7.5-8. This work carried out using a number of new approaches developed by the authors makes it possible to characterize paleoseismicity in more detail.

TI  - Replication of Mini-Sentinel Study Assessing Mirabegron and Cardiovascular Risk in Non-Mini-Sentinel Databases.
T2  - Drugs - real world outcomes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated a prospective routine surveillance using the Mini-Sentinel (M-S) program to assess potential signals of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke with use of mirabegron, indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), compared with oxybutynin.PURPOSE: To replicate the FDA M-S analysis of mirabegron using datasets that did not contribute to the M-S program.METHODS: IMS PharMetrics Plus and Truven MarketScan claims data from 2012-2015 were converted to the M-S Common Data Model. New and non-new users of mirabegron and oxybutynin were analyzed per the publicly available M-S protocol, and propensity score-matched 1:1 using the M-S PROMPT 2 module. Incidence rates (IR) were calculated per 1000 person-years (PY). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for mirabegron versus oxybutynin were calculated using Cox regression models.RESULTS: In PharMetrics, 12,429 new mirabegron users and 61,548 new oxybutynin users were identified. The aHR was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.33-1.37) for AMI (mirabegron IR 4.4/1000 PY), and 0.62 (95% CI 0.34-1.13) for stroke (mirabegron IR 6.3/1000 PY). In MarketScan, 17,182 new mirabegron users and 63,962 new oxybutynin users were identified. The aHR was 0.57 (95% CI 0.17-1.95) for AMI, and 0.69 (95% CI 0.30-1.62) for stroke; IRs were similar to those from PharMetrics. Neither dataset suggested an increased risk of AMI or stroke associated with mirabegron in non-new users.CONCLUSIONS: Using the publicly-available M-S protocol and analysis programs with alternative (non M-S) data sources, no statistically significant increased risk of AMI or stroke was found among new or non-new users of mirabegron compared with oxybutynin. These findings were consistent with the FDA M-S mirabegron study.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in Merkel cell carcinoma: The Mayo Clinic experience of 150 patients
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous malignancy of neuroendocrine origin with a high propensity for lymph node metastasis. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is important for accurate staging; however, the optimal treatment following SLN biopsy, regardless of nodal status, remains unclear.Methods: 150 patients with MCC who underwent SLN biopsy from 1995 to 2011 at 3 Mayo Clinic sites were reviewed.Results: Of 150 patients with MCC who underwent SLN biopsy, 39 (26%) were positive and 111 (74%) were negative. There was no significant difference between the sex, age, tumor location, or size of primary in the positive and negative SLN groups. While there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of any regional recurrence between SLN groups, the rate of in-transit recurrences was significantly higher in patients with a positive SLN (p = 0.022). The disease-specific survival for MCC was 97.0%, 82.4%, and 82.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years with a positive SLN and 99.0%, 94.9%, and 86.8% with a negative SLN (p = 0.31). Among those alive at last follow up, the median follow up was 3.8 years (IQR, 2.1-8.4) and 2.9 years (IQR, 1.8-6.1) for positive and negative SLN cohorts respectively.Conclusions: Occult nodal metastasis is common in MCC(26%). No tumor or patient characteristics were identified to predict SLN positivity. Patients with a positive SLN have a higher risk of in-transit recurrence and may benefit from adjuvant radiation with inclusion of the in-transit field in amenable cases. When patients with a positive SLN receive additional treatment to the at-risk nodal basin, both OS and DSS are similar to patients with a negative SLN. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Automated mapping of snow/ice surface temperature using Landsat-8 data in Beas River basin, India, and validation with wireless sensor network data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an automated method for retrieval of snow surface temperature (SST) in Beas River Basin, India, using Landsat-8 thermal data is proposed. Digital number (DN) values of thermal data were converted into Top of Atmospheric (TOA) radiance. Surface radiance has been estimated from TOA radiance using a single channel method. The estimated surface radiance was then converted into SST. Cloud free Landsat-8 data for January and February 2017 has been used to estimate SST. Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) has established a wireless sensor network (WSN) in an avalanche prone slope in Beas River Basin, India. Landsat-8 retrieved SST has been compared and validated with recorded SST at WSN stations. The retrieved SST using proposed algorithm was in good agreement with SST recorded on ground by sensor network. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between estimated and recorded SST has been observed as similar to 1.1 K and similar to 1.5 K for 23 January 2017 and similar to 0.7 and similar to 1.6 K for 24 February 2017. Algorithm has shown a potential for automated mapping of snow and ice surface temperature using Landsat-8 data for snow cover and glaciers in Himalaya.

TI  - Updates in Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Gynecologic Cancer
T2  - CURRENT OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The aim of this study is to review the indications, techniques, and outcomes of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancers.Recent Findings In endometrial cancer, the prospective FIRES trial showed that the negative predictive value of SLN mapping was 99.6%. Furthermore, multi-institutional retrospective studies comparing SLN mapping to traditional lymphadenectomy have found comparable survival between the two techniques, in both type 1 and type 2 endometrial cancer. In cervical cancer, randomized data from the SENTICOL-2 study has demonstrated significant reduction in postoperative complications without compromising survival with SLN mapping as compared to SLN mapping and pelvic lymphadenectomy. In vulvar cancer, the GROINS-V-II study protocol was amended to mandate inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in all patients with SLN macrometastasis greater than 2 mm after unacceptably high rates of groin recurrences were observed on interim analysis. SLN mapping is now included in the treatment guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer as an acceptable lymphatic assessment technique in select patients.Summary SLN biopsy is a safe and effective alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy for women with early-stage endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer. Recent data has validated the excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value of this technique in carefully selected patients, without compromising survival. The use of an algorithm that mandates pathologic ultrastaging on all SLNs, and ipsilateral lymphadenectomy in cases of failed bilateral mapping improves sensitivity and negative predictive value. All suspicious lymph nodes should be resected regardless of the location of the SLN. In patients with vulvar cancer, SLN biopsy is an acceptable standard of care for patients with unifocal tumors, less than 4 cm in largest diameter, and clinically and radiographically negative groin nodes.

TI  - Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Excision of Axillary Clip in Patients with Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Therapy (ILINA Trial) A New Tool to Guide the Excision of the Clipped Node After Neoadjuvant Treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has been improved with the placement of a clip in the positive node prior to treatment. Several methods have been described for clipped node excision during SLNB after NAT. We assessed the feasibility of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS)-guided excision of the clipped node during SLNB and investigated whether the accuracy of SLNB is improved.After approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee, all breast cancer patients undergoing NAT had an US-visible clip placed in the positive node. The ILINA trial consisted of IOUS-guided excision of the clipped node along with SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).Forty-six patients had a clip placed in the positive node. In two (4.3%) cases, the clip could not be seen prior to surgery and the patient underwent ALND; however, the clipped node was successfully removed by IOUS-guided excision in 44 patients. Thirty-five patients (79.5%) underwent SLNB along with IOUS-guided excision of the clipped node and ALND, and were subsequently included in the ILINA trial. Nine patients were not included (five patients with SLNB only and four patients with ALND without SLNB). SLNB matched the clipped node in 27 (77%) patients. The false negative rate for the ILINA protocol was 4.1% (95% confidence interval 0.1-21.1%).IOUS-guided excision of the axillary clipped node after NAT was feasible, safe, and successful in 100% of cases. The ILINA trial is accurate in predicting axillary nodal status after NAT.

TI  - Harvest Monitoring of Kenyan Tea Plantations With X-Band SAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is an important cash crop in Kenya, grown in a climatically restricted geographic area where climatic variability is starting to affect yield productivity levels. This paper assesses the feasibility of monitoring tea growth between, but also within fields, using X-band COSMO-SkyMed SAR images (five images at VV polarization and five images atHHpolarization). We detect the harvested and nonharvested areas for each field, based on the loss of interferometric coherence between two images, with an accuracy of 52% at VV polarization and 74% at HH polarization. We then implement a normalizationmethod to isolate the scattering component related to shoot growth and eliminate the effects of moisture and local incidence angle. After normalization, we analyze the difference in backscatter between harvested and nonharvested areas. At HH polarization, our backscatter normalization reveals a small decrease (similar to 0.1 dB) in HH backscatter after harvest. However, this decrease is too small for monitoring shoot growth. The decrease is not clear at VV polarization. This is attributed to the predominantly horizontal orientation of the harvested leaves.

TI  - Do FDA label changes work? Assessment of the 2010 class label change for proton pump inhibitors using the Sentinel System's analytic tools
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo pilot use of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Sentinel System data and analytic tools by a non-FDA stakeholder through the Innovation in Medical Evidence Development and Surveillance system of the Reagan Udall Foundation. We evaluated the US FDA 2010 proton pump inhibitor (PPI) class label change that warned of increased risk of bone fracture, to use PPIs for the lowest dose and shortest duration, and to manage bone status for those at risk for osteoporosis.MethodsThe cohort consisted of adults aged 18years or older prescribed PPIs without fracture risk factors. We evaluated incident and prevalent uses of the 8 PPIs noted in the label change. Outcomes evaluated before and after label change were PPI dispensing patterns, incident fractures, and osteoporosis screening or interventions. Consistent with FDA use of descriptive tools, we did not include direct comparisons or statistical testing.ResultsThere were 1488869 and 2224420 incident PPI users in the before [PRE] and after [POST] periods, respectively. Users with 1year or more of exposure decreased (8.4% vs 7.5%), as did mean days supplied/user (130.4 to 113.7d among all users and 830.8 to 645.4d among users with 1y or more of exposure). Osteoporosis screening and interventions did not appear to increase, but the proportion of patients with fractures decreased (4.4% vs 3.1%). Prevalent user results were similar.ConclusionsThis analysis demonstrated the ability to use Sentinel tools to assess the effectiveness of a label change and accompanying communication at the population level and suggests an influence on subsequent dispensing behavior.

TI  - Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in dogs and its ticks in rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mexico, the distribution and the presence of pathogenic genospecies of B. burgdorferi in dogs and their ticks has not been extensively investigated. The study of canine borreliosis is acquiring greater relevance, since the dog is considered to be an important sentinel for pathogens pertaining to the complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; in addition, dogs could be playing a key role in the spread of ticks from forested areas into the domestic environment. This study aimed to detect and estimate the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in dogs and their ticks in two rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico. In each community, 50 houses were visited, where 144 blood samples from dogs were studied by puncture of the saphenous vein, as well as the collection of their ticks. To detect the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in these samples, the conserved gene flaB, p66 and ospC were PCR amplified. A total of 144 dog blood samples, and 846 of ticks were obtained from the examined animals. Considering tick species, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (786/846) was common, while Ixodes affinis (33/846), and Amblyomma mixtum (27/846) resulted less frequent. As per gene conservation, the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in canine blood was 17.3 % (25/144) to flaB, 12.50 % (18/144) for p66 and 1.38 % (2/144) for the ospC gene. Within the analyzed ticks, R. sanguineus s. l. had a prevalence of 0.89 %, A. mixtum 5.88 % and I. affinis 15.15 %, being this last species the one that presented higher prevalence. Two dogs and their ticks I. affinis were positive to the flaB gene. Only a tick R. sanguineus s. l. was positive to the gene p66 and no tick species was positive the ospC gene. This study confirmed the existence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in dogs and their ticks in rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico. The detection of Borrelia in dogs may be an important criterion for the evaluation of the risk of borreliosis in humans, since the dog can be used as an epidemiological indicator for the identification of new outbreaks of this disease.

TI  - Forest Cover Change, Key Drivers and Community Perception in Wujig Mahgo Waren Forest of Northern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed forest cover change from 1985 to 2016, analyzed community perception on forest cover change and its drivers, and suggested possible solutions in northern Ethiopia. Landsat images of 1985, 2000 and 2016, household interviews and focus group discussions were used. While dense forests and open forests increased by 8.2% and 32.3% respectively between 1985 and 2000, they decreased by 10.4% and 9.8% respectively from 2000 to 2016. Grasslands and cultivated land decreased in the first period by 37.3% and 5.5% but increased in the second period by 89.5% and 28.5% respectively. Fuel wood collection, cultivated land expansion, population growth; free grazing, logging for income generation and drought were the major drivers of the change reported by local communities. Soil erosion, reduction in honey bee production, flooding and drought were the most perceived impacts of the changes. Most of the farmers have a holistic understanding of forest cover change. Strengthening of forest protection, improving soil and water conservation, enrichment planting, awareness creation, payment for ecosystem services and zero grazing campaigns were mentioned as possible solutions to the current state of deforestation. In addition, concerted efforts of conservation will ensure that the forests' ecosystems contribute to increased ecosystem services.

TI  - An Evaluation of Marine Boundary Layer Cloud Property Simulations in the Community Atmosphere Model Using Satellite Observations: Conventional Subgrid Parameterization versus CLUBB
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a satellite-observation-based evaluation of the marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud properties from two Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), simulations, one with the standard parameterization schemes (CAM5-Base) and the other with the Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals scheme (CAM5-CLUBB). When comparing the direct model outputs, the authors find that CAM5-CLUBB produces more MBL clouds, a smoother transition from stratocumulus to cumulus, and a tighter correlation between in-cloud water and cloud fraction than CAM5-Base. In the model-to-observation comparison using the COSP satellite simulators, the authors find that both simulations capture the main features and spatial patterns of the observed cloud fraction from MODIS and shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF) from CERES. However, CAM5-CLUBB suffers more than CAM5-Base from a problem that can be best summarized as "undetectable'' clouds (i.e., a significant fraction of simulated MBL clouds are thinner than the MODIS detection threshold). This issue leads to a smaller COSP-MODIS cloud fraction and a weaker SWCF in CAM5-CLUBB than the observations and also CAM5-Base in the tropical descending regions. Finally, the authors compare modeled radar reflectivity with CloudSat observations and find that both simulations, especially CAM5-CLUBB, suffer from an excessive drizzle problem. Further analysis reveals that the subgrid precipitation enhancement factors in CAM5-CLUBB are unrealistically large, which makes MBL clouds precipitate too excessively, and in turn results in too many undetectable thin clouds.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion method based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under the application background of massive remote sensing data. In the training stage, we build two five-layer CNNs to deal with the problems of complicated correspondence and large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS and Landsat images. Specifically, we first learn a nonlinear mapping CNN between MODIS and low-spatial-resolution (LSR) Landsat images and then learn a super-resolution CNN between LSR Landsat and original Landsat images. In the prediction stage, instead of directly taking the outputs of CNNs as the fusion result, we design a fusion model consisting of high-pass modulation and a weighting strategy to make full use of the information in prior images. Specifically, we firstmap the input MODIS images to transitional images via the learned nonlinear mapping CNN and further improve the transitional images to LSR Landsat images via the fusion model; then, via the learned SR CNN, the LSR Landsat images are supersolved to transitional images, which are further improved to Landsat images via the fusion model. Compared with the previous learning-based fusion methods, mainly referring to the sparse-representation-based methods, our CNNs-based spatiotemporalmethod has the following advantages: 1) automatically extracting effective image features; 2) learning an end-to-end mapping between MODIS and LSR Landsat images; and 3) generating more favorable fusion results. To examine the performance of the proposed fusion method, we conduct experiments on two representative Landsat-MODIS datasets by comparing with the sparse-representation-based spatiotemporal fusion model. The quantitative evaluations on all possibleprediction dates and the comparison of fusion results on one key date in both visual effect and quantitative evaluationsdemonstrate that the proposed method can generate more accurate fusionresults.

TI  - The determinants of response time in a repeated constant-sum game: A robust Bayesian hierarchical dual-process model
T2  - COGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of response time and behavior has a long tradition in cognitive psychology, particularly for non-strategic decision-making. Recently, experimental economists have also studied response time in strategic interactions, but with an emphasis on either one-shot games or repeated social-dilemmas. I investigate the determinants of response time in a repeated (pure-conflict) game, admitting a unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, with fixed partner matching. Response times depend upon the interaction of two decision models embedded in a dual-process framework (Achtziger and Alos-Ferrer, 2014; Alos-Ferrer, 2016). The first decision model is the commonly used win-stay/lose-shift heuristic and the second the pattern-detecting reinforcement learning model in Spiliopoulos (2013b). The former is less complex and can be executed more quickly than the latter. As predicted, conflict between these two models (i.e., each one recommending a different course of action) led to longer response times than cases without conflict. The dual-process framework makes other qualitative response time predictions arising from the interaction between the existence (or not) of conflict and which one of the two decision models the chosen action is consistent with-these were broadly verified by the data. Other determinants of RT were hypothesized on the basis of existing theory and tested empirically. Response times were strongly dependent on the actions chosen by both players in the previous rounds and the resulting outcomes. Specifically, response time was shortest after a win in the previous round where the maximum possible payoff was obtained; response time after losses was significantly longer. Strongly auto-correlated behavior (regardless of its sign) was also associated with longer response times. I conclude that, similar to other tasks, there is a strong coupling in repeated games between behavior and RT, which can be exploited to further our understanding of decision making.

TI  - Relationship in metastasis of coal fire and land use/cover using thermal imagery and support vector machine classifier
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to delineate temporal and spatial changes in the coal fire and land use/cover within Bastacolla area of Jharia coal field. Studying this variation helped to decipher interconnection among the dynamics of the coal fire and concomitant changes in land use/cover. The detection of coal fires during a span of 14 years along with transitioning land use/cover was cost-effective and enabled planning for management of coal resources and environment. Landsat series of satellite data of 2002, 2009, 2013, and 2016 were processed for generating land surface temperature profiles vis-a-vis classified land use/cover of the study area. A single cut-off temperature was derived for mapping of coal fires using land surface temperature profile from 2002 to 2016. The satellite images were classified using support vector machines, and for depicting land use/cover change, postclassification change detection was done. Classification accuracy obtained was excellent with kappa coefficient ranging from 0.897 for classified image of 2002 to 0.799 for classified image of 2016. Results revealed that coal fires had shifted to the central west part of the area. Furthermore, pockets of coal fire from northern and eastern part of the study area have diminished. OB dumps and coal quarry/coal dump may be attributed towards the spatial change in coal fire while; OB dumps showed connotation with the highest temperature zones. Ground verifications for temperature profiles and coal fires were carried out using thermal camera which enunciated good agreement with results.

TI  - A comparative study of LSTM neural networks in forecasting day-ahead global horizontal irradiance with satellite data
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecasts of solar energy are important for photovoltaic (PV) based energy plants to facilitate an early participation in energy auction markets and efficient resource planning. The study concentrates on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a novel forecasting method from the family of deep neural networks, and compares its forecasting accuracy to alternative methods with a proven track record in solar energy forecasting. To provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment of LSTM, the study employs remote-sensing data for testing predictive accuracy at 21 locations, 16 of which are in mainland Europe and 5 in the US. To that end, a novel framework to conduct empirical forecasting comparisons is introduced, which includes the generation of virtual PV plants. The framework enables richer comparisons with higher coverage of geographical regions. Empirical results suggest that LSTM outperforms a large number of alternative methods with substantial margin and an average forecast skill of 52.2% over the persistence model. An implication for energy management practice is that LSTM is a promising technique, which deserves a place in forecasters' toolbox. From an academic point of view, LSTM and the proposed framework for experimental design provide a valuable environment for future studies that assess new forecasting technology.

TI  - Modification of Local Urban Aerosol Properties by Long-Range Transport of Biomass Burning Aerosol
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During August 2016, a quasi-stationary high-pressure system spreading over Central and North-Eastern Europe, caused weather conditions that allowed for 24/7 observations of aerosol optical properties by using a complex multi-wavelength PollyXT lidar system with Raman, polarization and water vapour capabilities, based at the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET network) urban site in Warsaw, Poland. During 24-30 August 2016, the lidar-derived products (boundary layer height, aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent, lidar ratio, depolarization ratio) were analysed in terms of air mass transport (HYSPLIT model), aerosol load (CAMS data) and type (NAAPS model) and confronted with active and passive remote sensing at the ground level (PolandAOD, AERONET, WIOS-AQ networks) and aboard satellites (SEVIRI, MODIS, CATS sensors). Optical properties for less than a day-old fresh biomass burning aerosol, advected into Warsaw's boundary layer from over Ukraine, were compared with the properties of long-range transported 3-5 day-old aged biomass burning aerosol detected in the free troposphere over Warsaw. Analyses of temporal changes of aerosol properties within the boundary layer, revealed an increase of aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent accompanied by an increase of surface PM10 and PM2.5. Intrusions of advected biomass burning particles into the urban boundary layer seem to affect not only the optical properties observed but also the top height of the boundary layer, by moderating its increase.

TI  - A New Quantitative Model for Comprehensive Geodiversity Evaluation: the Skocjan Caves Regional Park, Slovenia
T2  - GEOHERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a simple quantitative model for geodiversity evaluation, which merges spatial relationship of geodiversity elements with terrain data. The model is partially automated in geographic information system tools to eliminate the majority of subjectivity in evaluation. As a result, it can be used for different environment types and is applicable for comparative studies. The method was applied to the Skocjan Caves Regional Park, which is one of the most diverse karst areas in the world. The geodiversity element types were identified through remote sensing data and basic field mapping. Their diversity was subsequently defined through block statistic tools in a geographic information system programme. The geodiversity index was calculated from a number of different geodiversity element types within defined spatial units and from the terrain ruggedness index. Areas of high geodiversity index or geodiversity hotspots are in strong correlation with the most diverse areas of the regional park, which are also currently promoted for geotouristic and educational purposes.

M3  - Review
AB  - Chemical sensing and imaging technologies are of great importance in medical diagnostics and environmental sensing due to their ability to detect and localize chemical targets and provide valuable information in real-time. Biophotonic techniques are the most promising for in vivo applications due to their minimal invasivity. Our laboratory has introduced various biophotonics-based technologies for chemical sensing and imaging for biochemical sensing, medical diagnostics, and fundamental research. Over the years, we have developed a wide variety of fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based technologies for the detection of biomarkers for cancer and other diseases. This paper provides an overview of the research on chemical and biological sensors developed in our laboratory, highlighting our work on in vivo imaging and sensing, including minimally invasive detection of endogenous fluorophores associated with malignant tissue, SERS-tag localization of cancer cells and tissues, and SERS-based detection of nucleic acid biotargets and its feasibility for in vivo applications. This manuscript also presents new development on the use of Raman imaging of SERS-labeled nanoprobes incubated in leaves for use in biofuel research, laying the foundation for studies on functional imaging of nucleic acid biomarkers in plants.

TI  - Major clinical research advances in gynecologic cancer in 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2017, 10 topics were selected as major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology. For cervical cancer, efficacy and safety analysis results of a 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and long-term impact of reduced dose of quadrivalent vaccine were updated. Brief introduction of KEYNOTE trials of pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death (PD)-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, followed. Tailored surveillance programs for gynecologic cancer related with Lynch syndrome and update on sentinel lymph node mapping were reviewed for uterine corpus cancer. For ovarian cancer, 5 topics were selected including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases inhibitors and immunotherapy. The other potential practice changers covered in this review were lymphadenectomy in advanced disease, secondary cytoreductive surgery in recurrent disease, weekly dose-dense regimen for first-line chemotherapy, incorporation of bevacizumab maintenance in platinum-sensitive recurrent disease, and effect of platinum-free interval prolongation. Conflicting opinions of academic societies on periodic pelvic examination were introduced in conjunction with relevant literature review. For the field of radiation oncology, results of 2 big trials, The Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma-3 and Gynecologic Oncology Group-258, for endometrial cancer and recent advance in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer were reported. Topics for breast cancer covered adjuvant capecitabine after preoperative chemotherapy, adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab in early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease, olaparib for metastatic cancer in patients with a germline BRCA mutation, 20-year risks of recurrence after stopping endocrine therapy at 5 years, and contemporary hormonal contraception and the risk of breast cancer.

TI  - <i>PLASMODIUM</i> INFECTIONS IN <i>ANOPHELES</i> MOSQUITOES IN UBON RATCHATHANI PROVINCE, NORTHEASTERN THAILAND DURING A MALARIA OUTBREAK
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An unprecedented malaria outbreak occurred in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeastern Thailand, in 2014. The province showed the highest number of malaria cases of all Thai provinces. Five entomological surveys were conducted at 8 sentinel sites from September 2013 to September 2015 to address the role of different Anopheles species in malaria transmission. Mosquito collections were conducted using human landing catches and cow bait. A total of 10,369 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected and 2,240 were morphologically identified as potential malaria vectors, including An. dirus (n = 78), An. minimus (n = 18), An. sawadwongporni (n = 4), An. barbirostris s.l. (n = 819), An. philippinensis (n = 612), An. nivipes (n = 676), An. annularis (n = 42), An. aconitus (n = 7), and An. rampae (n = 142). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to screen for the presence of Plasmodium spp. in salivary glands. The proportion of primary vectors of surveyed villages was very low (<1%), and no Plasmodium-infected specimens were detected among in the 2,240 Anopheles mosquitoes tested. The absence of positive Plasmodium samples during malaria outbreaks suggests that malaria transmission most likely occurred outside the villages, particularly in the deep-forested hilly areas that provided suitable habitats for competent malaria vectors. These results emphasize the need to develop vector control related to village community activities to reduce malaria transmission along Thailand border areas.

TI  - Assessment of lymph node metastasis in elderly patients with colorectal cancer by sentinel lymph node identification using carbon nanoparticles
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in abdominal lymph node metastases of elderly patients with colorectal cancer using carbon nanoparticles (CN).Methods: 80 colorectal cancer patients admitted to the affiliated Weihai Second Municipal Hospital of Qingdao University from November 2014 to February 2017 were selected, and divided into the control group (n=40) and the study group (n=40). The control group was treated with surgery, while the study group was administered CN tracer subcutaneously for intraoperative dye positioning; the first to four black-stained lymph nodes were marked as SLN and then radical surgery for CRC followed. Pathological examination of intraoperative specimens was performed to assess SLN metastasis.Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the distant metastasis rate and SLN metastasis rate between the two groups (p>0.05). The total number of lymph nodes and the number of micro lymph nodes (<2 mm) in the study group was higher compared with the control group (p<0.05); the ratio of <12 lymph nodes in the study group was lower compared with the control group (p<0.05). In the study group, 8 out of 40 cases had SLN metastasis, the detection rate of SLN using CN was 92.50%, the accuracy rate was 94.59%, the specificity of diagnosis was 87.50%, the false negative rate was 12.50% and the negative predictive value was 21.88%. No statistically significant difference was noted in the metastasis rate of black-stained lymph nodes and non-black-stained lymph nodes in the study group (p>0.05). The black-stained rate of micro lymph nodes was higher than the total black-stained rate (p<0.05). The rate of micro lymph node metastasis was lower than that of lymph node metastasis >5mm (p<0.05).Conclusion: Preoperative SLN examination can evaluate the abdominal lymph node status in elderly patients with colorectal cancer, which is simple and accurate and can guide the clinical treatment, so it is worthy of popularization and application.

TI  - Disaggregation of SMOS soil moisture over West Africa using the Temperature and Vegetation Dryness Index based on SEVIRI land surface parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The overarching objective of this study was to produce a disaggregated SMOS Soil Moisture (SM) product using. land surface parameters from a geostationary satellite in a region covering a diverse range of ecosystem types. SEVIRI data at 15 min temporal resolution were used to derive the Temperature and Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) that served as SM proxy within the disaggregation process. West Africa (3 degrees N 26 degrees W; 28 degrees N 26 degrees E) was selected as a case study as it presents both an important North-South climate gradient and a diverse range of ecosystem types. The main challenge was to set up a methodology applicable over a large area that overcomes the constraints of SMOS (low spatial resolution) and TVDI (requires similar atmospheric forcing and triangular shape formed when plotting morning rise temperature versus fraction of vegetation cover) in order to produce a 0.05 degrees resolution disaggregated SMOS SM product at the sub-continental scale. Consistent cloud cover appeared as one of the main constraints for deriving TVDI, especially during the rainy season and in the southern parts of the region and a large adjustment window (105 x 105 SEVIRI pixels) was therefore deemed necessary. Both the original and the disaggregated SMOS SM products described well the seasonal dynamics observed at six locations of in situ observations. However, there was an overestimation in both products for sites in the humid southern regions; most likely caused by the presence of forest. Both TVDI and the associated disaggregated SM product were found to be highly sensitive to algorithm input parameters; especially for conditions of high fraction of vegetation cover. Additionally, seasonal dynamics in TVDI did not follow the seasonal patterns of SM. Still, its spatial heterogeneity was found to be a good proxy for disaggregating SMOS SM data; main river networks and spatial patterns of SM extremes (i.e. droughts and floods) not seen in the original SMOS SM product were revealed in the disaggregated SM product for a test case of July September 2012. The disaggregation methodology thereby successfully increased the spatial resolution of SMOS SM, with potential application for local drought/flood monitoring of importance for the livelihood of the population of West Africa.

TI  - An Extension of Fuzzy SWOT Analysis: An Application to Information Technology
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When considering today's uncertain atmosphere, many people and organizations believe that strategy has lost its meaning and position. When future is predictable, common approaches for strategic planning are applicable; nonetheless, vague circumstances require different methods. Accordingly, a new approach that is compatible with uncertainty and unstable conditions is necessary. Fuzzy logic is a world view compatible with today complicated requirements. Regarding today's uncertain and vague atmosphere, there is an absolute requirement to fuzzify the tools and strategic planning models, especially for dynamic and unclear environment. In this research, an extended version of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) fuzzy approach has been presented for strategic planning based on fuzzy logic. It has solved the traditional strategic planning key problems like internal and external factors in imprecision and ambiguous environment. The model has been performed in an information technology corporation to demonstrate the capabilities in real world cases.

TI  - Estimation of Rice Evapotranspiration Using Reflective Images of Landsat Satellite in Sefidrood Irrigation and Drainage Network
T2  - RICE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - More accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) in a regional scale has always been one of the most important challenges. Temporal and spatial monitoring of ETc using satellite images can help to enhance accuracy of estimations. In this study, the (ETc)(rice) maps were produced by using statistical/experimental methods based on crop coefficient (K-c) maps derived from vegetation index (VI). K-c was estimated using four methods, including linear relationship between K-c and VI (K-c-VI), calibrated model of K-c-VI, linear relationship between K-cb (the basal crop coefficient) and VI (K-cb-VI), and calibrated model of K-cb-VI. The results showed that calibrated model of K-c-VI had a better performance compared to the other methods, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE), mean absolute error and root mean square error being 5.7%, 0.05 mm/d and 0.06 mm/d, respectively. (ETc)(rice) maps were produced by using calibrated model of K-c-VI and reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from FAO Penman-Monteith method. The NRMSE was 21.3% for using FAO Penman-Monteith method. Therefore, calibrated K-c-VI model in combining with ET0 based on the Landsat 7 ETM+ images could be provided a good estimation of (ETc)(rice) in regional scale, and can be applied to estimate water requirement due to the free and facilitate access.

TI  - Evaluating Endmember and Band Selection Techniques for Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis using Post-Fire Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire impacts many vegetated ecosystems across the world. The severity of a fire is major component in determining post-fire effects, including soil erosion, trace gas emissions, and the trajectory of recovery. In this study, we used imaging spectroscopy data combined with Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA), a form of spectral mixture analysis that accounts for endmember variability, to map fire severity of the 2013 Rim Fire. We evaluated four endmember selection approaches: Iterative Endmember Selection (IES), count-based within endmember class (In-CoB), Endmember Average Root Mean Squared Error (EAR), and Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA). To reduce the dimensionality of the imaging spectroscopy data we used uncorrelated Stable Zone Unmixing (uSZU). Fractional cover maps derived from MESMA were validated using two approaches: (1) manual interpretation of fine spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery; and (2) ground plots measuring the Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) and the percentage of co-dominant and dominant trees with green, brown, and black needles. Comparison to reference data demonstrated fairly high correlation for green vegetation and char fractions (r(2) values as high as 0.741 for the MESMA ash fractions compared to classified WorldView-2 imagery and as high as 0.841 for green vegetation fractions). The combination of uSZU band selection and In-CoB endmember selection had the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. This study demonstrated that detailed fire severity retrievals based on imaging spectroscopy can be optimized using techniques that would be viable also in a satellite-based imaging spectrometer.

TI  - The immune response of <i>Mytilus edulis</i> hemocytes exposed to <i>Vibrio splendidus</i> LGP32 strain: A transcriptomic attempt at identifying molecular actors
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine mussel Mytilus edulis, tolerant to a wide range of environmental changes, combines a key role as a sentinel species for environmental monitoring programs and a significant economic importance. Mortality events caused by infective agents and parasites have not been described in mussels, which suggests an efficient immune system. This study aims at identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the early immune responses M. edulis' hemocytes challenged with Vibrio splendidus LGP32 strain during 2, 4 and 6 h.A total of 149,296 assembled sequences has been annotated and compared to KEGG reference pathways. Several immune related sequences were identified such as Toll-Like receptors (TLRs), transcription factors, cytokines, protease inhibitors, stress proteins and sequences encoding for proteins involved in cell adhesion, phagocytosis, oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy.Differential gene expression clustered 10 different groups of transcripts according to kinetics of transcript occurrence. Sequences were assigned to biological process gene ontology categories. Sequences encoding for galectins, fibrinogen-related proteins, TLRs, MyD88, some antimicrobial peptides, lysosomal hydrolases, heat shock proteins and protease inhibitors, as well as proteins of oxidative stress and apoptosis were identified as differently regulated during the exposure to V. splendidus LGP32.The levels of candidate transcripts were quantified in M. edulis' hemocytes exposed to V. splendidus LGP32 and 7SHRW by using branched DNA technology. Transcripts encoding for inhibitor kappa B, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, tumor protein D54, serine/threonine-proteine kinase SIK2 were identified as up-regulated in hemocytes exposed to both strains.

TI  - The morphology of the Arrival City - A global categorization based on literature surveys and remotely sensed data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - When we think about living environments of the urban poor, slums might be the most immediate association. These slums evoke a more or less stereotype impression of built environments: complex, high dense alignments of small makeshift or run-down shelters. However, this perceived characteristic morphology is neither globally homogeneous nor is this perception covering morphologic appearances of urban poverty in a comprehensive way. This research provides an empirical baseline study of existing morphologies, their similarities and differences across the globe. To do so, we conceptually approach urban poverty as places which provide relatively cheap living spaces serving as possible access to the city, to its society and to its functions so called Arrival Cities. Based on a systematic literature survey we select a sample of 44 Arrival Cities across the globe. Using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with street view images and field work we derive level of detail-1 3D-building models for all study areas. We measure the spatial structure of these settlements by the spatial pattern (by three features - building density, building orientation and heterogeneity of the pattern) and the morphology of individual buildings (by two features building size and height). We develop a morphologic settlement type index based on all five features allowing categorization of Arrival Cities. We find a large morphologic variety for built environments of the urban poor, from slum and slum-like structures to formal and planned structures. This variability is found on all continents, within countries and even within a single city. At the same time detected categories (such as slums) are found to have very similar physical features across the globe.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: An update and review Current and future therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the skin associated with a high risk of local recurrence and distant metastases. It most commonly occurs on sun-exposed areas of white patients [ 65 years of age. The Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is thought to be responsible for malignant transformation in approximately 80% of cases in the northern hemisphere, while ultraviolet radiation-induced DNA damage is implicated in MCV-negative tumors. The overall incidence of MCC is low, with approximately 1600 cases diagnosed annually in the United States. The rate is much higher in patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies, solid organ transplants, and HIV infection. The low overall incidence of this tumor makes it challenging to conduct prospective clinical trials with sufficient power. As a result, most management recommendations are based on case series, retrospective reviews, and expert opinion. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and staging of MCC was discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. This article focuses on current management guidelines and promising new therapies in development. Because of the complexity, aggressive nature, and individuality of each case, MCC is best treated by a multidisciplinary team.

TI  - Design of a Generic 3-DScene Generator for Passive Optical Missions and Its Implementation for the ESA's FLEX/Sentinel-3 Tandem Mission
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the design phase of a satellite mission, end-to-end mission performance simulator (E2ES) tools allow scientists and engineers evaluating the mission concept, consolidating system technical requirements and analyzing the suitability of the implemented technical solutions and data processing algorithms. The generation of synthetic scenes is one of the core parts of an E2ES, providing scenes (ground truth) as would be observed by satellite instruments and used as reference against simulated retrieved mission products. An appropriate generation of the scene also allows assessing the performance of the ground data processing chain replacing real instrument data before the mission is in orbit, for which the fidelity of the scene generation is critical. This paper describes the design of a generic scene generator (GSG) with capabilities to generate complex 3-D synthetic scenes that combine the effects of surface, heterogeneity, topography and atmosphere, and viewing/illumination geometry. The proposed design allows generating consistent high spatial and spectral resolution top-of-atmosphere radiance scenes for multiple instruments based on the use of thematic maps, radiative transfer models, and reflectance databases. The described GSG was implemented within the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) E2ES software tool and showed its capabilities to generate compatible scenes for the fluorescence imaging spectrometer, ocean and land color instrument, and sea and land surface temperature radiometer instruments of ESA's FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission and to validate the fulfillment of the FLEX mission requirements.

TI  - Assessing the relationship between microwave vegetation optical depth and gross primary production
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - At the global scale, the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by terrestrial ecosystems through photosynthesis is commonly estimated through vegetation indices or biophysical properties derived from optical remote sensing data. Microwave observations of vegetated areas are sensitive to different components of the vegetation layer than observations in the optical domain and may therefore provide complementary information on the vegetation state, which may be used in the estimation of Gross Primary Production (GPP). However, the relation between GPP and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), a biophysical quantity derived from microwave observations, is not yet known. This study aims to explore the relationship between VOD and GPP. VOD data were taken from different frequencies (L-, C-, and X-band) and from both active and passive microwave sensors, including the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation System (AMSR-E) and a merged VOD data set from various passive microwave sensors. VOD data were compared against FLUXCOM GPP and Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). FLUXCOM GPP estimates are based on the upscaling of flux tower GPP observations using optical satellite data, while SIF observations present a measure of photosynthetic activity and are often used as a proxy for GPP. For relating VOD to GPP, three variables were analyzed: original VOD time series, temporal changes in VOD (AVOD), and positive changes in VOD (AVOD,0). Results show widespread positive correlations between VOD and GPP with some negative correlations mainly occurring in dry and wet regions for active and passive VOD, respectively. Correlations between VOD and GPP were similar or higher than between VOD and SIF. When comparing the three variables for relating VOD to GPP, correlations with GPP were higher for the original VOD time series than for AVOD or AVOD a 0 in case of sparsely to moderately vegetated areas and evergreen forests, while the opposite was true for deciduous forests. Results suggest that original VOD time series should be used jointly with changes in VOD for the estimation of GPP across biomes, which may further benefit from combining active and passive VOD data.

TI  - Derivation of Soil Moisture using Modified Dubois Model with field assisted surface roughness on RISAT-1 data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study discuss about the soil moisture estimation using dual polarimetric RISAT-1. The semiempirical approach of Modified Dubois Model (MDM) derived by (SrinivasaRao 2013) is worked out using (sigma degrees(HH)) and (sigma degrees(HV)) for soil moisture estimation using dual polarimetric backscattering image. IRS LISS IV data have been used to analyze the site suitability of different land use/cover types. The retrieval of backscattering coefficient values (sigma degrees) from SAR is the common principle factor for soil moisture estimation. The surface roughness were measured in the selected sample location, for which the same backscattering values derived from the SAR is linearly correlated showing r(2) = 0.93. The estimated surface roughness is used for retrieval of dielectric constant using MDM. The dielectric constant derived from MDM in combination with the Topps model proposed by (Topp 1980), is used to derive satellite based soil moisture estimation. Linear regression analysis was performed and the soil moisture derived from SAR are well correlated with the volumetric soil moisture showing value of r(2) = 0.63.

TI  - Suggested Bony Landmarks for Safe Axillary Artery Access
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVASIVE CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To identify a fluoroscopic bony landmark for safe percutaneous axillary artery cannulation. Background. No bony landmarks exist to guide safe percutaneous axillary artery cannulation, which is an important alternate access site for catheter-based procedures in selected patients. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 51 consecutive percutaneous axillary artery sheath angiograms and attempted to correlate a fixed bony landmark to the proximal end of the third part of the artery. Proximal to this site, no cords of the brachial plexus traverse the anterior aspect of the vessel. Moreover, this site is proximal to the subscapular branch of the axillary artery, the first branch of its third part, and a sentinel component of the scapular anastomosis responsible for collateral blood flow to the arm. Results. With the arm abducted at 135 degrees, the subscapular artery originated at, or distal to, the inferior border of the glenoid cavity, as seen on fluoroscopy in the anterior-posterior projection, in all patients. The origin was within 5 mm distal to the inferior border of the glenoid cavity in 17 patients (46%), 5-10 mm in 13 patients (35%), and between 10 mm and 20 mm in 7 patients (19%). Conclusions. With the arm abducted, the origin of the subscapular artery correlates well with the inferior-most aspect of the glenoid cavity of the scapula under fluoroscopy. Axillary artery cannulation medial to this bony landmark typically lands the sheath in the second part or proximal end of the third part of the artery, thereby theoretically sparing injury to the brachial plexus and the subscapular artery.

TI  - Estimating fishing and natural mortality rates, and catchability coefficient, from a series of observations on mean length and fishing effort
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gedamke and Hoenig (2006) (Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 135: 476-487) developed a non-equilibrium version of the Beverton and Holt estimator of total mortality rate, Z, based on mean length and thereby increased the usefulness of length-based methods. In this study, we extend their model by replacing period-specific Z parameters with the year-specific parameterization Z(y) = qf(y) + M where q is the catchability coefficient, f(y) is the fishing effort in year y, F (= qf) is the fishing mortality rate, and M is the natural mortality rate. Thus, the problem reduces to estimating just three parameters: q, M and residual variance. We used Monte Carlo simulation to study the model behaviour. Estimates of q and M are highly negatively correlated and may or may not be reliable; however, the estimates of corresponding Z's are more precise than estimates of F and are generally reliable, even when uncertainty about the mean lengths is high. This length-based method appears to work best for stocks with rapid growth rate. Contrast in effort data may not be necessary for reliable estimates of Z's. This approach forms a bridge between data-limited models and more complex models. We apply the method to the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus stock in Portugal as an example.

TI  - Brazilian Adolescents' Just World Beliefs and Its Relationships with School Fairness, Student Conduct, and Legal Authorities
T2  - SOCIAL JUSTICE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior research has demonstrated that adolescence is a sensitive period to develop their belief in a just world (BJW), both general and personal. Research has found significant relationships between BJW, perceptions of school fairness, student conduct, and perceptions of legal authorities. However, no research has combined these constructs in one model to get a broader picture of how adolescents construct their worldview of fairness and how this influences their compliance with authorities. This study analyzed 475 Brazilian adolescents across three schools. A partially mediated and a mediated model were tested to determine if students' BJW relate directly or indirectly to student conduct and perceptions of legal authorities through school fairness. The partially mediated model best fit the data. Personal BJW predicted students' perceptions of the school fairness, which predicted student conduct. General BJW and school fairness predicted adolescents' perceptions of legal authorities. Perceptions of school fairness are influenced by Personal BJW and are predictive of students' conduct and opinions of legal authorities. By analyzing multiple constructs simultaneously, this study provides a picture of how these overlapping conceptualizations of justice interact. Students who do not believe their school is fair are less likely to respect and abide by the rules and are more likely to also expect unfair treatment from law enforcement and judicial officials. This study points to the importance of students' perceptions of justice at school and highlights the far-reaching implications of students who do not perceive or expect justice in their lives.

TI  - STUDY ON LANDSLIDE CATEGORY BASE ON TEMPORAL-SPATIAL CHARACTERISTIC DISTRIBUTION IN NORTHERN VIETNAM USING SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - North Vietnam is a lot of landslide generate region due to heavy rainfall or tropical storms, Steep slopes on mountainous sides and human activities such as road or house constructions. Heavy rainfall events are estimated by climate change in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to understand landslide characteristic due to rainfall variation. This paper applied Landsat satellite images and calculated NDIs (Normalized Difference Indexes) to evaluate the condition of vegetation, soil and water and detected 87 landslide points in North Vietnam. And, landslide points are evaluated to compare digital geographic information data to divide landslide type. As result, three typical types of landslides are classified as landslide caused by rainfall on construction (Road etc..) sites (Type1), a landslide caused by rainfall on natural slopes(Type2), and landslide caused by rainfall and water drawdown on banks of reservoirs or streams(Type3). Considering the Landsat result Type 2 and Type 3 consist larger proportions compared to those in historical data. This means that many landslides would occur in mountainous areas that far from residential or road areas (Type1).

TI  - Optimized rule-based logistic model tree algorithm for mapping mangrove species using ALOS PALSAR imagery and GIS in the tropical region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to map the spatial distribution of mangrove species and assess their changes from 2010 to 2015 in Hai Phong City of Vietnam located on the tropical region using the ALOS PALSAR data and an optimized rulebased decision tree technique. For this purpose, ALOS PALSAR imagery for the above period and GIS data were collected and used, and then, spatial distributions of mangrove species were derived using logistic model tree (LMT) classifier. The LMT is current state-of-the-art machine learning method that has not been used for mapping of mangrove species. The results showed that incorporation of ALOS PALSAR imagery and GIS in the LMT algorithm provides satisfactory overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The ALOS-2 PALSAR for 2015 achieved better overall accuracy, with an increment of 3.6% in mapping mangrove species than that of the ALOS PALSAR for 2010. The ALOS-2 PALSAR-derived model yielded the overall accuracy of 83.8% and the kappa coefficient of 0.81, compared with those of the ALOS PALSAR-derived model, 80.2% and 0.78, respectively. The results of classification for 2010 and 2015 were significantly different using the McNemar test. This research demonstrates the potential use of ALOS PALSAR together with machine learning techniques in monitoring mangrove species in tropical areas.

TI  - GIS-based Methodology for Identification of Suitable Locations for Rainwater Harvesting Structures
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, the water resources across the world are being continuously depleted. It is essential to find sustainable solutions for this shortage of water. Rainwater harvesting is one such promising solution to this problem. This paper presents a new GIS-based methodology to identify suitable locations for rainwater harvesting structures using only freely available imageries/remote sensing data and data from other sources. The methodology has been developed for the semi-arid environment of Khushkhera-Bhiwadi-Neemrana Investment Region (KBNIR) in Alwar district of Rajasthan. For identifying locations suitable for rainwater harvesting structures, the layers of surface elevation (ASTER-DEM), landuse/landcover, soil map, drainage map and depression map are used and further analyzed for their depression volume, and availability of surface runoff using Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. Based on the proposed criteria total seven locations were identified, out of which two locations are excellent; three locations are good, (if provisions of overflow structure are made for them) and two locations are not suitable for rain water harvesting. The total rainwater harvesting potential of the study area is 54.49 million cubic meters which is sufficient to meet the water requirements if harvested and conserved properly. This methodology is time-saving and cost-effective. It can minimize cost of earthwork and can be utilized for the planning of cost effective water resource management.

TI  - Planktonic stages of small pelagic fishes (<i>Sardinella aurita</i> and <i>Engraulis encrasicolus</i>) in the central Mediterranean Sea: The key role of physical forcings and implications for fisheries management
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidisciplinary studies are recently aiming to define diagnostic tools for fishery sustainability by coupling ichthyoplanktonic datasets, physical and bio-geochemical oceanographic measurements, and ocean modelling. The main goal of these efforts is to understand those processes that control the dispersion and fate of fish larvae and eggs, and thus tuning the inter-annual variability of the biomass of small pelagic fish species. In this paper we analyse the distribution of eggs and larvae as well as the biological features of the two species of pelagic fish, Engraulis encrasicolus and Sardinella aurita in the north-eastern sector of the Sicily Channel (Mediterranean Sea) from ichthyoplanktonic data collected during the 2010 and 2011 summer cruises. We use Lagrangian simulations and satellite data (i.e., sea surface temperature, wind, and chlorophyll-a concentration) to recognize the main oceanographic patterns that mark eggs and larvae transport processes. We provide a mechanistic explanation of a cross-shore transport process by using a potential vorticity (PV) model that takes into account the role of wind stress in generating cold filaments. Our results show that the strong offshore transport towards Malta occurred in 2010 was likely due to a persistent Mistral wind forcing that generated high-PV cold filaments. This phenomenon was not found in the 2011 analysis, which indeed showed an along-shore transport towards the retention area of Capo Passero. Since, for the first time, we describe the spatial distribution of the early life stage of Sardinella aurita in the northern part of the Sicily Channel and we clarify the link between the ocean dynamics and the fate of small pelagic fish larvae, this work provides a useful, diagnostic tool for the sustainable management of fishery resources.

Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN and rates of endometrial cancer were calculated.Results. Overall, 64/120 (53.3%) patients were found to have EC on final pathology: 58 stage IA, 3 IB, and 3 IIIC1. In patients with preoperative diagnosis of "AH", 44.3% (31/70) had EC on final pathology compared to 66% (33/50) in patients with "AH - cannot rule out cancer" (p = 0.02). Overall, 3.3% of the patients (4/120) had lymph node involvement. In patients with EC with a pre-operative diagnosis of "AH", none had lymph node metastasis (0/31), compared to 12.1% (4/33) in patients with "AH - cannot rule out cancer" (p = 0.06). Elevated preoperative CA125 levels (>25 U/mL) were statistically associated with the risk of lymph node metastasis on final pathology (p = 0.024). Unilateral and bilateral SLN detection occurred in 93.7% and 78.1% respectively. In patients with EC and bilateral SLN mapping, sensitivity and NPV were respectively 66.6% and 97.9%. There was one false negative (ITCs in non-SLN).Conclusion. Our data indicate that the risk of lymph node involvement in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of "AH-only" is null. Lymph node assessment could be omitted in those patients. Conversely this risk is significant in patients with "AH - cannot rule out cancer". SLN mapping could be a valuable staging procedure in these patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Learning with mobiles: The Global South
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the need to build sustainable, appropriate and authentic foundations for learning with mobiles in the Global South. It does this in two ways: first, by reviewing aspects of the current environment, namely the nature of learning with mobiles in the Global North, the relationships between research and policy in relation to learning with mobiles, the impact of mobile technology on language, and the meanings of international development; and second, by consolidating these within a broader and critical historical framework that sees education and technology as the instruments of the hegemony of the Global North, reinforcing its values and worldview. This is, however, methodologically challenging and problematic, and the article briefly considers how such arguments should be constructed. The article concludes by offering ways forward as the basis for practical progress.

TI  - Deforestation modeling in the MATOPIBA region
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of deforestation of native vegetation in the MATOPIBA (MAranhdo, TOcantins, PIaui, and BAhia) region is related to the expansion of the production activities of agricultural commodities.The deforestation monitoring using remotely sensed data and GIS techniques, associated with the development of spatially explicit modeling can contribute to better understanding the variables related to deforestation and allows the simulation of future trajectories of this phenomenon. In this research, we proposed and simulated deforestation scenarios (trend, optimistic and pessimistic) for the MATOPIBA region between 2011 and 2050 based on deforestation observed in 2002, 2008, and 2010. This study results indicate an increase of deforestation of 10.3, 15.3, and 10.9 million hectares between 2011 and 2050 assuming the optimistic, business as usual, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively. It would increase deforestation in 55%, 82%, and 85% (optimistic, business as usual, and pessimistic, respectively) when compared to the total observed deforestation by 2010. This research results may help decision and policy makers to improve strategies to reduce deforestation and improve sustainable development in the MATOPIBA region.

TI  - Longitudinal analyses of correlated response efficiencies of fillet traits in Nile tilapia
T2  - ANIMAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies with Nile tilapia have shown divergent results regarding the possibility of selecting on morphometric measurements to promote indirect genetic gains in fillet yield (FY). The use of indirect selection for fillet traits is important as these traits are only measurable after harvesting. Random regression models are a powerful tool in association studies to identify the best time point to measure and select animals. Random regression models can also be applied in a multiple trait approach to analyze indirect response to selection, which would avoid the need to sacrifice candidate fish. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships between several body measurements, weight and fillet traits throughout the growth period and to evaluate the possibility of indirect selection for fillet traits in Nile tilapia. Data were collected from 2042 fish and was divided into two subsets. The first subset was used to estimate genetic parameters, including the permanent environmental effect for BW and body measurements (8758 records for each body measurement, as each fish was individually weighed and measured a maximum of six times). The second subset (2042 records for each trait) was used to estimate genetic correlations and heritabilities, which enabled the calculation of correlated response efficiencies between body measurements and the fillet traits. Heritability estimates across ages ranged from 0.05 to 0.5 for height, 0.02 to 0.48 for corrected length (CL), 0.05 to 0.68 for width, 0.08 to 0.57 for fillet weight (FW) and 0.12 to 0.42 for FY. All genetic correlation estimates between body measurements and FW were positive and strong (0.64 to 0.98). The estimates of genetic correlation between body measurements and FY were positive (except for CL at some ages), but weak to moderate (-0.08 to 0.68). These estimates resulted in strong and favorable correlated response efficiencies for FW and positive, but moderate for FY. These results indicate the possibility of achieving indirect genetic gains for FW and by selecting for morphometric traits, but low efficiency for FY when compared with direct selection.

TI  - Minilaparoscopy vs Standard Laparoscopy for Sentinel Node Dissection: A Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare 3-mm minilaparoscopy and standard 5-mm laparoscopy for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer (EC).Design: Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: Two academic research centers.Patients: Consecutive women with apparent early-stage EC who underwent surgical staging with SLN detection between November 2015 and April 2016.Interventions: The surgical approach was a total laparoscopic extrafascial hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and SLN detection. Systematic lymphadenectomy was performed in selected cases. In all patients, SLN detection was performed with cervical injection of indocyanine green and the use of an optical camera with a near-infrared high-intensity light source for detection of fluorescence imaging. All patients who underwent a minilaparoscopic approach (using one 5-mm scope and three 3-mm ancillary trocars) have been enrolled at the University of Insubria, whereas at the San Gerardo Hospital, standard laparoscopy was performed with one 10-mm scope and three 5-mm ancillary trocars.Measurements ad Main Results: A total of 38 patients were enrolled, including 15 (39.5%) in the 3-mm group and 23 (60.5%) in the 5-mm group. No between-group differences were found in terms of demographic and tumor characteristics. Bilateral SLNs were detected in 73.3% of the patients in the 3-mm group and in 73.9% in the 5-mm group. Operative time, blood loss, hemoglobin drop, hospital stay, and the incidence and severity of complications were similar in the 2 groups. One patient (4.3%) in the standard 5-mm group had a positive SLN result (a micrometastasis in the left external iliac SLN). No positive SLNs were detected in the 3-mm group.Conclusion: Minilaparoscopic SLN biopsy appears to be a promising and feasible technique for EC staging. Further research is warranted to investigate the possible benefits of 3-mm instruments in this specific setting. (C) 2017 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> column over different climatic zones and land use/land cover types in South Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have applied regression analyses for the modeling of tropospheric NO2 (tropo-NO2) as the function of anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and some important meteorological parameters such as temperature (Temp), precipitation (Preci), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), cloud fraction (CLF) and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) over different climatic zones and land use/land cover types in South Asia during October 2004-December 2015. Simple linear regression shows that, over South Asia, tropo-NO2 variability is significantly linked to AOD, WS, NOx, Preci and CLF. Also zone-5, consisting of tropical monsoon areas of eastern India and Myanmar, is the only study zone over which all the selected parameters show their influence on tropo-NO2 at statistical significance levels. In stepwise multiple linear modeling, tropo-NO2 column over landmass of South Asia, is significantly predicted by the combination of RH (standardized regression coefficient, beta = -49), AOD (beta = 0.42) and NOx (beta = 0.25). The leading predictors of tropo-NO2 columns over zones 1-5 are OLR, AOD, Temp, OLR, and RH respectively. Overall, as revealed by the higher correlation coefficients (r), the multiple regressions provide reasonable models for tropo-NO2 over South Asia (r = 0.82), zone-4 (r = 0.90) and zone-5 (r = 0.93). The lowest r (of 0.66) has been found for hot semi-arid region in northwestern Indus-Ganges Basin (zone-2). The highest value of beta for urban area AOD (of 0.42) is observed for megacity Lahore, located in warm semi-arid zone-2 with large scale crop-residue burning, indicating strong influence of aerosols on the modeled tropo-NO2 column. A statistical significant correlation (r = 0.22) at the 0.05 level is found between tropo-NO2 and AOD over Lahore. Also NOx emissions appear as the highest contributor (beta = 0.59) for modeled tropo-NO2 column over megacity Dhaka.

TI  - The sentinel lymph node spread determines quantitatively melanoma seeding to non-sentinel lymph nodes and survival
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Complete lymph node dissection (CLND) after a positive sentinel node (SN) biopsy provides important prognostic information in melanoma patients but has been questioned for therapeutic use recently. We explored whether quantification of the tumour spread to SNs may replace histopathology of non-sentinel nodes (NSNs) for staging purposes.Patients and methods: We quantified melanoma spread in SNs and NSNs in 128 patients undergoing CLND for a positive SN. In addition to routine histopathology, one-half of each of all 1496 SNs and NSNs was disaggregated into a single cell suspension and stained immunocytochemically to determine the number of melanoma cells per 10(6) lymph node cells, i.e. the disseminated cancer cell density (DCCD).Results: We uncovered melanoma spread to NSNs in the majority of patients; however, the tumour load and the proportion of positive nodes were significantly lower in NSNs than in SNs. The relation between SN and NSN spread could be described by a mathematical function with DCCDNSN = DCCDSNc/10(1-c) (c = 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.76). At a median follow-up of 67 months, multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that DCCDSN (p = 0.02; HR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.05-1.71) and the total number of pathologically positive nodes (p = 0.02; HR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07-2.22) were significant risk factors after controlling for age, gender, thickness of melanoma and ulceration status. A prognostic model based on DCCDSN and melanoma thickness predicted outcome as accurately as a model including pathological information of both SNs and NSNs.Conclusion: The assessment of DCCDSN renders CLND for staging purposes unnecessary.

AB  - The spotlight is on the use of Earth remote sensing data in geoecological assessment of the Malyi Khingan Ridge area in the Far East. Based on the analysis of satellite observations over the Sutara gold placer mining range, the time variation of the disturbed land is determined. It is found that natural recovery of bio-geo-cenosis takes an active part in the process. Using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the behavior and rates of self-healing of the disturbed lands are assessed. Complete recovery of vegetation in gold placer mining areas up to a level comparable with the adjacent territories takes 7 to 10 years.

TI  - <i>Angiostrongylus</i> spp. in the Americas: geographical and chronological distribution of definitive hosts versus disease reports
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Angiostrongyliasis is an infection caused by nematode worms of the genus Angiostrongylus. The adult worms inhabit the pulmonary arteries, heart, bronchioles of the lung, or mesenteric arteries of the caecum of definitive host. Of a total of 23 species of Angiostrongylus cited worldwide, only nine were registered in the American Continent. Two species, A. cantonensis and A. costaricensis, are considered zoonoses when the larvae accidentally parasitise man.OBJECTIVES In the present study, geographical and chronological distribution of definitive hosts of Angiostrongylus in the Americas is analysed in order to observe their relationship with disease reports. Moreover, the role of different definitive hosts as sentinels and dispersers of infective stages is discussed.METHODS The study area includes the Americas. First records of Angiostrongylus spp. in definitive or accidental hosts were compiled from the literature. Data were included in tables and figures and were matched to geographic information systems (GIS).FINDINGS Most geographical records of Angiostrongylus spp. both for definitive and accidental hosts belong to tropical areas, mainly equatorial zone. In relation to those species of human health importance, as A. cantonensis and A. costaricensis, most disease cases indicate a coincidence between the finding of definitive host and disease record. However, in some geographic site there are gaps between report of definitive host and disease record. In many areas, human populations have invaded natural environments and their socioeconomic conditions do not allow adequate medical care.MAIN CONCLUSIONS Consequently, many cases for angiostrongyliasis could have gone unreported or unrecognised throughout history and in the nowadays. Moreover, the population expansion and the climatic changes invite to make broader and more complete range of observation on the species that involve possible epidemiological risks. This paper integrates and shows the current distribution of Angiostrongylus species in America, being this information very relevant for establishing prevention, monitoring and contingency strategies in the region.

TI  - GIS numerical and remote sensing analyses of forest changes in the Toplica region for the period of 1953-2013
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Toplica region is situated in a forest-rich part of the Republic of Serbia, the region's four municipalities are not equally forested. Forests are an important resource for economic activities and the existence of flora and fauna, both globally and in the Republic of Serbia. Many initiatives around the world intend to protect and renew forest belts under the sponsorship of developed and developing countries (e.g. China, India, Russia, Brazil, or the G7). In this study, we reconstructed the condition of forests in the Toplica region over the last 60 years using remote sensing, topographic maps, geographical information system (GIS) analysis, and official data from cadaster books and censuses. In addition to changes in forested land, concurrent socio-economic changes have affected the distribution and density of forests. The total number of trees in the Toplica region in 2013 was determined by applying numerical GIS analyses to remote sensing data. We also reconstructed the state of forests in 1953 and used this to determine the total number of trees cut down within this period, as well as the forested areas within different parts of the region. We also determined the elevations beneath different forested zones. In addition to these qualitative and quantitative analyses, we analyzed processes with the potential to influence future forest dispersion (afforestation, deagrarianization, degradation, and deforestation). These analyses are useful in acquiring more detailed insight into the condition of forests in this part of southeastern Europe.

TI  - Brexit or Bremain? A person and social analysis of voting decisions in the EU referendum
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The period following UK's European Union referendum in 2016 foreshadows significant social and political change in the UK. The current research draws on social psychological theories to empirically examine the drivers of voting decisions during the referendum. We report the results of a prospective study using structural equation modelling with data (N=244) collected just before, and self-reported voting behaviour immediately following (N=197), the European Union referendum. We employ a person and social approach to examine the additive roles of worldview, conservatism, social identity, and intergroup threat as predictors of voting intentions and behaviour. Results showed that person factors (worldview and conservatism) predicted voting intentions through social factors (European identity and realistic threat) and that intentions predicted behaviour. The results highlight the importance of addressing threat-based intergroup rhetoric and the potential of common in-group identity to mitigate psychological threat.

T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the value of left vertebral artery filter protection in addition to the current filter-based embolic protection technology to achieve complete cerebral protection during TAVR.BackgroundThe occurrence of cerebrovascular events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has fueled concern for its potential application in younger patients with longer life expectancy. Transcatheter cerebral embolic protection (TCEP) devices may limit periprocedural cerebrovascular events by preventing macro and micro-embolization to the brain. Conventional filter-based TCEP devices cover three extracranial contributories to the brain, yet leave the left vertebral artery unprotected.MethodsPatients underwent TAVR with complete TCEP. A dual-filter system was deployed in the brachiocephalic trunk and left common carotid artery with an additional single filter in the left vertebral artery. After TAVR all filters were retrieved and sent for histopathological evaluation by an experienced pathologist.ResultsEleven patients received a dual-filter system and nine of them received an additional left vertebral filter. In the remaining two patients, the left vertebral filter could not be deployed. No periprocedural strokes occurred. We found debris in all filters, consisting of thrombus, tissue derived debris, and foreign body material. The left vertebral filter contained debris in an equal amount of patients as the Sentinel filters. The size of the captured particles was similar between all filters.ConclusionsThe left vertebral artery is an important entry route for embolic material to the brain during TAVR. Selective filter protection of the left vertebral artery revealed embolic debris in all patients. The clinical value of complete filter-based TCEP during TAVR warrants further research.

TI  - Bayesian estimation of seasonal course of canopy leaf area index from hyperspectral satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, Bayesian inversion of a physically-based forest reflectance model is investigated to estimate of boreal forest canopy leaf area index (LAI) from EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral data. The data consist of multiple forest stands with different species compositions and structures, imaged in three phases of the growing season. The Bayesian estimates of canopy LAI are compared to reference estimates based on a spectral vegetation index. The forest reflectance model contains also other unknown variables in addition to LAI, for example leaf single scattering albedo and understory reflectance. In the Bayesian approach, these variables are estimated simultaneously with LAI. The feasibility and seasonal variation of these estimates is also examined. Credible intervals for the estimates are also calculated and evaluated. The results show that the Bayesian inversion approach is significantly better than using a comparable spectral vegetation index regression. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - State and fate of the remaining tropical mountain glaciers in australasia using satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical glaciers are extremely sensitive to a warming climate. In this paper, the evolution of the remaining tropical glaciers in Australasia (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) during the period 1988-2015 was quantified. Landsat series images, a digital elevation model from SRTM, and previously published data were used. Estimated total glacier area in 1988, 1993, 1997 and 2004 was 3.85 km2 +/- 0.13 km(2), 3.01 km(2)+/- 0.08 km(2), 2.49 km2 +/- 0.07 km2 and 1.725 km2 +/- 0.042 km2, respectively. Only 0.58 km(2)+/- 0.016 km(2) glacierized area remained in 2015 in Puncak Jaya, which is about 84.9% loss in just 27 years. If this rate continued, the remaining tropical glaciers in Australasia would disappear in the 2020s. Timeseries analysis of climate variables showed significant positive trends in air temperature (0.009A degrees C per year) and relative humidity (0.43% per year) but no considerable tendency was observed for precipitation. Warming climate together with mining activities would accelerate loss of glacier coverage in this region.

TI  - Paget's disease of the male breast: case report and a point of view from actual literature
T2  - GIORNALE DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Paget disease of the nipple in man is a very rare breast cancer, and there are not standard procedures or guidelines. In any cases, a Paget's disease could hide an invasive ductal breast cancer.Case description. We report the case of a 77-years old man affected by Alzheimer's disease, who presented to our attention because of an ulcerated palpable mass in the right nipple. A biopsy of the lesion showed "intra-epidermic proliferation of epitelioid cells, associated with linfo-plasmacellular infiltration of superficial dermis, compatible with Paget's disease (pTis)".We discussed the case in the multidisciplinary meeting and decided to subject the patient to surgery, so a right mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were performed. Histo-pathological examination revealed " invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, associated with a small component of in situ ductal carcinoma and Paget's disease of the nipple with superficial ulceration". Resection margins were free. Sentinel lymph node was negative. Biological features were as follows: ER 95%, PR 60%, Her-2/neu 1+, Ki-67 35%. The patient was discharged in the third post-operative day in good conditions. In the following weeks the patient's healing process was good and free of complications.Conclusions. Clinical recognition of Paget's disease is very important also in man, because it can be the alarm bell for an underlying invasive ductal breast cancer, often more aggressive than in woman.

TI  - Improved stratification of pT1 melanoma according to the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer staging edition criteria: A Dutch population-based study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging edition includes revisions regarding pT1 melanomas. We aimed to evaluate the expected impact of this edition on staging and survival in the Dutch pT1 melanoma population.Methods: In total, 32,935 pT1 melanoma patients, whose data were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry between 2003 and 2015, were included in the study. Patients were stratified by the 6th AJCC edition (cohort 1: 2003-2009) and 7th edition (cohort 2: 2010-2015) and all reclassified according to the 8th edition. Stage migration, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positivity rates and relative survival were analysed. Agreement between staging systems was calculated by Cohen's kappa coefficient.Results: In cohort 2, restaging according to the 8th edition led to an increase of 7% in the total number of patients staged pT1b. The kappa score for agreement between the 6th and 8th edition was 0.15 and 0.25 for agreement between 7th and 8th edition. Restaging according to the 8th edition resulted in a higher SLNB positivity rate for pT1b patients than pT1a patients (8% versus 5%, p = 0.08). Relative survival curves were predominantly similar between the staging editions.Conclusions: Implementation of the 8th AJCC staging edition will presumably not have major impact on the total number of Dutch pT1b patients. Consequently, the number of patients eligible for SLNB would roughly remain similar. In terms of SLNB positivity, the selection of high-risk pT1 melanoma patients is likely to improve. In addition, the 8th edition criteria for pT1 melanoma seem more workable for pathologists. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation of Atmospheric Numerical Models Based on Satellite Measurements of Ozone Columns
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The time series of ozone columns measured with the SBUV satellite instrument over three subarctic stations (Saint Petersburg, Harestua, and Kiruna) are analyzed. The daily and monthly mean ozone values in the layers of 0-25, 25-60, and 0-60 km are compared with the results of simulations with RSHU and EMAC numerical models for the period of 2000-2015. Model data are in good agreement with satellite data both in general and in the cases of rapid short-term ozone loss. However, there are some differences between the models and measurements as well as between the two considered models. These differences require the more detailed analysis in order to modify model parameters. Experimental data demonstrate the increase in ozone columns in the layer of 25-60 km which amounts to 2.1 +/- 0.7, 2.4 +/- 0.7, and 1.5 +/- 0.8% per decade for Saint Petersburg, Harestua, and Kiruna stations, respectively. The results of numerical simulations do not contradict these estimates.

TI  - Endocrine disruption and differential gene expression in sentinel fish on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska: Health implications for indigenous residents
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - People living a subsistence lifestyle in the Arctic are highly exposed to persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Formerly Used Defense (FUD) sites are point sources of PCB pollution; the Arctic contains thousands of FUD sites, many co-located with indigenous villages. We investigated PCB profiles and biological effects in freshwater fish (Alaska blackfish [Dallia pectoralis] and ninespine stickleback [Pungitius pungitius]) living upstream and downstream of the Northeast Cape FUD site on St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea. Despite extensive site remediation, fish remained contaminated with PCBs. Vitellogenin concentrations in males indicated exposure to estrogenic contaminants, and some fish were hypothyroid. Downstream fish showed altered DNA methylation in gonads and altered gene expression related to DNA replication, response to DNA damage, and cell signaling. This study demonstrates that, even after site remediation, contaminants from Cold War FUD sites in remote regions of the Arctic remain a potential health threat to local residents - in this case, Yupik people who had no influence over site selection and use by the United States military.

TI  - Remote sensing as a tool to assess botanical composition, structure, quantity and quality of temperate grasslands
T2  - GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Grassland systems frequently exhibit small-scale botanical and structural heterogeneity with pronounced spatio-temporal dynamics. These features present particular challenges for sensor applications, in addition to limitations posed by the high cost and low spatial resolution of many available remote-sensing (RS) systems. There has been little commercial application of RS for practical grassland farming. This article considers the developments in sensor performance, data analysis and modelling over recent decades, identifies significant advances in RS for grassland research and practice and reviews the most important sensor types and corresponding findings in research. Beside improvements of single sensor types, the development of systems with complementary sensors is seen as a very promising research area, and one that will help to overcome the limitations of single sensors and provide better information about grassland composition, yield and quality. From an agronomic point of view, thematic maps of farm fields are suggested as the central outcome of RS and data analysis. These maps could represent the relevant grassland features and constitute the basis for various farm management decisions at strategic, tactical and operational levels. The overarching goal will be to generate low cost, appropriate and timely information that can be provided to farmers to support their decision-making.

TI  - Pancake Ice Thickness Mapping in the Beaufort Sea From Wave Dispersion Observed in SAR Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The early autumn voyage of RV Sikuliaq to the southern Beaufort Sea in 2015 offered very favorable opportunities for observing the properties and thicknesses of frazil-pancake ice types. The operational region was overlaid by a dense network of retrieved satellite imagery, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK). This enabled us to fully test and apply the SAR-waves technique, first developed by Wadhams and Holt (1991), for deriving the thickness of frazil-pancake icefields from changed wave dispersion. A line of subimages from a main SAR image (usually CSK) is analyzed running into the ice along the main wave direction. Each subimage is spectrally analyzed to yield a wave number spectrum, and the change in the shape of the spectrum between open water and ice, or between two thicknesses of ice, is interpreted in terms of the viscous equations governing wave propagation in frazil-pancake ice. For each of the case studies considered here, there was good or acceptable agreement on thickness between the extensive in situ observations and the SAR-wave calculation. In addition, the SAR-wave analysis gave, parametrically, effective viscosities for the ice covering a consistent and narrow range of 0.03-0.05 m(2) s(-1).Plain Language Summary It is known from work at open ocean boundaries such as Antarctica and the Greenland Sea that ocean waves interact with icefields to break up the ice and strip it away from the ice-water boundary, enhancing ice retreat. Also, in a wave field, new ice is forced to grow in the form of pancakes, an array of small cakes. The Beaufort Sea in late summer now counts as an open ocean boundary, and on the 2015 cruise of Sikuliaq it was found that vast fields of pancake ice were being created at the advancing edge as summer ended. We were able to map the thickness of these pancakes, and hence their contribution to the volume of the icefield, using a satellite technique developed by two of the authors in 1991. This uses synthetic aperture radar images of the ice to determine the frequency spectrum of wave energy, and since the speed of waves in ice depends on the frequency and the ice thickness, we can extract thicknesses from this analysis. The results were tested against direct measurements from the ship. This technique can be used worldwide to determine the overall contribution of pancake ice to the world's sea ice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam is a novel beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor combination with a broad spectrum of activity that includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and relevant comparators versus a large collection of antimicrobial non-susceptible P. aeruginosa clinical isolates recovered from patients across Canada (CANWARD, 2008-16).Susceptibility testing was performed on P. aeruginosa clinical isolates obtained from sentinel hospitals across Canada between January 2008 and December 2016 using broth microdilution, as described by the CLSI. MDR P. aeruginosa were defined as isolates that tested non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial from 3 classes. XDR P. aeruginosa were defined as isolates that tested non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial from 5 classes.In total, 3229 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained as a part of CANWARD. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active antimicrobial evaluated, with 98.3% of isolates testing susceptible. The percentage of antimicrobial non-susceptible isolates that remained susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam ranged from 85.3% (amikacin non-susceptible subset) to 95.0% (ciprofloxacin non-susceptible subset). Four-hundred and sixty-two P. aeruginosa isolates were MDR (14.3% of all isolates tested) and 84 were XDR (2.6% of all isolates tested). Ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated excellent in vitro activity versus the MDR and XDR isolates, with 90.5% and 78.6% remaining susceptible, respectively.Ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against antimicrobial non-susceptible P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, including MDR and XDR subsets. It may prove useful in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms.

TI  - A Novel Method for Removing Snow Melting-Induced Fluctuation in GIMMS NDVI3g Data for Vegetation Phenology Monitoring: A Case Study in Deciduous Forests of North America
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used in recent decades to monitor vegetation phenology. However, interference from snow cover introduces a high degree of uncertainty in interpreting NDVI fluctuation, because snow melting increases NDVI value in a manner similar to vegetation growth, leading to false detection. In this study, we present a novel methodology to smooth out data noise caused by snow in the third generation NDVI dataset from Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS NDVI3g). This method is developed to replace small values with a pixel-specific snow-free background NDVI estimate, based on the assumption that the existence of snow decrease NDVI value and the patterns of NDVI fluctuation after snow melting and that after initiation of vegetation growth are different. Using the daily gross primary production (GPP) data of 111 site-years from FLUXNET in nine North American sites and the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset, we found that the green-up onset day (GUD) derived from raw NDVI is 42.2 days earlier than that of GPP, on average. This difference decreases to 4.7 days when applying the newly developed method. Additionally, the root mean square error and Spearman's correlation coefficient between NDVI-derived GUD and GPP-derived GUD are improved from 46.8 to 12.8 days and 0.22 to 0.64, respectively. Our results indicate that this method could effectively improve the ability to monitor the vegetation phenology by NDVI time series in areas with seasonal snow cover.

TI  - Empirical Algorithm for Significant Wave Height Retrieval from Wave Mode Data Provided by the Chinese Satellite Gaofen-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3), the first Chinese civil C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was successfully launched by the China Academy of Space Technology on 10 August 2016. Among its 12 imaging modes, wave mode is designed to monitor the ocean surface waves over the open ocean. An empirical retrieval algorithm of significant wave height (SWH), termed Quad-Polarized C-bandWAVE algorithm for GF-3 wave mode (QPCWAVE_GF3), is developed for quad-polarized SAR measurements from GF-3 in wave mode. QPCWAVE_GF3 model is built using six SAR image and spectrum related parameters. Based on a total of 2576 WaveWatch III (WW3) and GF-3 wave mode match-ups, 12 empirical coefficients of the model are determined for 6 incidence angle modes. The validation of the QPCWAVE_GF3 model is performed through comparisons against independent WW3 modelling hindcasts, and observations from altimeters and buoys from January to October in 2017. The assessment shows a good agreement with root mean square error from 0.5 m to 0.6 m, and scatter index around 20%. In particular, applications of the QPCWAVE_GF3 model in SWH estimation for two storm cases from GF-3 data in wave mode and Quad-Polarization Strip I mode are presented respectively. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for SWH estimation from GF-3 wave mode and is promising for other similar data.

TI  - Multi-Pixel Simultaneous Classification of PolSAR Image Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in the optical image processing field. Because of the excellent performance of CNN, more and more methods based on CNN are applied to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. Most CNN-based PolSAR image classification methods can only classify one pixel each time. Because all the pixels of a PolSAR image are classified independently, the inherent interrelation of different land covers is ignored. We use a fixed-feature-size CNN(FFS-CNN) to classify all pixels in a patch simultaneously. The proposed method has several advantages. First, FFS-CNN can classify all the pixels in a small patch simultaneously. When classifying a whole PolSAR image, it is faster than common CNNs. Second, FFS-CNN is trained to learn the interrelation of different land covers in a patch, so it can use the interrelation of land covers to improve the classification results. The experiments of FFS-CNN are evaluated on a Chinese Gaofen-3 PolSAR image and other two real PolSAR images. Experiment results show that FFS-CNN is comparable with the state-of-the-art PolSAR image classification methods.

TI  - Urban Built-Up Area Boundary Extraction and Spatial-Temporal Characteristics Based on Land Surface Temperature Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of urban built-up area is conducive to the rational formulation of urban land use strategy, scientific planning and rational distribution of modern urban development. Based on the remote sensing data in four separate years (1999, 2004, 2010 and 2014), this research identified and inspected the urban built-up area boundary based on the temperature retrieval method. Combined with the second land investigation data and Google map data in Jingzhou, this paper used the qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics of Jingzhou urban built-up area expansion over the past 15 years. The analysis shows that the entire spatial form of the urban built-up area has been evolving towards a compact and orderly state. On this basis, the urban area-population elasticity coefficient and algometric growth model were used to determine the reasonability of the urban sprawl. The results show that the expansion of built-up area in Jingzhou is not keeping up with the speed of population growth.

TI  - Progressive left ventricular dysfunction and long-term outcomes in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy receiving cardiopulmonary therapies
T2  - OPEN HEART
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To describe the natural history of cardiomyopathy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are receiving contemporary therapies.Methods This is a single-institution retrospective cohort study of 57 patients aged > 15 years with DMD. Serial digital echocardiograms were performed over a median follow-up of 8 years. Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) was defined as shortening fraction (SF) < 29% plus focal wall motion abnormalities. Therapies included ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and assisted ventilation.Results The SF declined progressively in 53/57 patients (93%). LVD occurred in 40 of 57 patients (70%), with variable age at onset (median 18 years, IQR 14-21.5 years). Rate of SF decline (-1.51%+/- 1.16%/year) was variable and unrelated to genotype. However, survival was shorter for patients with LVD onset at age < 18 years vs onset at = 18 years (death at 21.1 +/- 2.5 years vs 33.1 +/- 4.4 years; P< 0.001). Death occurred in 27/57 (47%) patients at a median age of 26.3 years (IQR 20.6-31.5). Death was preceded by LVD in 22/27 patients (81%), 15 (68%) of whom developed class 4 heart failure (CHF). Time from CHF to death was brief (median 8.0 months).Conclusion Despite contemporary therapies, SF declined progressively in almost all patients. Age at onset of LVD and age at death were variable and unrelated to genotype; however, survival was shortened for patients with LVD onset at age < 18 years. Death was usually preceded by LVD. CHF was a sentinel event, with death occurring shortly thereafter.

TI  - VIIRS-derived ocean color product using the imaging bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique and implementation for deriving ocean color product using the imaging band (I-band) measurements from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) have been developed. The three VIIRS-SNPP image bands (638, 862, and 1600 nm) with spatial resolution of 375 m are much better than the VIIRS moderate (M) resolution bands of 750 m, which have been used for routinely producing VIIRS global ocean color products. In particular, the high spatial resolution of VIIRS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 638 nm (11 band) nL(omega)(638) can provide useful information about water optical, biological, and biogeochemical properties over turbid coastal and inland waters. In addition, VIIRS-derived nL, (638) data provide an important spectral point and coverage along with nL(omega)(1) from the seven VIIRS M-bands at wavelengths of 410, 443, 486, 551, 671, 745, and 862 nm, particularly over turbid coastal and inland waters. In this paper, we describe our effort to develop a technique for deriving VIIRS nL(omega)(lambda) spectra for both M-bands and I-bands using the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system. Some examples of VIIRS-derived nL(omega)(638) are provided and discussed, showing the usefulness of this added capability for providing water properties over global turbid coastal and inland waters. Therefore, MSL12 is now capable of routinely and efficiently producing VIIRS nL(omega)(638) for both spatial resolutions of 375 and 750 m, along with nL(omega)(lambda) spectra at VIIRS Ml-M7 with the spatial resolution of 750 m.

TI  - A Relative Radiometric Calibration Method Based on the Histogram of Side-Slither Data for High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative radiometric calibration, or flat fielding, is indispensable for obtaining high-quality optical satellite imagery for sensors that have more than one detector per band. High-resolution optical push-broom sensors with thousands of detectors per band are now common. Multiple techniques have been employed for relative radiometric calibration. One technique, often called side-slither, where the sensor axis is rotated 90 degrees in yaw relative to normal acquisitions, has been gaining popularity, being applied to Landsat 8, QuickBird, RapidEye, and other satellites. Side-slither can be more time efficient than some of the traditional methods, as only one acquisition may be required. In addition, the side-slither does not require any onboard calibration hardware, only a satellite capability to yaw and maintain a stable yawed attitude. A relative radiometric calibration method based on histograms of side-slither data is developed. This method has three steps: pre-processing, extraction of key points, and calculation of coefficients. Histogram matching and Otsu's method are used to extract key points. Three datasets from the Chinese GaoFen-9 satellite were used: one to obtain the relative radiometric coefficients, and the others to verify the coefficients. Root-mean-square deviations of the corrected imagery were better than 0.1%. The maximum streaking metrics was less than 1. This method produced significantly better relative radiometric calibration than the traditional method used for GaoFen-9.

TI  - Improving Object-Based Land Use/Cover Classification from Medium Resolution Imagery by Markov Chain Geostatistical Post-Classification
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover maps derived from remotely sensed imagery are often insufficient in quality for some quantitative application purposes due to a variety of reasons such as spectral confusion. Although object-based classification has some advantages over pixel-based classification in identifying relatively homogeneous land use/cover areas from medium resolution remotely sensed images, the classification accuracy is usually still relatively low. In this study, we aimed to test whether the recently proposed Markov chain random field (MCRF) post-classification method, that is, the spectral similarity-enhanced MCRF co-simulation (SS-coMCRF) model, can effectively improve object-based land use/cover classifications on different landscapes. Four study areas (Cixi, Yinchuan and Maanshan in China and Hartford in USA) with different landscapes and classification schemes were chosen for case studies. Expert-interpreted sample data (0.087% to 0.258% of total pixels) were obtained for each study area from the original Landsat images used in object-based pre-classification and other sources (e.g., Google satellite imagery). Post-classification results showed that the overall classification accuracies of the four cases were obviously improved over the corresponding pre-classification results by 14.1% for Cixi, 5% for Yinchuan, 11.8% for Maanshan and 5.6% for Hartford, respectively. At the meantime, SS-coMCRF also reduced the noise and minor patches contained in pre-classifications. This means that the Markov chain geostatistical post-classification method is capable of improving the accuracy and quality of object-based land use/cover classification from medium resolution remotely sensed imagery in various landscape situations.

TI  - Thirty-year expansion of construction land in Xi'an: Spatial pattern and potential driving factors
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - China has witnessed rapid urban growth over the past 3 decades resulting in vast ecological and environmental issues. Understanding the process of construction land (Cl) expansion and its driving factors are crucial for urban growth planning and management to mitigate the adverse impacts of such growth. Based on remote sensing data for 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2008, we monitored Cl changes in Xi'an City over the past 3 decades. The land use transform matrices were calculated. The results showed that from 1975 to 2008, remarkable changes in Cl occurred in Xi'an City. Over the past 30years, the Cl concentration spread from one centre to multiple centres. The elevation, slope, traffic condition, wetland, education industry, rebuilding of city village, and historical and cultural sites may be the most important driving forces. We therefore recommend discussing the interactions of these potential driving factors within the Cl sprawl.

TI  - The desertification process in the Silk Road Economic Belt in the past 15years: A study using MODIS data and GIS analysis
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The arid region in the northern part of China is a bridge between China and neighbouring countries in the Silk Road Economic Belt, and the severe desertification in this region restricts its sustainable development. In this paper, MODIS data, including albedo, reflectance, normalized vegetation index, and land surface temperature, were selected in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 to construct a decision tree to extract spatio-temporal information of the desertified land in the arid area. The trend in desertification and transfer directions was analysed by the GIS method, and the dynamic characteristics of the desertification at different units (provincial administrative unit and typical sandy land) and with different topographic factors (slope and aspect) are discussed. Our conclusions include (a) desertification in the arid region in the northern part of China showed improvement overall and local deterioration. The deteriorating areas were located primarily in the western region of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, the tectonic zone of the Taklimakan Desert, and the Qaidam Basin; (b) the degree of desertification transfer occurred primarily at adjacent levels; (c) the desertified area in each province showed a different trend in fluctuation, and Maowusu Sandy Land recovered better among the 4 large sands; and (d) the desertified area was distributed primarily along 0(o)-3(o) slopes and showed a rapid decline at increased slopes. The change in the degree of desertification in each aspect largely was a general reversal, and the area of the north aspect was larger than that of other areas of aspects. This study provides some theoretical support for the control of desertification in the Silk Road Economic Belt.

TI  - Relationship between Park Composition, Vegetation Characteristics and Cool Island Effect
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Land Surface Temperature (LST) of a park is lower than the surrounding environment, and thus the parkland forms a Park Cool Island (PCI). However, more case studies are needed to reveal the relationship between park composition, vegetation characteristic and PCI development. The LST and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) of 18 different sized parks in Changzhou, China were obtained from Landsat-8 and Mapworld Changzhou data. Then, a sample investigation method was used to calculate vegetation characteristics of these parks by an i-Tree Eco model. In order to reduce the impact from the external environment on PCI, the Temperature Drop Amplitude (TDA) and Temperature Drop Range (TR) inside the parks were analyzed by ArcGIS 9.3. Impact factors were tested by Pearson correlation analysis and curve fit to reveal the relationship between these factors and PCI formation. The result shows that a park area threshold of 1.34 to 17 hectares provides the best PCI effect, that park shape (perimeter/area), Leaf Area Index (LAI), density, tree cover, water cover, and impervious surface cover have significant correlation with PCI development, vegetation health and global climate change affect the PCI development. Advice is proposed to improve and maintain PCI effects.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of the Surface Runoff Coefficient of HiPIMS in Simulating Flood Processes in a Large Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To simulate flood processes at the basin level, the GPU-based High-Performance Integrated Hydrodynamic Modelling System (HiPIMS) is gaining interest as computational capability increases. However, the difficulty of coping with rainfall input to HiPIMS reduces the possibility of acquiring a satisfactory simulation accuracy. The objective of this study is to test the sensitivity of the surface runoff coefficient in the HiPIMS source term in the Misai basin with an area of 797 km(2) in south China. To achieve this, the basin was divided into 909,824 grid cells, to each of which a Manning coefficient was assigned based on its land use type interpreted from remote sensing data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for three typical flood processes under four types of surface runoff coefficients, assumed a priori, upon three error functions. The results demonstrate the crucial role of the surface runoff coefficient in achieving better simulation accuracy and reveal that this coefficient varies with flood scale and is unevenly distributed over the basin.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Methods for GF-1 WFV1 Data in Hazy Weather
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing hazy weather in the eastern area of China limits the potential application of high-resolution satellite data and poses a huge challenge for the atmospheric correction of remote sensing images. Consequently, it is necessary to find the most suitable atmospheric correction method under hazy condition. In this study, five kinds of atmospheric correction models, including 6S, COST, FLAASH, QUAC, and ATCOR2, are applied to the GaoFen-1 Wild Field Camera (GF-1 WFV1) data in the eastern area of China, and examined by both quantitative and qualitative analyses using the measured spectrum data. Experimental results indicated that ATCOR2 achieves the best performance among the atmospheric correction methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Hence, specifically for the study area and GF-1 WFV1 dataset, ATCOR2 is the most suitable atmospheric correction approach under hazy in the eastern area of China.

TI  - Current surgical management of breast cancer
T2  - BRITISH COLUMBIA MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Definitive treatment of breast cancer is surgical. Typically, the primary tumor is excised and axillary nodes are removed for staging. The decision on optimal treatment for the breast can be challenging for the clinician and the patient because of the wide variety of surgical options, including breast conserving surgery and mastectomy with or without immediate or delayed breast reconstruction. Surgical management of the axilla for clinically node-negative and node-positive patients has progressed significantly over time. Sentinel node biopsy is now recommended for many clinical scenarios that would have previously required axillary node dissection. As optimal management of breast cancer is becoming more complex, many patients may benefit from early multidisciplinary review to aid in clinical decision making and to develop a patient specific treatment strategy. Current surgical management of breast cancer in British Columbia is based on consensus recommendations from the Breast Tumour Group of the BC Cancer Surgical Oncology Network.

TI  - Characterizing Land Surface Anisotropic Reflectance over Rugged Terrain: A Review of Concepts and Recent Developments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Rugged terrain, including mountains, hills, and some high lands are typical land surfaces around the world. As a physical parameter for characterizing the anisotropic reflectance of the land surface, the importance of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) has been gradually recognized in the remote sensing community, and great efforts have been dedicated to build BRDF models over various terrain types. However, on rugged terrain, the topography intensely affects the shape and magnitude of the BRDF and creates challenges in modeling the BRDF. In this paper, after a brief introduction of the theoretical background of the BRDF over rugged terrain, the status of estimating land surface BRDF properties over rugged terrain is comprehensively reviewed from a historical perspective and summarized in two categories: BRDFs describing solo slopes and those describing composite slopes. The discussion focuses on land surface reflectance retrieval over mountainous areas, the difference in solo slope and composite slope BRDF models, and suggested future research to improve the accuracy of BRDFs derived with remote sensing satellites.

TI  - Using Bi-Seasonal WorldView-2 Multi-Spectral Data and Supervised Random Forest Classification to Map Coastal Plant Communities in Everglades National Park
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal plant communities are being transformed or lost because of sea level rise (SLR) and land-use change. In conjunction with SLR, the Florida Everglades ecosystem has undergone large-scale drainage and restoration, altering coastal vegetation throughout south Florida. To understand how coastal plant communities are changing over time, accurate mapping techniques are needed that can define plant communities at a fine-enough resolution to detect fine-scale changes. We explored using bi-seasonal versus single-season WorldView-2 satellite data to map three mangrove and four adjacent plant communities, including the buttonwood/glycophyte community that harbors the federally-endangered plant Chromolaena frustrata. Bi-seasonal dataweremore effective than single-season to differentiate all communities of interest. Bi-seasonal data combined with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) elevation datawere used tomap coastal plant communities of a coastal stretchwithin Everglades National Park (ENP). Overall map accuracy was 86%. Black and red mangroves were the dominant communities and covered 50% of the study site. All the remaining communities had <= 10% cover, including the buttonwood/glycophyte community. ENP harbors 21 rare coastal species threatened by SLR. The spatially explicit, quantitative data provided by our map provides a fine-scale baseline for monitoring future change in these species' habitats. Our results also offer a method to monitor vegetation change in other threatened habitats.

TI  - Projecting the future of an alpine ungulate under climate change scenarios
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change represents a primary threat to species persistence and biodiversity at a global scale. Cold adapted alpine species are especially sensitive to climate change and can offer key early warning signs about deleterious effects of predicted change. Among mountain ungulates, survival, a key determinant of demographic performance, may be influenced by future climate in complex, and possibly opposing ways. Demographic data collected from 447 mountain goats in 10 coastal Alaska, USA, populations over a 37-year time span indicated that survival is highest during low snowfall winters and cool summers. However, general circulation models (GCMs) predict future increase in summer temperature and decline in winter snowfall. To disentangle how these opposing climate-driven effects influence mountain goat populations, we developed an age-structured population model to project mountain goat population trajectories for 10 different GCM/emissions scenarios relevant for coastal Alaska. Projected increases in summer temperature had stronger negative effects on population trajectories than the positive demographic effects of reduced winter snowfall. In 5 of the 10 GCM/representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, the net effect of projected climate change was extinction over a 70-year time window (2015-2085); smaller initial populations were more likely to go extinct faster than larger populations. Using a resource selection modeling approach, we determined that distributional shifts to higher elevation (i.e., thermoneutral) summer range was unlikely to be a viable behavioral adaptation strategy; due to the conical shape of mountains, summer range was expected to decline by 17%-86% for 7 of the 10 GCM/RCP scenarios. Projected declines of mountain goat populations are driven by climate-linked bottom-up mechanisms and may have wide ranging implications for alpine ecosystems. These analyses elucidate how projected climate change can negatively alter population dynamics of a sentinel alpine species and provide insight into how demographic modeling can be used to assess risk to species persistence.

TI  - LAND COVER TYPES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE URBAN HEAT SIGNATURE OF UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES USING REMOTE SENSING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The campus, as an educational area, has a variety of land cover with varying surface temperatures. Knowledge of land use in a localized urban environment and its effect on the Urban Heat Signature (UHS) of a university campus is insufficient, so it is essential to assess UHS-related localized urban environments. The objective of this study is to assess land cover and its effect on the UHS of two university campuses. The research used spatial-temporal analysis employing satellite images during the period 2013-2014. The areas studied were the University Malaya (UM) and University Indonesia (UI) campuses. The results show that the land cover of both university campuses has the same localized urban environment pattern. Based on Landsat 8 TIRS (100 m ground resolution) both university campuses had UHS profiles related to vegetation cover of 25-33 degrees C, with mean temperature 28 degrees C is the lowest temperature, and building cover of 33-39 degrees C, with a mean temperature 35 degrees C, is the highest temperature, caused effect from Land cover types. Google Earth visual interpretation and digitalization provided the land cover based on 10mx10m vector square grids with their attributes validated by field survey. The research shows a trend of UHS change between 2013 and 2014, with the maximum temperature of >30 degrees C on the UM and UI Campuses with increased of temperature 1 degrees C. The study concludes that the UHS behavior is an effect of its temporal relation with land cover, which is new knowledge on university campuses about localized urban environments.

TI  - Metastases of malignant neoplasms: Historical, biological, & clinical considerations
T2  - SEMINARS IN DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The metastasis of neoplastic cells from their site of origin to distant anatomic locations continues to be the principal cause of death from malignant tumors, and that fact has been recognized by physicians for over a century. After the work done by Halsted in the treatment of breast cancer in the 1880s, accepted surgical canon held that metastasis occurred in a linear fashion, with centrifugal "growth in continuity" from the primary neoplasm that first involved regional lymph nodes. Those structures were considered to then be the sources of more distant, visceral metastases. With that premise in mind, radical and "ultra-radical" surgical procedures were devised to remove as many lymph nodes as possible in the treatment of carcinomas and melanomas. However, such interventions were ineffective in altering tumor-related mortality. This review considers the details of the historical material just mentioned. It also reviews currently-held concepts on biological mechanisms of metastasis, the "sentinel" lymph node biopsy technique, and the important topic of metastatic tumor "dormancy" as the cause of surgical treatment failure. Finally, predictive models of tumor behavior are discussed, which are based on gene signatures. These will likely be the key to identifying malignant lesions of low surgical stage that ultimately prove fatal through later manifestation of metastasis.

TI  - Phenology differences between native and novel exotic-dominated grasslands rival the effects of climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Novel ecosystems can differ from the native systems they replaced. We used phenology measures to compare ecosystem functioning between novel exotic-dominated and native-dominated grasslands in the central U.S.2. Phenology, or timing of biological events, is affected by climate and land use changes. We assessed how phenology shifts are being altered by exotic species dominance by comparing remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index within growing seasons at exotic-and native-dominated sites along a latitudinal gradient. Exotic species were dominated by the C-3 species functional group in the north and the C-4 species functional group in the south.3. Date of senescence was an average of 36 days later in exotic than native-dominated grasslands, and this effect was consistent across latitudes.4. Exotic-dominated grasslands greened-up an average of 10.7 days earlier than native-dominated grasslands, but this effect was highly dependent on latitude and the plant functional group that dominated at that latitude. Green-up differed between native and exotic sites the most in central and northern regions that had dominant C-3 grasses.5. We estimated the effects of an increase in global temperatures on green-up and senescence with a space-for-time substitution, and by comparing growing degree day differences between historical average temperatures and +2.5 degrees C. Green-up was significantly earlier and senescence was significantly later with a 2.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The native-exotic difference was significantly greater than the difference due to increased temperature for senescence, but not for green-up.6. Synthesis and applications. Native to exotic plant conversions in central U.S. grasslands have led to highly altered phenology, especially in terms of senescence, and this effect should be considered along with global warming in models moving forward. This conversion will have to be considered in developing estimates of how global change will affect phenology in locations where exotics are present, especially in cases where their abundance is increasing concurrent with climate change. Global change models and policy should consider exotic species invasion as an additional widespread factor behind changes in phenology.

TI  - Harmonic regression of Landsat time series for modeling attributes from national forest inventory data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Imagery from the Landsat Program has been used frequently as a source of auxiliary data for modeling land cover, as well as a variety of attributes associated with tree cover. With ready access to all scenes in the archive since 2008 due to the USGS Landsat Data Policy, new approaches to deriving such auxiliary data from dense Landsat time series are required. Several methods have previously been developed for use with finer temporal resolution imagery (e.g. AVHRR and MODIS), including image compositing and harmonic regression using Fourier series. The manuscript presents a study, using Minnesota, USA during the years 2009-2013 as the study area and timeframe. The study examined the relative predictive power of land cover models, in particular those related to tree cover, using predictor variables based solely on composite imagery versus those using estimated harmonic regression coefficients. The study used two common non-parametric modeling approaches (i.e. k-nearest neighbors and random forests) for fitting classification and regression models of multiple attributes measured on USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots using all available Landsat imagery for the study area and timeframe. The estimated Fourier coefficients developed by harmonic regression of tasseled cap transformation time series data were shown to be correlated with land cover, including tree cover. Regression models using estimated Fourier coefficients as predictor variables showed a two- to threefold increase in explained variance for a small set of continuous response variables, relative to comparable models using monthly image composites. Similarly, the overall accuracies of classification models using the estimated Fourier coefficients were approximately 10-20 percentage points higher than the models using the image composites, with corresponding individual class accuracies between six and 45 percentage points higher.

TI  - Glacial lakes of the Central and Patagonian Andes
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence and increased frequency of high -magnitude Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the Chilean and Argentinean Andes suggests this region will be prone to similar events in the future as glaciers continue to retreat and thin under a warming climate. Despite this situation, monitoring of glacial lake development in this region has been limited, with past investigations only covering relatively small regions of Patagonia. This study presents new glacial lake inventories for 1986, 2000 and 2016, covering the Central Andes, Northern Patagonia and Southern Patagonia. Our aim was to characterise the physical attributes, spatial distribution and temporal development of glacial lakes in these three sub-regions using Landsat satellite imagery and image datasets available in Google Earth and Bing Maps. Glacial lake water volume was also estimated using an empirical area volume scaling approach. Results reveal that glacial lakes across the study area have increased in number (43%) and areal extent (7%) between 1986 and 2016. Such changes equate to a glacial lake water volume increase of 65 km(3) during the 30-year observation period. However, glacial lake growth and emergence was shown to vary sub-regionally according to localised topography, meteorology, climate change, rate of glacier change and the availability of low gradient ice areas. These and other factors are likely to influence the occurrence of GLOFs in the future. This analysis represents the first large-scale census of glacial lakes in Chile and Argentina and will allow for a better understanding of lake development in this region, as well as, providing a basis for future GLOF risk assessments.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node surgery in prostate cancer using magnetic particles
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewSuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are tested to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to exploit the advantages of targeted pelvic SLN dissection (sPLND), while circumventing the disadvantages of established radioactive labeling. Here we review recent studies about sPLND in prostate cancer (PCa), including the first results of SLN detection using intraprostatic SPION-injection.Recent findingsA recent systematic literature review reveals that the diagnostic accuracy of sPLND is comparable with extended PLND (ePLND). sPLND combined with ePLND achieve better node removal by increasing the number of affected nodes. The first sentinel-based nomogram predicting lymph node invasion is established. A sentinel-nomogram update provides comparative predictions relative to ePLND models. sPLND using a magnetometer and SPIONs as a tracer is successful whenever applied to PCa, and SLN identification using MRI after intraprostatic injection of SPIONs is feasible. SLNs are present in an unexpectedly high number outside the ePLND template.SummarySLN detection outside the ePLND template and the increased diagnostic value of sPLND compared with ePLND supports the individualized extension of PLND using sPLND in PCa. SPION-MRI, combined with a hand-held magnetometer, provides a nonradioactive technique for preoperative and intraoperative SLN localization. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of sPLND on oncological outcomes.

TI  - An adaptive calibration and beamforming technique for a GEO satellite data relay
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - High throughput data links from low Earth orbit satellites through a geostationary orbit satellite data relay have been proposed to increase the available contact times to ground stations. Accurate antenna beam pointing and tracking of moving targets are key requirements for the relay satellite. In this work, we propose an adaptive calibration and beamforming methodology on the basis of least mean squares, which is suitable for a geostationary orbit data relay. The target system consists of the combination of a high gain reflector fed by a digitally steerable patch antenna array. The proposed method is first presented by numerical cosimulation of the antenna and the calibration algorithm. The results are then validated in an outdoor experimental setup with all digital signal processing implemented in a field-programmable gate array. We demonstrate the tracking ability and pointing performance of the digitally enhanced reflector antenna with gain fluctuations smaller than 3dB over a field of view of at least 2,5 degrees. The demonstrated performance shows that the digitally enhanced reflector antenna is a suitable candidate for long-distance space communications.

TI  - Improving MISR AOD Retrievals With Low-Light-Level Corrections for Veiling Light
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data have been shown to have a high bias in pristine oceanic areas. One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22. The best performing set will be implemented operationally in the next V23 MISR AOD product release.

TI  - Spatial Modeling of Soil Erosion Risk and Its Implication for Conservation Planning: The Case of the Gobele Watershed, East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion by water has accelerated over recent decades due to non-sustainable land use practices resulting in substantial land degradation processes. Spatially explicit information on soil erosion is critical for the development and implementation of appropriate Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures. The objectives of this study were to estimate the magnitude of soil loss rate, assess the change of erosion risk, and elucidate their implication for SWC planning in the Gobele Watershed, East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. Applying remote sensing data, the study first derived the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model parameters in an ArcGIS environment and estimated the soil loss rates. The estimated total soil loss in the watershed was 1,390,130.48 tons in 2000 and 1,022,445.09 tons in 2016 with a mean erosion rate of 51.04 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 34.26 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The study area was divided into eight erosion risk classes ranging from very low to extremely high. We established a change detection matrix of the soil erosion risk classes between 2000 and 2016. The change analysis results have revealed that about 70.80% of the soil erosion risk areas remained unchanged, 19.67% increased in total area, and 9.53% decreased, showing an overall worsening of the situation. We identified and mapped areas with a higher and increasing erosion risk as SWC priority areas using a Multi-criteria Decision Rules (MCDR) method. The top three priority levels marked for the emergency SWC measures account for about 0.04%, 0.49%, and 0.83%, respectively. These priority levels are situated along the steep slope areas in the north, northwest, south, and southeast of the Gobele Watershed. It is, thus, very critical to undertake proper intervention measures in upslope areas based on the priority levels to establish sustainable watershed management in the study area.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes and Their Effects on the Landscape of Abaya-Chamo Basin, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a combination of remote sensing data, field interviews and observations, and landscape indices to examine the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC), identify their driving forces, and analyze their effects on the landscape of Abaya-Chamo Basin (ACB) between 1985, 1995, and 2010. The results reveal that the landscape of ACB has changed considerably during the past 25 years between 1985 and 2010. The main changes observed imply a rapid reduction in shrubland (28.82%) and natural grassland (33.13%), and an increase in arable land (59.15%). The basin has become more fragmented and formed less connected patches in 2010 compared to 1985. Rapid population growth, internal migration, policy shifts, and regime change were identified as the key driving forces of LULC changes in ACB. The LULC changes and related trend of increasing landscape fragmentation in the basin increased soil erosion, the volume of surface runoff, and sediment transport in the landscape and, consequently, affected the levels and water quality of the lakes found in the rift floor. Furthermore, the destruction and fragmentation of shrubland and natural grassland led to the decline of wild plants and animals previously prominent in the basin. Therefore, protective measures that take into consideration the economic, social, and ecological dynamics of the basin are urgently needed to save the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of the basin from further damage.

TI  - Abundance of urban male mosquitoes by green infrastructure types: implications for landscape design and vector management
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is widely espoused in sustainable urban design. Notwithstanding its ecosystem services, UGS is commonly perceived as inadvertent habitats for urban mosquitoes. Moreover, the lack of ecological understanding of mosquitoes and their urban habitats renders vector control in green spaces without reliance on chemical and bio-pesticides especially challenging.This study envisages the application of a comparative analytical method for the evaluation and optimization of vector management in different urban spaces. The research examines the extent of male habitat preference as measured by population characteristics of urban adult mosquitoes on green roof and control sites.Adult mosquito traps were deployed on green roofs (GR), bare roofs (negative control, NC), and low-elevation gardens (positive control, PC). Distribution of male and female members of vector species were analyzedUrban adult male mosquitoes exhibited highly-selective habitat use of the studied urban spaces, in that they were clustered chiefly in PC. Their spatial distributions are consistently explained by site group even under the stringent measure of presence/absence. The sex ratios of GR and NC were highly skewed toward females, which lends further to the interpretation of strong male habitat preference for the studied PC gardens.Urban mosquitoes do not display similar degrees of affinity for different types of green infrastructure. The methodology used can help prioritize urban sites and optimize control strategies. The uses of amenable environmental features salient to mosquito survival in landscape design should be explored as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly vector management approach.

TI  - Prevalence of carbapenem resistance and carbapenemase production among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from urine in the UK: results of the UK infection-Carbapenem Resistance Evaluation Surveillance Trial (iCREST-UK)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although carbapenem susceptibility testing has been recommended for all Enterobacteriaceae from clinical specimens, for practical reasons a carbapenem is not included in many primary antibiotic panels for urine specimens. The 'iCREST' study sought carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in routine urine specimens yielding Gram-negative growth in five diagnostic laboratories in the UK. We sought also to compare locally and centrally determined MICs of meropenem and ceftazidime/avibactam.Positive growth from up to 2000 urine specimens per laboratory was plated onto chromID(A (R)) CARBA SMART agar. Suspected CPE colonies were tested locally by Etest for susceptibility to meropenem and ceftazidime/avibactam, and referred to central laboratories for PCR confirmation of CPE status and microbroth MIC determination.Twenty-two suspected CPE were identified from 7504 urine specimens. Ten were confirmed by PCR to have NDM (5), IMP (2), KPC (2) or OXA-48-like (1) carbapenemases. Locally determined ceftazidime/avibactam MICs showed complete categorical agreement with those determined centrally by microbroth methodology. The seven ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant isolates (MI256 mg/L) had NDM or IMP metallo-carbapenemases.The frequency of confirmed CPE among Gram-negative urinary isolates was low, at 0.13% (10/7504), but CPE were found in urines at all five participating sites and the diversity of carbapenemase genes detected reflected the complex epidemiology of CPE in the UK. These data can inform local policies about the cost-effectiveness and clinical value of testing Gram-negative bacteria from urine specimens routinely against a carbapenem as part of patient management and/or infection prevention and control strategies.

TI  - Biological processes dominate seasonality of remotely sensed canopy greenness in an Amazon evergreen forest
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of Amazon forests show seasonal and interannual variations, but the underlying biological processes remain debated.Here we combined radiative transfer models (RTMs) with field observations of Amazon forest leaf and canopy characteristics to test three hypotheses for satellite-observed canopy reflectance seasonality: seasonal changes in leaf area index, in canopy-surface leafless crown fraction and/or in leaf demography.Canopy RTMs (PROSAIL and FLiES), driven by these three factors combined, simulated satellite-observed seasonal patterns well, explaining c. 70% of the variability in a key reflectance-based vegetation index (MAIAC EVI, which removes artifacts that would otherwise arise from clouds/aerosols and sun-sensor geometry). Leaf area index, leafless crown fraction and leaf demography independently accounted for 1, 33 and 66% of FLiES-simulated EVI seasonality, respectively. These factors also strongly influenced modeled near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, explaining why both modeled and observed EVI, which is especially sensitive to NIR, captures canopy seasonal dynamics well.Our improved analysis of canopy-scale biophysics rules out satellite artifacts as significant causes of satellite-observed seasonal patterns at this site, implying that aggregated phenology explains the larger scale remotely observed patterns. This work significantly reconciles current controversies about satellite-detected Amazon phenology, and improves our use of satellite observations to study climate-phenology relationships in the tropics.

TI  - Validation of synthetic daily Landsat NDVI time series data generated by the improved spatial and temporal data fusion approach
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Correlation analysis has been widely used to validate the accuracy of synthetic medium-resolution data generated by spatial and temporal fusion methods. However, as the temporal resolution of Landsat data is 16 days, this method only can be used for the validation of multi-temporal Landsat data. This means that the fusion accuracy of most images in a synthetic daily time series have not been validated. Furthermore, the fusion accuracy of each image in a synthetic Landsat time series is different, because there is a negative correlation with the time interval length between the fusion date and the base image date. Therefore, there is a need for temporal validation of synthetic daily Landsat time series data. We propose a suitable validation method in this paper. The improved spatial and temporal data fusion approach (ISTDFA) was applied to generate synthetic daily Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, which were then validated for both spatial and temporal dimensions using actual MODIS NDVI time series. For temporal validation, the correlation coefficients (R) between the actual and synthetic 500 m NDVI time series were calculated by pixel-by-pixel to generate imagery with an R value for each pixel. For spatial validation, R between MODIS NDVI imagery and synthetic Landsat NDVI imagery was calculated day by day to generate an R time series. This method was tested and validated in two locations (Bole and Luntai) in Xinjiang Province, China. The results show that, for temporal validation, the R values of 86.08% pixels in Bole and 94.71% pixels in Luntai are higher than 0.9, and in spatial validation, R values are higher than 0.8 on most days. Synthetic daily Landsat NDVI data was used to monitor the phenology of vegetation at a spatial resolution of 30 m successfully, while the MODIS product is limited to 500 m. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Performance comparison of the MODIS and the VIIRS 1.38 pm cirrus cloud channels using libRadtran and CALIOP data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) M9 channel and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 26 channel have been simulated using the libRadtran radiative transfer model and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Vertical Feature Mask data. The simulated data were analyzed to quantify the performance differences between the VIIRS M9 and the MODIS 26 channels. Analysis of simulated clear-sky TOA reflectances showed that compared MODIS channel 26, the VIIRS M9 channel always performs better in reducing background reflectance regardless of latitude, season, surface type, vapor content or surface elevation. For mid-latitude, sub-Arctic and tropical regions the VIIRS M9 channel reduce the background reflectance by approximately 66.7%, 52.6% and 41.5%, respectively over the surface type of sandstone, compared to MODIS channel 26. Simulations for cloudy skies showed that both stratus and cumulus clouds contribute less to VIIRS M9 and MODIS band 26 TOA reflectances. Analysis of observed MODIS, VIIRS and CALIOP data was consistent with the simulated results. The VIIRS M9 decreases clear-sky background reflectance by as much as 35.96% and non-cirrus cloud reflectance by 29.86% compared with the MODIS channel 26. The observed reflectances of MODIS and VIIRS cirrus channels for clear sky, non-cirrus cloud, and cirrus cloud are 0.0133 and 0.0095, 0.020 and 0.015, 0.084 and 0.067 respectively.

TI  - A New Method for Temperature Spatial Interpolation Based on Sparse Historical Stations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term grid historical temperature datasets are the foundation of climate change research. Datasets developed by traditional interpolation methods usually contain data for a period of less than 50 yr, with a relatively low spatial resolution owing to the sparse distribution of stations in the historical period. In this study, the point interpolation based on Biased Sentinel Hospitals Areal Disease Estimation (P-BSHADE) method has been used to interpolate 1-km grids of monthly surface air temperatures in the historical period of 1900-50 in China. The method can be used to remedy the station bias resulting from sparse coverage, and it considers the characteristics of spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity of the temperature distribution to obtain unbiased and minimum error variance estimates. The results have been compared with those from widely used methods such as kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and a combined spline with kriging (TPS-KRG) method, both theoretically and empirically. The leave-one-out cross-validation method using a real dataset was implemented. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) [mean absolute error (MAE)] for P-BSHADE is 0.98 degrees C (0.75 degrees C), while those for TPS-KRG, kriging, and IDW are 1.46 degrees (1.07 degrees), 2.23 degrees (1.51 degrees), and 2.64 degrees C (1.85 degrees C), respectively. The results of validation using a simulated dataset also present the smallest error for P-BSHADE, demonstrating its empirical superiority. In addition to its empirical superiority, the method also can produce a map of the estimated error variance, representing the uncertainty of estimation.

TI  - A UAV and S2A data-based estimation of the initial biomass of green algae in the South Yellow Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the initial biomass of green tide was the green algae attaching to Pyropia aquaculture rafts in the Southern Yellow Sea. In this study, the green algae was identified with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an biomass estimation model was proposed for green algae biomass in the radial sand ridge area based on Sentinel-2A image (S2A) and UAV images. The result showed that the green algae was detected highly accurately with the normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI); approximately 1340 tons and 700 tons of green algae were attached to rafts and raft ropes respectively, and the lower biomass might be the main cause for the smaller scale of green tide in 2017. In addition, UAV play an important role in raft-attaching green algae monitoring and long-term research of its biomass would provide a scientific basis for the control and forecast of green tide in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Calculating Viewing Angles Pixel by Pixel in Optical Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery Using the Rational Function Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In studies involving the extraction of surface physical parameters using optical remote sensing satellite imagery, sun-sensor geometry must be known, especially for sensor viewing angles. However, while pixel-by-pixel acquisitions of sensor viewing angles are of critical importance to many studies, currently available algorithms for calculating sensor-viewing angles focus only on the center-point pixel or are complicated and are not well known. Thus, this study aims to provide a simple and general method to estimate the sensor viewing angles pixel by pixel. The Rational Function Model (RFM) is already widely used in high-resolution satellite imagery, and, thus, a method is proposed for calculating the sensor viewing angles based on the space-vector information for the observed light implied in the RFM. This method can calculate independently the sensor-viewing angles in a pixel-by-pixel fashion, regardless of the specific form of the geometric model, even for geometrically corrected imageries. The experiments reveal that the calculated values differ by approximately 10(-40) for the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) Wide-Field-View-1 (WFV-1) sensor, and by -10(-70) for the Ziyuan-3 (ZY3-02) panchromatic nadir (NAD) sensor when compared to the values that are calculated using the Rigorous Sensor Model (RSM), and the discrepancy is analyzed. Generally, the viewing angles for each pixel in imagery are calculated accurately with the proposed method.

TI  - Detecting Coastline Change with All Available Landsat Data over 1986-2015: A Case Study for the State of Texas, USA
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline change often results from social and natural factors, such as human activities in the coastal zone, long-term and short-term sea level change, hurricane occurrences, subsequent recovery, and so on. Tracking coastline change is essential to deepen our understanding of coastal responses to these factors. Such information is also required for land use planning and sustainable development of coastal zones. In this context, we aimed to collect all available Landsat data (TM: Thematic Mapper, ETM+: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and OLI: Operational Land Imager) over 1986-2015 for tracking the coastline dynamic and estimating its change rate in the State of Texas, USA. First, the land vs. water maps at an annual scale were derived from the satellite images. The border between land and water represents the coastline in this study. Second, the annual land area was obtained to characterize the coastline dynamic and a linear regression model was used for estimating the change rate. We also analyzed the potential driving factors of the observed coastline change. The results reveal that the coastline in the State of Texas changed at a rate of -0.154 +/- 0.063 km(2)/year from 1986 to 2015, which indicates that the coastline has mainly experienced an erosion over the past three decades. Specifically, 52.58% of the entire coastline retreated to the land while a 47.42% portion advanced to the ocean. Long-term sea level rise can result in the erosion of coastline. Hurricane occurrences can explain the relatively strong coastline erosion. Besides, significant difference between the coastline change rate with a higher curvature and a lower curvature was observed. This study establishes a general method for detecting coastline change at large spatial and long-term temporal scales, by using remote sensing that can give fundamental information on coastline change. This is important for making scientific and reasonable policies of sustainable development of coastal zones.

TI  - The economic burden of stroke care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland: Using a national stroke register to estimate and report patient-level health economic outcomes in stroke
T2  - EUROPEAN STROKE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Stroke registries are used in many settings to measure stroke treatment and outcomes, but rarely include data on health economic outcomes. We aimed to extend the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme registry of England, Wales and Northern Ireland to derive and report patient-level estimates of the cost of stroke care.Methods An individual patient simulation model was built to estimate health and social care costs at one and five years after stroke, and the cost-benefits of thrombolysis and early supported discharge. Costs were stratified according to age, sex, stroke type (ischaemic or primary intracerebral haemorrhage) and stroke severity. The results were illustrated using data on all patients with stroke included in Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme from April 2015 to March 2016 (n=84,184).Results The total cost of health and social care for patients with acute stroke each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was 3.60 billion in the first five years after admission (mean per patient cost: 46,039). There was fivefold variation in the magnitude of costs between patients, ranging from 19,101 pound to 107,336 pound. Costs increased with older age, increasing stroke severity and intracerebral hemorrhage stroke. Increasing the proportion of eligible patients receiving thrombolysis or early supported discharge was estimated to save health and social care costs by five years after stroke.Discussion The cost of stroke care is large and varies widely between patients. Increasing the proportion of eligible patients receiving thrombolysis or early supported discharge could contribute to reducing the financial burden of stroke.Conclusion Extending stroke registers to report individualised data on costs may enhance their potential to support quality improvement and research.

TI  - Remote estimation of canopy leaf area index and chlorophyll content in Moso bamboo (<i>Phyllostachys edulis</i> (Carriere) J. Houz.) forest using MODIS reflectance data
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message We estimated the leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CC) ofMoso bamboo forest by using statistical models based on MODIS data and field measurements. Results showed that the statistical model driven by MODIS data has the potential to accurately estimate LAI and CC, while the structure of the calibration models varied between on-and off-years because of the different leaf change and bamboo shoot production characteristics between these types of years.Context LAI and CC (gram per square meter of ground area) are important parameters for determining carbon exchange between Moso bamboo forest (Phyllostachys edulis (Carriere) J. Houz.) and the atmosphere.Aims This study evaluated the ability of a statistical model driven by MODIS data to accurately estimate the LAI and CC in Moso bamboo forest, and differences in the LAI and CC between on-years (years with great shoot production) and off-years (years with less shoot production) were analyzed.Methods The LAI and CC measurements were collected in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, China. Indicators of LAI and CC were calculated from MODIS data. Then, a regression analysis was used to build relationships between the LAI and CC and various indicators on the basis of leaf change and bamboo shoot production characteristics of Moso bamboo forest.Results LAI and CC were accurately estimated by using the regression analysis driven by MODIS-derived indicators with a relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 9.04 and 13.1%, respectively. The structure of the calibration models varied between on- and off-years. Long-term time series analysis from 2000 to 2015 showed that LAI and CC differed largely between on-and off-years.Conclusion This study demonstrates that LAI and CC ofMoso bamboo forest can be estimated accurately by using a statistical model driven by MODIS-derived indicators, but attention should be paid to differences in the calibration models between on-and off-years.

TI  - Prevalence and Genotype Distribution of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in Urine among Men Attending Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics in Guangdong Province, China, in 2016
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have rarely assessed the genotype distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in urine among men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics (MSCs) in China. This study was aimed at investigating the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of CT infection by examining urine samples among MSCs from different geographic areas of Guangdong Province, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among MSCs from 10 human immunodeficiency virus sentinel surveillance sites in Guangdong Province. CT DNA was extracted from male urine samples and analyzed using a Roche cobas 4800 CT/NG. The ompA genes were amplified by nested PCR and sequenced. The leukocyte esterase test was performed by routine urine analysis at local clinics. Of the 1,903 samples, 163 (8.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8-16.3%) tested positive for CT. The highest prevalence (10.5%) of CT infection was observed among participants aged between 21 and 30 years. A total of 130 CT-positive samples (79.8%, 130/163) were successfully genotyped by nested PCR, resulting in 8 genotypes. The most prevalent genotypes were D, E, F, and J, with proportions of 20.8%, 20.0%, 17.7%, and 16.9%, respectively. There were no significant correlations between the geographical areas, leukocyte esterase test results and genotype distribution. Promotion of detection and molecular epidemiology research is needed for effective and comprehensive prevention and control programs.

TI  - Clinicopathologic Factors Predictive of Occult Lymph Node Involvement in Cutaneous Head and Neck Melanoma
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Evaluate clinicopathologic factors contributing to regional lymph node (LN) metastases in cutaneous head and neck melanoma (HNM).Study Design Retrospective review of a national cancer database.Setting National Cancer Database (2004-2012).Methods National Cancer Database (NCDB) cases diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were head and neck cutaneous site codes, melanoma histology codes, and clinically node-negative status. Independent, clinicopathologic factors associated with pathologic positive LN status were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Subset analysis was performed on thin melanoma cases of 0.75 to 1 mm tumor depth to determine factors predictive of LN involvement and survival.Results Of 66,495 cases meeting inclusion criteria, 18,882 had nodes examined pathologically with 9.7% presenting with occult positive LN involvement. Mean (SD) age was 62.9 (16.13) years, and primary sites were scalp and neck (42.2%), face (40.2%), and external ear, lip, or eyelid (7.6%). Multivariable analysis found younger age; primary site of cutaneous scalp, neck, or face; increasing thickness; mitoses; ulceration; and vertical growth phase presence were independently associated with LN positivity (P < .001). Only 2% of 0.75- to 1.0-mm Breslow thickness cases had regional LN involvement, and age >70 was negatively associated with LN involvement (P = .002) in this subset.Conclusion This is the largest study examining factors predictive of occult LN involvement in patients with clinical node-negative cutaneous HNM who may benefit from sentinel LN biopsy. Primary sites of external ear, lip, or eyelid are less likely to present with occult nodal involvement, and older patients with T1a melanoma 0.76 mm are unlikely to present with regional node metastasis and may not require sentinel node guided management.

TI  - Sentinel visits in emergency department patients with diabetes mellitus as a warning sign for hyperglycemic emergencies
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may have a sentinel emergency department (ED) visit for a precipitating condition prior to presenting for a hyperglycemic emergency, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). This study's objective was to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with a sentinel ED visit prior to their hyperglycemic emergency visit.Methods: This was a 1-year health records review of patients >= 18 years old presenting to one of four tertiary care EDs with a discharge diagnosis of hyperglycemia, DKA, or HHS. Trained research personnel collected data on patient characteristics, management, disposition, and determined whether patients came to the ED within the 14 days prior to their hyperglycemia visit. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.Results: Of 833 visits for hyperglycemia, 142 (17.0%; 95% CI: 14.5% to 19.6%) had a sentinel ED presentation within the preceding 14 days. Mean (SD) age was 50.5 (19.0) years and 54.4% were male; 104 (73.2%) were discharged from this initial visit, and 98/104 (94.2%) were discharged either without their glucose checked or with an elevated blood glucose (>11.0 mmol/L). Of the sentinel visits, 93 (65.5%) were for hyperglycemia and 22 (15.5%) for infection. Upon returning to the ED, 61/142 (43.0%) were admitted for severe hyperglycemia, DKA, or HHS.Conclusion: In this unique ED-based study, diabetic patients with a sentinel ED visit often returned and required subsequent admission for hyperglycemia. Clinicians should be vigilant in checking blood glucose and provide clear discharge instructions for follow-up and glucose management to prevent further hyperglycemic emergencies from occurring.

TI  - Ship Detection From Thermal Remote Sensing Imagery Through Region-Based Deep Forest
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection from thermal remote sensing imagery is a challenging task because of cluttered scenes and variable appearances of ships. In this letter, we propose a novel detection algorithm named region-based deep forest (RDF) toward overcoming these existing issues. The RDF consists of a simple region proposal network and a deep forest ensemble. The region proposal network trained over gradient features robustly generates a small number of candidates that precisely cover ship targets in various backgrounds. The deep forest ensemble adaptively learns features from remote sensing data and discriminates real ships from region proposals efficiently. The training process of deep forest ensemble is efficient and users can control training cost according to computational resource available. Experimental results on numerous thermal satellite images demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization and mapping of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in southern Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization, China is experiencing severe air pollution problems. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation and trends of air pollution is a key element of an improved understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms and the implementation of the most effective risk assessment and environmental policy in the region. The motivation behind the present work is that the study region of southern Jiangsu province of China is one of the most populated and developed regions in China. The daily concentrations of particulate matter with particle diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in southern Jiangsu province obtained during the year 2014 were used to derive the variogram model that provided a quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal (ST) variation of PM2.5 concentrations in the study region. A spatiotemporal ordinary kriging (STOK) technique was subsequently employed to generate informative maps of the ST pollutant distribution in southern Jiangsu province. The results generated by STOK showed that during 2014 about 29.3% of the area was PM2.5 polluted (at various severity levels, according to the criteria established by the Chinese government), and that the number of days characterized as polluted varied from 59 to 164 at different parts of the study region. Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, was the place with the highest PM2.5 pollution (including 3 days of serious pollution). The PM2.5 pollution exhibited a decreasing spatial trend from the western to the eastern part of southern Jiangsu. A similar temporal PM2.5 pattern was found from the western to the eastern part of southern Jiangsu, which was characterized by 4 peaks and 3 troughs linked to different meteorological conditions and human factors.

TI  - Predicting the minimum height of forest fire smoke within the atmosphere using machine learning and data from the CALIPSO satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire smoke is a growing public health concern as more intense and frequent fires are expected under climate change. Remote sensing is a promising tool for exposure assessment, but its utility for health studies is limited because most products measure pollutants in the total column of the atmosphere, and not the surface concentrations most relevant to population health. Information about the vertical distribution of smoke is vital for addressing this limitation. The CALIPSO satellite can provide such information but it cannot cover all smoke events due to its narrow ground track. In this study, we developed a random forests model to predict the minimum height of the smoke layer observed by CALIPSO at high temporal and spatial resolution, using information about fire activity in the vicinity, geographic location, and meteorological conditions. These pieces of information are typically available in near-real-time, ensuring that the resulting model can be easily operationalized. A total of 15,617 CALIPSO data blocks were identified as impacted by smoke within the province of British Columbia, Canada from 2006 to 2015, and 52.1% had smoke within the boundary layer, where the population might be exposed. The final model explained 82.1% of the variance in the observations with a root mean squared error of 560 m. The most important variables in the model were wind patterns, the month of smoke observation, and fire intensity within 500 km. Predictions from this model can be 1) directly applied to smoke detection from the existing remote sensing products to provide another dimension of information; 2) incorporated into statistical smoke models with inputs from remote sensing products; or 3) used to inform estimates of vertical dispersion in deterministic smoke models. These potential applications are expected to improve the assessment of ground-level population exposure to forest fire smoke.

TI  - Highly variable clinical feature and course of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA) is a rare cutaneous tumor with sweat gland differentiation. Due to the high risk of local recurrence and delayed metastasis, the wide local resection of the primary lesion and long-term follow up are recommended for ADPA. Here, we report two cases of ADPA. Case 1 had a blue-gray nodule on the tip of the right middle finger. Case 2 had had a papule on the dorsal side of the left ring finger for 13 years. In both cases, papillary proliferations of the tumor cells showed multilobular adenomatous structures with back-to-back patterns characteristic of ADPA. We amputated the finger at the proximal interphalangeal joint and performed a wide resection of the primary tumor in Case 1 and 2, respectively. Sentinel lymph node biopsy in the axilla was performed, and no sentinel lymph node metastasis was found in either case. Among the previously reported ADPA cases, clinically, most lesions were skin-colored or tan-brown to gray. The blue-gray color in Case 1 is thought to be extraordinary for ADPA. In Case 2, the patient had had the small lesion for more than 13 years and the tumor size had been stable during that long period. The present two cases suggest that ADPA shows a prominent variety of both clinical features and disease courses, and that we cannot exclude the possibility of ADPA even in cases of blue-gray nodules or small, stable, non-progressive papules.

TI  - Estimation of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures in urban landscapes using MODIS time series satellite data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air temperature is considered a significant variable for a variety of urban issues, and analyzing the spatial patterns of air temperature is important for urban planning and management. However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with T-max/T-min for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R-2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C for T-max and T-min in Los Angeles, and R-2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C for T-max and T-min in Seoul, respectively. LSTs obtained the day before were crucial for estimating daily urban air temperature. Estimated air temperature patterns showed that T-max was highly dependent on the geographic factors (e.g., sea breeze, mountains) of the two cities, while T-min showed marginally distinct temperature differences between built-up and vegetated areas in the two cities.

TI  - Application of a flood inundation model to analyze the potential impacts of a flood control plan in Mundeni Aru river basin, Sri Lanka
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing inundation extent by floods is indispensable for decision making for mitigating hazard. Satellite images have commonly been used for flood mapping, but there are limitations such as unavailability due to satellite's orbital period or cloud cover. Additionally, it would also be beneficial for policy makers to figure out the impact of water management measures such as water storage options on flood mitigation and irrigation water strengthening. Utilization of flood inundation models would support providing information for these demands. In this study, the rainfall-runoff inundation (RRI) model was applied in a flood-prone basin in eastern Sri Lanka, and its applicability was discussed. The RRI model was capable of simulating discharge and inundation extent during flood events, although it should be noted that the model had been calibrated targeting only the flooding period. Satellite-observed rainfall data corrected with a scale factor were able to be used as the model input to simulate long-term trends in runoff just as well as when gauged rainfall data were applied. The calibrated model was also capable of evaluating flood mitigation effects of existing and proposed water storage options by simulating discharge with and without flood capture operations. By reproducing long-term inflow to the storage facilities using satellite rainfall data, it was possible to determine that water would reach the maximum level of the proposed storage facilities even during low-rainfall years.

TI  - Effects of an extreme flood on river morphology (case study: Karoon River, Iran)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An extreme flood occurred on 14 April 2016 in the Karoon River, Iran. The occurred flood discharge was the highest discharge recorded over the last 60 years in the Karoon River. Using the OLI Landsat images taken on 8 April 2016 (before the flood) and 24 April 2016 (after the flood) the geomorphic effects were detected in different land cover types within the 155-km-long study reach. The results show that the flood significantly affected the channel width and the main effect was high mobilization of channel sediments and severe bank erosion in the meandering reaches. According to field surveys, the flood occupied the channel corridor and even the floodplain parts. However, the channel pattern was not significantly altered, although the results show that the average channel width increased from 192 to 256 m. Statistical results indicate a significant change for active channel width and sinuosity index at 99% confidence level for both indexes. The flood-induced morphological changes varied significantly for different land cover types along the Karoon River. Specifically, the channel has widened less in residential areas than in other land cover types because of the occurrence of bank protection structures. However, the value of bank retreat in residential and protected sides of the Karoon River is more than what we expected during the study of extreme flood. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing Moisture Sensitivity of Rubberized Warm Mix Asphalt Mixtures Using the Surface Free Energy Method and Dynamic Water Pressure Tester
T2  - JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to understand the effect of Zy as an antistripping agent on the moisture resistance of rubberized warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures using the surface free energy (SFE) method and dynamic water pressure tester (DWPT). First, viscosity tests were performed to determine the reasonable mixing and compaction temperatures. Therefore, volumetric properties of asphalt mixtures with all binders compacted with the Superpave gyratory compaction (SGC) method were measured. Second, the effects of Zy on micromechanisms of moisture damage in the asphalt-aggregate interface were analyzed using the SFE method. Finally, moisture sensitivity of the rubberized WMA mixtures was evaluated by determining the tensile strength ratio (TSR) of warm rubberized mixtures. The TSR was determined by the DWPT, a newly developed moisture-conditioning machine, to better simulate realistic moisture conditioning within asphalt pavements. The results suggest that E3G does not play a significant role in reducing binder viscosity, especially at high temperatures. Results also demonstrate that the Zy agent does not impact the temperature reduction function of E3G. The Zy agent significantly decreases the moisture damage of rubberized WMA mixtures in both SFE and TSR results. These findings also show that the DWPT has significant potential as an effective laboratory tool for better simulation of actual moisture conditioning.

TI  - Investigation of drought-vulnerable regions in North Korea using remote sensing and cloud computing climate data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most severe natural disasters in the world and leads to serious challenges that affect both the natural environment and human societies. North Korea (NK) has frequently suffered from severe and prolonged droughts since the second half of the twentieth century. These droughts affect the growing conditions of agricultural crops, which have led to food shortages in NK. However, it is not easy to obtain ground data because NK is one of the most closed-off societies in the world. In this situation, remote sensing (RS) techniques and cloud computing climate data (CCCD) can be used for drought monitoring in NK. RS-derived drought indices and CCCD were used to determine the drought-vulnerable regions in the spring season in NK. After the results were compared and discussed, the following conclusions were derived: (1) 10.0% of the total area of NK is estimated to be a drought-vulnerable region. The most susceptible regions to drought appear in the eastern and western coastal regions, far from BaekDu-DaeGan (BDDG), while fewer drought regions are found near BDDG and the Nahngrim Mountains. The drought-vulnerable regions are the coastal regions of South Hamgyong Province, North Hamgyong Province, South Pyongan Province, and South Hwanghae Province. The latter region is the food basket of NK. (2) In terms of land cover, the drought-vulnerable regions mainly consisted of croplands and mixed forest.

TI  - Improvement of Moderate Resolution Land Use and Land Cover Classification by Introducing Adjacent Region Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-like moderate resolution remote sensing images are widely used in land use and land cover (LULC) classification. Limited by coarser resolutions, most of the traditional LULC classifications that are based on moderate resolution remote sensing images focus on the spectral features of a single pixel. Inspired by the spatial evaluation methods in landscape ecology, this study proposed a new method to extract neighborhood characteristics around a pixel for moderate resolution images. 3 landscape-metric-like indexes, i.e., mean index, standard deviation index, and distance weighted value index, were defined as adjacent region features to include the surrounding environmental characteristics. The effects of the adjacent region features and the different feature set configurations on improving the LULC classification were evaluated by a series of well-controlled LULC classification experiments using K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. When the adjacent region features were added, the overall accuracies of both the classifiers were higher than when only spectral features were used. For the KNN and SVM classifiers that used only spectral features, the overall accuracies of the LULC classification were 85.45% and 88.87%, respectively, and the accuracies were improved to 94.52% and 96.97%. The classification accuracies of all the LULC types improved. Highly heterogeneous LULC types that are easily misclassified achieved greater improvements. As comparisons, the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches were also implemented on the same dataset. The results revealed that the new method outperformed GLCM and CNN approaches and can significantly improve the classification performance that is based on moderate resolution data.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The level of axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer is a critical decision factor for adjuvant therapy and the most important indicator of prognosis and survival. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a minimally invasive technique with low morbidity in axillary staging of breast cancer. Radiocolloid substances (Technetium-99m) and/or blue dyes such as methylene blue or isosulfan blue are used during sentinel lymph node biopsy. Isosulfan blue stain is frequently used in sentinel lymph node biopsy and rarely causes complications. The present case report presents a severe decrease in SpO2 due to methemoglobinemia following isosulfan blue administration as well as skin and urine signs and inconsistency with clinical picture in a 67-year-old, 77 kg, ASA II female case who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy under general anesthesia.

TI  - Understanding the temporal dimension of the red-edge spectral region for forest decline detection using high-resolution hyperspectral and Sentinel-2a imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The operational monitoring of forest decline requires the development of remote sensing methods that are sensitive to the spatiotemporal variations of pigment degradation and canopy defoliation. In this context, the red-edge spectral region (RESR) was proposed in the past due to its combined sensitivity to chlorophyll content and leaf area variation. In this study, the temporal dimension of the RESR was evaluated as a function of forest decline using a radiative transfer method with the PROSPECT and 3D FLIGHT models. These models were used to generate synthetic pine stands simulating decline and recovery processes over time and explore the temporal rate of change of the red-edge chlorophyll index (CI) as compared to the trajectories obtained for the structure-related Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The temporal trend method proposed here consisted of using synthetic spectra to calculate the theoretical boundaries of the subspace for healthy and declining pine trees in the temporal domain, defined by CItime=n/CItime=n+1, vs. NDVItime-n/NDVItime=n+1 Within these boundaries, trees undergoing decline and recovery processes showed different trajectories through this subspace. The method was then validated using three high-resolution airborne hyperspectral images acquired at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands of 6.5 nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) over a forest with widespread tree decline, along with field-based monitoring of chlorosis and defoliation (i.e., 'decline' status) in 663 trees between the years 2015 and 2016. The temporal rate of change of chlorophyll vs. structural indices, based on reflectance spectra extracted from the hyperspectral images, was different for trees undergoing decline, and aligned towards the decline baseline established using the radiative transfer models. By contrast, healthy trees over time aligned towards the theoretically obtained healthy baseline. The applicability of this temporal trend method to the red-edge bands of the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) instrument on board Sentinel-2a for operational forest status monitoring was also explored by comparing the temporal rate of change of the Sentinel-2-derived CI over areas with declining and healthy trees. Results demonstrated that the Sentinel-2a red-edge region was sensitive to the temporal dimension of forest condition, as the relationships obtained for pixels in healthy condition deviated from those of pixels undergoing decline.

TI  - Contextual Bag-of-Words for Robust Visual Tracking
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An appearance model is critical for most modern trackers. While numerous novel appearance models have been proposed with demonstrated success, challenges such as occlusion and drifting are still not well addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel contextual bag-of-words (CBOW) discriminative appearance model that appropriately handles drifting and occlusion. Specifically, a contextual region containing both the target and its surroundings is explored to construct a compact representation with two bags-of-words. Each word carries discriminative appearance information that is learned by Bayesian inference. An adaptive updating approach, where the background BOWs of the CBOW model acts as a "sentinel" to prevent the integration of the background appearance with the object model, is introduced to alleviate the drifting problem. Based on CBOW, visual tracking is posed within a Bayesian framework. Moreover, an explicit detection method is employed to handle severe occlusions, which further reduces drifting. Two trackers based on the same CBOW model are implemented using either handcrafted color/texture or deep convolutional features. Our trackers are evaluated based on the popular OTB50 and VOT2015 benchmarks and perform competitively against the current state of the art. In addition, they outperform two recent BOWs trackers by a large margin using the currently available figures of merit. To take into account a tracking breakdown, we propose a new figure of merit called the mean maximum-tracked-frame ratio (MTFR) that evaluates a tracker's temporal persistence without any interruption. Experiments with OTB50 demonstrate the superior robustness of our tracker compared with all other evaluated trackers on the basis of MTFR.

TI  - Land Cover Classification Using Integrated Spectral, Temporal, and Spatial Features Derived from Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining accurate and timely land cover information is an important topic in many remote sensing applications. Using satellite image time series data should achieve high-accuracy land cover classification. However, most satellite image time-series classification methods do not fully exploit the available data for mining the effective features to identify different land cover types. Therefore, a classification method that can take full advantage of the rich information provided by time-series data to improve the accuracy of land cover classification is needed. In this paper, a novel method for time-series land cover classification using spectral, temporal, and spatial information at an annual scale was introduced. Based on all the available data from time-series remote sensing images, a refined nonlinear dimensionality reduction method was used to extract the spectral and temporal features, and a modified graph segmentation method was used to extract the spatial features. The proposed classification method was applied in three study areas with land cover complexity, including Illinois, South Dakota, and Texas. All the Landsat time series data in 2014 were used, and different study areas have different amounts of invalid data. A series of comparative experiments were conducted on the annual time-series images using training data generated from Cropland Data Layer. The results demonstrated higher overall and per-class classification accuracies and kappa index values using the proposed spectral-temporal-spatial method compared to spectral-temporal classification methods. We also discuss the implications of this study and possibilities for future applications and developments of the method.

TI  - Exacerbated grassland degradation and desertification in Central Asia during 2000-2014
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland degradation and desertification is a complex process, including both state conversion (e.g., grasslands to deserts) and gradual within-state change (e.g., greenness dynamics). Existing studies hardly separated the two components and analyzed it as a whole based on time series vegetation index data, which cannot provide a clear and comprehensive picture for grassland degradation and desertification. Here we propose an integrated assessment strategy, by considering both state conversion and within-state change of grasslands, to investigate grassland degradation and desertification process in Central Asia. First, annual maps of grasslands and sparsely vegetated land were generated to track the state conversions between them. The results showed increasing grasslands were converted to sparsely vegetated lands from 2000 to 2014, with the desertification region concentrating in the latitude range of 43-48 degrees N. A frequency analysis of grassland vs. sparsely vegetated land classification in the last 15yr allowed a recognition of persistent desert zone (PDZ), persistent grassland zone (PGZ), and transitional zone (TZ). The TZ was identified in southern Kazakhstan as one hotspot that was unstable and vulnerable to desertification. Furthermore, the trend analysis of Enhanced Vegetation Index during thermal growing season (EVITGS) was investigated in individual zones using linear regression and Mann-Kendall approaches. An overall degradation across the area was found; moreover, the second desertification hotspot was identified in northern Kazakhstan with significant decreasing in EVITGS, which was located in PGZ. Finally, attribution analyses of grassland degradation and desertification were conducted by considering precipitation, temperature, and three different drought indices. We found persistent droughts were the main factor for grassland degradation and desertification in Central Asia. Considering both state conversion and gradual within-state change processes, this study provided reference information for identification of desertification hotspots to support further grassland degradation and desertification treatment, and the method could be useful to be extended to other regions.

TI  - A Lookup-Table-Based Approach to Estimating Surface Solar Irradiance from Geostationary and Polar-Orbiting Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incoming surface solar irradiance (SSI) is essential for calculating Earth's surface radiation budget and is a key parameter for terrestrial ecological modeling and climate change research. Remote sensing images from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites provide an opportunity for SSI estimation through directly retrieving atmospheric and land-surface parameters. This paper presents a new scheme for estimating SSI from the visible and infrared channels of geostationary meteorological and polar-orbiting satellite data. Aerosol optical thickness and cloud microphysical parameters were retrieved from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system images by interpolating lookup tables of clear and cloudy skies, respectively. SSI was estimated using pre-calculated offline lookup tables with different atmospheric input data of clear and cloudy skies. The lookup tables were created via the comprehensive radiative transfer model, Santa Barbara Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (SBDART), to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. The atmospheric attenuation effects considered in our approach were water vapor absorption and aerosol extinction for clear skies, while cloud parameters were the only atmospheric input for cloudy-sky SSI estimation. The approach was validated using one-year pyranometer measurements from seven stations in the SURFRAD (SURFace RADiation budget network). The results of the comparison for 2012 showed that the estimated SSI agreed with ground measurements with correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.69, and 0.89 with a bias of 26.4 W/m(2), 5.9 W/m(2), and 14.9 W/m(2) for clear-sky, cloudy-sky, and all-sky conditions, respectively. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) of instantaneous SSI was 80.0 W/m(2) (16.8%), 127.6 W/m(2) (55.1%), and 99.5 W/m(2) (25.5%) for clear-sky, cloudy-sky (overcast sky and partly cloudy sky), and all-sky (clear-sky and cloudy-sky) conditions, respectively. A comparison with other state-of-the-art studies suggests that our proposed method can successfully estimate SSI with a maximum improvement of an RMSE of 24 W/m(2). The clear-sky SSI retrieval was sensitive to aerosol optical thickness, which was largely dependent on the diurnal surface reflectance accuracy. Uncertainty in the pre-defined horizontal visibility for 'clearest sky' will eventually lead to considerable SSI retrieval error. Compared to cloud effective radius, the retrieval error of cloud optical thickness was a primary factor that determined the SSI estimation accuracy for cloudy skies. Our proposed method can be used to estimate SSI for clear and one-layer cloud sky, but is not suitable for multi-layer clouds overlap conditions as a lower-level cloud cannot be detected by the optical sensor when a higher-level cloud has a higher optical thickness.

AB  - Classification of mangrove species using satellite images is important for investigating the spatial distribution of mangroves at community and species levels on local, regional and global scales. Hence, studies of mangrove deforestation and reforestation are imperative to support the conservation of mangrove forests. However, accurate discrimination of mangrove species remains challenging due to many factors such as data resolution, species number and spectral confusion between species. In this study, three different combinations of datasets were designed from Worldview-3 and Radarsat-2 data to classify four mangrove species, Kandelia obovate (KO), Avicennia marina (AM), Acanthus ilicifolius (AI) and Aegiceras corniculatum (AC). Then, the Rotation Forest (RoF) method was employed to classify the four mangrove species. Results indicated the benefits of dual polarimetric SAR data with an improvement of accuracy by 2-3%, which can be useful for more accurate large-scale mapping of mangrove species. Moreover, the difficulty of classifying different mangrove species, in order of increasing difficulty, was identified as KO < AM < AI < AC. Dual polarimetric SAR data are recognized to improve the classification of AI and AC species. Although this improvement is not remarkable, it is consistent for all three methods. The improvement can be particularly important for large-scale mapping of mangrove forest at the species level. These findings also provide useful guidance for future studies using multi-source satellite data for mangrove monitoring and conservation.

TI  - The aerosol optical properties and PM<sub>2.5</sub> components over the world's largest industrial zone in Tangshan, North China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve an in-depth understanding of the aerosol optical properties in the highly-industrial region of Tangshan, we provided systematic aerosol optical properties analysis in this largest industrial zone for the first time. The aerosol optical datasets (2013.05-2015.04) and chemical component data of PM2.5 (2014-2015) obtained from the Tangshan site of the campaign on atmospheric aerosol research (CARE-China) network were analyzed. The results showed that the Tangshan region was seriously affected by fine-mode industrial aerosols all year, which would promote the accumulation of pollutants and influence the atmospheric circulation through changing the vertical temperature gradient. The annual average aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (a) were 0.80 +/- 0.26 and 1.05 +/- 0.10, respectively. The aerosol optical properties revealed significant seasonal characteristics. The maximum seasonal average AOD (1.03 +/- 0.62) and a (1.12 +/- 0.19) accompanied the highest seasonal secondary inorganic aerosol concentrations (SIA: So(4)(2-),NO3-,NH4+), 53.33 mu g/m(3), occurred in summer, and this phenomenon was attributed to the photochemical reactions favored by the high temperature and humidity. During the spring, frequent dust events led to the maximum Ca-2(+) concentration of 6.57 mu g/m(3) and the lowest seasonal a of 0.98 +/- 0.31. Coal was used for generating heat in winter, resulting in the highest levels of pollutant emissions (Cl- Elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC)). The aerosol type classifications showed that the industrial aerosols were the main controls in the summer and fall, representing 56%-58% of the total aerosols. While for spring and winter, mixed aerosols represented 53%-54% of the total aerosols. Hygroscopic growth effect of aerosols existed all year, which could enhance the negative radiative forcing and eventually cool the earth-atmosphere system. The classification Wing for Tangshan data showed high AOD values ( > 0.70) were mainly clustered in the fine-mode growth wing and coarse-mode. Of these values, summer showed a dense AOD distribution and the highest magnitude of fine-mode AODs, with a corresponding fine particle fraction of eta similar to 90% and an Rf similar to 0.20 mu m. In addition, spring showed the most coarse-mode aerosols.

TI  - Precise Orbit Determination of FY-3C with Calibration of Orbit Biases in BeiDou GEO Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emerging BeiDou navigation satellite system has contributed to global precise positioning and has recently moved toward space-borne applications. However, the contribution of BeiDou on LEO orbit determination applications is limited by the poor precision of the GEO satellite orbit and clock products. Current researches suggest that BeiDou GEO satellites should not be included in LEO precise orbit determination. Based on analyzing the characteristics of errors existing in BeiDou GEO orbit products, we propose a feasible method to mitigate the offsets in BeiDou GEO orbit errors by in-flight calibration of the systematic daily constant biases in the along-track and cross-track of BeiDou GEO satellites. The proposed method is investigated and validated using one entire month of onboard BDS data from the Chinese FY-3C satellite. The average daily RMS compared with the GPS-derived orbit indicates that our method achieves 6.2 cm three-dimensional precision. When compared to the solutions that disregard the GEO orbit errors scheme and roughly exclude the GEO scheme, the FY-3C orbit precision has been improved by 89.1% and 20.2%, respectively. The average daily RMS values of phase residuals are about one centimeter for solutions that exclude GEO and that estimate systematic biases in GEO orbits. The calibrated orbits of GEO with the decimeter level in along-track and cross-track can be reconstructed by correcting the orbit biases estimated in the FY-3C precise orbit determination. Statistics of the FY-3C orbit quality, observation residuals, and precision of the recovered GEO orbits demonstrate that calibration of daily orbit biases in GEO can improve the precision of LEO orbit determination and enhance the reliability of the solution.

TI  - Environmental Indicator Principium with Case References to Agricultural Soil, Water, and Air Quality and Model-Derived Indicators
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental indicators are powerful tools for tracking environmental changes, measuring environmental performance, and informing policymakers. Many diverse environmental indicators, including agricultural environmental indicators, are currently in use or being developed. This special collection of technical papers expands on the peer-reviewed literature on environmental indicators and their application to important current issues in the following areas: (i) model-derived indicators to indicate phosphorus losses from arable land to surface runoff and subsurface drainage, (ii) glutathione-ascorbate cycle-related antioxidants as early-warning bioindicators of polybrominated diphenyl ether toxicity in mangroves, and (iii) assessing the effectiveness of using organic matrix biobeds to limit herbicide dissipation from agricultural fields, thereby controlling on-farm point-source pollution. This introductory review also provides an overview of environmental indicators, mainly for agriculture, with examples related to the quality of the agricultural soil-water-air continuum and the application of model-derived indicators. Current knowledge gaps and future lines of investigation are also discussed. It appears that environmental indicators, particularly those for agriculture, work efficiently at the field, catchment, and local scales and serve as valuable metrics of system functioning and response; however, these indicators need to be refined or further developed to comprehensively meet community expectations in terms of providing a consistent picture of relevant issues and/or allowing comparisons to be made nationally or internationally.

TI  - Using Satellite Sensors and <i>In Situ</i> Observations to Monitor Phytoplankton Blooms in the Pearl River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) has become severe with the rapid urbanization of the Pearl River Delta in recent years. As a result, large-scale phytoplankton blooms occur frequently because of eutrophication. This study investigated a massive Cochlodinium geminatum bloom near the mouth of the Pearl River in August 2011 based on data from both in situ measurements and satellites. Both methods provided a useful approach for monitoring phytoplankton blooms. The in situ measurements illustrated a high concentration of algal cells (1.5 x 10(7) cells L-1) in the study area, and the bloom reached dimensions of approximately 10 to 15 km in length, 8 to 10 km in width, and 100 km(2) in area based on continuous field measurements. A chlorophyll algorithm for satellite sensors was developed based on in situ chlorophyll concentrations and remote sensing reflectance data collected during six cruises from August 2009 to July 2010. The algorithm was applied to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer full-resolution data at the daily scale (300 m at nadir) and obtained details regarding the spatial distribution and temporal variations of the phytoplankton bloom that were consistent with the in situ measurements. An abrupt shift in wind direction and an extreme drought increased the residence time of nutrients and led to the phytoplankton bloom.

TI  - Potential Investigation of Linking PROSAIL with the Ross-Li BRDF Model for Vegetation Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods that link different models for investigating the retrieval of canopy biophysical/structural variables have been substantially adopted in the remote sensing community. To retrieve global biophysical parameters from multiangle data, the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model has been widely applied to satellite multiangle observations to model (interpolate/extrapolate) the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in an arbitrary direction of viewing and solar geometries. Such modeled BRFs, as an essential information source, are then input into an inversion procedure that is devised through a large number of simulation analyses from some widely used physical models that can generalize such an inversion relationship between the BRFs (or their simple algebraic composite) and the biophysical/structural parameter. Therefore, evaluation of such a link between physical models and kernel-driven models contributes to the development of such inversion procedures to accurately retrieve vegetation properties, particularly based on the operational global BRDF parameters derived from satellite multiangle observations (e.g., MODIS). In this study, the main objective is to investigate the potential for linking a popular physical model (PROSAIL) with the widely used kernel-driven Ross-Li models. To do this, the BRFs and albedo are generated by the physical PROSAIL in a forward model, and then the simulated BRFs are input into the kernel-driven BRDF model for retrieval of the BRFs and albedo in the same viewing and solar geometries. To further strengthen such an investigation, a variety of field-measured multiangle reflectances have also been used to investigate the potential for linking these two models. For simulated BRFs generated by the PROSAIL model at 659 and 865 nm, the two models are generally comparable to each other, and the resultant root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.0092 and 0.0355, respectively, although some discrepancy in the simulated BRFs can be found at large average leaf angle (ALA) values. Unsurprisingly, albedos generated by the method are quite consistent, and 99.98% and 97.99% of the simulated white sky albedo (WSA) has a divergence less than 0.02. For the field measurements, the kernel-driven model presents somewhat better model-observation congruence than the PROSAIL model. The results show that these models have an overall good consistency for both field-measured and model-simulated BRFs. Therefore, there is potential for linking these two models for looking into the retrieval of canopy biophysical/structural variables through a simulation method, particularly from the current archive of the global routine MODIS BRDF parameters that were produced by the kernel-driven BRDF model; however, erectophile vegetation must be further examined.

T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - At 21.19 on 8 August 2017, an Ms 7.0 earthquake struck the Jiuzhaigou scenic spot in northwestern Sichuan Province, China. The Jiuzhaigou earthquake is a strike-slip earthquake with a focal depth of 20 km at 33.20 degrees N and 103.82 degrees E, and was caused by two concealed faults. According to emergency investigations and remote sensing interpretations, the Jiuzhaigou earthquake triggered 1780 landslides, damaged one dam (Nuorilang Waterfall) and broke one dam (Huohua Lake). The landslides mainly occurred in the Rize Valley and Shuzheng Valley and in Jiuzhai Paradise. The landslides involved hanging wall and back-slope effects, and the slope angle, slope aspect, seismic faults and valley trend were obviously related to the occurrence of the landslides. Specifically, most of the landslides were shallow landslides, rockfalls and rock avalanches and were small in scale. The failure modes of landslides mainly include wedge rock mass failure, residual deposit failure, relaxed rock mass failure and weathered rock mass failure. The initial low stability of the dam coupled with the topographic effect, back-slope effect and excess pore water pressure led to damage to the Nuorilang Waterfall dam.

T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The suppression of cancer cell growth and invasion has become a challenging clinical issue. In this study, we used nanotechnology to create a new drug delivery system to enhance the efficacy of existing drugs. We developed layered double hydroxide by combing Au nanosol (LDH@Au) and characterized the compound to prove its function as a drug delivery agent. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin was loaded into the new drug carrier to assess its quality. We used a combination of apoptosis assays, cell cycle assays, tissue distribution studies, cell endocytosis, transwell invasion assays, and immunoblotting to evaluate the characteristics of LDH@Au as a drug delivery system.Results: Our results show that the LDH@Au-Dox treatment significantly increased cancer cell apoptosis and inhibited cell invasion compared to the control Dox group. Additionally, our data indicate that LDH@Au-Dox has a better target efficiency at the tumor site and improved the following: cellular uptake, anti-angiogenesis action, changes in the cell cycle, and increased caspase pathway activation.Conclusions: Our findings suggest the nano drug is a promising anti-cancer agent and has potential clinical applications.

TI  - New Spectral Index for Detecting Wheat Yellow Rust Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow rust is one of the most destructive diseases for winter wheat and has led to a significant decrease in winter wheat quality and yield. Identifying and monitoring yellow rust is of great importance for guiding agricultural production over large areas. Compared with traditional crop disease discrimination methods, remote sensing technology has proven to be a useful tool for accomplishing such a task at large scale. This study explores the potential of the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), a newly launched satellite with refined spatial resolution and three red-edge bands, for discriminating between yellow rust infection severities (i.e., healthy, slight, and severe) in winter wheat. The corresponding simulative multispectral bands for the Sentinel-2 sensor were calculated by the sensor's relative spectral response (RSR) function based on the in situ hyperspectral data acquired at the canopy level. Three Sentinel-2 spectral bands, including B4 (Red), B5 (Re1), and B7 (Re3), were found to be sensitive bands using the random forest (RF) method. A new multispectral index, the Red Edge Disease Stress Index (REDSI), which consists of these sensitive bands, was proposed to detect yellow rust infection at different severity levels. The overall identification accuracy for REDSI was 84.1% and the kappa coefficient was 0.76. Moreover, REDSI performed better than other commonly used disease spectral indexes for yellow rust discrimination at the canopy scale. The optimal threshold method was adopted for mapping yellow rust infection at regional scales based on realistic Sentinel-2 multispectral image data to further assess REDSI's ability for yellow rust detection. The overall accuracy was 85.2% and kappa coefficient was 0.67, which was found through validation against a set of field survey data. This study suggests that the Sentinel-2 MSI has the potential for yellow rust discrimination, and the newly proposed REDSI has great robustness and generalized ability for yellow rust detection at canopy and regional scales. Furthermore, our results suggest that the above remote sensing technology can be used to provide scientific guidance for monitoring and precise management of crop diseases and pests.

TI  - SRTM-assisted block adjustment for stereo pushbroom imagery
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a stereo-image block-adjustment algorithm without ground control points (GCPs) by adopting a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) as a height assistant. Using dense, evenly distributed tie points on images used in the block adjustment, the initial height values of tie points are derived directly from the SRTM DEM. In the subsequent block-adjustment iterative computation, the height correction value for tie points is rigorously restricted by the SRTM DEM elevation. A total of 509 ZY-3 satellite stereo-images across 190000km(2) of China's Hubei Province were used for this block-adjustment experiment. The results show that the vertical root mean square errors (RMSEs) are improved from 72 to 23m without GCPs, while the RMSEs in flat and mountainous terrain are improved to 15 and 28m, respectively, fulfilling the vertical accuracy requirement of China's 1:25000 scale mapping.Resume Cet article propose un algorithme d'ajustement par blocs sans points d'appui pour des images stereoscopiques, utilisant le MNT SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) comme donnee altimetrique auxiliaire. A partir d'un semis dense et irregulier de points d'appui dans les images utilisees pour le calage, les valeurs altimetriques des points d'appui sont obtenues directement a partir de SRTM. Lors du calcul des iterations suivantes, la correction altimetrique des points d'appui est rigoureusement contrainte par les altitudes de SRTM. Des images stereoscopiques du satellite 509 ZY-3 couvrant une zone de 190000km(2) dans la province chinoise de Hubei ont ete utilisees pour cette experience d'ajustement par blocs. Les resultats montrent que les ecarts moyens quadratiques (EMQ) verticaux sont ameliores de 7,2 a 2,3m sans points d'appui, tandis que les EMQ sur terrain plat et montagneux sont ameliores pour atteindre respectivement 1,5 et 2,8m, ce qui permet de satisfaire les exigences de precision de la cartographie au 1:25000 de la Chine.Zusammenfassung In diesem Beitrag wird eine Blockausgleichung fur Stereobildpaare ohne den Einsatz von Passpunkten aber unter Zuhilfenahme eines Hohenmodells (DEM) der Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) vorgestellt. Es werden gleichma ss ig verteilte Verknupfungspunkte fur die Blockausgleichung ausgewahlt und die initialen Hohenwerte dieser Verknupfungspunkte direkt aus dem SRTM DEM entnommen.

En las siguientes iteraciones del ajuste de bloque, el valor de correccion de altura para los puntos esta rigurosamente restringido por la altura del MED SRTM. En este experimento de ajuste de bloques se han utilizado 509 imagenes estereoscopicas de satelite ZY-3 cubriendo 190000km(2) de la provincia china de Hubei. Los resultados muestran que el RMS del error se mejora de 7,2 a 2,3m sin PA, mientras que el RMS del error en terreno plano y montanoso se mejora en 1,5 y 2,8m respectivamente, satisfaciendo los requisitos en China para la cartografia a escala 1:25000.

TI  - High-Frequency Monitoring of Suspended Sediment Variations for Water Quality Evaluation at Deep Bay, Pearl River Estuary, China: Influence Factors and Implications for Sampling Strategy
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment (SS) is an important water quality indicator of coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Field measurement and satellite remote sensing are the most common approaches for water quality monitoring. However, the efficiency and precision of both methods are typically affected by their sampling strategy (time and interval), especially in highly dynamic coastal and estuarine waters, because only limited measurements are available to analyze the short-term variations or the long-term trends of SS. Dramatic variations of SS were observed, with standard deviation coefficients of 48.9% and 54.1%, at two fixed stations in Deep Bay, China. Therefore, it is crucial to resolve the temporal variations of SS and its main influencing factors, and thus to develop an improved sampling strategy for estuarine ecosystems. Based on two years of continuous high-frequency measurements of SS and concurrent tidal and meteorological data, we demonstrated that the tide is the dominant factor influencing the SS variation among tide, wind (speed and direction), and rainfall in Deep Bay, China. For the monitoring of maximum suspended sediment concentration (SSC), the recommended optimum sampling time coincides with the occurrence of the ebb tides, whereas multiple sampling times are recommended for monitoring of minimum SSC. Although variations of SS are also affected by other factors, the recommended sampling strategy could capture the maximum and minimum SSC variations exactly more than 85% days in a year on average in Deep Bay. This study provides a baseline of SS variation and direct sampling strategy guidance for future SS monitoring and could be extended to other coastal or estuarine waters with similar climatological/tidal exposures.

TI  - Distinguishing the vegetation dynamics induced by anthropogenic factors using vegetation optical depth and AVHRR NDVI: A cross-border study on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing the vegetation dynamics induced by anthropogenic factors and identifying the major drivers can provide crucial information for designing actionable and practical countermeasures to restore degraded grassland ecosystems. Based on the residual trend (RESTREND) method, this study distinguished the vegetation dynamics induced by anthropogenic factors from the effects of climate variability on the Mongolian Plateau during 1993-2012 using vegetation optical depth (VOD) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which measure vegetation water content in aboveground biomass and chlorophyll abundance in canopy cover respectively; afterwards, the major drivers within different agricultural zones and socio-institutional periods were identified by integrating agricultural statistics with statistical analysis techniques. The results showed that grasslands in Mongolia and the grazing zone of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR), China underwent a significant human-induced decrease in aboveground biomass during 1993-2012 and 1993-2000 respectively, which was attributable to the rapid growth of livestock densities stimulated by livestock privatization and market factors; by contrast, grasslands in these two regions did not experience a concurrent human-induced reduction in canopy greenness. Besides, the results indicated that grasslands in the grazing zone of IMAR underwent a significant human-induced increase in aboveground biomass since 2000, which was attributable to the reduced grazing pressure induced by China's ecological restoration programs; concurrently, grasslands in this region also experienced a remarkable increase in canopy greenness, however, this increase was found not directly caused by the decreased stocking densities. Furthermore, the results revealed that the farming and semi-grazing/farming zone of IMAR underwent a significant human-induced increase in both aboveground biomass and canopy greenness since 2000, which was attributable to the intensified grain production stimulated by market factors, open grazing regulation and confined feeding popularization. These findings suggest that China's grassland restoration practice has important implications for Mongolia to reverse the severe and continuous grassland degradation in the future.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Average Downward Shortwave Radiation over Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface shortwave (SW) irradiation is the primary driving force of energy exchange in the atmosphere and land interface. The global climate is profoundly influenced by irradiation changes due to the special climatic condition in Antarctica. Remote-sensing retrieval can offer only the instantaneous values in an area, whilst daily cycle and average values are necessary for further studies and applications, including climate change, ecology, and land surface process. When considering the large values of and small diurnal changes of solar zenith angle and cloud coverage, we develop two methods for the temporal extension of remotely sensed downward SW irradiance over Antarctica. The first one is an improved sinusoidal method, and the second one is an interpolation method based on cloud fraction change. The instantaneous irradiance data and cloud products are used in both methods to extend the diurnal cycle, and obtain the daily average value. Data from South Pole and Georg von Neumayer stations are used to validate the estimated value. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the estimated daily averages and the measured values based on the first method is 0.93, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 32.21 W/m(2) (8.52%). As for the traditional sinusoidal method, the R-2 and RMSE are 0.68 and 70.32 W/m(2) (18.59%), respectively The R-2 and RMSE of the second method are 0.96 and 25.27 W/m(2) (6.98%), respectively. These values are better than those of the traditional linear interpolation (0.79 and 57.40 W/m(2) (15.87%)).

TI  - Assessing the Defoliation of Pine Forests in a Long Time-Series and Spatiotemporal Prediction of the Defoliation Using Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine forests (Pinus tabulaeformis) have been in danger of defoliation by a caterpillar in the west Liaoning province of China for more than thirty years. This paper aims to assess and predict the degree of damage to pine forests by using remote sensing and ancillary data. Through regression analysis of the pine foliage remaining ratios of field plots with several vegetation indexes of Landsat data, a feasible inversion model was obtained to detect the degree of damage using the Normalized Difference Infrared Index of 5th band (NDII5). After comparing the inversion result of the degree of damage to the pine in 29 years and the historical damage record, quantized results of damage assessment in a long time-series were accurately obtained. Based on the correlation analysis between meteorological variables and the degree of damage from 1984 to 2015, the average degree of damage was predicted in temporal scale. By adding topographic and other variables, a linear prediction model in spatiotemporal scale was constructed. The spatiotemporal model was based on 5015 public pine points for 24 years and reached 0.6169 in the correlation coefficient. This paper provided a feasible and quantitative method in the spatiotemporal prediction of forest pest occurrence by remote sensing.

TI  - Quantifying the respective and additive effects of nectar plant crop borders and withholding insecticides on biological control of pests in subtropical rice
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation biological control avoids the need for mass releases of costly agents and the risks associated with introducing exotic agents by promoting existing natural enemies. This is done by alleviating insecticide-induced mortality and by manipulating the habitat to provide resources such as nectar, but there is a dearth of information on the relative and interactive effects of these two approaches. Here we used a large-scale factorial experiment with plots comprised of entire fields to test the effects of, and interactions between, withholding insecticides and planting borders of sesame (Sesamum indicum) on natural enemies and pests over 2 years. We used yellow sticky traps, sweeping netting and sentinel bait plants to monitor natural enemies and pests in the canopy and basal zones of the rice crop. Numbers of rice planthopper egg parasitoids and lepidopterous egg parasitoids in the rice canopy, as well as planthopper parasitism rates, were significantly greater in plots that were unsprayed and bordered by sesame, and scarcest in sprayed crops without sesame. Spraying of sesame-bordered crops gave parasitoid numbers similar to sprayed crops without sesame. Spiders in the canopy were significantly reduced in numbers by spraying, but there was no main effect of sesame borders. This study demonstrates that withholding insecticides and sowing nectar plant borders each have measurable as well as additive benefits on in-crop densities of ecosystem service providers responsible for predating and parasitising pests but the identity of the natural enemy determines the impact of these management practices.

TI  - Look-up-table approach for leaf area index retrieval from remotely sensed data based on scale information
T2  - OPTICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key structural characteristic of vegetation and plays a significant role in global change research. Several methods and remotely sensed data have been evaluated for LAI estimation. This study aimed to evaluate the suitability of the look-up-table (LUT) approach for crop LAI retrieval from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-5 data and establish an LUT approach for LAI inversion based on scale information. The LAI inversion result was validated by in situ LAI measurements, indicating that the LUT generated based on the PROSAIL (PROSPECT+SAIL: properties spectra + scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model was suitable for crop LAI estimation, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 0.31m(2)/m(2) and determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.65. The scale effect of crop LAI was analyzed based on Taylor expansion theory, indicating that when the SPOT data aggregated by 200 x 200 pixel, the relative error is significant with 13.7%. Finally, an LUT method integrated with scale information was proposed in this article, improving the inversion accuracy with RMSE of 0.20 m(2)/m(2) and R-2 of 0.83.

TI  - Understanding Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Crop Residue Burning in China from 2003 to 2017 Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue burning, which is a convenient approach to process excessive crop straws, has a negative impact on local and regional air quality and soil structures. China, as a major agricultural country with a large population, should take more effective measures to control crop residue burning. In this case, a better understanding of long-term spatio-temporal variations of crop residue burning in China is required. The MODIS products MOD14A1/MYD14A1 were employed in this research. Meanwhile, due to the vast territory of China, we divided the study area into seven regions based on the national administrative divisions to examine crop residue burning in each region, respectively. The temporal analysis of crop residue burning in different regions demonstrates a fluctuated, but generally upward, trend from 2003 to 2017. For monthly variations of crop residue burning in different regions, detected fire spots in June mainly concentrated in Central China (CC), East China (EC), and North China (NC). A majority of detected fire spots in Northeast China (NEC) and Northwest China (NWC) appeared in April and October. For other months, a small number of fire spots were distributed in all regions in a scattered manner. Furthermore, from a spatio-temporal perspective, this research revealed that crop residue burning in NEC was the most active among all regions both in spring and autumn. For summer, EC holds a larger proportion of burning spots than other regions. For winter, the number of burning spots in most regions was close. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of crop residue burning in China at both a national and regional scale. The methodology and results from this research provide useful reference for better monitoring and controlling crop residue burning in China.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of taking into account the polarization effect in atmospheric correction of satellite images of the Earth's surface in the visible wavelength range is considered. Some software for the calculation of radiation components forming satellite images has been developed with and without allowance for polarization in the approximation of a homogeneous surface. Conditions under which neglecting polarization properties of the radiation can lead to significant errors in the retrieval of reflection coefficients of low-reflecting surfaces have been obtained.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Precipitation-Modulated Landslide Deformation From Independent Component Analysis of InSAR Time Series
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term landslide deformation is disruptive and costly in urbanized environments. We rely on TerraSAR-X satellite images (2009-2014) and an improved data processing algorithm (SqueeSAR (TM)) to produce an exceptionally dense Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar ground deformation time series for the San Francisco East Bay Hills. Independent and principal component analyses of the time series reveal four distinct spatial and temporal surface deformation patterns in the area around Blakemont landslide, which we relate to different geomechanical processes. Two components of time-dependent landslide deformation isolate continuous motion and motion driven by precipitation-modulated pore pressure changes controlled by annual seasonal cycles and multiyear drought conditions. Two components capturing more widespread seasonal deformation separate precipitation-modulated soil swelling from annual cycles that may be related to groundwater level changes and thermal expansion of buildings. High-resolution characterization of landslide response to precipitation is a first step toward improved hazard forecasting.Plain Language Summary In an ever-expanding urban environment, we opt to live with the risk of catastrophic natural hazards through a perceived safety net of building codes and engineering solutions. Unfortunately, our concern for these hazards is often focused on their immediate impact to our everyday lives and does not account for imperceptible processes that may become significant over decades in time. Notoriously, some landslides slowly and continuously deform, ultimately causing costly unpredicted damage to homes, lifelines, and other infrastructure. Recent advances in satellite technology allow us to accurately measure these long-term movements, tracking where and when they occur. We show that the duration and amount of seasonal precipitation and associated water pressure changes determine how fast the landslides move and how recent drought conditions have slowed their advance. The satellite data allow us to differentiate the landslide deformation from normal seasonal changes in unaffected areas, giving us greater predictability of this hazard.

TI  - Modeling intrinsic potential for beaver (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) habitat to inform restoration and climate change adaptation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Through their dam-building activities and subsequent water storage, beaver have the potential to restore riparian ecosystems and offset some of the predicted effects of climate change by modulating streamflow. Thus, it is not surprising that reintroducing beaver to watersheds from which they have been extirpated is an often-used restoration and climate-adaptation strategy. Identifying sites for reintroduction, however, requires detailed information about habitat factors-information that is not often available at broad spatial scales. Here we explore the potential for beaver relocation throughout the Snohomish River Basin in Washington, USA with a model that identifies some of the basic building blocks of beaver habitat suitability and does so by relying solely on remotely sensed data. More specifically, we developed a generalized intrinsic potential model that draws on remotely sensed measures of stream gradient, stream width, and valley width to identify where beaver could become established if suitable vegetation were to be present. Thus, the model serves as a preliminary screening tool that can be applied over relatively large extents. We applied the model to 5,019 stream km and assessed the ability of the model to correctly predict beaver habitat by surveying for beavers in 352 stream reaches. To further assess the potential for relocation, we assessed land ownership, use, and land cover in the landscape surrounding stream reaches with varying levels of intrinsic potential. Model results showed that 33% of streams had moderate or high intrinsic potential for beaver habitat. We found that no site that was classified as having low intrinsic potential had any sign of beavers and that beaver were absent from nearly three quarters of potentially suitable sites, indicating that there are factors preventing the local population from occupying these areas. Of the riparian areas around streams with high intrinsic potential for beaver, 38% are on public lands and 17% are on large tracts of privately-owned timber land. Thus, although there are a large number of areas that could be suitable for relocation and restoration using beavers, current land use patterns may substantially limit feasibility in these areas.

TI  - Identification, expression, and endocrine-disruption of three ecdysone-responsive genes in the sentinel species <i>Gammarus fossarum</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking advantage of a large transcriptomic dataset recently obtained in the sentinel crustacean amphipod Gammarus fossarum, we developed an approach based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic reconstruction to identify key players involved in the endocrine regulation of G. fossarum. Our work identified three genes of interest: the nuclear receptors RXR and E75, and the regulator broad-complex (BR). Their involvement in the regulation of molting and reproduction, along with their sensitivity to chemical contamination were experimentally assessed by studying gene expression during the female reproductive cycle, and after laboratory exposure to model endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs): pyriproxyfen, tebufenozide and piperonyl butoxide. RXR expression suggested a role of this gene in ecdysis and post-molting processes. E75 presented two expression peaks that suggested a role in vitellogenesis, and molting. BR expression showed no variation during molting/ reproductive cycle. After exposure to the three EDCs, a strong inhibition of the inter-molt E75 peak was observed with tebufenozide, and an induction of RXR after exposure to pyriproxyfen and piperonyl butoxide. These results confirm the implication of RXR and E75 in hormonal regulation of female reproductive cycles in G. fossarum and their sensitivity towards EDCs opens the possibility of using them as specific endocrine disruption biomarkers.

TI  - When You Become a Superman: Subliminal Exposure to Death-Related Stimuli Enhances Men's Physical Force
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research based on terror management theory (TMT) has consistently found that reminders to individuals about their mortality engender responses aimed at shoring up faith in their cultural belief system. Previous studies have focused on the critical role that the accessibility of death-related thought plays in these effects. Moreover, it has been shown that these effects occur even when death-related stimuli are presented without awareness, suggesting the unconscious effects of mortality salience. Because one pervasive cultural ideal for men is to be strong, we hypothesized that priming death-related stimuli would lead to increasing physical force for men, but not for women. Building on self-escape mechanisms from TMT, we propose that the mechanism that turns priming of death-related stimuli into physical exertion relies on the co-activation of the self with death-related concepts. To test this hypothesis, we subjected 123 participants to a priming task that enabled us to combine the subliminal priming of death-related words with briefly presented self-related words. Accordingly, three different conditions were created: a (control) condition in which only self-related stimuli were presented, a (priming) condition in which death-related words were subliminally primed but not directly paired with self-related stimuli, and a (priming-plus-self) condition in which death-related words were subliminally primed and immediately linked to self-related stimuli. We recorded handgrip force before and after the manipulations. Results showed that male participants in the priming-plus-self condition had a higher peak force output than the priming and control conditions, while this effect was absent among female participants. These results support the hypothesis that unconscious mortality salience, which is accompanied with self-related stimuli, increases physical force for men but not for women. The gender difference may reflect the cultural belief system, in which individuals are taught that men should be strong. Thus, the unconscious mortality salience produced by exposure to the death-related stimuli motivates need to conform to this internalized cultural standard.

TI  - Estimating apple tree canopy chlorophyll content based on Sentinel-2A remote sensing imaging
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing technology provides a new means for the determination of chlorophyll content in apple trees that includes a rapid analysis, low cost and large monitoring area. The Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and the Supported Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) methods were both frequently used method to construct estimation model based on remote sensing imaging. The aim of this study was to find out which estimation model of apple tree canopy chlorophyll content based on the vegetation indices constructed with visible, red edge and near-infrared bands of the sensor of Sentinel-2 was more accurate and stabler. The results were as follows: The calibration set coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.729 and validation set R-2 value of 0.667 of the model using the SVMR method based on the vegetation indices (NDVIgreen + NDVIred + NDVIre) were higher than those of the model using the BPNN method by 8.2% and 11.0%, respectively. The calibration set root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.159 and validation set RMSE of 0.178 of the model using the SVMR method based on the vegetation indices (NDVIgreen + NDVIred + NDVIre) were lower than those of the model using the BPNN method by 5.9% and 3.8%, respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of Canadian High Arctic glacier surface albedo from MODIS data, 2001-2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-annual variations and longer-term trends in the annual mass balance of glaciers in Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI) are largely attributable to changes in summer melt. The largest source of melt energy in the QEI in summer is net shortwave radiation, which is modulated by changes in glacier surface albedo. We used measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors to investigate large-scale spatial patterns, temporal trends, and variability in the summer surface albedo of QEI glaciers from 2001 to 2016. Mean summer black-sky shortwave broadband albedo (BSA) decreased at a rate of 0.029 +/- 0.025 decade(-1) over that period. Larger reductions in BSA occurred in July (-0.050 +/- 0.031 decade(-1)). No change in BSA was observed in either June or August. Most of the decrease in BSA, which was greatest at lower elevations around the margins of the ice masses, occurred between 2007 and 2012, when mean summer BSA was anomalously low. The first principal component of the 16-year record of mean summer BSA was well correlated with the mean summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, except in 2006, 2010, and 2016, when the mean summer BSA appears to have been dominated by the August BSA. During the period 2001-2016, the mean summer land surface temperature (LST) over the QEI glaciers and ice caps increased by 0.049 +/- 0.038 degrees C yr(-1), and the BSA record was negatively correlated (r : -0.86) with the LST record, indicative of a positive ice-albedo feedback that would increase rates of mass loss from the QEI glaciers.

AB  - Quantification of surface water storage in extensive floodplains and their dynamics are crucial for a better understanding of global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we present estimates of both surface water extent and storage combining multi-mission remotely sensed observations and their temporal evolution over more than 15 years in the Mackenzie Delta. The Mackenzie Delta is located in the northwest of Canada and is the second largest delta in the Arctic Ocean. The delta is frozen from October to May and the recurrent ice break-up provokes an increase in the river's flows. Thus, this phenomenon causes intensive floods along the delta every year, with dramatic environmental impacts. In this study, the dynamics of surface water extent and volume are analysed from 2000 to 2015 by combining multi-satellite information from MODIS multispectral images at 500 m spatial resolution and river stages derived from ERS-2 (1995-2003), ENVISAT (2002-2010) and SARAL (since 2013) altimetry data. The surface water extent (permanent water and flooded area) peaked in June with an area of 9600 km(2) (+/- 200 km(2)) on average, representing approximately 70% of the delta's total surface. Altimetry-based water levels exhibit annual amplitudes ranging from 4 m in the downstream part to more than 10 m in the upstream part of the Mackenzie Delta. A high overall correlation between the satellite-derived and in situ water heights (R > 0.84) is found for the three altimetry missions. Finally, using altimetry-based water levels and MODIS-derived surface water extents, maps of interpolated water heights over the surface water extents are produced. Results indicate a high variability of the water height magnitude that can reach 10 m compared to the lowest water height in the upstream part of the delta during the flood peak in June. Furthermore, the total surface water volume is estimated and shows an annual variation of approximately 8.5 km(3) during the whole study period, with a maximum of 14.4 km(3) observed in 2006. The good agreement between the total surface water volume retrievals and in situ river discharges (R = 0.66) allows for validation of this innovative multi-mission approach and highlights the high potential to study the surface water extent dynamics.

TI  - Eight Kinetically Stable but Thermodynamically Activated Molecules that Power Cell Metabolism
T2  - CHEMICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Contemporary analyses of cell metabolism have called out three metabolites: ATP, NADH, and acetyl-CoA, as sentinel molecules whose accumulation represent much of the purpose of the catabolic arms of metabolism and then drive many anabolic pathways. Such analyses largely leave out how and why ATP, NADH, and acetyl-CoA (Figure 1) at the molecular level play such central roles. Yet, without those insights into why cells accumulate them and how the enabling properties of these key metabolites power much of cell metabolism, the underlying molecular logic remains mysterious. Four other metabolites, S-adenosylmethionine, carbamoyl phosphate, UDP-glucose, and Delta(2)-isopentenyl-PP play similar roles in using group transfer chemistry to drive otherwise unfavorable biosynthetic equilibria. This review provides the underlying chemical logic to remind how these seven key molecules function as mobile packets of cellular currencies for phosphoryl transfers (ATP), acyl transfers (acetyl-CoA, carbamoyl-P), methyl transfers (SAM), prenyl transfers (IPP), glucosyl transfers (UDP-glucose), and electron and ADP-ribosyl transfers (NAD(P)H/NAD(P)(+)) to drive metabolic transformations in and across most primary pathways. The eighth key metabolite is molecular oxygen (O-2), thermodynamically activated for reduction by one electron path, leaving it kinetically stable to the vast majority of organic cellular metabolites.

TI  - Informing a hydrological model of the Ogooue with multi-mission remote sensing data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to inform and constrain a hydrological model and to increase its value as a decision-support tool. In this study, we applied a multi-mission approach to force, calibrate and validate a hydrological model of the ungauged Ogooue river basin in Africa with publicly available and free remote sensing observations. We used a rainfall-runoff model based on the Budyko framework coupled with a Muskingum routing approach. We parametrized the model using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) and forced it using precipitation from two satellite-based rainfall estimates, FEWS-RFE (Famine Early Warning System rainfall estimate) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 v.7, and temperature from ECMWF ERA-Interim. We combined three different datasets to calibrate the model using an aggregated objective function with contributions from (1) historical in situ discharge observations from the period 1953-1984 at six locations in the basin, (2) radar altimetry measurements of river stages by Envisat and Jason-2 at 12 locations in the basin and (3) GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) total water storage change (TWSC). Additionally, we extracted CryoSat-2 observations throughout the basin using a Sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) imagery water mask and used the observations for validation of the model. The use of new satellite missions, including Sentinel-1 and CryoSat-2, increased the spatial characterization of river stage. Throughout the basin, we achieved good agreement between observed and simulated discharge and the river stage, with an RMSD between simulated and observed water amplitudes at virtual stations of 0.74 m for the TRMM-forced model and 0.87 m for the FEWS-RFE-forced model. The hydrological model also captures overall total water storage change patterns, although the amplitude of storage change is generally underestimated. By combining hydrological modeling with multi-mission remote sensing from 10 different satellite missions, we obtain new information on an otherwise unstudied basin. The proposed model is the best current baseline characterization of hydrological conditions in the Ogooue in light of the available observations.

TI  - Primary carcinosarcoma of the liver: imaging features and clinical findings in six cases and a review of the literature
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Carcinosarcoma of the liver is a very rare tumor composed of a mixture of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. Less than 25 adequately documented cases have been reported, with inadequate description of imaging features. In order to improve the awareness of this rare tumor, this study aimed to analyze the clinicopathologic and imaging features of six cases of hepatic carcinosarcoma (HCS) confirmed by surgical pathologic evaluation.Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinicopathologic and imaging features of six cases of HCS (matching the World Health Organization definition) and discussed the differential diagnosis on the basis of imaging findings. The patients, including five men and one woman, were 38 to 69 years of age. Five patients underwent CT scans, one underwent MRI scans.Results: While 3 patients were positive for hepatitis-B surface antigen, 2 had cirrhosis. The largest tumor diameter ranged from 5.0 to 21.0 cm. Satellite nodules, venous thrombi, and organ invasion (gastric wall, gallbladder, and right adrenal gland) were identified. Pathologically, the carcinomatous components corresponded to hepatocellular carcinoma in three cases, cholangiocellular carcinoma in one case, and adenocarcinoma in two cases. The sarcomatous components exhibited complex features, with undifferentiated spindle cells in five cases and a leiomyosarcoma in one. All tumors showed heterogeneous density/intensity with extensive cystic change and necrosis; spot calcification was observed in one case. Capsule was not identified. While four tumors showed heterogeneous hypervascular enhancement, two showed hypovascular enhancement. All patients underwent surgical resection. The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 18 months. Four patients died from recurrence and metastasis.Conclusions: The clinical and imaging features of HCS are heterogeneous. Due to the heterogenous nature and very low morbidity of HCS, combination of careful analysis of imaging findings and clinical features might be useful for a more accurate diagnosis of HCS.

TI  - A multi-year data set on aerosol-cloud-precipitation-meteorology interactions for marine stratocumulus clouds
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Airborne measurements of meteorological, aerosol, and stratocumulus cloud properties have been harmonized from six field campaigns during July-August months between 2005 and 2016 off the California coast. A consistent set of core instruments was deployed on the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies Twin Otter for 113 flight days, amounting to 514 flight hours. A unique aspect of the compiled data set is detailed measurements of aerosol microphysical properties (size distribution, composition, bioaerosol detection, hygroscopicity, optical), cloud water composition, and different sampling inlets to distinguish between clear air aerosol, interstitial in-cloud aerosol, and droplet residual particles in cloud. Measurements and data analysis follow documented methods for quality assurance. The data set is suitable for studies associated with aerosol-cloud-precipitation-meteorology-radiation interactions, especially owing to sharp aerosol perturbations from ship traffic and biomass burning. The data set can be used for model initialization and synergistic application with meteorological models and remote sensing data to improve understanding of the very interactions that comprise the largest uncertainty in the effect of anthropogenic emissions on radiative forcing.

TI  - Fire intensity impacts on post-fire temperate coniferous forest net primary productivity
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a dynamic ecological process in forests and impacts the carbon (C) cycle through direct combustion emissions, tree mortality, and by impairing the ability of surviving trees to sequester carbon. While studies on young trees have demonstrated that fire intensity is a determinant of post-fire net primary productivity, wildland fires on landscape to regional scales have largely been assumed to either cause tree mortality, or conversely, cause no physiological impact, ignoring the impacted but surviving trees. Our objective was to understand how fire intensity affects post-fire net primary productivity in conifer-dominated forested ecosystems on the spatial scale of large wildland fires. We examined the relationships between fire radiative power (FRP), its temporal integral (fire radiative energy - FRE), and net primary productivity (NPP) using 16 years of data from the MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for 15 large fires in western United States coniferous forests. The greatest NPP post-fire loss occurred 1 year post-fire and ranged from -67 to -312 gCm(-2) yr(-1) (-13 to -54 %) across all fires. Forests dominated by fire-resistant species (species that typically survive low-intensity fires) experienced the lowest relative NPP reductions compared to forests with less resistant species. Post-fire NPP in forests that were dominated by fire-susceptible species were not as sensitive to FRP or FRE, indicating that NPP in these forests may be reduced to similar levels regardless of fire intensity. Conversely, post-fire NPP in forests dominated by fire-resistant and mixed species decreased with increasing FRP or FRE. In some cases, this dose-response relationship persisted for more than a decade post-fire, highlighting a legacy effect of fire intensity on post-fire C dynamics in these forests.

TI  - Land-use change may exacerbate climate change impacts on water resources in the Ganges basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying how land-use change and climate change affect water resources is a challenge in hydrological science. This work aims to quantify how future projections of land-use and climate change might affect the hydrological response of the Upper Ganges river basin in northern India, which experiences monsoon flooding almost every year. Three different sets of modelling experiments were run using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (LSM) and covering the period 2000-2035: in the first set, only climate change is taken into account, and JULES was driven by the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) outputs of 21 models, under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), whilst land use was held fixed at the year 2010. In the second set, only land-use change is taken into account, and JULES was driven by a time series of 15 future land-use pathways, based on Landsat satellite imagery and the Markov chain simulation, whilst the meteorological boundary conditions were held fixed at years 2000-2005. In the third set, both climate change and land-use change were taken into consideration, as the CMIP5 model outputs were used in conjunction with the 15 future land-use pathways to force JULES. Variations in hydrological variables (stream flow, evapotranspiration and soil moisture) are calculated during the simulation period.Significant changes in the near-future (years 2030-2035) hydrologic fluxes arise under future land-cover and climate change scenarios pointing towards a severe increase in high extremes of flow: the multi-model mean of the 95th percentile of streamflow (Q(5)) is projected to increase by 63% under the combined land-use and climate change high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The changes in all examined hydrological components are greater in the combined land-use and climate change experiment. Results are further presented in a water resources context, aiming to address potential implications of climate change and land- use change from a water demand perspective. We conclude that future water demands in the Upper Ganges region for winter months may not be met.

TI  - Scenario approach for the seasonal forecast of Kharif flows from the Upper Indus Basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow and glacial melt runoff are the major sources of water contribution from the high mountainous terrain of the Indus River upstream of the Tarbela reservoir. A reliable forecast of seasonal water availability for the Kharif cropping season (April-September) can pave the way towards better water management and a subsequent boost in the agro-economy of Pakistan. The use of degree-day models in conjunction with satellite-based remote-sensing data for the forecasting of seasonal snow and ice melt runoff has proved to be a suitable approach for data-scarce regions. In the present research, the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) has not only been enhanced by incorporating the "glacier (G)" component but also applied for the forecast of seasonal water availability from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). Excelbased SRM + G takes account of separate degree-day factors for snow and glacier melt processes. All-year simulation runs with SRM + G for the period 2003-2014 result in an average flow component distribution of 53, 21, and 26% for snow, glacier, and rain, respectively. The UIB has been divided into Upper and Lower parts because of the different climatic conditions in the Tibetan Plateau. The scenario approach for seasonal forecasting, which like the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction method uses historic meteorology as model forcings, has proven to be adequate for long-term water availability forecasts. The accuracy of the forecast with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.5% could be slightly improved compared to two existing operational forecasts for the UIB, and the bias could be reduced to 2.0 %. However, the association between forecasts and observations as well as the skill in predicting extreme conditions is rather weak for all three models, which motivates further research on the selection of a subset of ensemble members according to forecasted seasonal anomalies.

TI  - Neurocognition and Cerebral Lesion Burden in High-Risk Patients Before Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
T2  - JACC-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES The authors sought to determine baseline neurocognition before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and its correlations with pre-TAVR brain imaging.& para;& para;BACKGROUND TAVR studies have not shown a correlation between diffusion-weighted image changes and neurocognition. The authors wanted to determine the extent to which there was already impairment at baseline that correlated with cerebrovascular disease.& para;& para;METHODS SENTINEL (Cerebral Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial patients had cognitive assessments of attention, processing speed, executive function, and verbal and visual memory. Z-scores were based on normative means and SDs, combined into a primary composite z-score. Brain magnetic resonance images were obtained pre-TAVR on 3-T scanners with a T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. Scores <=-1.5 SD below the normative mean (7th percentile) were considered impairment. Paired t tests compared within-subject scores, and chi-square goodness-of-fit compared the percentage of subjects below -1.5 SD. Correlation and regression analyses assessed the relationship between neurocognitive z-scores and T2 lesion volume.& para;& para;RESULTS Among 234 patients tested, the mean composite z-score was -0.65 SD below the normative mean. Domain scores ranged from -0.15 SD for attention to -1.32 SD for executive function. On the basis of the >= 1.5 SD normative reference, there were significantly greater percentages of impaired scores in the composite z-score (13.2%; p = 0.019), executive function (41.9%; p < 0.001), verbal memory (p < 0.001), and visual memory (p < 0.001). The regression model between FLAIR lesion volume and baseline cognition showed statistically significant negative correlations.& para;& para;CONCLUSIONS There was a significant proportion of aortic stenosis patients with impaired cognition before TAVR, with a relationship between baseline cognitive function and lesion burden likely attributable to longstanding cerebrovascular disease. These findings underscore the importance of pre-interventional testing and magnetic resonance imaging in any research investigating post-surgical cognitive outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Integrated emission inventory and modeling to assess distribution of particulate matter mass and black carbon composition in Southeast Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This is part of a research study addressing the potential co-benefits associated with selected black carbon (BC) emission reduction measures on mitigation of air pollution and climate forcing in Southeast Asia (SEA). This paper presents details of emission inventory (EI) results and WRF-CHIMERE model performance evaluation. The SEA regional emissions for 2007 were updated with our EI results for Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia and used for the model input. WRF-CHIMERE-simulated 2007 PM10, PM2.5, and BC over the SEA domain (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and the results were evaluated against the available meteorology and air quality monitoring data in the domain. WRF hourly simulation results were evaluated using the observed data at eight international airport stations in five SEA countries and showed a satisfactory performance. WRF-CHIMERE results for PM10 and PM2.5 showed strong seasonal influence of biomass open burning while the BC distribution showed the influence of urban activities in big SEA cities. Daily average PM10 constructed from the hourly concentrations were obtained from the automatic monitoring stations in three large SEA cities, i.e., Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Surabaya, for model evaluation. The daily observed PM2.5 and BC concentrations obtained from the Improving Air Quality in Asian Developing Countries (AIRPET) project for four cities (i.e., Bangkok, Hanoi, Bandung, and Manila) were also used for model evaluation. In addition, hourly BC concentrations were taken from the measurement results of the Asian Pacific Network (APN) project at a suburban site in Bangkok. The modeled PM10 and BC satisfactorily met all suggested statistical criteria for PM evaluation. The modeled PM2.5/PM10 ratios estimated for four AIRPET sites ranged between 0.47 and 0.59, lower than observed values of 0.6-0.83. Better agreement was found for BC/PM2.5 ratios with the modeled values of 0.05-0.33 as compared to the observation values of 0.05-0.28. AODEM (extended aerosol optical depth module) was used to calculate the total columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and BC AOD up to the top of the domain at 500 hPa (similar to 5500 m), which did not include the free-tropospheric long-range transport of the pollution. The model AOD results calculated using the internal mixing assumption were evaluated against the observed AOD by both AERONET and MODIS satellite in 10 countries in the domain. Our model results showed that the BC AOD contributed 7.5-12% of the total AOD, which was in the same range reported by other studies for places with intensive emissions. The results of this paper are used to calculate the regional aerosol direct radiative forcing under different emission reduction scenarios to explore potential co-benefits for air quality improvement, reduction in the number of premature deaths, and climate forcing mitigation in SEA in 2030 (Permadi et al., 2017a).

TI  - Perceptions of health and illness among the Konso people of southwestern Ethiopia: persistence and change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cross-cultural studies indicate that every culture has its own particular explanations for health and illness and its own healing strategies. The Konso people have always practiced indigenous medicine and have multifaceted accounts or multiple dimensions of illness perceptions and health-care beliefs and practices. This paper describes how perceptions of health and illness are instrumental in health and treatment outcomes among the Konso people in southwestern Ethiopia. Results may provide an understanding of the perceptions of health and illness in relation to the local cosmology, religion, and environment.Methods: The ethnographic method was employed to generate evidence, complemented by focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and direct observation. Thematic analysis was employed to categorize and interpret the data.Results: Findings indicate that the Konso people's worldview, particularly as it relates to health, illness, and healing systems, is closely linked to their day-to-day lives. Older people believe illnesses are caused by a range of supernatural forces, including the wrath of God or local gods, oritta (spirit possession), and karayitta (ancestral spirits), and they use culturally prescribed treatment. Young and formally educated members of the community attribute causes of diseases to germitta (germs) and factorta (bacteria) and tend to seek treatment mostly in modern health facilities.Conclusion: Perceptions of health and illness as well as of healing are part of Konso people's worldview. Local communities comprehend health problems and solutions within their cultural frame of reference, which has changed over the years. The Konso people associate their health situations with socio-cultural and religious factors. The individual's behavior and interactions with the social, natural, and supernatural powers affect the well-being of the whole group. The individual, the family, the clan leaders, and the deceased are intimately linked to one's culturally based health beliefs and are associated by the Konso with health problems and illnesses.

AB  - In this study, mass balance for Chorabari glacier of the Central Himalaya, India has been estimated. This glacier has been considered for the case study as it feeds the Mandakini River and was one of the reasons for flash floods in Rudraprayag district, Uttarakhand in 2013. The observations are based on glacier area/length change and rate of melting in the multi-decade (1976-2016) using Landsat data. The study estimates an overall decrease in area at 0.8% per year. Elevation change has been studied using geodetic method utilizing shuttle radar topography mission and TanDEM-X datasets, which have shown a decrease in elevation in 16 years (2000-16). From these remotely observed parameters, a negative mass balance for the decade 2000-11 indicates glacier retreat. This study highlights the applicability of optical and radar remote sensing for the Himalayan glaciers, for better disaster management and understanding glacier dynamics in response to climate change.

TI  - Seasonal surface chlorophyll <i>a</i> variability in the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR, 5 degrees-10 degrees S, 50 degrees-75 degrees E) in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean is a unique area that experiences year-round upwelling. This is a response to the upward Ekman pumping prevalent in the region. Satellite data, model data and objectively analysed Argo temperature/salinity data have been used to study the seasonal surface chlorophyll a (chl a) variability in SCTR. Variability of surface chl a concentration in SCTR showed a weak semiannual signature. The western part of SCTR (WSCTR, 50 degrees-62 degrees E) is characterized by higher chl a concentration than the eastern part (ESCTR, 63 degrees-75 degrees E). Average chl a concentration in WSCTR/ESCTR showed a primary peak in July-August (similar to 0.26/similar to 0.16 mg/m(3)) and a secondary peak in January (similar to 0.14/similar to 0.12 mg/m(3)). Minimum chl a concentration (similar to 0.12/similar to 0.1 mg/m(3)) was observed during March-April and December-January. The high amplitude of chl a variability observed during July-August is associated with weak stratification and deep mixed layer depth (MLD). Deep MLD reaching to nutrient-rich thermocline entrains nutrients to the surface and thereby increases the surface chl a concentration. However, the low surface chl a concentration is a result of shallow MLD in the region. The deep MLD (30-40 m) observed during June-October is dominated by wind mixing and supported by buoyancy mixing. Shallow MLD (<30 m) observed during rest of the year is due to weak wind mixing and high surface buoyancy. The high surface buoyancy is a manifestation of ocean surface warming and presence of low saline surface waters in the SCTR region.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Laparoscopic surgery has its unique minimally invasive advantages, however, taking the complex and difficult D2 lymph node dissection for advanced gastric cancer into consideration, laparoscopic gastrectomy was only applied in the treatment of early gastric cancer at its preliminary stage. With the development of more than a decade, many multicenter clinical data have confirmed the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. Based on high-quality evidence-based medicine evidence, laparoscopic gastrectomy has been recommended as an optional treatment for stage I( gastric cancer by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines 2014(ver.4). However, the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer remains controversial due to the lack of high-level evidence-based clinical evidence. Currently, China, Japan and South Korea are trying to clarify its safety and effectiveness by conducting well-designed multicenter prospective randomized controlled trials. To date, CLASS-01 trial in China, whose secondary endpoint indicated that laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for advanced gastric cancer can be safely performed by experienced surgeons, has provided the highest level evidence for the controversy in the world. At ASCO 2016, the safety reports from Korea's KLASS-02 trial also presented the similar conclusion. The long-term oncologic outcomes of the both researches were particularly promising. Retrospecting the whole development of gastric cancer surgery, it is not difficult to find that its mainstream direction is gradually shifted from "extended and standardized surgical resection" to "individual and precise surgery" for the safety and postoperative quality of life. The new concept of minimally invasive surgery built on laparoscopic surgery emphasizes more than shortening the surgical incision, but minimizing tissue trauma and maximizing functional preservation. On the ground of this new minimally invasive concept, surgeons have appreciated to select the most rational treatment for an individual patient. Thus, techniques focusing on further assisting laparoscopic gastrectomy with reducing trauma and preserving function, such as sentinel node navigation surgery and related fluorescence molecular imaging techniques, are increasingly being applied in gastric cancer surgery. At present, a series of researches about the feasibility of sentinel node navigation surgery and function preserving surgery associated with gastric cancer surgery are actively conducted or prepared. Results of these researches may further promote the development of laparoscopic gastrectomy and achieve the qualitative change in minimally invasive surgery in the new era.

TI  - Decadal change in supraglacial debris cover in Baspa basin, Western Himalaya
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial debris cover (SDC) influences surface energy balance and glacier dynamics. However, very few studies have been carried out to understand its distribution and evolution. Previous glacier investigations carried out in Baspa basin, Western Himalaya, focus on retreat and mass balance. Therefore, the present study monitored change in SDC area from 1997 to 2014 using Landsat data. SDC area change was estimated within a 'minimum snow-free glacier area' using normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and band ratio of near infrared and shortwave infrared. Threshold values for NDSI and band ratio map were derived manually. The study was carried out for a 'minimum snow-free glacier area' of 60.5 +/- 2.4 sq. km out of 174 +/- 7 sq. km of total glaciated area. SDC area of 31.5 +/- 1.4, 33.2 +/- 1.2, 34.6 +/- 1.9 and 36.3 +/- 0.7 sq. km for 1997, 2000, 2011 and 2014 respectively, was estimated. Analyses show a linear increase in SDC area from 1997 to 2014 by 2.8 +/- 0.4%. Naradu, a benchmark glacier in the basin, show one of the highest increase in SDC area (5.6 +/- 0.4%). The findings from the present study are in line with other published results that suggest retreat, glacier fragmentation and mass loss, which could be due to climate change. The present study can be extended further using the SDC map and the results, in glacier hydrology and mass balance modelling to predict future loss.

TI  - Temporal change and flow velocity estimation of Patseo glacier, Western Himalaya, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study we estimate the velocity and thickness of the Patseo glacier, Himachal Pradesh, India. The average velocity of the glacier was estimated as similar to 5.47 m/year using co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) method. The glacier thickness was found to vary between 12 and 278 m, with an average value 59 m. The total glacier ice volume was estimated as similar to 15.8 x 10(7) m(3), with equivalent water reservoir of similar to 14.5 x 10(7) m(3). Ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted during 2004 and 2013 for validation of the estimated glacier thickness. The glacier thickness estimated using COSI-Corr method was found to be in agreement with GPR-retrieved glacier thickness (RMSE = 4.75 m; MAE = 3.74 m). The GPR profiles collected along the same geographic locations on the glacier during 2004 and 2013 showed a reduction in ice thickness of similar to 1.89 m, and thus resulting in an annual ice thickness decrease of similar to 0.21 m. The glacier area was estimated for 2004 and 2013 using LISS IV satellite data and found to be similar to 2.52 and similar to 2.30 sq. km respectively. This shows an annual reduction of similar to 0.024 sq. km in glacier area. The total annual loss in glacier ice volume was estimated as similar to 4.55 x 10(5) m(3). This loss in the glacier ice volume of the Patseo glacier is supported by the snow and meteorological observations collected at a nearby field observatory of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE). The climate data collected at SASE meteorological observatory at Patseo (3800 m), between 1993-94 and 2014-15 showed an increasing trend in the mean annual temperature and a decreasing trend in winter precipitation.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the past, people only focused on surgical resection of gastric cancer to obtain satisfactory therapeutic effect, while the concept of function-preserving in gastric cancer surgery has not been emphasized. Gastric function-preserving surgery was originally performed by Japanese doctor Maki for surgical treatment of gastroduodenal ulcer. With the definition of early gastric cancer being accepted, the pylorus-preserving gastrectomy can be used continuously in the treatment of gastric cancer. Because of high incidence of early gastric cancer in Japan, a variety of application and research about function-preserving gastrectomy in other areas for treatment of early gastric cancer, such as proximal gastrectomy and jejunal interposition, segmental gastrectomy, gastric local resection and laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) at the same time, and regional or sentinel lymph node dissection were performed for the purpose of radical cure. Function-preserving gastrectomy for the treatment of early gastric cancer should include four important factors: (1) decrease of the scope of gastrectomy; (2)retaining pylorus; (3)retaining vagus nerve; (4)regional or sentinel lymph node dissection. The technique of sentinel lymph node can reduce the extent of gastric resection, avoid distal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy, and make gastric resection more suitable for laparoscopic partial gastrectomy, segmental resection, pylorus-preserving gastrectomy and proximal gastrectomy. Function-preserving gastrectomy has the advantage of improving the quality of life and has great potential in the treatment of early gastric cancer. However, the various treatment methods including LECS need strict technical standardization for confirmation of oncology safety. We need careful design, prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials to provide theoretical and technical support.

AB  - In the past few years, the early detection of gastric cancer has increased in China. The surgical treatment for early gastric cancer has gradually transformed from conventional gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy to function-preserving gastrectomy which maximally preserves the anatomy and physiology of stomach to maintain the quality of life of the patient. Driven by minimally invasive techniques, function-preserving gastrectomies, including pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy, sentinel node navigation surgery, etc. have already gained great attention especially in Japan and Korea. Although there are still many unsolved problems that need to be further discussed and explored, understanding of the clinical features of early gastric cancer and definition of gastric function preservation, launching clinical trials for solving practical problems, and emphasis of individualized and precision treatment will be the best strategies to improve the efficacy of early gastric cancer.

M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic technology is gradually accepted in gastric cancer surgery, whose efficacy has been demonstrated by some clinical researches. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered as the most important evidence to prove clinical outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer. Korean gastric surgeons have made great contributions to RCT in laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery. KLASS (Korean Laparoscopic Gastrointestinal Surgery Study Group) is one of the most important forerunner and global leader of clinical trials of gastric cancer treatment. KLASS series clinical trials are attracting global attention because of the significant value of surgical treatment for gastric cancer. The RCTs in Korea involve in many aspects of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer, including laparoscopy application in early gastric cancer (KLASS-01, KLASS-03 and KLASS-07), advanced gastric cancer (KLASS-02 and KLASS-06), function-preserving gastrectomy (KLASS-04,KLASS-05) and sentinel node navigation surgery (SENORITA trial). In order to share some informations of these RCTs, we review and prospect some important clinical trials of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery in Korea. With the experience of Korean gastric surgeons, we can make more progress in our own clinical trials of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery.

TI  - Accuracy and impact of spatial aids based upon satellite enumeration to improve indoor residual spraying spatial coverage
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is a key tool in the fight to control, eliminate and ultimately eradicate malaria. IRS protection is based on a communal effect such that an individual's protection primarily relies on the community-level coverage of IRS with limited protection being provided by household-level coverage. To ensure a communal effect is achieved through IRS, achieving high and uniform community-level coverage should be the ultimate priority of an IRS campaign. Ensuring high community-level coverage of IRS in malaria-endemic areas is challenging given the lack of information available about both the location and number of households needing IRS in any given area. A process termed 'mSpray' has been developed and implemented and involves use of satellite imagery for enumeration for planning IRS and a mobile application to guide IRS implementation. This study assessed (1) the accuracy of the satellite enumeration and (2) how various degrees of spatial aid provided through the mSpray process affected community-level IRS coverage during the 2015 spray campaign in Zambia.Methods: A 2-stage sampling process was applied to assess accuracy of satellite enumeration to determine number and location of sprayable structures.Results indicated an overall sensitivity of 94% for satellite enumeration compared to finding structures on the ground. Results: After adjusting for structure size, roof, and wall type, households in Nchelenge District where all types of satellite-based spatial aids (paper-based maps plus use of the mobile mSpray application) were used were more likely to have received IRS than Kasama district where maps used were not based on satellite enumeration. The probability of a household being sprayed in Nchelenge district where tablet-based maps were used, did not differ statistically from that of a household in Samfya District, where detailed paper-based spatial aids based on satellite enumeration were provided.Conclusion: IRS coverage from the 2015 spray season benefited from the use of spatial aids based upon satellite enumeration. These spatial aids can guide costly IRS planning and implementation leading to attainment of higher spatial coverage, and likely improve disease impact.

TI  - GEO-LEO reflective band intercomparison with bidirectional reflectance distribution function and atmospheric scattering corrections
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intercomparison of the reflective solar bands (RSB) between the instruments onboard a geostationary orbit satellite and a low Earth orbit satellite is very helpful in assessing their calibration consistency. Himawari-8 was launched on October 7, 2014, and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R was launched on November 19, 2016. Unlike previous GOES instruments, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on Himawari-8 and the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R have onboard calibrators for the RSB. Independent assessment of calibration is nonetheless important to enhance their product quality. MODIS and visible infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) can provide good references for sensor calibration. The intercomparison between AHI and VIIRS is performed over a pseudoinvariant target. The use of stable and uniform calibration sites provides comparison with accurate adjustment for band spectral difference, reduction of impact from pixel mismatching, and consistency of BRDF and atmospheric correction. The site used is the Strzelecki Desert in Australia. Due to the difference in solar and view angles, two corrections must be applied to compare the measurements. The first is the atmospheric scattering correction applied to the top of atmosphere reflectance measurements. The second correction is applied to correct the BRDF effect. The atmospheric correction is performed using a vector version of the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV) model and the BRDF correction is performed using a semiempirical model. Our results show that AHI band 1 (0.47 mu m) has a good agreement with VIIRS band M3 within 0.15%. AHI band 5 (1.61 mu m) shows the largest difference (5.09%) with VIIRS band M10, whereas AHI band 5 shows the least difference (1.87%) in comparison with VIIRS band I3. The methods developed in this work can also be directly applied to assess GOES-16/ABI calibration consistency, a topic we will address in the future.

TI  - The CHRONOS mission: capability for sub-hourly synoptic observations of carbon monoxide and methane to quantify emissions and transport of air pollution
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The CHRONOS space mission concept provides time-resolved abundance for emissions and transport studies of the highly variable and highly uncertain air pollutants carbon monoxide and methane, with sub-hourly revisit rate at fine (similar to 4 km) horizontal spatial resolution across a North American domain. CHRONOS can provide complete synoptic air pollution maps ("snapshots") of the continental domain with less than 10 min of observations. This rapid mapping enables visualization of air pollution transport simultaneously across the entire continent and enables a sentinel-like capability for monitoring evolving, or unanticipated, air pollution sources in multiple locations at the same time with high temporal resolution. CHRONOS uses a compact imaging gas filter correlation radiometer for these observations, with heritage from more than 17 years of scientific data and algorithm advances by the science teams for the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft in low Earth orbit. To achieve continental-scale sub-hourly sampling, the CHRONOS mission would be conducted from geostationary orbit, with the instrument hosted on a communications or meteorological platform. CHRONOS observations would contribute to an integrated observing system for atmospheric composition using surface, suborbital and satellite data with atmospheric chemistry models, as defined by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites. Addressing the U.S. National Academy's 2007 decadal survey direction to characterize diurnal changes in tropospheric composition, CHRONOS observations would find direct societal applications for air quality management and forecasting to protect public health.

TI  - Impact of biomass burning on pollutant surface concentrations in megacities of the Gulf of Guinea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of the Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions in West Africa (DACCIWA) project, the tropospheric chemical composition in large cities along the Gulf of Guinea is studied using the Weather and Research Forecast and CHIMERE regional models. Simulations are performed for the May-July 2014 period, without and with biomass burning emissions. Model results are compared to satellite data and surface measurements. Using numerical tracer release experiments, it is shown that the biomass burning emissions in Central Africa are impacting the surface aerosol and gaseous species concentrations in Gulf of Guinea cities such as Lagos (Nigeria) and Abidjan (Ivory Coast). Depending on the altitude of the injection of these emissions, the pollutants follow different pathways: directly along the coast or over land towards the Sahel before being vertically mixed in the convective boundary layer and transported to the south-west and over the cities. In July 2014, the maximum increase in surface concentrations due to fires in Central Africa is approximate to 150 mu g m(-3) for CO, approximate to 10 to 20 mu g m(-3) for O-3 and approximate to 5 mu g m(-3) for PM10. The analysis of the PM10 chemical composition shows that this increase is mainly related to an increase in particulate primary and organic matter.

TI  - Modeling Net Growth of Phaeocystis antarctica Based on Physiological and Optical Responses to Light and Temperature Co-limitation.
T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature and light are fundamental environmental variables which regulate phytoplankton growth rates when nutrients are in excess. For polar coastal oceans that are undergoing changes in sea ice cover and warming, light, and temperature are particularly important for bloom dynamics. Using colonial Phaeocystis antarctica cultures grown at steady-state, we assessed the combined effect of these two environmental controls on net growth rate ([mu]n), chlorophyll-specific absorption of light (aph* ([lambda])), and quantum yields for growth ([phi][mu]). Specific net growth rates ([mu]n) varied from 0.04 to 0.34 day<sup>-1 </sup>within a matrix of light and temperature ranging from 14 to 542 [mu]mol quanta m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and -1.5 to 4[degree]C. Values of aph* ([lambda]) varied significantly with light but only slightly with temperature. Values of [phi][mu], ranged from 0.003 to 0.09 mol C (mol quanta absorbed)<sup>-1</sup> with highest values at low light and 4[degree]C. For excess irradiances or low temperatures where growth rate is inhibited, quantum yields were low. The low [phi][mu], values are attributed both to increased absorption by photoprotective pigments compared to photosynthetic pigments and thermodynamic control of dark reaction enzymes. The systematic changes in photophysiological properties of P antarctica in relation to temperature and light were used to develop a series of nested light- and temperature-dependent models for [mu]n, aph* ([lambda]), and [phi][mu]. A model for aph* ([lambda]) (300-700 nm) was developed that takes into account the systematic changes in aph* ([lambda]) due to pigment packaging effects and cellular concentrations of chlorophylls and photoprotective pigments. Also, a model for [phi][mu] was developed based on a cumulative one-hit Poisson probability function. These model parameterization for absorption and quantum yield are combined into an overall model of net growth that can be applied easily to P antarctica bloom dynamics using remote sensing data for temperature, light, and chlorophyll a. Furthermore, modeling based on the biophysical variables aph* ([lambda]) and [phi][mu], that are shown to regulate the growth rate provides a more fundamental mechanistic approach compared to other modeling methods that do not explicitly resolve photon flux into the cell or the quantum yield.

For polar coastal oceans that are undergoing changes in sea ice cover and warming, light, and temperature are particularly important for bloom dynamics. Using colonial Phaeocystis antarctica cultures grown at steady-state, we assessed the combined effect of these two environmental controls on net growth rate (mu(n)), chlorophyll-specific absorption of light (a(ph)* (lambda)), and quantum yields for growth (phi(mu)). Specific net growth rates (mu(n)) varied from 0.04 to 0.34 day(-1 )within a matrix of light and temperature ranging from 14 to 542 mu mol quanta m(-2)s(-1) and -1.5 to 4 degrees C. Values of a(ph)* (lambda) varied significantly with light but only slightly with temperature. Values of phi(mu), ranged from 0.003 to 0.09 mol C (mol quanta absorbed)(-1) with highest values at low light and 4 degrees C. For excess irradiances or low temperatures where growth rate is inhibited, quantum yields were low. The low phi(mu), values are attributed both to increased absorption by photoprotective pigments compared to photosynthetic pigments and thermodynamic control of dark reaction enzymes. The systematic changes in photophysiological properties of P antarctica in relation to temperature and light were used to develop a series of nested light- and temperature-dependent models for mu(n), a(ph)* (lambda), and phi(mu). A model for a(ph)* (lambda) (300-700 nm) was developed that takes into account the systematic changes in a(ph)* (lambda) due to pigment packaging effects and cellular concentrations of chlorophylls and photoprotective pigments. Also, a model for phi(mu) was developed based on a cumulative one-hit Poisson probability function. These model parameterization for absorption and quantum yield are combined into an overall model of net growth that can be applied easily to P antarctica bloom dynamics using remote sensing data for temperature, light, and chlorophyll a. Furthermore, modeling based on the biophysical variables a(ph)* (lambda) and phi(mu), that are shown to regulate the growth rate provides a more fundamental mechanistic approach compared to other modeling methods that do not explicitly resolve photon flux into the cell or the quantum yield.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of genogroup II norovirus infections in acute gastroenteritis patients during 2014-2016 in Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China
T2  - GUT PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Norovirus (NoV), a member of the Caliciviridae, is now recognized as the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide. Globally, the GII.4 Sydney_2012 variant has predominated in NoV-related AGE since 2012, although the novel variant GII.17 has also been reported as responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks in East Asia since 2014. This study aimed to disclose the recent genotype patterns of NoV genogroup II (GII) presenting in AGE patients in Pudong New Area of Shanghai through a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system. The study further aimed to delineate the predominant strains circulating in the population.Methods: Pudong New Area is located in eastern Shanghai and covers 20.89% of the Shanghai population. The laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system is composed of 12 sentinel hospitals among the 68 general hospitals in this area. AGE patients who sought medical care were sampled following an AGE surveillance protocol. Stool samples were collected from participating patients, and a standardized questionnaire was given to each patient by trained nurses to gain information on the disease profiles and demographics of the patients. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to screen the GI nd GII NoV and RT-PCR was used to amplify NoV GII partial capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2). NoV Genotyping Tool (version 1.0, RIVM, MA Bilthoven, Netherlands) was used for genotyping,and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted by MEGA 7.0.Results: During 2014-2016, among the 2069 virus-infected AGE cases, 65.88% were caused by NoV. NoV-AGE occurred most frequently in the periods from October to March. The patients with more severe diarrheal symptoms and vomiting were more likely to be infected by NoV. The main genotypes were GII.17 (44.69%) and GII.4 (39.26%), which dominated the NoV-AGE epidemics jointly or in turn, whereas a slight increase in GII.2 was observed beginning in May 2016. The GII.17 strains tended to cluster more with the Hu/JP/2014/GII.P17_GII.17/Kawasaki323 variants, representing novel prevalent strains. Among the GII.4 strains, the GII.4 Sydney_2012 variant was still the predominant strain.Conclusions: NoV GII has become the main cause of virus-infected AGE in Pudong New Area, Shanghai. The predominant genotypes of NoV GII were GII.17 and GII.4. Comprehensive laboratory-based surveillance is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Identification of emerging new genotypes is also crucial for the prevention and control of NoV-infected AGE.

TI  - Linear relationship between peak and season-long abundances in insects
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate quantitative relationship between key characteristics of an insect population, such as season-long and peak abundances, can be very useful in pest management programs. To the best of our knowledge, no such relationship has yet been established. Here we establish a predictive linear relationship between insect catch M-pw during the week of peak abundance, the length of seasonal flight period, F (number of weeks) and season-long cumulative catch (abundance) A = 0.41M(pw)F. The derivation of the equation is based on several general assumptions and does not involve fitting to experimental data, which implies generality of the result. A quantitative criterion for the validity of the model is presented. The equation was tested using extensive data collected on captures of male gypsy moths Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) in pheromone-baited traps during 15 years. The model was also tested using trap catch data for two species of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), in Gravid and BG-sentinel mosquito traps, respectively. The simple, parameter-free equation approximates experimental data points with relative error of 13% and R-2 = 0.997, across all of the species tested. For gypsy moth, we also related season-long and weekly trap catches to the daily trap catches during peak flight. We describe several usage scenarios, in which the derived relationships are employed to help link results of small-scale field studies to the operational pest management programs.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns and environmental drivers of human echinococcoses over a twenty-year period in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Human cystic (CE) and alveolar (AE) echinococcoses are zoonotic parasitic diseases that can be influenced by environmental variability and change through effects on the parasites, animal intermediate and definitive hosts, and human populations. We aimed to assess and quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of human echinococcoses in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR), China between January 1994 and December 2013, and examine associations between these infections and indicators of environmental variability and change, including large-scale landscape regeneration undertaken by the Chinese authorities.Methods: Data on the number of human echinococcosis cases were obtained from a hospital-based retrospective survey conducted in NHAR for the period 1 January 1994 through 31 December 2013. High-resolution imagery from Landsat 4/5-TM and 8-OLI was used to create single date land cover maps. Meteorological data were also collected for the period January 1980 to December 2013 to derive time series of bioclimatic variables. A Bayesian spatio-temporal conditional autoregressive model was used to quantify the relationship between annual cases of CE and AE and environmental variables.Results: Annual CE incidence demonstrated a negative temporal trend and was positively associated with winter mean temperature at a 10-year lag. There was also a significant, nonlinear effect of annual mean temperature at 13-year lag. The findings also revealed a negative association between AE incidence with temporal moving averages of bareland/artificial surface coverage and annual mean temperature calculated for the period 11-15 years before diagnosis and winter mean temperature for the period 0-4 years. Unlike CE risk, the selected environmental covariates accounted for some of the spatial variation in the risk of AE.Conclusions: The present study contributes towards efforts to understand the role of environmental factors in determining the spatial heterogeneity of human echinococcoses. The identification of areas with high incidence of CE and AE may assist in the development and refinement of interventions for these diseases, and enhanced environmental change risk assessment.

TI  - Anti-vaccination and pro-CAM attitudes both reflect magical beliefs about health
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examined the relationship between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and vaccination scepticism; and specifically whether a person's more general health-related worldview might explain this relationship. A cross-sectional online survey of adult Australians (N = 2697) included demographic, CAM, and vaccination measures, as well as the holistic and magical health belief scales (HHB, MHB). HHB emphasises links between mind and body health, and the impact of general 'wellness' on specific ailments or resistance to disease, whilst MHB specifically taps ontological confusions and cognitive errors about health. CAM and anti-vaccination were found to be linked primarily at the attitudinal level (r = -0.437). We did not find evidence that this was due to CAM practitioners influencing their clients. Applying a path-analytic approach, we found that individuals' health worldview (HHB and MHB) accounted for a significant proportion (43.1%) of the covariance between CAM and vaccination attitudes. MHB was by far the strongest predictor of both CAM and vaccination attitudes in regressions including demographic predictors. We conclude that vaccination scepticism reflects part of a broader health worldview that discounts scientific knowledge in favour of magical or superstitious thinking. Therefore, persuasive messages reflecting this worldview may be more effective than fact-based campaigns in influencing vaccine sceptics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth and immune evasion of Lymph node Metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer patients with lymph node (LN) metastases have a worse prognosis than those without nodal disease. However, why LN metastases correlate with reduced patient survival is poorly understood. Recent findings provide insight into mechanisms underlying tumor growth in LNs. Tumor cells and their secreted molecules engage stromal, myeloid, and lymphoid cells within primary tumors and in the lymphatic system, decreasing antitumor immunity and promoting tumor growth. Understanding the mechanisms of cancer survival and growth in LNs is key to designing effective therapy for the eradication of LN metastases. In addition, uncovering the implications of LN metastasis for systemic tumor burden will inform treatment decisions. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of the seeding, growth, and further dissemination of LN metastases.

TI  - Global Prediction of Photovoltaic Field Performance Differences Using Open-Source Satellite Data
T2  - JOULE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate field-performance prediction is essential for the calculation of returnon-investment for photovoltaic projects. Leading software predicting field performance was developed for traditional technologies and markets. Yet emerging markets are projected to install over half of all solar cells by the end of this decade, with persisting interest in new technologies. In this study, we map photovoltaic system performance over the entire planet, for standard and emerging technologies, using open-source satellite data. We validate results using time-resolved field-performance data of cadmium telluride and silicon modules in temperate (Perrysburg, OH, USA) and hot-humid (Singapore) climates. Watt for watt, we find that CdTe produces up to 6% more energy than Si in tropical regions. This result emphasizes the significance of local performance evaluation to complement standard testing condition efficiencies. We extend our model to emerging materials including lead-halide perovskites and III-V thin films, and demonstrate that larger band gaps have performance advantages in hot and humid environments.

TI  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass and uncertainties by integration of field measurements, airborne LiDAR, and SAR and optical satellite data in Mexico
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Information on the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) over large areas is needed for understanding and managing processes involved in the carbon cycle and supporting international policies for climate change mitigation and adaption. Furthermore, these products provide important baseline data for the development of sustainable management strategies to local stakeholders. The use of remote sensing data can provide spatially explicit information of AGB from local to global scales. In this study, we mapped national Mexican forest AGB using satellite remote sensing data and a machine learning approach. We modelled AGB using two scenarios: (1) extensive national forest inventory (NFI), and (2) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as reference data. Finally, we propagated uncertainties from field measurements to LiDAR-derived AGB and to the national wall-to-wall forest AGB map.Results: The estimated AGB maps (NFI- and LiDAR-calibrated) showed similar goodness-of-fit statistics (R-2 , Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)) at three different scales compared to the independent validation data set. We observed different spatial patterns of AGB in tropical dense forests, where no or limited number of NFI data were available, with higher AGB values in the LiDAR-calibrated map. We estimated much higher uncertainties in the AGB maps based on two-stage up-scaling method (i.e., from field measurements to LiDAR and from LiDAR-based estimates to satellite imagery) compared to the traditional field to satellite up-scaling. By removing LiDAR-based AGB pixels with high uncertainties, it was possible to estimate national forest AGB with similar uncertainties as calibrated with NFI data only.Conclusions: Since LiDAR data can be acquired much faster and for much larger areas compared to field inventory data, LiDAR is attractive for repetitive large scale AGB mapping. In this study, we showed that two-stage up-scaling methods for AGB estimation over large areas need to be analyzed and validated with great care. The uncertainties in the LiDAR-estimated AGB propagate further in the wall-to-wall map and can be up to 150%.Thus, when a two-stage up-scaling method is applied, it is crucial to characterize the uncertainties at all stages in order to generate robust results. Considering the findings mentioned above LiDAR can be used as an extension to NFI for example for areas that are difficult or not possible to access.

TI  - Effectiveness of a field trap barrier system for controlling <i>Aedes albopictus</i>: a "removal trapping" strategy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main vectors for the transmission of several viral pathogens, in particular, dengue, Zika and chikungunya. In the absence of vaccines and treatment, control of Aedes mosquitoes is the only means of keeping these diseases in check. Aedes control is difficult, and it is, therefore, necessary to evaluate the efficacy of novel control methods, particularly those targeting adult and exophilic Ae. albopictus populations.Methods: We carried out the first evaluation of the effectiveness of a field trap barrier system, i.e. a "removal trapping" outdoor control strategy for Ae. albopictus in southern France.Results: The removal trapping control strategy is an effective system, able to reduce to almost zero the biting rate of the tiger mosquito in and around houses with traps installed. This strategy has the advantage of being a non-chemical method, which is environmentally friendly and does not affect non-target fauna. Nevertheless, it has several constraints including the cost of the CO2 required for the system to function. However, the system could be optimized by reducing the costs and combining it with other control strategies within the framework of integrated vector management.Conclusions: We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of this trap barrier system, which is based on the combined effect of (i) removing adult mosquitoes living in the area, and (ii) hampering the migration of mosquitoes from outside into the treated area. Further investigation is needed to understand its efficacy for other species, other locations and at-risk communities, and to evaluate its application for reducing the prevalence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya diseases.

TI  - Daily gridded datasets of snow depth and snow water equivalent for the Iberian Peninsula from 1980 to 2014
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present snow observations and a validated daily gridded snowpack dataset that was simulated from downscaled reanalysis of data for the Iberian Peninsula. The Iberian Peninsula has long-lasting seasonal snowpacks in its different mountain ranges, and winter snowfall occurs in most of its area. However, there are only limited direct observations of snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE), making it difficult to analyze snow dynamics and the spatiotemporal patterns of snowfall. We used meteorological data from downscaled reanalyses as input of a physically based snow energy balance model to simulate SWE and SD over the Iberian Peninsula from 1980 to 2014. More specifically, the ERA-Interim reanalysis was downscaled to 10 km x 10 km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF outputs were used directly, or as input to other submodels, to obtain data needed to drive the Factorial Snow Model (FSM). We used lapse rate coefficients and hygrobarometric adjustments to simulate snow series at 100m elevations bands for each 10 km x 10 km grid cell in the Iberian Peninsula. The snow series were validated using data from MODIS satellite sensor and ground observations. The overall simulated snow series accurately reproduced the interannual variability of snowpack and the spatial variability of snow accumulation and melting, even in very complex topographic terrains. Thus, the presented dataset may be useful for many applications, including land management, hydrometeorological studies, phenology of flora and fauna, winter tourism, and risk management. The data presented here are freely available for download from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.854618). This paper fully describes the work flow, data validation, uncertainty assessment, and possible applications and limitations of the database.

TI  - Importance of interpolation and coincidence errors in data fusion
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The complete data fusion (CDF) method is applied to ozone profiles obtained from simulated measurements in the ultraviolet and in the thermal infrared in the framework of the Sentinel 4 mission of the Copernicus programme. We observe that the quality of the fused products is degraded when the fusing profiles are either retrieved on different vertical grids or referred to different true profiles. To address this shortcoming, a generalization of the complete data fusion method, which takes into account interpolation and coincidence errors, is presented. This upgrade overcomes the encountered problems and provides products of good quality when the fusing profiles are both retrieved on different vertical grids and referred to different true profiles. The impact of the interpolation and coincidence errors on number of degrees of freedom and errors of the fused profile is also analysed. The approach developed here to account for the interpolation and coincidence errors can also be followed to include other error components, such as forward model errors.

TI  - Combining satellite data and appropriate objective functions for improved spatial pattern performance of a distributed hydrologic model
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based earth observations offer great opportunities to improve spatial model predictions by means of spatial-pattern-oriented model evaluations. In this study, observed spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration (AET) are utilised for spatial model calibration tailored to target the pattern performance of the model. The proposed calibration framework combines temporally aggregated observed spatial patterns with a new spatial performance metric and a flexible spatial parameterisation scheme. The mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) is used to simulate streamflow and AET and has been selected due to its soil parameter distribution approach based on pedo-transfer functions and the build in multi-scale parameter regionalisation. In addition two new spatial parameter distribution options have been incorporated in the model in order to increase the flexibility of root fraction coefficient and potential evapotranspiration correction parameterisations, based on soil type and vegetation density. These parameterisations are utilised as they are most relevant for simulated AET patterns from the hydrologic model. Due to the fundamental challenges encountered when evaluating spatial pattern performance using standard metrics, we developed a simple but highly discriminative spatial metric, i.e. one comprised of three easily interpretable components measuring co-location, variation and distribution of the spatial data.The study shows that with flexible spatial model parameterisation used in combination with the appropriate objective functions, the simulated spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration become substantially more similar to the satellite-based estimates. Overall 26 parameters are identified for calibration through a sequential screening approach based on a combination of streamflow and spatial pattern metrics. The robustness of the calibrations is tested using an ensemble of nine calibrations based on different seed numbers using the shuffled complex evolution optimiser. The calibration results reveal a limited trade-off between streamflow dynamics and spatial patterns illustrating the benefit of combining separate observation types and objective functions. At the same time, the simulated spatial patterns of AET significantly improved when an objective function based on observed AET patterns and a novel spatial performance metric compared to traditional streamflow-only calibration were included. Since the overall water balance is usually a crucial goal in hydrologic modelling, spatial-pattern-oriented optimisation should always be accompanied by traditional discharge measurements. In such a multi-objective framework, the current study promotes the use of a novel bias-insensitive spatial pattern metric, which exploits the key information contained in the observed patterns while allowing the water balance to be informed by discharge observations.

TI  - Modeling Net Land Occupation of Hydropower Reservoirs in Norway for Use in Life Cycle Assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing hydropower electricity production constitutes a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change impacts. However, hydropower electricity production also impacts aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity through freshwater habitat alteration, water quality degradation, and land use and land use change (LULUC). Today, no operational model exists that covers any of these cause-effect pathways within life cycle assessment (LCA). This paper contributes to the assessment of LULUC impacts of hydropower electricity production in Norway in LCA. We quantified the inundated land area associated with 107 hydropower reservoirs with remote sensing data and related it to yearly electricity production. Therewith, we calculated an average net land occupation of 0.027 m(2).yr/kWh of Norwegian storage hydropower plants for the life cycle inventory. Further, we calculated an adjusted average land occupation of 0.007 m(2).yr/kWh, accounting for an underestimation of water area in the performed maximum likelihood classification. The calculated land occupation values are the basis to support the development of methods for assessing the land occupation impacts of hydropower on biodiversity in LCA at a damage level.

TI  - A dataset mapping the potential biophysical effects of vegetation cover change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Changing the vegetation cover of the Earth has impacts on the biophysical properties of the surface and ultimately on the local climate. Depending on the specific type of vegetation change and on the background climate, the resulting competing biophysical processes can have a net warming or cooling effect, which can further vary both spatially and seasonally. Due to uncertain climate impacts and the lack of robust observations, biophysical effects are not yet considered in land-based climate policies. Here we present a dataset based on satellite remote sensing observations that provides the potential changes i) of the full surface energy balance, ii) at global scale, and iii) for multiple vegetation transitions, as would now be required for the comprehensive evaluation of land based mitigation plans. We anticipate that this dataset will provide valuable information to benchmark Earth system models, to assess future scenarios of land cover change and to develop the monitoring, reporting and verification guidelines required for the implementation of mitigation plans that account for biophysical land processes.

TI  - Prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance among patients with uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium</i> <i>falciparum</i> malaria in three provinces in Angola, 2015
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first-line anti-malarial treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in Angola. To date, the prevalence of polymorphisms in the pfk13 gene, associated with artemisinin resistance, and pfmdr1, associated with lumefantrine resistance, have not been systematically studied in Angola.Methods: DNA was isolated from pretreatment and late treatment failure dried blood spots collected during the 2015 round of therapeutic efficacy studies in Benguela, Lunda Sul, and Zaire Provinces in Angola. The pfk13 propeller domain and pfmdr1 gene were sequenced and analysed for polymorphisms. Pfmdr1 copy number variation was assessed using a real-time PCR method. The association between pfmdr1 and pfk13 mutations and treatment failure was investigated.Results: The majority of pretreatment (99%, 466/469) and all late treatment failure (100%, 50/50) samples were wild type for pfk13. Three of the pretreatment samples (1%) carried the A578S mutation commonly observed in Africa and not associated with artemisinin resistance. All 543 pretreatment and day of late treatment failure samples successfully analysed for pfmdr1 copy number variation carried one copy of pfmdr1. The NYD haplotype was the predominant pfmdr1 haplotype, present in 63% (308/491) of pretreatment samples, followed by NFD, which was present in 32% (157/491) of pretreatment samples. The pfmdr1 N86 allele was overrepresented in day of late treatment failure samples from participants receiving artemether-lumefantrine (p value 0.03).Conclusions: The pretreatment parasites in patients participating in therapeutic efficacy studies in 2015 in Angola's three sentinel sites showed genetic evidence of susceptibility to artemisinins, consistent with clinical outcome data showing greater than 99% day 3 clearance rates. The lack of increased pfmdr1 copy number is consistent with previous reports from sub-Saharan Africa. Although pfmdr1 NYD and NFD haplotypes were overrepresented in artemether-lumefantrine late treatment failure samples, their role as markers of resistance was unclear given that these haplotypes were also present in the majority of successfully treated patients in the artemether- lumefantrine treatment arms.

TI  - A hybrid gene selection approach to create the S1500+targeted gene sets for use in high-throughput transcriptomics
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in gene expression can help reveal the mechanisms of disease processes and the mode of action for toxicities and adverse effects on cellular responses induced by exposures to chemicals, drugs and environment agents. The U.S. Tox21 Federal collaboration, which currently quantifies the biological effects of nearly 10,000 chemicals via quantitative high-throughput screening(qHTS) in in vitro model systems, is now making an effort to incorporate gene expression profiling into the existing battery of assays. Whole transcriptome analyses performed on large numbers of samples using microarrays or RNA-Seq is currently cost-prohibitive. Accordingly, the Tox21 Program is pursuing a high-throughput transcriptomics (HTT) method that focuses on the targeted detection of gene expression for a carefully selected subset of the transcriptome that potentially can reduce the cost by a factor of 10-fold, allowing for the analysis of larger numbers of samples. To identify the optimal transcriptome subset, genes were sought that are (1) representative of the highly diverse biological space, (2) capable of serving as a proxy for expression changes in unmeasured genes, and (3) sufficient to provide coverage of well described biological pathways. A hybrid method for gene selection is presented herein that combines data-driven and knowledge-driven concepts into one cohesive method. Our approach is modular, applicable to any species, and facilitates a robust, quantitative evaluation of performance. In particular, we were able to perform gene selection such that the resulting set of "sentinel genes" adequately represents all known canonical pathways from Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB v4.0) and can be used to infer expression changes for the remainder of the transcriptome. The resulting computational model allowed us to choose a purely data-driven subset of 1500 sentinel genes, referred to as the S1500 set, which was then augmented using a knowledge-driven selection of additional genes to create the final S1500+ gene set. Our results indicate that the sentinel genes selected can be used to accurately predict pathway perturbations and biological relationships for samples under study.

TI  - XBAER-derived aerosol optical thickness from OLCI/Sentinel-3 observation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A cloud identification algorithm used for cloud masking, which is based on the spatial variability of reflectances at the top of the atmosphere in visible wavelengths, has been developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties by MODIS. It is shown that the spatial pattern of cloud reflectance, as observed from space, is very different from that of aerosols. Clouds show a high spatial variability in the scale of a hundred metres to a few kilometres, whereas aerosols in general are homogeneous. The concept of spatial variability of reflectances at the top of the atmosphere is mainly applicable over the ocean, where the surface background is sufficiently homogeneous for the separation between aerosols and clouds. Aerosol retrievals require a sufficiently accurate cloud identification to be able to mask these ground scenes. However, a conservative mask will exclude strong aerosol episodes and a less conservative mask could introduce cloud contamination that biases the retrieved aerosol optical properties (e.g. aerosol optical depth and effective radii). A detailed study on the effect of cloud contamination on aerosol retrievals has been performed and parameters are established determining the threshold value for the MODIS aerosol cloud mask (3 x 3-STD) over the ocean. The 3 x 3-STD algorithm discussed in this paper is the operational cloud mask used for MODIS aerosol retrievals over the ocean.A prolonged pollution haze event occurred in the northeast part of China during the period 16-21 December 2016. To assess the impact of such events, the amounts and distribution of aerosol particles, formed in such events, need to be quantified. The newly launched Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3 is the successor of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). It provides measurements of the radiance and reflectance at the top of the atmosphere, which can be used to retrieve the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from synoptic to global scales. In this study, the recently developed AOT retrieval algorithm eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER) has been applied to data from the OLCI instrument for the first time to illustrate the feasibility of applying XBAER to the data from this new instrument. The first global retrieval results show similar patterns of aerosol optical thickness, AOT, to those from MODIS and MISR aerosol products. The AOT retrieved from OLCI is validated by comparison with AERONET observations and a correlation coefficient of 0.819 and bias (root mean square) of 0.115 is obtained. The haze episode is well captured by the OLCI-derived AOT product. XBAER is shown to retrieve AOT well from the observations of MERIS and OLCI.

TI  - Status of the undisturbed mangroves at Brunei Bay, East Malaysia: a preliminary assessment based on remote sensing and ground-truth observations
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Brunei Bay, which receives freshwater discharge from four major rivers, namely Limbang, Sundar, Weston and Menumbok, hosts a luxuriant mangrove cover in East Malaysia. However, this relatively undisturbed mangrove forest has been less scientifically explored, especially in terms of vegetation structure, ecosystem services and functioning, and land-use/cover changes. In the Present study, mangrove areal extent together with species composition and distribution at the four notified estuaries was evaluated through remote sensing (Advanced Land Observation Satellite ALOS) and ground-truth (Point-Centred Quarter Method PCQM) observations. As of 2010, the total mangrove cover was found to be ca. 35,183.74 ha, of which Weston and Menumbok occupied more than two-folds (58%), followed by Sundar (27%) and Limbang (15%). The medium resolution ALOS data were efficient for mapping dominant mangrove species such as Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata, Sonneratia caseolaris, S. alba and Xylocarpus granatum in the vicinity (accuracy: 80%). The PCQM estimates found a higher basal area at Limbang and Menumbok suggestive of more mature vegetation, compared to Sundar and Weston. Mangrove stand structural complexity (derived from the complexity index) was also high in the order of Limbang Menumbok > Sundar > Weston and supporting the perspective of less/undisturbed vegetation at two former locations. Both remote sensing and ground-truth observations have complementarily represented the distribution of Sonneratia spp. as pioneer vegetation at shallow river mouths, N. fruticans in the areas of strong freshwater discharge, R. apiculata in the areas of strong neritic incursion and X. granatum at interior/elevated grounds. The results from this study would be able to serve as strong baseline data for future mangrove investigations at Brunei Bay, including for monitoring and management purposes locally at present.

TI  - Conservation outcomes assessment of Sanjiangyuan alpine grassland with MODIS-EVI approach
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sanjiangyuan Region is a priority area for ecosystem conservation in China. Since 2005, the government has contributed significant funding to implement ecological conservation and restoration to protect and restore the grasslands. This study correlated aboveground biomass (AGB) data from 24g sites scattered across the Sanjiangyuan Region with MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EV1) data from 2000 to 2016 and utilized four regression models to estimate AGB by EV1. Results showed that power-function model worked best for grasslands in the Sanjiangyuan Region. Trend analysis showed no significant trends in 62% of the area of Sanjiangyuan, with 22% of the area, mainly distributed in the western and northern regions, increasing significantly and 16% of the area, sporadically located in the central and southern regions, decreasing significantly from 2000 to 2016. In general, the AGB of the entire area showed no significant increases or decreases with high annual fluctuations since 2000. However, there have been significant decreases since 2012. The AGB inside of the Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve was lower than that found outside, and didn't increase significantly during first-stage projects between 2005 and 2012 based on results from matching methods.

TI  - Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms on the Ecuadorian Coast (1997-2017): Integrating Remote Sensing and Biological Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean climate drivers and phytoplankton life strategies interact in a complex dynamic to produce harmful algal blooms (HABs). This study aims to integrate historical biological data collected during "red tide" events along the Ecuadorian coast between 1997 and 2017 in relation to five ocean variables derived from satellite remote sensing data to explain the seasonal drivers of coastal processes associated with HABs dynamics. Seasonality of the occurrence of HABs was assessed in relation to oceanographic variables by applying multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to the Ecuadorian central coast (Zone 1) and at the outer and inner Gulf of Guayaquil (Zone 2). Sixty-seven HABs events were registered between 1997 and 2017. From a total of 40 species of phytoplankton identified, 28 were identified as non-toxic and the remaining 12 are well known to produce toxins. Dinoflagellates were the taxonomic group most highly associated with potential HABs events along the entire Ecuadorian coast. HABs appear to be constrained by the Humboldt coastal upwelling, high precipitation, and associated coastal runoff, with higher biomass abundance in the Gulf of Guayaquil than in the central coast. Results from the MCA reveal that in the central Ecuadorian coast (oligotrophic system), toxic HABs occurred with low abundance of dinoflagellates, while in the Gulf of Guayaquil (eutrophic system), toxic HABs corresponded to a high abundance of dinoflagellates. In both cases, high values were found for sea surface temperature, precipitation, and irradiance-characteristic of wet seasons or El Nino years. Non-toxic HABs occurred with a high abundance of dinoflagellates, ciliates, and centric diatoms, corresponding to colder waters and low levels of precipitation and irradiance. These findings confirm that dinoflagellates display several strategies that enhance their productive capacity when ocean conditions are warmer, allowing them to produce toxins at high or at low concentrations. Considering that the Gulf of Guayaquil is essential to tourism, the shrimp industry, fisheries, and international shipping, these findings strongly suggest the need to establish an ecosystem health research program to monitor HABs and the development of a preventive policy for tourism and public health in Ecuador.

TI  - Estimation of land surface temperature from three thermal infrared channels of MODIS data for dust aerosol skies
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies indicated that a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.7 K was found if dust aerosol was not considered in the traditional land surface temperature (LST) retrieval algorithm. To reduce the influence of dust aerosol on LST estimation, a three-channel algorithm is proposed using MODIS channels 29, 31, and 32 with model coefficients irrelevant to the aerosol optical depth (AOD). Compared with actual and estimated LSTs, the RMSEs are 1.8 K and 1.6 K for dry and wet atmospheres, respectively, when the AOD is 1.0. Sensitivity analyses considering instrument noise, land surface emissivity uncertainties, and the algorithm error itself show that the LST errors are 2.5 K and 1.7 K for dry and wet atmospheres, respectively, when the AOD is 1.0. Finally, some in situ measured LSTs at the Jichanghuangmo, Huazhaizi, and Yingke sites in northwest China are taken as referenced LST values and compared with the MODIS LST products MOD11_L2/MYD11_L2 and those estimated with the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can improve the LST retrieval accuracy from 1.4 K to 2.2 K in dust aerosol atmospheres.

TI  - Single-footprint retrievals of temperature, water vapor and cloud properties from AIRS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Single-footprint Atmospheric Infrared Sounder spectra are used in an optimal estimation-based algorithm (AIRS-OE) for simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric temperature, water vapor, surface temperature, cloud-top temperature, effective cloud optical depth and effective cloud particle radius. In a departure from currently operational AIRS retrievals (AIRS V6), cloud scattering and absorption are in the radiative transfer forward model and AIRS single-footprint thermal infrared data are used directly rather than cloud-cleared spectra (which are calculated using nine adjacent AIRS infrared footprints). Coincident MODIS cloud data are used for cloud a priori data. Using single-footprint spectra improves the horizontal resolution of the AIRS retrieval from similar to 45 to similar to 13.5 km at nadir, but as microwave data are not used, the retrieval is not made at altitudes below thick clouds. An outline of the AIRS-OE retrieval procedure and information content analysis is presented. Initial comparisons of AIRS-OE to AIRS V6 results show increased horizontal detail in the water vapor and relative humidity fields in the free troposphere above the clouds. Initial comparisons of temperature, water vapor and relative humidity profiles with coincident radiosondes show good agreement. Future improvements to the retrieval algorithm, and to the forward model in particular, are discussed.

TI  - The TROPOMI surface UV algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) is the only payload of the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P), which is a polar-orbiting satellite mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). TROPOMI is a nadir-viewing spectrometer measuring in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and the shortwave infrared that provides near-global daily coverage. Among other things, TROPOMI measurements will be used for calculating the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Thus, the TROPOMI surface UV product will contribute to the monitoring of UV radiation by providing daily information on the prevailing UV conditions over the globe. The TROPOMI UV algorithm builds on the heritage of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Satellite Application Facility for Atmospheric Composition and UV Radiation (AC SAF) algorithms. This paper provides a description of the algorithm that will be used for estimating surface UV radiation from TROPOMI observations. The TROPOMI surface UV product includes the following UV quantities: the UV irradiance at 305, 310, 324, and 380 nm; the erythemally weighted UV; and the vitamin-D weighted UV. Each of these are available as (i) daily dose or daily accumulated irradiance, (ii) overpass dose rate or irradiance, and (iii) local noon dose rate or irradiance. In addition, all quantities are available corresponding to actual cloud conditions and as clear-sky values, which otherwise correspond to the same conditions but assume a cloud-free atmosphere. This yields 36 UV parameters altogether. The TROPOMI UV algorithm has been tested using input based on OMI and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) satellite measurements. These preliminary results indicate that the algorithm is functioning according to expectations.

TI  - Updated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of melanoma: definitive excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Definitive management of primary cutaneous melanoma consists of surgical excision of the melanoma with the aim of curing the patient. The melanoma is widely excised together with a safety margin of surrounding skin and subcutaneous tissue, after the diagnosis and Breslow thickness have been established by histological assessment of the initial excision biopsy specimen. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be discussed for melanomas >= 1 mm thickness (>= 0.8 mm if other high risk features) in which case lymphoscintigraphy must be performed before wider excision of the primary melanoma site. The 2008 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of melanoma (http://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/HealthProfessionals/ClinicalGuidelines/Clinical PracticeGuidelines-ManagementofMelanoma.pdf) are currently being revised and updated in a staged process by a multidisciplinary working party established by Cancer Council Australia. The guidelines for definitive excision margins for primary melanomas have been revised as part of this process.Main recommendations: The recommendations for definitive wide local excision of primary cutaneous melanoma are:melanoma in situ: 5-10 mm marginsinvasive melanoma (pT1) <= 1.0 mm thick: 1 cm marginsinvasive melanoma (pT2) 1.01-2.00 mm thick: 1-2 cm marginsinvasive melanoma (pT3) 2.01-4.00 mm thick: 1-2 cm marginsinvasive melanoma (pT4) > 4.0mm thick: 2 cm marginsChanges in management as a result of the guideline: Based on currently available evidence, excision margins for invasive melanoma have been left unchanged compared with the 2008 guidelines. However, melanoma in situ should be excised with 5-10 mm margins, with the aim of achieving complete histological clearance. Minimum clearances from all margins should be assessed and stated. Consideration should be given to further excision if necessary; positive or close histological margins are unacceptable.

M3  - Article
AB  - Model and observational evidence has shown that ocean current speeds in the Beaufort Gyre have increased and recently stabilized. Because these currents rival ice drift speeds, we examine the potential for the Beaufort Gyre's shift from a system in which the wind drives the ice and the ice drives a passive ocean to one in which the ocean often, in the absence of high winds, drives the ice. The resultant stress exerted on the ocean by the ice and the resultant Ekman pumping are reversed, without any change in average wind stress curl. Through these curl reversals, the ice-ocean stress provides a key feedback in Beaufort Gyre stabilization. This manuscript constitutes one of the first observational studies of ice-ocean stress inclusive of geostrophic ocean currents, by making use of recently available remote sensing data.

TI  - Trends and Variability of Surface Solar Radiation in Europe Based On Surface- and Satellite-Based Data Records
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that determines the Earth's energy cycle and climate. As long-term high-quality surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to derive more information on its spatial pattern and its temporal variability. Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CMSAF) has published two satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both data records provide estimates of surface solar radiation. In this study, these new climate data records are compared to surface measurements in Europe during the period 1983-2015. SARAH-2 and CLARA-A2 show a high accuracy compared to ground-based observations (mean absolute deviations of 6.9 and 7.3W/m(2), respectively) highlighting a good agreement considering the temporal behavior and the spatial distribution. The results show an overall brightening period since the 1980s onward (comprised between 1.9 and 2.4W/m(2)/decade), with substantial decadal and spatial variability. The strongest brightening is found in eastern Europe in spring. An exception is found for northern and southern Europe, where the trends shown by the station data are not completely reproduced by satellite data, especially in summer in southern Europe. We conclude that the major part of the observed trends in surface solar radiation in Europe is caused by changes in clouds and that remaining differences between the satellite- and the station-based data might be connected to changes in the direct aerosol effect and in snow cover.Plain Language Summary The incoming solar radiation is the essential climate variable that determines the Earth's climate. As surface measurements of solar radiation are rare, satellite data are used to derive more information in space and time. Recently, the EUMETSAT Satellite Application on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) has published two new satellite-based climate data records: Surface Solar Radiation Data Set-Heliosat, Edition 2 (SARAH-2), and Clouds and Radiation Data Set based on AVHRR (advanced very high resolution radiometer) Satellite Measurements, Edition 2 (CLARA-A2). Both satellite-based data records provide estimates of surface solar radiation and can capture what is observed by station measurements in Europe. The proven high accuracy of the CM SAF's climate data records allows the detailed analysis of surface solar radiation during the last three decades. A positive trend is observed by the station and satellite data, meaning surface radiation has increased since the 1980s, mainly in eastern and northwestern Europe. Some discrepancies between satellite and station data are found in the Mediterranean summer likely due to aerosol effects. It is concluded that the main reason for the observed positive trend in surface solar radiation in Europe since the 1980s is a change in clouds.

TI  - Interseismic crustal deformation in and around the Atotsugawa fault system, central Japan, detected by InSAR and GNSS
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atotsugawa fault system is one of the best-known active faults in Japan. However, revealing the interseismic velocity field in and around the Atotsugawa fault system with high spatial resolution is challenging because of dense vegetation, steep topography, and heavy snowfall in winter. To overcome these difficulties, we combined ALOS/PALSAR data and GNSS data from our original stations in addition to the nationwide station network (GEONET). First, we removed the height-dependent phase change in each interferogram using a digital elevation model. Next, we removed the long-wavelength phase trend using the GNSS velocity field. Finally, we applied an InSAR time-series analysis, known as small baseline subset analysis (SBAS), to all the corrected interferograms. The resultant mean velocity field shows a remarkable phase gradient around the Atostugawa fault system. We found a sharp velocity gradient across the Ushikubi fault, a major strand of the Atotsugawa faults system, rather than the main trace of the Atotsugawa fault. Using InSAR, we found that the interseismic deformation inside the strain concentration zone is spatially heterogeneous and different from what we expect from the fault traces.

TI  - Comparisons of Ice Water Path in Deep Convective Systems Among Ground-Based, GOES, and CERES-MODIS Retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrievals of convective cloud microphysical properties based on passive satellite imagery are difficult. To help quantify their uncertainties, ice water paths (IWPs) retrieved from the NASA Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System project using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Terra/Aqua MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations are compared with IWPs retrieved from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) observations over a large domain (32 degrees N to 40 degrees N and 105 degrees W to 91 degrees W) during the 2011 Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment field campaign. Based on comparisons of pixel-level (4kmx4km) daytime IWP retrievals from NEXRAD and GOES, it is found that NEXRAD- and GOES-retrieved mean IWPs are 2.03 and 1.83kgm(-2), respectively, for ice-phase cloud in thick anvil area. Their mean difference of 0.20kgm(-2) (with 95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.26kgm(-2)) is within the uncertainty of NEXRAD retrievals. However, the low correlation between pixel-to-pixel comparisons indicates a large variation in GOES-retrieved IWP. For mixed-phase clouds in thick anvil areas, in addition to IWPs, total water paths (TWPs, sum of ice and liquid water path) are estimated with aid of aircraft measurements for NEXRAD retrievals and corrected using a TWP parameterization for GOES retrievals. The mean values of estimated TWPs from NEXRAD (corrected using aircraft in situ measurements) and GOES are similar. GOES and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-retrieved IWPs/TWPs generally do not exceed 5kgm(-2). Large differences and low correlations exist between satellite and NEXRAD retrievals in stratiform rain areas. Possible reasons for the differences between retrievals are discussed.

TI  - Collocation mismatch uncertainties in satellite aerosol retrieval validation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol products are routinely validated against ground-based reference data, usually obtained from sun photometer networks such as AERONET (AEROsol RObotic NETwork). In a typical validation exercise a spatial sample of the instantaneous satellite data is compared against a temporal sample of the point-like ground-based data. The observations do not correspond to exactly the same column of the atmosphere at the same time, and the representativeness of the reference data depends on the spatiotemporal variability of the aerosol properties in the samples. The associated uncertainty is known as the collocation mismatch uncertainty (CMU). The validation results depend on the sampling parameters. While small samples involve less variability, they are more sensitive to the inevitable noise in the measurement data. In this paper we study systematically the effect of the sampling parameters in the validation of AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product against AERONET data and the associated collocation mismatch uncertainty. To this end, we study the spatial AOD variability in the satellite data, compare it against the corresponding values obtained from densely located AERONET sites, and assess the possible reasons for observed differences. We find that the spatial AOD variability in the satellite data is approximately 2 times larger than in the ground-based data, and the spatial variability correlates only weakly with that of AERONET for short distances. We interpreted that only half of the variability in the satellite data is due to the natural variability in the AOD, and the rest is noise due to retrieval errors. However, for larger distances (similar to 0.5 degrees) the correlation is improved as the noise is averaged out, and the day-to-day changes in regional AOD variability are well captured. Furthermore, we assess the usefulness of the spatial variability of the satellite AOD data as an estimate of CMU by comparing the retrieval errors to the total uncertainty estimates including the CMU in the validation. We find that accounting for CMU increases the fraction of consistent observations.

TI  - Tracing platinum accumulation kinetics in oyster <i>Crassostrea</i> <i>gigas</i>, a sentinel species in coastal marine environments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) are extremely scarce in the Earth's Crust and of strong interest for high-end technologies due to their specific properties. They belong to the Technology Critical Elements (TCEs) for which use is forecast to increase, implying growing emissions into the environment in the following years. In particular, with the intensive use of platinum (Pt) in car catalytic converters, the anthropogenic geochemical cycle of this element has surpassed the natural cycle. Yet, environmental Pt levels are still in the sub picomolar range, making its analytical detection a challenge. Few studies cover the behavior of Pt in marine waters in terms of speciation, reactivity and possible transfer to the biota. In this study, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from an unpolluted estuary were exposed to the stable isotope Pt-194 in seawater at a range of concentrations during 35 days. Seawater was renewed daily and spiked to three nominal Pt concentrations (50, 100, and 10,000 ng . L-1) for two replicate series. In addition, control conditions were monitored. Five oysters from each tank were dissected after 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days of Pt exposure, and analyzed by ICP-MS. Accuracy of this analytical method applied to biological matrix was checked by an inter-method comparison with a voltammetrical technique. A concentration-dependent accumulation of Pt in oysters increasing with exposure time occurred. After 28 days, oyster Pt accumulation from low and intermediate exposure conditions reached a plateau. This was not the case of the highest exposure condition for which oyster tissues showed increasing concentrations until the last day of the experiment. A linear correlation exists between seawater concentrations and Pt content in oysters for low and intermediate exposure concentrations i.e. closer to environmental concentrations. By showing high Pt accumulation potential, oysters may serve as sentinels, ensuring biomonitoring of Pt concentrations in marine coastal waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Water productivity and crop yield: A simplified remote sensing driven operational approach
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops and proposes a simplified operational remote sensing approach to assist crop growth models in reproducing actual processes in the field by relating satellite based remote sensing data and key canopy biophysical parameters. While relationships between spectral vegetation indices (VI) and biomass production have been conducted in the past, we specifically pursue the relationship between crop transpiration and biomass production as described in the FAO-66 Aquacrop manual. The authors point to a possible general relationship between a transpiration coefficient (herein we propose the basal crop coefficient, K-cb, as a proxy) and biomass production. In parallel, many studies have demonstrated the well-established relationship between Kcb and remote sensing based VI. Thus, the relationship between both parameters has a strong basis but must be demonstrated. We analyze the relationship between biomass production and the reflectance based Kcb using field data obtained during 11 years in irrigated and rainfed soybeans and maize in eastern Nebraska. The analysis confirms that the relationship is strong and paves the way for the use of remote sensing data for a quantitative analysis of crop biomass production and yield.

TI  - Modeling vegetation green-up dates across the Tibetan Plateau by including both seasonal and daily temperature and precipitation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in vegetation phenology induced by climate change are substantially modifying various ecosystem processes, and those changes can in turn affect weather and climate systems. Realistic modeling of spring vegetation green-up is critical to improving process-based ecosystem models of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and for better understanding of the coupling between TP terrestrial biophysical processes and the Asian monsoon system. However, no model is available for simulating the vegetation green-up date (VGD) across the entire TP. In this study, we first assessed the ability of several existing state-of-the-art phenological models to estimate VGD across the TP. We then modified the existing models by adding environmental constraints identified by partial least squares analyses. The modified models simulated VGDs with lower estimation errors than other models (Mean absolute error: 8.2 days vs. 8.7-12.9 days; P < 0.01, t-test). Moreover, although our model captured the inter annual variations in VGD better than any previous model, the correlation coefficient between predicted and remotely sensed VGDs was still low, especially in the western TP. This study revealed the necessity of considering multiple factors in VGD models and highlighted the challenge of developing models that will better represent phenology in future ecosystem models.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017/18 interim estimate of trivalent influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 39% (95% confidence interval: 20-54) in Navarre. Compared with individuals unvaccinated in the current and five previous seasons, VE against influenza B was 41% for current and any prior doses, 67% for current vaccination only, and 22% for any prior doses, and 43%, 51% and 54%, respectively against influenza A(H3N2). This suggests moderate VE despite predominance of lineage mismatched influenza B.The early 2017/18 influenza season in Europe was characterised by co-circulation of influenza B, A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdmo9, with lineage mismatched influenza B(Yamagata) virus predominating in many countries [1,2]. Concerns arose due to the low influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) reported in the 2017 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic in Australia [3] and the warning about low VE of the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) against a lineage mismatched influenza B(Yamagata) virus [4]. Influenza vaccination in previous seasons may retain some preventive effect and modify the effect of the current season vaccination so the vaccination history should be considered in the VE assessment [5,6].We present the 2017/18 interim effectiveness estimates of different combinations of current and prior season influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza.

TI  - Quantification of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in paddy rice based on the characterization and simulation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the canopy photosynthesis of crops is essential for elucidation of the effects of environmental changes on CO2 fluxes in agricultural ecosystems and crop productivity. This study was conducted to characterize the CO2 fluxes of paddy rice (Oryza sativa), simulate CO2 assimilation based on the development of a photosynthesis model, and project spatiotemporal variations in CO2 assimilation using a crop model based on remotely sensed data in an effort to identify a link between photosynthetic productivity and accumulation of plant biomass. To perform the research practically under actual farming conditions, we investigated the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization on canopy photosynthesis of rice grown under two levels of N application. Gross primary productivity (GPP) was calculated using net ecosystem exchange and ecosystem respiration measured in a closed-system canopy chamber. GPP was the highest in the maximum tillering stage and its minimum in the heading stage. The initial slope of the light response curve was similar during the four growth stages observed. The sensitivity of GPP to the amount of chlorophyll in the lower N treatment was higher than that in the optimum N treatment, whereas the GPP and yield in plants in the lower N treatment were lower. The photosynthesis model that was developed simulated CO2 assimilation that had statistically acceptable agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. In addition, projections of spatiotemporal variations in CO2 assimilation were established using the GRAMI-rice model using remotely sensed data. These results indicated that CO2 fluxes in paddy rice could be well quantified based on measurement and simulation projecting spatiotemporal CO2 assimilation. As most of the information was derived from fields, it is not well organized to form one acceptable scientific streamline, efforts should be made to seek ecological implications through a fusion between at-ground measurements and remote sensing observations via model development.

TI  - Simple models to predict grassland ecosystem C exchange and actual evapotranspiration using NDVI and environmental variables
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Semiarid grasslands contribute significantly to net terrestrial carbon flux as plant productivity and heterotrophic respiration in these moisture-limited systems are correlated with metrics related to water availability (e.g., precipitation, Actual EvapoTranspiration or AET). These variables are also correlated with remotely sensed metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We used measurements of growing season net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE), NDVI from eMODIS and AVHRR, precipitation, and volumetric soil water content (VSWC) from grazed pastures in the semiarid, shortgrass steppe to quantify the correlation of NEE with these driving variables. eMODIS NDVI explained 60 and 40% of the variability in daytime and nighttime NEE, respectively, on non-rain days; these correlations were reduced to 41 and 15%, respectively, on rain days. Daytime NEE was almost always negative (sink) on non-rain days but positive on most rain days. In contrast, nighttime NEE was always positive (source), across rain and non-rain days. A model based on eMODIS NDVI, VSWC, daytime vs. nighttime, and rain vs. non-rain days explained 48% of observed variability in NEE at a daily scale; this increased to 62% and 77%, respectively, at the weekly and monthly scales. eMODIS NDVI explained 50-52% of the variability in AET regardless of rain or non-rain days. A model based on eMODIS NDVI, VSWC, Potential EvapoTranspiration (or PET), and rain vs. non-rain days explained 70% of the observed variability in AET at a daily scale; this increased to 90 and 96%, respectively, at weekly and monthly scales. Models based on AVHRR NDVI showed similar patterns as those using eMODIS, but correlations with observations were lower. We conclude that remotely-sensed NDVI is a robust tool, when combined with VSWC and knowledge of rain events, for predicting NEE and AET across multiple temporal scales (day to season) in semiarid grasslands.

TI  - Improving shadows detection for solar radiation numerical models
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation numerical models need the implementation of an accurate method for determining cast shadows on the terrain or on solar collectors. The aim of this work is the development of a new methodology to detect the shadows on a particular terrain. The paper addresses the detection of self and cast shadows produced by the orography as well as those caused by clouds. The paper presents important enhancements on the methodology proposed by the authors in previous works, to detect the shadows caused by the orography. The domain is the terrain surface discretised using an adaptive mesh of triangles. A triangle of terrain will be under cast shadows when, looking at the mesh from the Sun, you can find another triangle that covers all or partially the first one. For each time step, all the triangles should be checked to see if there are cast or self shadows on it. The computational cost of this procedure eventually resulted unaffordable when dealing with complex topography such as that in Canary Islands thus, a new methodology was developed. This one includes a filtering system to identify which triangles are those likely to be shadowed. If there are no self shadowed triangles, the entire mesh will be illuminated and there will not be any shadows. Only triangles that have their backs towards the Sun will be able to cast shadows on other triangles. Detection of shadows generated by clouds is achieved by a shadow algorithm using satellite images. In this paper, Landsat 8 images have been used. The code was done in python programming language. Finally, the outputs of both approaches, shadows generated by the topography and generated by clouds, can be combined in one map. The whole problem has been tested in Gran Canaria and Tenerife Island (Canary Islands - Spain), and in the Tatra Mountains (Poland and Slovakia). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - NDVI derived from near-infrared-enabled digital cameras: Applicability across different plant functional types
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of vegetation indices (e.g. normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) and color indices (e.g. green chromatic coordinate [G(CC)]) based on radiometric measurements are now available at different spatial and temporal scales ranging from weekly satellite observations to sub-hourly in situ measurements by means of near surface remote sensing (e.g. spectral sensors or digital cameras). In situ measurements are essential for providing validation data for satellite-derived vegetation indices. In this study we used a recently developed method to calculate NDVI from near-infrared (NIR) enabled digital cameras (NDVIC) at 17 sites (for a total of 74 year-sites) encompassing six plant functional types (PFT) from the PhenoCam network.The seasonality of NDVIC was comparable to both NDVI measured by ground spectral sensors and by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). We calculated site- and PFT-specific scaling factors to correct NDVIC values and recommend the use of site-specific NDVI from MODIS in order to scale NDVIC. We also compared G(CC) extracted from red-green-blue images to NDVIC and found PFT-dependent systematic differences in their seasonalities. During senescence, NDVIC lags behind G(CC) in deciduous broad-leaf forests and grasslands, suggesting that G(CC) is more sensitive to changes in leaf color and NDVIC is more sensitive to changes in leaf area. In evergreen forests, NDVIC peaks later than G(CC) in spring, probably tracking the processes of shoot elongation and new needle formation. Both G(CC) and NDVIC can be used as validation tools for the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MCD12Q2) for deciduous broad-leaf spring phenology, whereas NDVIC is more comparable than G(CC) with autumn phenology derived from MODIS. For evergreen forests, we found a poor relationship between MCD12Q2 and camera-derived phenology, highlighting the need for more work to better characterize the seasonality of both canopy structure and leaf biochemistry in those ecosystems.Our results demonstrate that NDVIC is in excellent agreement with NDVI obtained from spectral measurements, and that NDVIC and G(CC) can complement each other in describing ecosystem phenology. Additionally, NDVIC allows the detection of structural changes in the canopy that cannot be detected by visible-wavelength imagery.

TI  - Detection of aerosol pollution sources during sandstorms in Northwestern China using remote sensed and model simulated data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper has used a comprehensive approach to study atmosphere pollution sources including the study of vertical distribution characteristics, the epicenters of occurrence and transport of atmospheric aerosol in North-West China under intensive dust storm registered in all cities of the region in April 2014. To achieve this goal, the remote sensing data using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite (MODIS) as well as model-simulated data, were used, which facilitate tracking the sources, routes, and spatial extent of dust storms. The results of the study have shown strong territory pollution with aerosol during sandstorm. According to ground-based air quality monitoring stations data, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 exceeded 400 mu g/m(3) and 150 mu g/m(3), respectively, the ratio PM2.5/PM10 being within the range of 0.123-0.661. According to MODIS/Terra Collection 6 Level-2 aerosol products data and the Deep Blue algorithm data, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm in the pollution epicenter was within 0.75-1. The vertical distribution of aerosols indicates that the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) 532 nm total attenuates backscatter coefficient ranges from 0.01 to 0.0001 km(-1) x sr(-1) with the distribution of the main types of aerosols in the troposphere of the region within 0-12.5 km, where the most severe aerosol contamination is observed in the lower troposphere (at 3-6 km). According to satellite sounding and model-simulated data, the sources of pollution are the deserted regions of Northern and Northwestern China. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union-Hydrology-Section (CGU-HS)
CL  - Fredericton, CANADA
AB  - In this study, the Precipitation-Runoff Modelling System (PRMS) was used to simulate changes in surface-water depression storage in the 1,126-km(2) Upper Pipestem Creek basin located within the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, USA. The Prairie Pothole Region is characterized by millions of small water bodies (or surface-water depressions) that provide numerous ecosystem services and are considered an important contribution to the hydrologic cycle. The Upper Pipestem PRMS model was extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Hydrologic Model (NHM), developed to support consistent hydrologic modelling across the conterminous United States. The Geospatial Fabric database, created for the USGS NHM, contains hydrologic model parameter values derived from datasets that characterize the physical features of the entire conterminous United States for 109,951 hydrologic response units. Each hydrologic response unit in the Geospatial Fabric was parameterized using aggregated surface-water depression area derived from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus, an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets. This paper presents a calibration strategy for the Upper Pipestem PRMS model that uses normalized lake elevation measurements to calibrate the parameters influencing simulated fractional surface-water depression storage. Results indicate that inclusion of measurements that give an indication of the change in surface-water depression storage in the calibration procedure resulted in accurate changes in surface-water depression storage in the water balance. Regionalized parameterization of the USGS NHM will require a proxy for change in surface-storage to accurately parameterize surface-water depression storage within the USGS NHM.

TI  - Bias due to Preanalytical Dilution of rodent serum for Biochemical analysis on the siemens Dimension Xpand Plus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical pathology testing of rodents is often challenging due to insufficient sample volume. One solution in clinical veterinary and exploratory research environments is dilution of samples prior to analysis. However, published information on the impact of preanalytical sample dilution on rodent biochemical data is incomplete. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of preanalytical sample dilution on biochemical analysis of mouse and rat serum samples utilizing the Siemens Dimension Xpand Plus. Rats were obtained from end of study research projects. Mice were obtained from sentinel testing programs. For both, whole blood was collected via terminal cardiocentesis into empty tubes and serum was harvested. Biochemical parameters were measured on fresh and thawed frozen samples run straight and at dilution factors 2-10. Dilutions were performed manually, utilizing either ultrapure water or enzyme diluent per manufacturer recommendations. All diluted samples were generated directly from the undiluted sample. Preanalytical dilution caused clinically unacceptable bias in most analytes at dilution factors four and above. Dilution-induced bias in total calcium, creatinine, total bilirubin, and uric acid was considered unacceptable with any degree of dilution, based on the more conservative of two definitions of acceptability. Dilution often caused electrolyte values to fall below assay range precluding evaluation of bias. Dilution-induced bias occurred in most biochemical parameters to varying degrees and may render dilution unacceptable in the exploratory research and clinical veterinary environments. Additionally, differences between results obtained at different dilution factors may confound statistical comparisons in research settings. Comparison of data obtained at a single dilution factor is highly recommended.

TI  - Potential for using remote sensing to estimate carbon fluxes across northern peatlands - A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Peatlands store large amounts of terrestrial carbon and any changes to their carbon balance could cause large changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of the Earth's atmosphere. There is still much uncertainty about how the GHG dynamics of peatlands are affected by climate and land use change. Current field-based methods of estimating annual carbon exchange between peatlands and the atmosphere include flux chambers and eddy covariance towers. However, remote sensing has several advantages over these traditional approaches in terms of cost, spatial coverage and accessibility to remote locations. In this paper, we outline the basic principles of using remote sensing to estimate ecosystem carbon fluxes and explain the range of satellite data available for such estimations, considering the indices and models developed to make use of the data. Past studies, which have used remote sensing data in comparison with ground-based calculations of carbon fluxes over Northern peatland landscapes, are discussed, as well as the challenges of working with remote sensing on peatlands. Finally, we suggest areas in need of future work on this topic. We conclude that the application of remote sensing to models of carbon fluxes is a viable research method over Northern peatlands but further work is needed to develop more comprehensive carbon cycle models and to improve the long-term reliability of models, particularly on peatland sites undergoing restoration.

TI  - Mapping relative humidity, average and extreme temperature in hot summer over China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature and relative humidity are the key variables in environmental health research. Both of them are difficult to map especially at national scale because of spatial heterogeneity. This paper presents a methodology for mapping relative humidity, average and extreme temperature in hot summer (June to August) over China. Several data as explanatory variables were applied to random forest regression models to predict relative humidity and temperatures, including surface reflectance, land cover, digital elevation model (DEM), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), latitude, nighttime lights (NLs), as well as buffer zones of road, railroad, river system and administration center. Results based on cross-validation reflect acceptable prediction errors in estimating relative humidity (RMSE = 7.4%), average temperature (RMSE = 2.4 degrees C), average maximum temperature (RMSE = 2.5 degrees C), and extreme maximum temperature (RMSE= 2.6 degrees C). Despite the strong correlation between average and extreme temperatures, significant differences exist in their spatial distribution along the latitude direction, especially in the areas such as Hebei, Szechwan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia. Specifically, social economic activity, relative humidity and vegetation tend to affect extreme heat events, and both latitude and DEM (i.e., geographical position) determine the average level of temperature. Compared with interpolation technology and statistical methods, the proposed methodology demonstrates the ability to generate relative humidity and temperature maps with finer gradients in hot summer over China.

TI  - Surge of Hispar Glacier, Pakistan, between 2013 and 2017 detected from remote sensing observations
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the behaviour of an actively surging glacier, Hispar, in Pakistan using remote sensing methods. We used 15 m panchromatic band of Landsat 8 OLI from 2013 to 2017 to assess the changes in glacier velocity, glacier geomorphology and supraglacial water bodies. For the velocity estimation, correlation image analysis (CIAS) was used, which is based on normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of satellite data. On-screen digitization was employed to quantify changes in the glacier geomorphology and dynamics of supraglacial water bodies on the glacier. Our velocity estimates indicate that the upper part of the glacier is presently undergoing an active surge which not only affects the debris distribution but also impacts the development of supraglacial water bodies. Velocities in the actively surging part of the main glacier trunk and its three tributaries reach up to similar to 900 m yr(-1). The surge of Hispar also impacts the distribution of supraglacial debris causing folding of the medial moraines features present on the glacier surface. Changes in the number and size of supraglacial lakes and ponds were also observed during the observation period from 2013 to 2017. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multivariate geostatistical modeling of the spatial sediment distribution in a large scale drainage basin, Upper Rhone, Switzerland
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a notable discrepancy between detailed sediment budget studies in small headwater catchments (<10(2) km(2)) focusing on the identification of sedimentary landforms in the field (e.g. talus cones, moraine deposits, fans) and large scale studies (>10(3) km(2)) in higher order catchments applying modeling and/or remote sensing based approaches for major sediment storage delineation.To bridge the gap between these scales, we compiled an inventory of sediment and bedrock coverage from field mapping, remote sensing analysis and published data for five key sites in the Upper Rhone Basin (Val d'llliez, Val de la Liene, Turtmanntal, Lotschental, Goms; 3603 km(2), equivalent to 6.7% of the Upper Rhone Basin). This inventory was used as training and testing data for the classification of sediment and bedrock cover. From a digital elevation model (2 x 2 m ground resolution) and Landsat imagery we derived 22 parameters characterizing local morphometry, topography and position, contributing area, and climatic and biotic factors on different spatial scales, which were used as inputs for different statistical models (logistic regression, principal component logistic regression, generalized additive model). Best prediction results with an excellent performance (mean AUROC: 0.8721 +/- 0.0012) and both a high spatial and non-spatial transferability were achieved applying a generalized additive model. Since the model has a high thematic consistency, the independent input variables chosen based on their geomorphic relevance are suitable to model the spatial distribution of sediment. Our high-resolution classification shows that 53.5 +/- 21.7% of the Upper Rhone Basin are covered with sediment.These are by no means evenly distributed: small headwaters (<5 km(2)) feature a very strong variability in sediment coverage, with watersheds drowning in sediments juxtaposed to watersheds devoid of sediment cover. In contrast, larger watersheds predominantly show a bimodal distribution, with highest densities for bedrock (30-40%) being consistently lower than for sediment cover (60-65%). Earlier studies quantifying sedimentary cover and volume focus on the broad glacially overdeepened Rhone Valley that accounts for c. 9% of our study area. While our data support its importance, we conservatively estimate that the remaining 90% of sediment cover, mainly located outside trunk valleys, account for a volume of 2.6-13 km(3), i.e. 2-16% of the estimated sediment volume stored in the Rhone Valley between Brig and Lake Geneva. Furthermore, our data reveal increased relative sediment cover in areas deglaciated since the Little Ice Age, as compared to headwater regions without this recent glacial imprint. We therefore conclude that sediment storage in low-order valleys, often neglected in large scale studies, constitutes a significant component of large scale sediment budgets that needs to be better included into future analysis.

TI  - Diverse sensitivity of winter crops over the growing season to climate and land surface temperature across the rainfed cropland-belt of eastern Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainfed cropland belt in Australia is of great importance to the world grain market but has the highest climate variability of all such regions globally. However, the spatial-temporal impacts of climate variability on crops during different crop growth stages across broadacre farming systems are largely unknown. This study aims to quantify the contributions of climate and Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations to the variability of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) by using remote sensing methods. The datasets were analyzed at an 8-day time-scale across the rainfed cropland of eastern Australia. First, we found that EVI values were more variable during the crop reproductive growth stages than at any other crop life stage within a calendar year, but nevertheless had the highest correlation with crop grain yield (t ha(-1)). Second, climate factors and LST during the crop reproductive growth stages showed the largest variability and followed a typical east-west gradient of rainfall and a north-south temperature gradient across the study area during the crop growing season. Last, we identified two critical 8-day periods, beginning on day of the year (DoY) 257 and 289, as the key 'windows' of crop growth variation that arose from the variability in climate and LST. Our results show that the sum of the variability of the climate components within these two 8-day 'windows' explained > 88% of the variability in the EVI, with LST being the dominant factor. This study offers a fresh understanding of the spatial-temporal climate-crop relationships in rainfed cropland and can serve as an early warning system for agricultural adaptation in broadacre rainfed cropping practices in Australia and worldwide.

TI  - Estimation of plant area index and phenological transition dates from digital repeat photography and radiometric approaches in a hardwood forest in the Northeastern United States
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term, continuous digital camera imagery and tower-based radiometric monitoring were conducted at a representative hardwood forest site in the Northeastern United States, part of the AmeriFlux network. In this study, the phenological metrics of the leaf area index (LAI), plant area index (PAI) and associated transition dates (e.g., timing of the onset of leaf expansion and the cessation of leaf fall) were compared using 4-year of data from Bartlett Experimental Forest. We used digital repeat photography (DRP) imagery collected using two different methods ("canopy cover" and "phenocam" approaches), together with above- and below-canopy measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The growth-period LAI estimated from canopy cover images (LAI(CANOPY)) and the above and below canopy PAR measurements (LAI(fPARt)) were within approximately the same range, in term of magnitude, as previous results for multiple comparative methods, although growing season LAI(CANOPY) was slightly lower (3.11 m(2) m(-2) to 3.35 m(2) m(-2)) than LAI(fPARt) (3.19 m(2) m(-2) to 3.67 m(2) m(-2)). In addition, we derived phenological transition dates from PAI(CANOPY), PAI(fPARt), and color-based metrics calculated from the phenocam imagery (green (G(cc)) and red (R-cc) chromatic coordinates). The transition dates in both spring and autumn differed somewhat according to method, presumably due to the vegetation status detection abilities of each vegetation metric. We found that LAI estimation from canopy cover images may be influenced by automatic exposure settings, which limits the ability to detect subtle changes in phenology during the transition phases in both spring and autumn. Particularly in autumn, the color-based metrics calculated from the phenocam imagery are decoupled from leaf area dynamics and thus PAL While above and below canopy PAR measurements could yield the better indicators for estimating LAI, its seasonal dynamics, and associated phenological transition dates in long-term monitoring, we argue that there are obvious benefits to the multi-sensor approach used here.

TI  - Estimation of soil salt content (SSC) in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR), Northwest China, based on a Bootstrap-BP neural network model and optimal spectral indices
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is recognized worldwide as a major threat to agriculture, particularly in arid regions. Producers and decision-makers thus require updated and accurate maps of salinity in agronomical and environmentally relevant regions. The goals of this study were to test various regression models for estimating soil salt content based on hyperspectral data, HJ-CCD images, and Landsat OLI data using; develop optimal band Difference Index (DI), Ratio Index (RI), and Normalization Index (NDI) algorithms for monitoring soil salt content using image and spectral data; and to compare the performances of the proposed models using a Bootstrap-BP neural network model (Bootstrap-BPNN) from different data sources. The results showed that previously published optimal remote sensing parameters can be applied to estimate the soil salt content in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR). Optimal band combination indices based on DI, RI, and NDI were developed for different data sources. Then, the Bootstrap-BP neural network model was built using 1000 groups of Bootstrap samples of remote sensing indices (DI, RI and NDI) and soil salt content. When verifying the accuracy of hyperspectral data, the model yields an R-2 value of 0.95, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.38 g/kg, and a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 3.36. The optimal model for remote sensing images was the first derivative model of Landsat OLI, which yielded R2 value of 0.91, RMSE of 4.82 g/kg, and RPD of 3.32; these data indicated that this model has a high predictive ability. When comparing the salinization monitoring accuracy of satellite images to that of ground hyperspectral data, the accuracy of the first derivative of the Landsat OLI model was close to that of the hyperspectral parameter model. Soil salt content was inverted using the first derivative of the Landsat OLI model in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A steady-state approximation approach to simulate seasonal leaf dynamics of deciduous broadleaf forests via climate variables
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As leaves are the basic elements of plants that conduct photosynthesis and transpiration, vegetation leaf dynamics controls canopy physical and biogeochemical processes and hence largely influences the interactive exchanges of energy and materials between the land surface and the atmosphere. Given that the processes of plant leaf allocation is highly sensitive to climatological and environmental conditions, developing robust models that simulate leaf dynamics via climate variables contributes a key component to land surface models and coupled land-atmosphere models. Here we propose a new method to simulate seasonal leaf dynamics based on the idea of applying vegetation productivity as a synthesized metric to track and assess the climate suitability to plant growth over time. The method first solves two closed simultaneous equations of leaf phenology and canopy photosynthesis as modeled using the Growing Production-Day model iteratively for deriving the time series of steady-state leaf area index (LAI), and then applies the method of simple moving average to account for the time lagging of leaf allocation behind steady-state LAI. The seasonal LAI simulated using the developed method agree with field measurements from a selection of AmeriFlux sites as indicated by high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.801) and low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.924 m(2)/m(2)) and with satellite-derived data (R-2 = 0.929 and RMSE = 0.650 m(2)/m(2)) for the studied flux tower sites. Moreover, the proposed method is able to simulate seasonal LAI of deciduous broadleaf forests that match with satellite-derived LAI time series across the entire eastern United States. Comparative modeling studies suggest that the proposed method produces more accurate results than the method based on Growing Season Index in terms of correlation coefficients and error metrics. The developed method provides a complete solution to modeling seasonal leaf dynamics as well as canopy productivity solely using climate variables.

AB  - Introduction: Influenza vaccine is recommended for the entire population in Israel. We assessed influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons in Israel, for the first time. Methods: Combined nose and throat swab specimens were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting to sentinel primary care clinics and tested for influenza virus by RT-PCR. VE of the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) was assessed using test-negative case-control design. Results: During the 2014/15 season 1,142 samples were collected; 327 (28.6%) were positive for influenza, 83.8% A(H3N2), 5.8% A(H1N1) pdmo9, 9.2% B and 1.2% A un-subtyped. Adjusted VE against all influenza viruses for this influenza season was -4.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): -54.8 to 29.0) and against influenza A(H3N2), it was -15.8% (95% CI: -72.8 to 22.4). For the 2015/16 season, 1,919 samples were collected; 853 (44.4%) were positive for influenza, 43.5% A(H1N1) pdmo9, 57% B, 0.7% A(H3N2) and 11 samples positive for both A(H1N1) pdmo9 and B. Adjusted VE against all influenza viruses for this influenza season was 8.8% (95% CI: -25.1 to 33.5), against influenza A(H1N1) pdmo9, it was 32.3% (95% CI: (-4.3 to 56.1) and against influenza B, it was -2.2% (95% CI: (-47.0 to 29.0). Conclusions: Using samples from patients with ILI visiting sentinel clinics in Israel, we demonstrated the feasibility of influenza VE estimation in Israel.

TI  - Recent dynamics of hydro-ecosystems in thermokarst depressions in Central Siberia from satellite and in situ observations: Importance for agriculture and human life
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alases, which are thermokarst depressions that are occupied by grasslands and lakes, are an important element of the Central Yakutian periglacial landscape. In recent decades, climatic changes in Central Yakutia have resulted in important changes in environmental conditions. We use different remote-sensing instruments (Landsat 8, TerraSAR-X, ENVISAT-RA2, and Jason-2) alongside in situ observations to investigate 1) the spatial distribution and water regime of alas lakes and their relationships with climatic and geomorphologic factors, 2) the relationship of the alas' grassland productivity with the water regime and 3) the potential of alas grasslands for local agriculture. During the 2002-2010 period, the lake water level rose by 1.3 m on average, resulting in lake expansion throughout the region. Since 2011, the lake area decreased and the water level declined by 70 cm on the middle terraces (low ground-ice content), while the wetting trend continued until 2016 at higher elevations. Small thermokarst lakes (<0.025 km(2)), which indicate regions of young thermokarst, comprise up to 11% of the total lake area and experience high (30%) seasonal variations. In situ observations of the grassland dynamics show their synchronous cyclic variability with the lake extent and a general increasing trend for their productivity since 1985. Around 50% of these dynamics can be explained by the amount of pre-winter precipitation with a delay of two years. We explain this delay through the buffering effect of watershed soils. The cyclic variability of alas hydro-ecosystems strongly affects the local agriculture, which is based on horse and cattle breeding. We estimate that these alas grasslands can provide enough forage supply for local communities. However, the real alas yield is several times less than the theoretical value because of grassland degradation that is caused by recent thermokarst and waterlogging in the most productive phytocenosis.

TI  - InSAR and GPS derived coseismic deformation and fault model of the 2017 Ms7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake in the Northeast Bayanhar block
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 8 August 2017, a Ms7.0 earthquake stroke the city of Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, China. The Jiuzhaigou earthquake occurred on a buried fault in the vicinity of three well-known active faults and this event offers a unique opportunity to study tectonic structures in the epicentral region and stress transferring. Here we present coseismic displacement field maps for this earthquake using descending and ascending Sentinel-1A Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. Deformation covered an area of approximately 50 x 50 km, with a maximum line-of-sight (LOS) displacement of similar to 22 cm in ascending and similar to 14 cm in descending observations on the west side of the source fault. Based on InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, both separately and jointly, we constructed a one-segment model to invert the coseismic slip distribution and dip angle of this event. Our final fault slip model suggests that slip was concentrated at an upper depth of 15 km; there was a maximum slip of similar to 1.3 m and the rupture was dominated by a left-lateral strike-slip motion. The inverted geodetic moment was approximately 6.75 x 10(18) Nm, corresponding to a moment magnitude of Mw6.5, consistent with seismological results. The calculated static Coulomb stress changes indicate that most aftershocks occurred in stress increasing zones caused by the mainshock rupture; the Jiuzhaigou earthquake has brought the western part of the Tazang fault 0.1-0.4 MPa closer to failure, indicating an increasing seismic hazard in this region. The Coulomb stress changes caused by the 2008 Mw7.8 Wenchuan earthquake suggest that stress loading from this event acted as a trigger for the Jiuzhaigou earthquake.

TI  - Changes in global vegetation activity and its driving factors during 1982-2013
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation activity plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and climate. Many studies have examined recent changes in vegetation growth and the associated local climatic drivers. They revealed a global greening trend during the recent decades. However, few studies have analyzed how remote oceanic conditions affect land vegetation growth through atmospheric teleconnection, and the causes of the recent greening needs further investigation. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal variations (including trends) of vegetation activity using satellite data of growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIgs), and examine their relationship to local and remote climate oscillations and external anthropogenic forcing by statistical means. As expected, there is an increasing trend in global-mean NDVIgs from 1982-2013, with significant greening over Europe and many other land areas. NDVIgs is temperature-limited at northern high-latitudes, but water-limited in arid and semi-arid regions, and radiation-limited in the Amazon and eastern and southern Asia. Globally, El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the leading climatic driver of interannual variability of NDVIgs, especially over southern and eastern Africa, eastern Australia, northeastern Asia, and northern South America. Consistent with previous modeling studies, a regression-based attribution analysis suggests that historical anthropogenic forcing (mainly increases in greenhouse gases) explains about two thirds of the NDVIgs trend from 1982 to 2013, with the rest coming mainly from the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). Contributions to the recent NDVIgs trend from ENSO and Pacific decadal variability and Artctic Oscillation appear to be small.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of an ecological water diversion project on water consumption through high-resolution estimations of actual evapotranspiration in the downstream regions of the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological Water Diversion Projects (EWDPs) have been implemented in several endorheic river basins in the arid region of northwest China since the beginning of the new millennium to restore the deteriorated ecosystems. However, the effects of these EWDPs are difficult to evaluate quantitatively. Here, we assessed changes in water use in Ejin Oasis in the downstream region of the Heihe River Basin, which is a typical endorheic river basin in northwest China, based on the estimated evapotranspiration (ET) during the growing season (May to October) in 2000 (before the EWDP) and 2014 (after the EWDP). The ET estimates were based on the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land (M-SEBAL) model and Landsat images. The estimated ET was validated against observations using eddy covariance towers installed on different landscapes in 2014 and was found to have a root mean square error of 1.20 mm day(-1) and a coefficient of determination of 0.67 at the footprint scale on satellite overpass days. The estimated ETs in two years were also compared with another remote sensing product that showed a similar spatial pattern, with a spatial mean difference of 4 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The estimated ET was then used to evaluate the impact of the EWDP on water consumption. The ET over different land use and land cover types increased, with a mean increase of 52% over the 15 years of the implementation of the EWDP in Ejin Oasis. The water consumption in Ejin Oasis in 2014 was approximately twice that in 2000. Among the changes, water consumption by croplands increased significantly, with a maximum increase of 264% because of cropland expansion and increased ET. The increases in water consumption by forests and grasslands were 60% and 25%, respectively. The lake area expanded drastically (from 0 to 37.46 km(2)), and the corresponding water consumption caused by evaporation was zero in 2000 and approximately 3.9 x 10(7) m(3) from May to October in 2014. This work demonstrates that estimates of the ET based on remote sensing can be used as reliable indicators for comprehensive assessments of the impacts of the EWDPs.

TI  - Feasibility of intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes with 89-zirconium-labelled nanocolloidal albumin PET-CT and a handheld high-energy gamma probe
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy using Zr-89-nanocolloidal albumin has the potential to improve the preoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), especially if located in the near proximity of the primary tumour. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy followed by intraoperative detection of Zr-89-nanocolloidal albumin containing SLNs with the use of a handheld high-energy gamma probe.Methods: PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy was performed after peritumoural injection of Zr-89-nanocolloidal albumin in five patients with oral cavity carcinoma planned for surgical resection. SLN biopsy procedure was performed 18 h later. SLNs were detected using detailed information of PET/CT and the high-energy gamma probe.Results: In all patients, SLNs were identified on PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy. Intraoperative detection using the high-energy gamma probe was possible in 10 of 13 SLNs, at a short distance from the SLN.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that intraoperative detection of SLNs containing Zr-89-nanocolloidal albumin using a handheld high-energy gamma probe is feasible, but its clinical use and sensitivity seem to be limited.

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal variability of <i>C</i>-factor derived from remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is an important phenomenon that contributes to the degradation of agricultural land. Even though it is a natural process, human activities can significantly increase its impact on land degradation and present serious limitation on sustainable agricultural land use. Nowadays, the risk of soil erosion is assessed either qualitatively by expert assessment or quantitatively using model-based approach. One of the primary factors affecting the soil erosion assessment is a cover-management factor, C-factor. In the Czech Republic, several models are used to assess the C-factor on a long-term basis based on data collected using traditional tabular methods. This paper presents work to investigate the estimation of both long-term and short-term cover-management factors using remote sensing data. The results demonstrate a successful development of C-factor maps for each month of 2014, growing season average, and annual average for the Czech Republic. C-factor values calculated from remote sensing data confirmed expected trend in their temporal variability for selected crops. The results presented in this paper can be used for enhancing existing methods for estimating C-factor, planning future agricultural activities, and designing technical remediations and improvement activities of land use in the Czech Republic, which are also financially supported by the European Union funds.

TI  - Potential of hyperspectral remote sensing to estimate the yield of a <i>Crambe</i> <i>abyssinica</i> Hochst crop
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of research is to evaluate the relationship between vegetation indices obtained in different phenological phases by hyperspectral sensors and crambe grain yield. The study was conducted in the winter crop season in 2015 in an experimental agricultural area in the city of Cascavel, Parana. Spectral information about 12 random points were acquired during all phenological phases of the crambe crop. The data collected were separated into different spectral bands. Then, the vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) were generated. Remote sensing data were correlated with grain yield, and linear regression models were elaborated and evaluated. At 66 days after sowing (DAS), in the beginning of the flowering phase, the NDMI presented a negative correlation with grain yield (R-adj(2) : 0.49; RMSE: 134.80 kg ha(-1)). The red-light region (648 to 672 nm) at 66 DAS presented a positive linear correlation with grain yield (R-adj(2) : 0.36; RMSE: 151.38 kg ha(-1)). The flowers in the canopy of the plant during the flowering phase contributed to the increase of the reflectance in the red-light and midinfrared regions. Excessive precipitation and winds during flowering, granulation, and maturation led to grain damage and yield variability, reducing the explanatory capacity of the production with the models.

TI  - Total ozone trends from 1979 to 2016 derived from five merged observational datasets - the emergence into ozone recovery
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on updated trends using different merged datasets from satellite and ground-based observations for the period from 1979 to 2016. Trends were determined by applying a multiple linear regression (MLR) to annual mean zonal mean data. Merged datasets used here include NASA MOD v8.6 and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) merge v8.6, both based on data from the series of Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (SBUV) and SBUV-2 satellite instruments (1978-present) as well as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-type Total Ozone (GTO) and GOME-SCIAMACHY-GOME-2 (GSG) merged datasets (1995-present), mainly comprising satellite data from GOME, the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIA-MACHY), and GOME-2A. The fifth dataset consists of the monthly mean zonal mean data from ground-based measurements collected at World Ozone and UV Data Center (WOUDC). The addition of four more years of data since the last World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ozone assessment (2013-2016) shows that for most datasets and regions the trends since the stratospheric halogen reached its maximum (similar to 1996 globally and similar to 2000 in polar regions) are mostly not significantly different from zero. However, for some latitudes, in particular the Southern Hemisphere extratropics and Northern Hemisphere subtropics, several datasets show small positive trends of slightly below +1% decade 1 that are barely statistically significant at the 2 sigma uncertainty level. In the tropics, only two datasets show significant trends of +0.5 to +0.8% decade(-1), while the others show near-zero trends. Positive trends since 2000 have been observed over Antarctica in September, but near-zero trends are found in October as well as in March over the Arctic. Uncertainties due to possible drifts between the datasets, from the merging procedure used to combine satellite datasets and related to the low sampling of ground-based data, are not accounted for in the trend analysis. Consequently, the retrieved trends can be only considered to be at the brink of becoming significant, but there are indications that we are about to emerge into the expected recovery phase. However, the recent trends are still considerably masked by the observed large year-toyear dynamical variability in total ozone.

TI  - 21st Century drought-related fires counteract the decline of Amazon deforestation carbon emissions
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical carbon emissions are largely derived from direct forest clearing processes. Yet, emissions from drought-induced forest fires are, usually, not included in national-level carbon emission inventories. Here we examine Brazilian Amazon drought impacts on fire incidence and associated forest fire carbon emissions over the period 2003-2015. We show that despite a 76% decline in deforestation rates over the past 13 years, fire incidence increased by 36% during the 2015 drought compared to the preceding 12 years. The 2015 drought had the largest ever ratio of active fire counts to deforestation, with active fires occurring over an area of 799,293 km(2). Gross emissions from forest fires (989 +/- 504 Tg CO2 year(-1)) alone are more than half as great as those from old-growth forest deforestation during drought years. We conclude that carbon emission inventories intended for accounting and developing policies need to take account of substantial forest fire emissions not associated to the deforestation process.

TI  - Evaluation of atmospheric profiles derived from single- and zero-difference excess phase processing of BeiDou radio occultation data from the FY-3C GNOS mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Occultation Sounder (GNOS) is one of the new-generation payloads onboard the Chinese FengYun 3 (FY-3) series of operational meteorological satellites for sounding the Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. The GNOS was designed for acquiring setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou System (BDS) and the US Global Positioning System (GPS). An ultra-stable oscillator with 1s stability (Allan deviation) at the level of 10(-2) was installed on the FY-3C GNOS, and thus both zero-difference and single-difference excess phase processing methods should be feasible for FY-3C GNOS observations. In this study we focus on evaluating zero-difference processing of BDS RO data vs. single-difference processing, in order to investigate the zero-difference feasibility for this new instrument, which after its launch in September 2013 started to use BDS signals from five geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites, five inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellites and four medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites. We used a 3-month set of GNOS BDS RO data (October to December 2013) for the evaluation and compared atmospheric bending angle and refractivity profiles, derived from single-and zero-difference excess phase data, against co-located profiles from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses. We also compared against co-located refractivity profiles from radiosondes. The statistical evaluation against these reference data shows that the results from single-and zero-difference processing are reasonably consistent in both bias and standard deviation, clearly demonstrating the feasibility of zero differencing for GNOS BDS RO observations. The average bias (and standard deviation) of the bending angle and refractivity profiles were found to be about 0.05 to 0.2% (and 0.7 to 1.6 %) over the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Zero differencing was found to perform slightly better, as may be expected from its lower vulnerability to noise. The validation results indicate that GNOS can provide, on top of GPS RO profiles, accurate and precise BDS RO profiles both from single-and zero-difference processing. The GNOS observations by the series of FY-3 satellites are thus expected to provide important contributions to numerical weather prediction and global climate change analysis.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing reveals a positive impact of living oyster reefs on microalgal biofilm development
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing (RS) is routinely used for the large-scale monitoring of microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass in intertidal mudflats and has greatly improved our knowledge of MPB spatio-temporal variability and its potential drivers. Processes operating on smaller scales however, such as the impact of benthic macrofauna on MPB development, to date remain underinvestigated. In this study, we analysed the influence of wild Crassostrea gigas oyster reefs on MPB biofilm development using multispectral RS. A 30-year time series (1985-2015) combining high-resolution (30 m) Landsat and SPOT data was built in order to explore the relationship between C. gigas reefs and MPB spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Emphasis was placed on the analysis of a before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment designed to assess the effect of oyster killing on the surrounding MPB biofilms. Our RS data reveal that the presence of oyster reefs positively affects MPB biofilm development. Analysis of the historical time series first showed the presence of persistent, highly concentrated MPB patches around oyster reefs. This observation was supported by the BACI experiment which showed that killing the oysters (while leaving the physical reef structure, i.e. oyster shells, intact) negatively affected both MPB biofilm biomass and spatial stability around the reef. As such, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of nutrient input as an explanation for the MPB growth-promoting effect of oysters, whereby organic and inorganic matter released through oyster excretion and biodeposition stimulates MPB biomass accumulation. MPB also showed marked seasonal variations in biomass and patch shape, size and degree of aggregation around the oyster reefs. Seasonal variations in biomass, with higher NDVI during spring and autumn, were consistent with those observed on broader scales in other European mudflats. Our study provides the first multi-sensor RS satellite evidence of the promoting and structuring effect of oyster reefs on MPB biofilms.

TI  - Increased West Antarctic and unchanged East Antarctic ice discharge over the last 7 years
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice discharge from large ice sheets plays a direct role in determining rates of sea-level rise. We map present-day Antarctic-wide surface velocities using Landsat 7 and 8 imagery spanning 2013-2015 and compare to earlier estimates derived from synthetic aperture radar, revealing heterogeneous changes in ice flow since similar to 2008. The new mapping provides complete coastal and inland coverage of ice velocity north of 82.4 degrees S with a mean error of < 10 m yr(-1), resulting from multiple overlapping image pairs acquired during the daylight period. Using an optimized flux gate, ice discharge from Antarctica is 1929 +/- 40 Gigatons per year (Gt yr(-1)) in 2015, an increase of 36 +/- 15 Gt yr(-1) from the time of the radar mapping. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and Marguerite Bay on the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 88% of this increase. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have been remarkably constant over the period of observation. Including modeled rates of snow accumulation and basal melt, the Antarctic ice sheet lost ice at an average rate of 183 +/- 94 Gt yr(-1) between 2008 and 2015. The modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years is contrasted by high rates of ice sheet mass loss and distinct spatial patters of elevation lowering. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing high rates of mass loss and displays distinct patterns of elevation lowering that point to a dynamic imbalance. We find modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years, which suggests that the recent pattern of mass loss in Antarctica is part of a longer-term phase of enhanced glacier flow initiated in the decades leading up to the first continent-wide radar mapping of ice flow.

TI  - Predicting decadal trends in cloud droplet number concentration using reanalysis and satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is the key state variable that moderates the relationship between aerosol and the radiative forcing arising from aerosolcloud interactions. Uncertainty related to the effect of anthropogenic aerosol on cloud properties represents the largest uncertainty in total anthropogenic radiative forcing. Here we show that regionally averaged time series of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed CDNC of low, liquid-topped clouds is well predicted by the MERRA2 reanalysis near-surface sulfate mass concentration over decadal timescales. A multiple linear regression between MERRA2 reanalyses masses of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), sea salt (SS), and dust (DU) shows that CDNC across many different regimes can be reproduced by a simple power-law fit to near-surface SO4, with smaller contributions from BC, OC, SS, and DU. This confirms previous work using a less sophisticated retrieval of CDNC on monthly timescales. The analysis is supported by an examination of remotely sensed sulfur dioxide (SO2) over maritime volcanoes and the east coasts of North America and Asia, revealing that maritime CDNC responds to changes in SO2 as observed by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI). This investigation of aerosol reanalysis and top-down remote-sensing observations reveals that emission controls in Asia and North America have decreased CDNC in their maritime outflow on a decadal timescale.

TI  - A harmonic spline magnetic main field model for Southern Africa combining ground and satellite data to describe the evolution of the South Atlantic Anomaly in this region between 2005 and 2010
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - CHAMP satellite and relatively densely spaced ground-based data measured over southern Africa between 2005 and 2010 are combined in a new regional, harmonic spline based, core field model. This new SACFM-2 model is compared to the regional SARM model, which is based only on satellite data, and the global CHAOS-6 model. The results agree well in the vertical (Z) component, with somewhat larger differences in the horizontal components. The Z component and total intensity F are used to investigate the evolution of the South Atlantic Anomaly in this region. The computed maps of main field of the Z component and total intensity F show a steady decrease in the field over the years during the study period, indicating the evolution of the South Atlantic Anomaly over southern Africa and suggesting an increase in the area of this feature.

TI  - Comparison between influenza coded primary care consultations and national influenza incidence obtained by the General Practitioners Sentinel Network in Portugal from 2012 to 2017
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is associated with severe illness, death, and economic burden. Sentinel surveillance systems have a central role in the community since they support public health interventions. This study aimed to describe and compare the influenza-coded primary care consultations with the reference index of influenza activity used in Portugal, General Practitioners Sentinel Network, from 2012 to 2017. An ecological time-series study was conducted using weekly R80-coded primary care consultations (according to the International Classification of Primary Care-2), weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence rates from the General Practitioners Sentinel Network and Goldstein Index (GI). Good accordance between these three indicators was observed in the characterization of influenza activity regarding to start and length of the epidemic period, intensity of influenza activity, and influenza peak. A high correlation (>0.75) was obtained between weekly ILI incidence rates and weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations during all five studied seasons. In 3 out of 5 seasons this correlation increased when weekly ILI incidence rates were multiplied for the percentage of influenza positive cases. A cross-correlation between weekly ILI incidence rates and the weekly number of R80-coded primary care consultations revealed that there was no lag between the rate curves of influenza incidence and the number of consultations in the 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. In the last three seasons, the weekly influenza incidence rates detected the influenza epidemic peak for about a week earlier. In the last season, the GI anticipated the detection of influenza peak for about a two-week period. Sentinel networks are fundamental elements in influenza surveillance that integrate clinical and virological data but often lack representativeness and are not able to provide regional and age groups estimates. Given the good correlation between weekly ILI incidence rate and weekly number of R80 consultations, primary care consultation coding system may be used to complement influenza surveillance data, namely, to monitor regional influenza activity. In the future, it would be interesting to analyse concurrent implementation of both surveillance systems with the integration of all available information.

TI  - Spatial Variability in Patterns of Glacier Change across the Manaslu Range, Central Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses changes in glacier area, velocity, and geodetic mass balance for the glaciers in the Manaslu region of Nepal, a previously undocumented region of the Himalayas. We studied changes between 1970 (for select glaciers), 2000, 2005, and 2013 using freely available Landsat satellite imagery, the SRTM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a DEM based on Worldview imagery. Our results show a complex pattern of mass changes across the region, with glaciers lowering on average by 0.25 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) between 2000 and 2013 which equates to a geodetic mass balance of -0.21 +/- 0.16m w.e.a(-1). Over approximately the same time period (1999 to 2013) the glaciers underwent a 16.0% decrease in mean surface velocity over their debris-covered tongues as well as a reduction in glacier area of 8.2%. The rates of glacier change appear to vary between the different time periods, with glacier losses increasing in most cases. The glaciers on Manaslu itself underwent a change in surface elevation of -0.46 +/- 0.03m a(-1) between 1970 and 2000 and -0.99 +/- 0.08m a(-1) between 2000 and 2013. Rates of glacier area change for the same glaciers increased from-0.36 km(2) a(-1) between 1970 and 2001 to -2.28 km(2) a(-1) between 2005 and 2013. Glacier change varies across the region and seems to relate to a combination of glacier hypsometry, glacier elevation range and the presence and distribution of supraglacial debris. Lower-elevation, debris-free glaciers with bottom-heavy hypsometries are losing most mass. As the glaciers in the Manaslu region continue to stagnate, an accumulation and thickening of the debris-cover is likely, thereby insulating the glacier and further complicating future glacier responses to climate.

TI  - Mortality estimates among adult patients with severe acute respiratory infections from two sentinel hospitals in southern Arizona, United States, 2010-2014
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: From October 2010 through February 2016, Arizona conducted surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) among adults hospitalized in the Arizona-Mexico border region. There are few accurate mortality estimates in SARI patients, particularly in adults >= 65 years old. The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality.Methods: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models.Results: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital. Mortality increased to 12% (30/258, 30% increase) when electronic vital records and a 30-day post-hospitalization time frame were used. Being age >= 65 years (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6-9.9) and having an intensive care unit admission (OR = 7.4; 95% CI: 3.0-17.9) were independently associated with mortality.Conclusion: The use of electronic vital records increased SARI-associated mortality estimates by 30%. These findings may help guide prevention and treatment measures, particularly in high-risk persons in this highly fluid border population.
