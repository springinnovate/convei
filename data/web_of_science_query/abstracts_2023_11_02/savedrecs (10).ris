TI  - The underappreciated importance of solar radiation in constraining spring phenology of temperate ecosystems in the Northern and Eastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spring phenology of temperate ecosystems is highly sensitive to climate change, generating various impacts on many important terrestrial surface biophysical processes. Although various prognostic models relying on environmental variables of temperature and photoperiod have been developed for spring phenology, comprehensive ecosystem-scale evaluations over large landscapes and long-time periods remain lacking. Further, environmental variables other than temperature and photoperiod might also importantly constrain spring phenology modelling but remain under-investigation. To address these issues, we leveraged around 20-years datasets of environmental variables (from Daymet and GLDAS products) and the spring phenology metric (i.e., the greenup date) respectively derived from MODIS and PhenoCams across 108 sites in the Northern and Eastern United States. We firstly cross-compared MODIS-derived greenup date with official PhenoCams product with high accuracy (R2 = 0.70). Then, we evaluated the three prognostic models (i.e., Growing Degree Date (GDD), Sequential (SEQ) and optimality-based (OPT)) with MODIS-derived spring phenology, assessed the model residuals and their associations with soil moisture, rainfall, and solar radiation, and revised the two photoperiod-relevant models (SEQ, OPT) by replacing the daylength variable with solar radiation, which was found to contribute the most to model residuals. We found that 1) all models demonstrated good capability in characterizing spring phenology, with OPT performing the best (RMSE = 8.04 +/- 5.05 days), followed by SEQ (RMSE = 10.57 +/- 7.77 days) and GDD (RMSE = 10.84 +/- 8.42 days), 2) all models displayed high model residuals showing tight correlation with solar radiation (r = 0.45-0.75), and 3) the revised models that included solar radiation significantly performed better with an RMSE reduction by 22.08%. Such results are likely because solar radiation better constrains early growing season plant photosynthesis than photoperiod, supporting the hypothesis of spring phenology as an adaptive strategy to maximize photosynthetic carbon gain (approximated by solar radiation) while minimizing frost damage risk (captured by temperature). Collectively, our study reveals the underappreciated importance of solar radiation in constraining spring phenology of temperate ecosystems, and suggests ways to improve spring phenology modelling and other phenology-related ecological processes.

T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Yield predictions prior to harvesting crops is significant for agricultural decision-making. This study aimed to predict rice yield at the stage prior to harvesting using crops and soil phenological properties in the Pathein District of Myanmar. Remote sensing imagery data derived from Sentinel-2A satellite imageries during the month of November at the stage prior to harvest of rice fields were collected and analyzed from 2016 to 2021. Four vegetation indices (VIs): (i) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (ii) normalized difference water index (NDWI), (iii) soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (iv) rice growth vegetation index (RGVI) were specified as independent variables for a rice yield prediction model, after which simple and multiple linear regression models were estimated and validated. The accuracy of the estimated models was assessed using observed data from 1790 ground reference points (GRPs) in rice-yielding croplands. The average observed rice yield over 6 years was 1.57 tons per acre, and the average rice yield predictions over 6 years were 1.28, 1.48, 1.28, and 1.17 per acre with simple linear regression models from NDVI, NDWI, SAVI and RGVI, respectively. On the other hand, THE observed rice yield was 1.49 tons per acre with a multiple regression model. This indicates that prediction by the multiple regression model with four vegetation indices is superior to predictions by all other linear regression models. The early predicted yield data is useful for rice-growing farmers to compare expenses against losses after any extreme climatic event.

TI  - Temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation coverage and their influencing factors in the Sugan Lake wetland on the northern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important indicator of the development or reversal of salt marsh due to its absence in arid desert areas. Many studies have emphasized the differences in factors that affect fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in different temporal and spatial scales. However, few studies have reported on the temporal and spatial variations in vegetation coverage and their response to climate and also on the hydrological environment in inland salt marsh wetlands. Accordingly, based on a wetland community survey, different types of data, such as meteorological data, hydrological data, and Landsat remote sensing image data, recorded during the period from 1990 to 2020 were collected. The characteristics of the spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation coverage in the Sugan Lake wetland over the past 30 years were analyzed using a binary pixel model. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis on the response of vegetation coverage to hydrological and meteorological factors was undertaken. The results of the present study showed that the dimidiate pixel model had a high simulation accuracy in retrieving the vegetation coverage in inland salt marsh wetlands. The vegetation coverage of the Sugan Lake wetland increased with each year from 1990 to 2020, and its annual average was 19.34%. The spatial distribution of vegetation coverage was patchy and decreased from the center to the edge of the wetland. Within the same period, the vegetation coverage showed an increasing trend in Quan-shui and He-hong areas and a decreasing trend in the Shan-hong area. Vegetation coverage was mainly affected by various factors, such as precipitation, lake area, surface runoff, groundwater depth, and residential density, respectively. It was significantly positively correlated with precipitation (R-2 = 0.56, P < 0.01), lake area (R-2 = 0.50, P < 0.01), air temperature (R-2 = 0.46, P < 0.01), and river system density (R-2 = 0.52, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with groundwater depth (R (2) =-0.57, P < 0.01) and residential density (R-2 = -0.38, P < 0.05). Implicit in these findings are complex mechanisms of change in vegetation coverage that help prevent the degradation of vegetation in fragile ecosystems.

TI  - Assessing the potential of temperature/vegetation index space to infer soil moisture over Ganga Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil Moisture (SM) is a critical parameter for land-atmosphere interaction, measuring drought conditions in agricultural areas, and it can significantly affect surface water and agricultural production. Based on remote sensing observations, the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) can be generated to evaluate SM at a large spatial scale. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Vegetation Index (VI) plots are generated to obtain the triangular/trapezoidal space to calculate TVDI. For the present study, TVDI was calculated by using LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for a period of three years (2017, 2018, and 2019) over the Ganga Basin. The applicability of the TVDI at soil depths of 0-10, 10-40, 40-100, and 100-200 cm was also examined. The result from the study indicates that, a better correlation is obtained between TVDI generated using EVI and SM compared to TVDI generated using NDVI. Temporal variation of TVDI with SM shows that TVDI (EVI) almost captures the maximum and minimum SM variation in most locations. Also, SM at 10-40 cm shows a better negative correlation (r close to -0.5) with TVDI (EVI) than 0-10 cm depth for the summer season. The result thus reveals the potential of TVDI in assessing SM especially in summer season, while using EVI as the vegetation index.

TI  - Model for calculating local bearing capacity of concrete with spiral stirrups
T2  - CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the mechanical and failure modes of 30 concrete specimens under local compression. The experimental results indicate that the specimens undergo three types of local compressive failure modes. These modes primarily depend on the strengths of the tensile and compression regions. Based on the test results, a calculation model for the local bearing capacity of concrete with spiral stirrups Fl is formulated. In the model, the local compressive failure of concrete with spiral stirrups is classified into tension and compression. The yielding of spiral stirrups in the tensile region is regarded as tensile failure, and compressive failure is considered to have occurred when the strain value in the compression region reaches 0.002. To simplify the model calculation, the spacings, diameter d, and yield strength fy of spiral stirrup as well as the local compression area ratio Ab/Al (ratio of the concrete bearing area Ab to the loading area Al) are comprehensively analyzed. Based on the analysis results, a formula for the bearing capacity of the reinforcement Ns is derived. The independent variables of the formula are yield force of spiral stirrup fyAssl, stirrup spacings, and ratio of specimen side length to loading plate side length h/a. A simplified formula for calculating the tensile failure of the specimen is derived. To ensure simultaneous tensile and compressive failures, a critical reinforcement ratio of the spiral stirrup rho vu is proposed based on the calculation model. Test data from similar axial local compression tests are collected to verify the accuracy of the calculation model. The local bearing capacity of concrete is recalculated according to the calculation method proposed in this study. Results show that the calculation model is highly accurate. Accordingly, it may be used as reference for calculating the local bearing capacity.

TI  - Harvesting the Landsat archive for land cover land use classification using deep neural networks: Comparison with traditional classifiers and multi-sensor benefits
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat archive, with a multi-decadal global coverage is a prime candidate for deep learning classification methods due to the large data volume. Local studies have evaluated deep learning methods on Landsat obser-vations. However, these models often saturate at high accuracies due to limited reference dataset size thus do not fully explore the potential of deep classifiers. Furthermore, no provisions are taken to investigate algorithmic performance of challenging classification areas. To address these shortcomings in this research, Landsat 5, 7 and 8 observations were combined within the continental United States to create one of the largest to date reference dataset containing about 21 million labeled annual temporal sequences. Difficult to classify reference samples were isolated by examining labelsin the immediate vicinity. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deep learners were integrated to capture temporal and spatial relationships, respec-tively. Classification mapping accuracy was contrasted with a commonly implemented large-scale mapping method, the Random Forest (RF).Results indicate substantial classification improvements of deep learning methods (DLMs) over the RF. These improvements are more pronounced on challenging to classify pixels in heterogenous areas. RF classification accuracy reaches about 70% on average, while DLMs are at 86%-95% range, depending on model architecture. Grass and bare land classes show the highest accuracy improvements, from 65.5% and 63.5%, respectively for the RF to the 79.4%-96.3% range for the DLMs. Our work also examined the practical value of having two, instead of one, Landsat sensors. Results indicate substantial classification increases (7%-10% in average F1 ac-curacy) suggesting that having two concurrent Landsat sensors is important not only for redundancy but also for improved mapping capabilities.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of the microbiome-host response to pharmaceuticals and pesticides in<i> Mytilus</i><i> galloprovincialis</i> farmed in the Northwestern Adriatic Sea
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine mussels, especially Mytilus galloprovincialis, are well-established sentinel species, being naturally resistant to the exposure to multiple xenobiotics of natural and anthropogenic origin. Even if the response to multiple xenobiotic ex-posure is well known at the host level, the role of the mussel-associated microbiome in the animal response to environ-mental pollution is poorly explored, despite its potential in xenobiotic detoxification and its important role in host development, protection, and adaptation. Here, we characterized the microbiome-host integrative response of M. galloprovincialis in a real-world setting, involving exposure to a complex pattern of emerging pollutants, as occurs in the Northwestern Adriatic Sea. A total of 387 mussel individuals from 3 commercial farms, spanning about 200 km along the Northwestern Adriatic coast, and in 3 different seasons, were collected. Multiresidue analysis (for quantitative xenobiotic determination), transcriptomics (for host physiological response), and metagenomics (for host-associated microbial taxonomical and functional features) analyses were performed on the digestive glands. Ac-cording to our findings, M. galloprovincialis responds to the presence of the complex pattern of multiple emerging pol-lutants - including the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and tetracycline, the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor, and the insecticide N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide - integrating host defense mechanisms, e.g., through upreg-ulation of transcripts involved in animal metabolic activity, and microbiome-mediated detoxification functions, in-cluding microbial functionalities involved in multidrug or tetracycline resistance. Overall, our data highlight the importance of the mussel-associated microbiome as a strategic player for the orchestration of resistance to the multixenobiotic exposure at the holobiont level, providing strategic functionalities for the detoxification of multiple xenobiotic substances, as occurring in real world exposure settings. Complementing the host with microbiome-dependent xenobiotic degradative and resistance genes, the M. galloprovincialis digestive gland associated microbiome can have an important role in the detoxification of emerging pollutants in a context of high anthropogenic pressure, supporting the relevance of mussel systems as potential animal-based bioremediation tool.

M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems mostly originates from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and such a situation can be responsible for significant negative impacts on natural ecosystems, such as estuarine and coastal areas. Bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals, namely antibiotics, in exposed organisms is known to have remarkable effects on different trophic levels of non-target organisms such as algae, invertebrates and vertebrates, including the emergence of bacterial resistance. Bivalves are a highly appreciated seafood product, as they are fed by filtering water, and can bioconcentrate chemicals, being ideal for biomonitoring environmental health hazards in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. To use this sentinel species, an analytical strategy was developed to be used in accessing antibiotics, from human and veterinary medicine, and evaluate their occurrence as emerging pollutants in aquatic environments. The optimized analytical method was fully validated according to the European requirements defined by the Commission Implementing Regulation 2021/808. The validation comprised the following parameters: specificity, selectivity, precision, recovery, ruggedness, linearity, and the decision limit CCa, as well as the limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ). The method was validated for 43 antibiotics to allow their quantification in both contexts, environmental biomonitoring and food safety.

TI  - Unified building change detection pre-training method with masked semantic annotations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building change detection (CD) using remote sensing images plays a vital role in urban development, and deep learning models attracted attention for their potential to accomplish CD tasks automatically. However, most methods are still facing challenges, such as the costly and time-consuming process of constructing CD datasets and the severely imbalanced distribution of positive and negative samples preventing loss functions from functioning as desired in the training process. Inspired by weak supervision have demonstrated excellent performance in solving the above-mentioned problems, a unified change detection pre-training paradigm is proposed to accomplish the CD task using a small number of samples and improve the inference accuracy of building change detection. The keys of this proposed method are as follows. First, the pre-training paradigm detects building changes using pseudo-labels and them generated by highly available semantic segmentation datasets. Second, a balanced sample distribution is ensured by using the proposed method for semantic masked building areas and controlling the proportion of the areas. Third, multi-task networks for simultaneous building extraction and change detection are used in the proposed unified paradigm, owing to the semantic information can be employed as an effective supervision signal to assist with the CD training to solve the problem that pseudo-labels adversely affect the ability of the algorithm to converge. In particular, experiments were performed on three challenging datasets. For aerial WHU-CD and satellite Gaofen Challenge-CD datasets, our pre-trained weights generated with pseudo-bitemporal samples were applied to subsets containing different proportions of ground truth for fine-tuning, respectively. Notably, 10% of ground truth for fine-tuning with our pre-trained weights obtained intersection over union (IoU) comparable to that obtained using 100% of the CD ground truth without our pre-trained weights, whereas an even greater IoU was achieved using 30% of ground truth with our pre-trained weights. Experiments demonstrated that the performance of our method based on a small number of samples was superior to that of conventional supervised learning methods. When conducting experiments with 100% ground truth, the results showed that the use of our pre-trained weights yields IoU that substantially exceeds that of conventional supervised learning methods. The results of experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD dataset proved the excellent transferable performance of our method. The proposed method can greatly reduce the need for high-quality CD labels and alleviate bottlenecks caused by an imbalanced distribution. Moreover, our method can improve CD accuracy and has excellent generalization capabilities.

TI  - Evaluation and application analysis of kilometer-scale convective parameters derived from a statistical downscaling method over Central China
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thunderstorms are usually accompanied by heavy precipitation and other disasters. Therefore, it is very important to study the thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms that control the occurrence and development of storms. However, the relatively coarse resolution of the reanalysis may limit the evaluation and application of its derived convective parameters at regional and local scales, especially in high mountains. Given that the effect of grid averaging on ERA5 can be well-reflected in the monthly mean, the paper proposes a methodological framework to achieve the statistical downscaling of convective parameters (SDCP). After the convection-related variables are decomposed, we introduce a multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model and take the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as explanatory variables to improve the spatial resolution of monthly-scale convective parameters. The convective parameters chosen for the downscaling experiments are closely related to thunderstorm occurrence, involving instability, moisture, and wind shear. ERA5 and SDCP datasets' quality is evaluated based on measurements available from 11 radiosonde stations over 10 years. We also explore the climatology of thunderstorm environments and the corresponding trends. The results show that the accuracy of the SDCP data obtains additional added value in complex-terrain areas. Compared with ERA5, the downscaled results have a finer spatial structure. A strong but spatially and scale-varying relationship exists between the monthly mean convective parameter and the resampled NDVI and DEM. Considering the very high predictive ability of the MGWR model, the performance of the SDCP algorithm mainly depends on the accuracy of the ERA5 data. Our study demonstrates the possibility of high spatial resolution land surface features observed by remote sensing satellites in improving the spatial resolution of thermodynamic parameters.

TI  - Analysis of Hydrometeorological Trends and Drought Severity in Water-Demanding Mediterranean Islands under Climate Change Conditions
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has emerged as a problem in recent years, and its effects will likely continue to increase in the future. Several scientific studies conducted in the Mediterranean region have demonstrated relatively stationary trends for annual precipitation and significant upward trends for mean annual temperature. These trends present several implications, especially in the Greek islands that serve as major summer tourist destinations where the population is already unable to meet their water demands. The aim of this study is to investigate both long- and short-term variations in temperature and precipitation on three Greek islands in the Mediterranean Sea (Mykonos, Naxos, and Kos). The temperature and rainfall trends, as well as their magnitudes at yearly, seasonal, and monthly time steps, were determined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was employed to identify the drought periods. According to the results, precipitation slightly increased (almost stationary) in the three islands, although this rise was not statistically significant. All three islands experienced a sharp and statistically significant increase in their mean annual air temperatures. The region may experience drought episodes as a result of the high temperature increase, which would drastically reduce the amount of water, available for use due to the increased evapotranspiration. For the Mediterranean region, the necessity for a drought management strategy to stop or diminish the severity of drought episodes and their effects has grown into a matter of great concern. It is crucial to take measures and conduct relevant research in order to create the conditions for adaptation and mitigation of climate change consequences and the increased appearance of drought phenomena.

TI  - Comparative observation of common tracers in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer and a study on simplifying its surgical procedure
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMany breast cancer patients have avoided axillary lymph node dissection after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). During the SLNB operation, the color of lymphatic vessels is sometimes poor and so finding them is difficult. This study observed the tracing effects of three tracer combinations and also reported our experience in simplifying the SLNB program. MethodsIn total, 123 breast cancer patients whose TNM stage was cT1-2N0M0 were retrospectively studied. According to the tracer used, the patients were divided into the carbon nanoparticle (CNP) group (38 cases), CNP combined with methylene blue (CNP + MB) group (41 cases), and indocyanine green combined with MB (ICG + MB) group (44 cases). All 123 breast cancer cases were also classified into the non-tracking group (53 cases) and tracking group (70 cases) according to the SLNB operation process. The non-tracking group looked for the stained sentinel lymph nodes directly, while the tracking group looked for the stained lymph nodes along the lymphatic vessels. ResultsThe SLN identification rates in the CNP, CNP + MB, and ICG + MB groups were 97.4%, 97.6%, and 95.5% respectively (P > 0.05). The average number of SLNs detected was 4.92 +/- 2.06, 5.12 +/- 2.18, and 4.57 +/- 1.90, respectively (P > 0.05). The ideal display rates of lymphatic vessels in the three groups were 86.8%, 87.8%, and 93.2%, respectively (P > 0.05). The SLN identification rates in the non-tracking and tracking groups were 96.2% and 97.1%, respectively (P > 0.05). The average number of SLNs detected were 5.73 +/- 1.76 and 5.70 +/- 1.93, respectively (P > 0.05), and the average operation time was 16.47 +/- 5.78 and 27.53 +/- 7.75 min, respectively (P < 0.05). ConclusionThis is the first study to observe the application effect of CNP combined with MB and ICG combined with MB tracers in SLNB of breast cancer patients. No significant difference was observed among the patients in SLN identification and lymphatic vessel display. Omitting the step of searching for lymphatic vessels in SLNB surgery does not reduce the surgical effect, but the reduced operating steps can reduce the surgical time and theoretically reduce postoperative complications.

AB  - I discuss whether animism, the worldview that (some) objects, plants and animals are capable of communication, rational reflection and intentional action, is in conflict with contemporary science. I distinguish two conflicts. The first points to conflicting claims regarding the abilities of objects, plants and animals made by scientists and animists (agential vs. non-agential). I argue that the alleged conflict can be diffused by noting that science and animism advance different ways of looking at the world. The second conflict notes discrepancies between how animists treat nature and all therein (with respect and reverence) and how science does (instrumentalized). I argue that this conflict is more difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.

TI  - Urban effects on local cloud patterns
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization extensively modifies surface roughness and properties, impacting regional climate and hydrological cycles. Urban effects on temperature and precipitation have drawn considerable attention. These associated physical processes are also closely linked to clouds' formation and dynamics. Cloud is one of the critical components in regulating urban hydrometeorological cycles but remains less understood in urban-atmospheric systems. We analyzed satellite-derived cloud patterns spanning two decades over 447 US cities and quantified the urban-influenced cloud patterns diurnally and seasonally. The systematic assessment suggests that most cities experience enhanced daytime cloud cover in both summer and winter; nocturnal cloud enhancement prevails in summer by 5.8%, while there is modest cloud suppression in winter nights. Statistically linking the cloud patterns with city properties, geographic locations, and climate backgrounds, we found that larger city size and stronger surface heating are primarily responsible for summer local cloud enhancement diurnally. Moisture and energy background control the urban cloud cover anomalies seasonally. Under strong mesoscale circulations induced by terrains and land-water contrasts, urban clouds exhibit considerable nighttime enhancement during warm seasons, which is relevant to strong urban surface heating interacting with these circulations, but other local and climate impacts remain complicated and inconclusive. Our research unveils extensive urban influences on local cloud patterns, but the effects are diverse depending on time, location, and city properties. The comprehensive observational study on urban-cloud interactions calls for more in-depth research on urban cloud life cycles and their radiative and hydrologic implications under the urban warming context.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics of Reference Evapotranspiration and Relative Moisture Index in Heilongjiang Investigated through Remote Sensing Tools
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is one of the significant parameters in agricultural irrigation, especially in Heilongjiang, a big agricultural province in China. In this research, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of evapotranspiration (ET), relative moisture index (MI) and influencing factors of ET0 in Heilongjiang, which was divided into six ecology districts according to landforms, were analyzed with meteorological data observed over 40 years from 1980 and MOD16 products from 2000 to 2017 using Morlet wavelet analysis and partial correlation analysis. The results indicated that (1) the spatial distribution of ET and PET in Heilongjiang in humid, normal and arid years showed a distribution of being higher in the southwest and lower in the northwest, and higher in the south and lower in the north. The PET was higher than ET from 2002 to 2017, and the difference was small, indicating that the overall moisture in Heilongjiang was sufficient in these years. (2) In the last 40 years, the ET0 increased while the annual MI decreased. The annual minimum of MI in the six regions of Heilongjiang was -0.25, showing that all six regions were drought free. (3) The importance of the meteorological factors affecting ET0 was ranked as average relative humidity > average wind speed > sunshine duration. This research provides scientific guidance for the study of using remote sensing to reverse ET.

TI  - Delineation Evaluation and Variation of Debris-Covered Glaciers Based on the Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images, Take Glaciers in the Eastern Tomur Peak Region for Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a particular type of alpine glacier, debris-covered glaciers are essential for local water resources and glacial disaster warnings. The Eastern Tomur Peak Region (EPTR) is the most concentrated glacier in Tien Shan Mountain, China, where the glaciers have not been studied in detail. This paper evaluates the delineation accuracy of Landsat8 OLI, Sentinel-1A, and GF images for debris-covered glaciers in the EPTR. Each image uses the most advanced delineation method for itself to minimize the error of inherent resolutions. The results show that the accuracy of these images for delineating debris-covered glaciers is very high, and the F1 scores are expressed as 96.73%, 93.55%, and 95.81%, respectively. Therefore, Landsat images were selected to analyze the area change of EPTR from 2000 to 2022 over a 5-year time scale. The results indicate that glaciers of the EPTR decreased by 19.05 km(2) from 2000 to 2020, accounting for 1.9% (0.08% a(-1)), and debris increased by 10.8%, which validates the opinion that the presence of debris inhibits glacier melting. The most varied time was 2010-2022, but it was much less than other Tien Shan regions. The lower glacier ablation rate in this area results from the combined effect of decreased bare ice and increased debris. The main reason for the change in debris-covered glaciers is the increase in temperature.

TI  - Mapping the forage nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents of alpine grasslands by integrating Sentinel-2 and Tiangong-2 data
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents are crucial quality indicators for forage in alpine natural grasslands and are closely related to plant growth and reproduction. One of the greatest challenges for the sustainable utilization of grassland resources and the development of high-quality animal husbandry is to efficiently and accurately obtain information about the distribution and dynamic changes in N, P, and K contents in alpine grasslands. A new generation of multispectral sensors, the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and Tiangong-2 moderate-resolution wide-wavelength imager (MWI), is equipped with several spectral bands suitable for specific applications, showing great potential for mapping forage nutrients at the regional scale. This study aims to achieve high-accuracy spatial mapping of the N, P, and K contents in alpine grasslands at the regional scale on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Sentinel-2 MSI and Tiangong-2 MWI data, coupled with multiple feature selection algorithms and machine learning models, are applied to develop forage N, P, and K estimation models from data collected at 92 sample sites ranging from the vigorous growth stage to the senescent stage. The results show that the spectral bands of both the Sentinel-2 MSI and Tiangong-2 MWI have an excellent performance in estimating the forage N, P, and K contents (the R-2 values are 0.68-0.76, 0.54-0.73, and 0.74-0.82 for forage N, P, and K estimations, respectively). Moreover, the model integrating the spectral bands of these two sensors explains 78%, 74%, and 84% of the variations in the forage N, P, and K contents, respectively. These results indicate that the estimation ability of forage nutrients can be further improved by integrating Tiangong-2 MWI and Sentinel-2 MSI data. In conclusion, integration of the spectral bands of multiple sensors is a promising approach to map the forage N, P, and K contents in alpine grasslands with high accuracy at the regional scale. This study offers valuable information for growth monitoring and real-time determination of forage quality in alpine grasslands.

TI  - The Estimation of Maize Grain Protein Content and Yield by Assimilating LAI and LNA, Retrieved from Canopy Remote Sensing Data, into the DSSAT Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of remote sensing data into mechanistic models of crop growth has become an available method for estimating yield. The objective of this study was to explore an effective assimilation approach for estimating maize grain protein content and yield using a canopy remote sensing data and crop growth model. Based on two years of field experiment data, the remote sensing inversion model using assimilation intermediate variables, namely leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA), was constructed with an R-2 greater than 0.80 and a low root-mean-square error (RMSE). The different data assimilation approaches showed that when the LAI and LNA variables were used together in the assimilation process (VLAI+LNA), better accuracy was achieved for LNA estimations than the assimilation process using single variables of LAI or LNA (V-LAI or V-LNA). Similar differences in estimation accuracy were found in the maize yield and grain protein content (GPC) simulations. When the LAI and LNA were both intermediate variables in the assimilation process, the estimation accuracy of the yield and GPC were better than that of the assimilation process with only one variable. In summary, these results indicate that two physiological and biochemical parameters of maize retrieved from hyperspectral data can be combined with the crop growth model through the assimilation method, which provides a feasible method for improving the estimation accuracy of maize LAI, LNA, GPC and yield.

TI  - PSI Spatially Constrained Clustering: The Sibari and Metaponto Coastal Plains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PSI data are extremely useful for monitoring on-ground displacements. In many cases, clustering algorithms are adopted to highlight the presence of homogeneous patterns; however, clustering algorithms can fail to consider spatial constraints and be poorly specific in revealing patterns at lower scales or possible anomalies. Hence, we proposed a novel framework which combines a spatially-constrained clustering algorithm (SKATER) with a hypothesis testing procedure which evaluates and establishes the presence of significant local spatial correlations, namely the LISA method. The designed workflow ensures the retrieval of homogeneous clusters and a reliable anomaly detection; to validate this workflow, we collected Sentinel-1 time series from the Sibari and Metaponto coastal plains in Italy, ranging from 2015 to 2021. This particular study area is interesting due to the presence of important industrial and agricultural settlements. The proposed workflow effectively outlines the presence of both subsidence and uplifting that deserve to be focused and continuous monitoring, both for environmental and infrastructural purposes.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation with High-Resolution Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's high-resolution images are supplied by a radar system named Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Semantic SAR image segmentation proposes a computer-based solution to make segmentation tasks easier. When conducting scientific research, accessing freely available datasets and images with low noise levels is rare. However, SAR images can be accessed for free. We propose a novel process for labeling Sentinel-1 SAR radar images, which the European Space Agency (ESA) provides free of charge. This process involves denoising the images and using an automatically created dataset with pioneering deep neural networks to augment the results of the semantic segmentation task. In order to exhibit the power of our denoising process, we match the results of our newly created dataset with speckled noise and noise-free versions. Thus, we attained a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 70.60% and overall pixel accuracy (PA) of 92.23 with the HRNet model. These deep learning segmentation methods were also assessed with the McNemar test. Our experiments on the newly created Sentinel-1 dataset establish that combining our pipeline with deep neural networks results in recognizable improvements in challenging semantic segmentation accuracy and mIoU values.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry Mapping on Horseshoe Island, Antarctic Peninsula, with Open-Source Satellite Images: Evaluation of Atmospheric Correction Methods and Empirical Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is the process of estimating water depth in shallow coastal and inland waters using satellite imagery. Recent advances in technology and data processing have led to improvements in the accuracy and availability of SDB. The increased availability of free optical satellite sensors, such as Landsat missions and Sentinel 2 satellites, has increased the quantity and frequency of SDB research and mapping efforts. In addition, machine learning (ML)- and deep learning (DL)-based algorithms, which can learn to identify features that are indicative of water depth, such as color or texture variations, have started to be used for extracting bathymetry information from satellite imagery. This study aims to produce an initial optical image-based SBD map of Horseshoe Island's shallow coasts and to perform a comprehensive and comparative evaluation with Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite images. Our research considers the performance of empirical SDB models (classical, ML-based, and DL-based) and the effects of the atmospheric correction methods ACOLITE, iCOR, and ATCOR. For all band combinations and depth intervals, the ML-based random forest and XGBoost models delivered the highest performance and best fitting ability by achieving the lowest error with MAEs smaller than 1 m up to 10 m depth and a maximum correlation of R-2 around 0.80. These models are followed by the DL-based ANN and CNN models. Nonetheless, the non-linearity of the reflectance-depth connection was significantly reduced by the ML-based models. Furthermore, Landsat 8 showed better performance for 10-20 m depth intervals and in the entire range of (0-20 m), while Sentinel 2 was slightly better up to 10 m depth intervals. Lastly, ACOLITE, iCOR, and ATCOR provided reliable and consistent results for SDB, where ACOLITE provided the highest automation.

TI  - Inferring slip-surface geometry and volume of creeping landslides based on InSAR: A case study in Jinsha River basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The slip-surface geometry and volume of landslides are fundamental for landslide modeling and mechanism interpretation. The movement of a landslide, which is generally controlled by the slip-surface geometry, can be obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. However, there is a lack of a general approach for inferring the slip-surface geometry and volume of landslides through the InSAR-derived deformation field. Here we developed a geometry-based method to determine the landslide slip-surface geometry and volume using InSAR measurements and applied it to the Jinsha River Basin, a landslide-prone area that poses a significant threat to residents and infrastructure. Through the InSAR-derived displacement, topography, and Google Earth images, 50 creeping landslides were identified in the study area. Based on the displacement field, the landslide slip-surface slope was inverted under the assumption that the landslide displacement was parallel to the slip-surface. Then the two-dimensional slip-surface depths and volumes of selected landslides were inferred using the slip-surface slope. Comparisons with the in-situ data suggest that the results obtained in this study are reliable. The mapped landslides in the study area have depths of approximately 16-160 m along the central axis and volumes ranging from 483,412 to 135,789,944 m(3). The derived volume-area relationship and 2D slip-surface depth suggest that deep-seated landslide is a major landslide type in the study area. We conclude that our method can infer the slip-surface geometry of creeping landslides based on InSAR observation and our results have improved the understanding of the landslide mechanisms in the Jinsha River Basin, China.

TI  - TRPA1 channel in the airway underlies protection against airborne threats by modulating respiration and behaviour
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), a member of the TRP superfamily of cation channels, is broadly expressed in sensory neural pathways, including the trigeminal neurons innervating the nasal cavity and vagal neurons innervating the trachea and the lung. TRPA1 acts as a detector of various irritant chemicals as well as hypoxia and hyperoxia. For the past 15 years, we have characterised its role in respiratory and behavioural modulation in vivo using Trpa1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. Trpa1 KO mice failed to detect, wake up from sleeping, and escape from formalin vapour and a mild hypoxic (15% O-2) environment. Respiratory augmentation induced by mild hypoxia was absent in either Trpa1 KO mice or WT mice treated with a TRPA1 antagonist. Irritant gas introduced into the nasal cavity inhibited respiratory responses in WT mice but not in the KO mice. The effect of TRPA1 on the olfactory system seemed minimal because olfactory bulbectomized WT mice reacted similarly to the intact mice. Immunohistological analyses using a cellar activation marker, the phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, confirmed activation of trigeminal neurons in WT mice but not in Trpa1 KO mice in response to irritant chemicals and mild hypoxia. These data collectively show that TRPA1 is necessary for multiple chemical-induced protective responses in respiration and behaviour. We propose that TRPA1 channels in the airway may play a sentinel role for environmental threats and prevent incoming damage.

TI  - Bandpass Alignment from Sentinel-2 to Gaofen-1 ARD Products with UNet-Induced Tile-Adaptive Lookup Tables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful launching of more satellites in recent years has made data fusion an important and promising task because it can significantly increase the temporal frequency of the resulting time series data. To improve the usability of Gaofen-1 analysis ready data (GF1-ARD), Sentinel-2 (S2) is selected to enhance the temporal resolution of GF1-ARD due to their similar characteristics and short revisit period. Before constructing a denser time series from different platforms, bandpass alignment is required. Most researchers implement bandpass alignment using the linear model. However, the transformed bands of S2 by the linear model cannot match GF1-ARD well due to the limited globally shared parameters. In contrast, local-derived lookup tables (LUTs) can better address this problem. Inspired by the powerful capability of deep learning, we develop a model based on the U-shaped network (UNet) to learn tile-adaptive LUTs. Specifically, the LUTs are adaptively learned from the histogram of the S2 tile. Given that the bandpass alignment can be viewed as a histogram matching process, the expected LUTs are believed to be highly correlated with the input histogram. In addition, a simple convolutional module is further introduced to address the pixel-level misregistration. We have created a large-scale dataset and conducted extensive experiments on it to evaluate the competitive performance of the proposed model. Meanwhile, extensive visualizations are generated to illustrate the mechanism of our model. Furthermore, the temporal frequency of S2 and GF1-ARD is thoroughly assessed to demonstrate that bandpass alignment can significantly improve the temporal resolution of GF1-ARD.

TI  - Analysis of Pre-Earthquake Ionospheric Anomalies in the Japanese Region Based on DEMETER Satellite Data
T2  - UNIVERSE
M3  - Article
AB  - The electron density (N-e), ion density (N-i), and electron temperature (T-e) statistics recorded by the DEMETER satellite payload ISL (Instrument Sonde de Langmuir) were used to study the disturbance characteristics of the ionosphere before solid earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher in Japan during the summer of 2005-2009, to provide more information and methods for the coupling mechanism and short-range earthquake prediction. In this paper, the region of +/- 10 degrees of the epicenter is divided into 1 degrees x 1 degrees pixels, and the background field of each parameter is constructed using data without earthquakes and relatively calm space weather. We also define a measure of the perturbation intensity of ionospheric parameters relative to the background field during the occurrence of earthquakes. The analysis results of the four Japanese earthquakes from space and time show an excellent synchronization in the time and area of the anomalies in ionospheric parameters of the four cases. All four instances showed N-e abnormalities, and three showed N-i and T-e anomalies, in which N-e and N-i increased or decreased abnormally, while T-e increased abnormally every time, and the anomalies mainly occurred about 9-12 days before the earthquake. This paper eliminates the influence of solar, geomagnetic, and satellite data defects on the experimental results as much as possible in data screening and method selection. The results partially agree with the conclusions reported in the existing literature, and the obtained anomalies are somewhat related to the ionospheric precursors of earthquakes.

AB  - Remote sensing is an important tool for the quantitative estimation of forest carbon stock. This study presents a multiscale, object-based method for the estimation of aboveground carbon stock in Moso bamboo forests. The method differs from conventional pixel-based approaches and is more suitable for Chinese forest management inventory. This research indicates that the construction of a SPOT-6 multiscale hierarchy with the 30 scale as the optimal segmentation scale achieves accurate information extraction for Moso bamboo forests. The producer's and user's accuracy are 88.89% and 86.96%, respectively. A random generalized linear model (RGLM), constructed using the multiscale hierarchy, can accurately estimate carbon storage of the bamboo forest in the study area, with a fitting and test accuracy (R-2) of 0.74 and 0.64, respectively. In contrast, pixel-based methods using the RGLM model have a fitting and prediction accuracy of 0.24 and 0.01, respectively; thus, the object-based RGLM is a major improvement. The multiscale object hierarchy correctly analyzed the multiscale correlation and responses of bamboo forest elements to carbon storage. Objects at the 30 scale responded to the microstructure of the bamboo forest and had the strongest correlation between estimated carbon storage and measured values. Objects at the 60 scale did not directly inherit the forest information, so the response to the measured carbon storage of the bamboo forest was the smallest. Objects at the 90 scale serve as super-objects containing the forest feature information and have a significant correlation with the measured carbon storage. Therefore, in this study, a carbon storage estimation model was constructed based on the multiscale characteristics of the bamboo forest so as to analyze correlations and greatly improve the fitting and prediction accuracy of carbon storage.

TI  - Modeling the impact of urbanization and climate changes on terrestrial vegetation productivity in China by a neighborhood substitution analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a vital role in global carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems and could be affected by climate changes and human activities. In the current context of rapid urban expansion, understanding the impacts of urbanization and climate changes on net primary productivity (NPP) is helpful to sequester more atmospheric carbon and achieve carbon neutrality. We explored the terrestrial spatio-temporal NPP dynamics in China during the years 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, respectively, using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model based on multi-source remote sensing data. We then proposed a neighborhood substitution model to isolate the effects of urbanization and climate changes on NPP and examined the driving forces for the NPP update. The results revealed that while urbanization was likely to reduce NPP, averagely by 48.57 Tg C and 50.13 Tg C in the two stages, climate changes improved NPP by 97.71 Tg C and 92.46 Tg C, respectively, indicating that the climate changes offset the reduced vegetation productivity from rapid urbanization. The results highlighted that the rapidly urbanizing process reduced vegetation productivity due to the lost vegetated land and degraded vegetation productivity. In addition, the residual effect other than urbanization and the climate changes also played a part on the degraded vegetation carbon sequestration, reducing NPP by an average of 4.29 Tg C year(-1) and 3.94 Tg C year(-1 )in the two stages, which could be related to other human activities. We recommend protecting vegetation cover and making informed land use plan as means to improve carbon sequestration in the context of rapid urban expansion and climate changes.

TI  - Evaluating Impacts of Opencast Stone Mining on Vegetation Primary Production and Transpiration over Rajmahal Hills
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast mining has significantly triggered vegetation degradation in many ecologically sensitive regions across the globe. The detailed spatio-temporal information on mining-induced vegetation degradation and associated primary production loss are crucial inputs to authorities and policymakers to frame and implement sustainable development programs in the mining regions to conserve vegetation ecology. Thus, the present study aimed to decipher the mining-induced vegetation cover and subsequent productivity losses over the Rajmahal Hills in Jharkhand (India). The Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Net Primary Productivity (NPP), and Vegetation Transpiration (VT) datasets were used for analyzing the mines-induced losses in vegetation cover and associated productivity. The key findings indicated a loss of vegetation cover by similar to 340 km(2) and an expansion of the mining area by similar to 54 km(2) over the Rajmahal Hills during 1990-2020. The change detection analysis at the decadal period revealed that similar to 3.06 km(2), 8.10 km(2), and 22.29 km(2) of vegetation cover were lost only due to the mining activity during 2000-2010, 2010-2020, and 2000-2020, respectively. The replacement of vegetation cover by mining area has caused GPP loss of 0.01 tonnes carbon (tC) per day, 0.04 tC/day, and 0.09 tC/day; NPP loss of similar to 1.25 tC, 2.77 tC, and 7.27 tC; VT loss of 5200 mm/day, 13,630 mm/day, and 30,190 mm/day during 2000-2010, 2010-2020, and 2000-2020, respectively. Hence, the present study revealed that the mining-induced vegetation losses have caused an alteration of carbon sequestration, carbon stock, and VT over the Rajmahal Hills.

TI  - Geospatial Assessment of Long-Term Changes (1937-2019) in Mangrove Vegetation and Shoreline Dynamics of Godavari Estuary, East Coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Godavari mangroves are the second largest mangrove ecoregion of India located on its eastern coast. Mangroves perform major ecological functions including shoreline stabilization and coastal protection. They have undergone serious alterations, largely induced by human activities resulting in increased vulnerability to coastal flooding. A reliable database on mangroves distribution and temporal changes is essential for their effective management and conservation. Present study analyzes the long-term changes in mangroves, as well as the geomorphological changes along the coast of Godavari Estuary over a span of 82 years (1937-2019), using topographical maps, remotely sensed multi-temporal satellite imageries for five time periods. Results indicated that the rate of land uses conversions of agricultural fields, degraded areas, mudflats and mangrove vegetation into aquaculture significantly increased during the late 1990s. About 40 percent of it was constructed on mangrove areas between 1980 and 2019. The area under aquaculture was estimated to be 6,388.62 ha in 2000, almost doubling-up to 11,924.67 ha in 2019. Mangrove cover in this region increased by 15.95 percent between 2000 and 2019 (including 11.9 percent in Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary) due to increased protection, consequent regeneration and accretion. Shift in Hope Island spit was observed in north and northwest directions, gradually growing nearly 3.84 km. High-resolution declassified satellite data were found very helpful for long-term mangrove mapping and analyzing geomorphological changes; enabling a better understanding of these regions to help decision makers/planners to find better solutions to existing coastal issues. The paper concludes with some recommendations to restore and conserve the existing mangrove cover in the study area.

TI  - Emerging Issues in Mapping Urban Impervious Surfaces Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban impervious surface (UIS) is a key parameter in climate change, environmental change, and sustainability. UIS extraction has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. However, high-resolution impervious surface mapping is a long-term need. There is an urgent requirement for impervious surface mapping from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In this paper, we compare current extraction methods in terms of extraction units and extraction models and summarize their strengths and limitations. We discuss the challenges in impervious surface estimation from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery in terms of selection of spatial resolution, spectral band, and extraction method. The uncertainties caused by clouds and snow, shadows, and vegetation occlusion are also analyzed. Automated sample labeling and remote sensing domain knowledge are the main directions in impervious surface extraction using deep learning methods. We should also focus on using continuous time series of high-resolution imagery and multi-source satellite imagery for dynamic monitoring of impervious surfaces.

TI  - Population monitoring of trisomy 21: problems and approaches
T2  - MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is the most common autosomal aneuploidy among newborns. About 90% result from meiotic nondisjunction during oogenesis, which occurs around conception, when also the most profound epigenetic modifications take place. Thus, maternal meiosis is an error prone process with an extreme sensitivity to endogenous factors, as exemplified by maternal age. This contrasts with the missing acceptance of causal exogenous factors. The proof of an environmental agent is a great challenge, both with respect to ascertainment bias, determination of time and dosage of exposure, as well as registration of the relevant individual health data affecting the birth prevalence. Based on a few exemplary epidemiological studies the feasibility of trisomy 21 monitoring is illustrated. In the nearer future the methodical premises will be clearly improved, both due to the establishment of electronic health registers and to the introduction of non-invasive prenatal tests. Down syndrome is a sentinel phenotype, presumably also with regard to other congenital anomalies. Thus, monitoring of trisomy 21 offers new chances for risk avoidance and preventive measures, but also for basic research concerning identification of relevant genomic variants involved in chromosomal nondisjunction.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current geostationary satellite images have a time resolution of minutes. It is not clear how useful they are for detecting diurnal and seasonal changes. We tested this by comparing lake surface temperatures (LSTs) from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) images with in situ measurements in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan, for one year. LST products of the Sentinel-3 satellites were also compared. We found that instantaneous LSTs can be estimated with an root mean square difference (RMSE) of 0.6 degrees C. A large amount of data (N = 10(2)-10(3)) is available for each month, but N differs greatly in the range of 216-2771. A good agreement (RMSE of 0.9 degrees C) was found between monthly mean LSTs from Himawari-8 and in situ measurements, and it is better than the RMSE of 1.2-1.7 degrees C found for the Sentinel-3 LST products. The diurnal change detection was more difficult due to insufficient data numbers around noon. Practical remedies for this issue are suggested.

TI  - Estimation and Spatiotemporal Evolution Analysis of Actual Evapotranspiration in Turpan and Hami Cities Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate inversion of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) at a regional scale is crucial for understanding water circulation, climate change, and drought monitoring. In this study, we produced a 1 km monthly ETa dataset for Turpan and Hami, two typical arid cities in northwest China, using multi-source remote sensing data, reanalysis information, and the ETMonitor model from 1980 to 2021. We analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of ETa using various statistical approaches and discussed the impact of climate and land use and cover changes (LUCC) on ETa. The results show the following: (1) the estimation results correlate well with ETa products on monthly scales (coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.85, root mean square error (RMSE) < 15 mm/month) with high reliability. (2) The ETa values were spatially distributed similarly to precipitation and LUCC, with the multi-year (1980-2021) average of 66.31 mm and a slightly fluctuating downward trend (-0.19 mm/a). (3) During the 42-year period, 63.16% of the study area exhibited an insignificant decrease in ETa, while 86.85% experienced pronounced fluctuations (coefficient of variation (CV) > 0.20), and 78.83% will show an upward trend in the future. (4) ETa was significantly positively correlated with precipitation (94.17%) and insignificantly positively correlated with temperature (55.81%). The impact of human activities showed an insignificant decreasing trend (85.41%). Additionally, the intensity of ETa varied considerably among land types, with the largest for cropland (424.12 mm/a). The results of the study have implications for promoting the rational allocation of regional water resources and improving water use efficiency in arid zones.

TI  - Optimisation of AquaCrop backscatter simulations using Sentinel-1 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In preparation for active microwave-based data assimilation into a crop modeling system, the mapping of daily 1-km AquaCrop model (v6.1) biomass and surface soil moisture to backscatter was optimised, using two forward operators, i.e. the Water Cloud Model (WCM) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). Both forward operators were calibrated (2014-2018) with 1-km Sentinel-1 backscatter (gamma degrees) observations in VV and VH polarisation, for three different study domains in Europe. For the validation period (2019-2021), the gamma degrees simulations showed reasonable performances around Czech Republic and the Iberian Peninsula, to good performances over Belgium, but with strong variations within each domain. The domain-averaged root mean square difference between the model and Sentinel-1 gamma degrees remained below 2 dB for both forward operators and all three study domains, and the mean bias for VV remained close to 0 dB, and close 0.5 dB for the VH polarisation. The WCM and SVR performed better in VV than VH and overall the SVR performed slightly better in mapping the AquaCrop soil moisture and vegetation to backscatter than the WCM. Additionally, the assumed linear relationship in the WCM between soil moisture and soil gamma degrees holds better for VV than for VH. The remaining differences between WCM or SVR simu-lations and Sentinel-1 observations are mainly caused by AquaCrop model errors.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of NDVI and Its Influencing Factors Based on the ESTARFM in the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Loess Plateau is ecologically vulnerable. Vegetation is the key factor in ecological improvement. The study of the distribution patterns of vegetation and its impact factors has important guiding meaning for ecological construction in the region. The existing single sensor cannot provide long-term and high-resolution data. We established data of NDVI with a great spatial resolution by fusing the GIMMS NDVI and the MODIS NDVI based on the ESTARFM. Furthermore, we analyzed the variation in NDVI under different topographies and its response to climatic factors and human activities in the Loess Plateau. The results manifested that: (1) The fused NDVI by the ESTARFM had a high correlation with the MODIS NDVI and can be used in subsequent studies. (2) The multi-year average NDVI of this region ranged from 0.027 to 0.973, which is specifically low in the northwest and high southeast. The NDVI manifested an upward trend in the last 31 years. Its growth rate was 0.0036/a (p < 0.01). Spatially, the area with an upward trend of NDVI accounted for 89.48% of the plateau. (3) For topography, the larger area with the extremely significant upward of NDVI was found at elevations of 500-1500 m, with slopes of 6-15 degrees. The larger area with the extremely significant downward trend of NDVI was found at an elevation of higher than 3000 m, with a slope of greater than 35 degrees. (4) The response of the NDVI to the climatic factors manifested a significant spatial heterogeneity. The temperature had a more significant impact on NDVI than precipitation. (5) Human activities contributed more to NDVI than climatic factors (65.22% for human activities and 34.78% for climatic factors). Among them, the area with a high contribution of human activities to NDVI increase was consistent with the area where the GGP was implemented. The distribution of areas with high contribution of human activities to NDVI decrease was in line with that of the provincial capital cities. The results served as the theoretical foundation for assessing the efficacy of environmental stewardship and for optimizing ecological restoration measures.

T2  - HISTORY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - From the 1950s and onwards, Pierre Parlebas developed an original approach to education, which over time has spread beyond the borders of France. This study focuses on how Parlebas was led to develop the concept of an 'alter-education of sport' and analyses those concepts through the lens of contemporary democratic societies. It will show how his involvement in community life influenced his work, and how much he was committed to promulgating the role that physical education has in improving community living. In the wake of the May 1968 protest movement in France, his main focus became the criticism of competition in sports. He has systematically prioritised mutual support and cooperation over competition and has worked to spread this idea worldwide. His democratic worldview, with its specific focus upon young people and physical practices, condemns all forms of oppression and calls upon others to do so as well.

T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aotearoa (New Zealand) is undertaking reforms in natural resource management, and there are promising signals that Indigenous perspectives will be included alongside science for decision-making. Any resource management system is underpinned by worldviews, from which values stem and then risk and uncertainty derive. Maori (the Indigenous peoples of New Zealand) and Eurocentric notions of risk and uncertainty are fundamentally different because knowledge holders have different worldviews. Eurocentric concepts of risk and uncertainty continue to frame policy, making it challenging for Maori knowledge to shape policy that is relevant for decision-making in Aotearoa. We explore Maori perspectives of risk and uncertainty and literature, identifying common attributes across natural resource management frameworks, and identify issues of risk and uncertainty from the perspective of Maori experts. We conclude that a Maori approach to enhancing natural resources is more aligned to current environmental policy compared with standard approaches for risk assessment and reducing uncertainty.

TI  - The optimal method for water quality parameters retrieval of urban river based on machine learning algorithms using remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Water eutrophication has become one of the prominent problems of environmental protection in inland watersheds. Turbidity, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations are key water quality parameters (WQPs) that reflect the level of water eutrophication in inland waters. Due to the complex interaction effects between different water quality in urban rivers, the water quality retrieval models still have the problem of single input features and poor applicability. This paper proposed a robust feature selection method based on machine learning and utilized Sentinel-2 remote sensing images for water quality retrieval of Chan and Ba rivers in Xi'an City. The ReliefF and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods (ReliefF-GSA) were used to select the optimal feature combination from the potential feature dataset. Based on the optimal feature combination, Random Forest regression (RFR), LightGBM and XGboost models were constructed for the three WQPs retrieval, respectively. The optimal models were then used to invert the three WQPs and the spatial-temporal variation of WQPs from January 2021 to January 2022 was analysed. The results show that (1) The RelieF-GSA method is suitable for high-dimensional feature filtration and enables optimal feature selection for specific WQPs retrieval. It is revealed that the BOI index (black odour water index) is the key feature for the retrieval of turbidity and TN concentration. (2) The RFR model was found to be better than other models and more appropriate for Chan and Ba rivers, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.90, 0.89 and 0.81, respectively. (3) It was found that the water qualities in the Chan and Ba rivers have prominent seasonal characteristics. Turbidity and TP concentrations showed higher, while TN concentration showed relatively low in autumn. The method and conclusions of this paper can further provide a reference for WPQs retrieval in urban rivers.

TI  - Spatiotemporal modeling of the value of carbon sequestration under changing land use/land cover using InVEST model: a case study of Nour-rud Watershed, Northern Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The current paper aims to assess the effects of landscape change in a mountain river basin in the north of Iran through quantifying, mapping, and assessing carbon storage. The analyses were performed based on previous alterations in land use and land cover (LULC) (1988-2018) and on expected changes determined by three LULC alteration setups for 2048. The Landsat imagery from 2018, 2008, 1998, and 1988 was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated using Land Change Modeler (LCM) module of TerrSet software for the years 2028, 2038, and 2048. Validation was carried out by overlaying the actual and projected to 2018 map. We integrated the Markov Chain (MC) and InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration (InVEST-CSS) models for simulating the ecosystem carbon storage and the long-term monetary valuation. In this process, we considered social costs/economic value because of the area's loss and gain of stored carbon. The results show that forests and rangelands with good and poor conditions decreased by 631.2, 10,374, and 10,254 ha, respectively, from 1988 to 2018. Overall, modeling and mapping LULC changes showed a descending trend in forests (0.66%), agriculture (0.1%), and rangelands (4.1%) in 2048. In addition, carbon storage has already been lost by 9.9 million tons (76.98 ha(-1)) from 1988 to 8.8 million tons (68.86 ha(-1)) in 2018 and is expected to have an 8.4 million tons (65.25 ha(-1)) loss by 2048. Monitoring the economic value of carbon storage from 1988 to 2018 shows a loss of $US 15684338 (121.8 ha(-1)) and estimates a loss of $US6972622 (54.18 ha(-1)) by 2048. Therefore, spatiotemporal design of InVEST model by estimating the carbon value over time focuses on continuous monitoring actions for both the carbon pools dynamic and LULC pattern. This consideration causes reduction the uncertainty of estimated models and also increases the continuous cost of those changes. This will help government and decision makers for long-term and accurate carbon sequestration strategies for ecosystem.

TI  - Evaluating the Consistency of Vegetation Phenological Parameters in the Northern Hemisphere from 1982 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology reflects the response mechanisms in ecology and climate change, so it is important that the parameters used to study vegetation phenology are accurate. Previous studies mainly focused on phenological changes. However, because the extraction methods used in those investigations led to inconsistencies in setting vegetation phenological parameters, a more accurate approach needs to be developed. To resolve this issue, we select five methods to extract the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) from the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI3g) data. The five chosen methods are the second-order derivative method (Method 1), the first-order derivative method (Method 2), the 0.2 dynamic threshold method (Method 3), the 0.5 dynamic threshold method (Method 4), and the fixed threshold method (Method 5). Our study area is the Northern Hemisphere (above 30 degrees N), and our study period is 1982 to 2015. After applying the five methods, we evaluate the consistency of the vegetation phenological parameters. The results show that (1) regardless of the method used, the average changes in phenological parameters are consistent; however, the SOS and EOS under Methods 1, 3 and 5 are up to 30 days earlier than those under Methods 2 and 4. (2) Under all five methods, the SOS trend mainly shows an advance, but the trend is substantially higher under Methods 1, 3 and 4 than under Methods 2 and 5 from 45 degrees N to 60 degrees N. The distribution of the EOS trend under different methods is consistent. (3) Under the tested extraction methods, the SOS trends of evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) and mixed forests (MF) have significant differences (p < 0.05), whereas, the EOS trend for different vegetation types is consistent. (4) By analysing the consistency of the phenological parameters between remote sensing data and ground data under different methods, we now know that Methods 3 and 4 are the most accurate for extracting the SOS and EOS, respectively. The above results can provide a reference for the accurate extraction of phenological parameters above 30 degrees N.

TI  - Intensity Analysis for Urban Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics Characterization of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso remain the two major urban centers in Burkina Faso with an increasing trend in human footprint. The research aimed at analyzing the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) dynamics in the two cities between 2003 and 2021 using intensity analysis, which decomposes LULC changes into interval, category and transition levels. The satellite data used for this research were composed of surface reflectance imagery from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 acquired from the Google Earth Engine Data Catalogue. The Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Gradient Tree Boost algorithms were employed to run supervised image classifications for four selected years including 2003, 2009, 2015 and 2021. The results showed that the landscape is changing in both cities due to rapid urbanization. Ouagadougou experienced more rapid changes than Bobo-Dioulasso, with a maximum annual change intensity of 3.61% recorded between 2015 and 2021 against 2.22% in Bobo-Dioulasso for the period 2009-2015. The transition of change was mainly towards built-up areas, which gain targeted bare and agricultural lands in both cities. This situation has led to a 78.12% increase of built-up surfaces in Ouagadougou, while 42.24% of agricultural land area was lost. However, in Bobo-Dioulasso, the built class has increased far more by 140.67%, and the agricultural land areas experienced a gain of 1.38% compared with the 2003 baseline. The study demonstrates that the human footprint is increasing in both cities making the inhabitants vulnerable to environmental threats such as flooding and the effect of an Urban Heat Island, which is information that could serve as guide for sustainable urban land use planning.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients After COVID-19 Vaccine
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - One of the side effects of vaccines used to end the COVID-19 epidemic is non-specifically enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Such lymphadenopathy detected during clinical examination of breast cancer patients may require additional imaging or interventional procedures that should not normally be performed. This study has been designed to estimate the incidence of palpable enlarged axillary lymph node in breast cancer patients who had received COVID-19 vaccination in the past 3 months in the same arm as compared to those without vaccination. Breast cancer patients admitted to M.U. Medical Faculty Breast polyclinic between January 2021 and March 2022 were screened, and clinical staging was performed after thorough clinical examination. Among these patients with suspected enlarged axillary lymph node and those undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), they were divided into two groups as vaccinated and unvaccinated. Age, menopausal status, tumor size, tumor location, surgery, pathology results, hormonal receptor status, and SLNB results were statistically compared with groups. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of age, menopause, tumor size, tumor location, surgery, pathological results, and hormone receptor status. The SLNB being reported as reactive only was 89.1% in the vaccinated group and 73.2% in the non-vaccinated group which was statistically significant different. Reactive lymph nodes were commonly found with an excess of 16% in patients who had received COVID-19 vaccination in the past 3 months. This required caution and additional examination of the axillary lymph nodes in this period.

TI  - User-Aware Evaluation for Medium-Resolution Forest-Related Datasets in China: Reliability and Spatial Consistency
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover data are fundamental to sustainable forest management and conservation. Available medium-resolution publicly shared forest-related datasets provide primary information on forest distribution. The evaluation of relevant datasets is of great importance to learn about the differences, characterize the accuracy, and provide a reference for rational use. This study presents an evaluation and analysis of the forest-related datasets in China around 2020, including TreeCover and the forest-related layer (latter referred to as the forest datasets) in WorldCover, Esri land cover, FROM-GLC10, GlobeLand30, and GLC_FCS30. These forest datasets, that are obtained by aggregating forest-related lasses based on the classification schemes, are analyzed from spatial consistency and accuracy comparison. The results illustrate that forest datasets with 10m resolution are generally more precise than those with 30m resolution in China. WorldCover shows the highest accuracy, with producer accuracy and user accuracy of 91.4% and 87.09%, respectively. These datasets exhibit high accuracy but great spatial inconsistency. The more consistent the regions are, the more accurate the accuracy is. High consistency (=5, i.e., classified into forests by five datasets) areas account for 56.49% of areas of forest classified (AFC), while the area of low consistency (=2) reach 25.51% of AFC. The analysis delves into the datasets, offering a reliable reference for the usage of these datasets.

TI  - A thermal radiation directionality correction method for the surface upward longwave radiation of geostationary satellite based on a time-evolving kernel-driven model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal radiation directionality (TRD) characterizes the anisotropic signature of most surface targets in the thermal infrared domain. It causes significant uncertainties in estimating surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) from space observations. In this regard, kernel-driven models (KDMs) are suitable to remove TRD effects from remote sensing dataset as they are computationally efficient. However, KDMs requires simultaneous multiangle observations as inputs to be well calibrated, which yields a difficulty with geostationary satellites as they can only provide a single-angle observation. To overcome this issue, we proposed a six-parameter time-evolving KDM that combines a four-parameter SULR diurnal variation model and a two-parameter TRD amplitude model to correct the TRD effect for single-angle estimated SULR dataset of geostationary satellites. The significant daytime TRD effect when solar zenith angle is within 60 degrees can be effectively eliminated. The modeling accuracy of the time-evolving KDM is evaluated using a simulated SULR dataset generated by the 3D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model; the TRD correction method based on the new time-evolving KDM is validated using a two-year single-angle estimated SULR dataset derived from data of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) against in situ measurements at 20 AmeriFlux sites. Results show that the proposed time-evolving KDM has a high accuracy with an R2 > 0.999 and a small RMSE = 1.5 W/m2; the TRD correction method based on the time-evolving KDM can greatly reduce the GOES-16 SULR uncertainty caused by the TRD effect with an RMSE decrease of 4.5 W/m2 (22.1%) and mean bias error decrease of 7.9 W/m2 (62.7%). Hence, the proposed TRD correction method is practically efficient for the operational TRD correction of SULR products generated from the geostationary satellites (e.g., GOES-16, FY-4A, Himawari-8, MSG).

TI  - The Sentinel Lymph Node in Treatment Planning: A Narrative Review of Lymph-Flow-Guided Radiotherapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel lymph node technique is minimally invasive and used routinely by surgeons, reducing the need for morbid extensive lymph node dissections, which is a significant advantage for cancer staging and treatment decisions. The sentinel lymph node could also help radiation oncologists to identify tumor drainage for each of their patients, leading to a more personalized radiotherapy, instead of a probabilistic irradiation based on delineation atlases. The aim is both to avoid recurrence in unexpected areas and to limit the volume of irradiated healthy tissues. The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of sentinel lymph node mapping for radiation oncologists. This concept, relying on sentinel lymph node mapping for treatment planning, is known as lymph-flow-guided radiotherapy. We present an up-to-date narrative literature review showing the potential applications of the sentinel lymph node technique for radiotherapy, as well as the limits that need to be addressed before its routine usage.

TI  - HABLAN: Multispectral and multiangular remote sensing of artificial light at night from high altitude balloons
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Some studies have established statistical links between Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) and the risk as-sociated with diseases such as hormone-dependent Cancers (HDC). These links have been identified in part under a yellowish lighting regime and with space-borne images that only detect light travelling up-ward and that are often blind to the blue or the shorter wavelengths of the visible spectrum. The use of colour images taken by astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) can detect the blue component of ALAN but it is still restricted to the upward light emissions. It may be expected that the light trav-elling near horizontal is even more correlated to HDC. Therefore, it is essential to develop multispectral and multiangular remote sensing techniques of ALAN. To achieve this, we suggested a new experiment to observe ALAN from the stratosphere during High Altitude Balloon (HAB) flights. The system use mul-tiple colour cameras to picture a city at different viewing angles and in the three RGB bands (Red, Green and Blue bands). The ultimate goal of the project is to provide better remote sensing data as inputs to numerical radiative transfer models. The model may then be used to infer health risks associated with ALAN. Stratospheric remote sensing makes it possible to measure large areas in a short period of time at low cost compared to space-borne methods. The system High Altitude Balloon Light At Night (HABLAN) was designed to achieve that goal. The first HABLAN experiments were carried out aboard balloon flights of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) as part of their STRATOS program. In this paper, we present the experimental concept of the HABLAN system and we show some preliminary results. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Delineating Polynya Area Using Active and Passive Microwave Sensors for the Western Ross Sea Sector of Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A polynya is an area of open water or reduced concentration of sea ice surrounded by either concentrated sea ice or land ice. They are often seen as sites of intense ocean-atmosphere heat exchange and as ice production factories. Given their importance, it is crucial to quantify the accuracy of satellite-derived polynya information. Polynyas in their early evolution phase are generally narrow and occur at scales likely too fine to be detected by widely used passive microwave (PMW) radiometric sensors. We derived 40 m scale polynya information over the western Ross Sea from high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 C-band data and examined discrepancies with larger-scale estimates. We utilized two automated algorithms, supervised (a rule-based approach) and unsupervised (a combination of texture analysis with k-means clustering), to accurately identify the polynya areas. We generated data for validation using Sentinel-1 data at instances where polynyas can be visually delineated. Results from PMW sensors (NSIDC and AMSR2) and SAR-based algorithms (rule-based and texture-based) are compared with manually delineated polynya areas obtained through Sentinel-1. Analysis using PMW sensors revealed that NSIDC overestimates larger polynyas and underestimates smaller polynyas compared to AMSR2. We were more accurately able to identify polynya presence and area using Sentinel-1 SAR observations, especially in clear cases and cases when PMW data miscalculates the polynya's presence. Of our SAR-based algorithms, the rule-based approach was more accurate than the texture-based approach at identifying clear polynyas when validated against manually delineated regions. Altogether, we emphasize the need for finer spatio-temporal resolution data for polynya studies.

TI  - Development of a map for land use and land cover classification of the Northern Border Region using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use and land cover study (LULC) play an essential role in regional socio-economic development and natural resource management to develop sustainable development in vegetation changes, water quantity and quality, land resources, and coastal management. This study uses remote sensing data to investigate LULC in the Northern Border Region (NBR) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of changes in LULC in the NBR over the past three decades. Remote sensing data from Landsat imagery between 1990 and 2022 were used to classify LULC types, and a time series analysis was performed using Landsat imagery to detect changes over time. The classification finds four main classes: bare land, built-up area, rocks, and vegetation. The results indicate a significant increase in urban development. The outcomes revealed that most urban-ization occurred in the outskirts of the cities, where previously there were bare soil lands. The main dri-vers of urbanization were population growth and economic development. These findings have important implications for city planning, the management of green spaces, and the sustainable development of cities. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used to perform the classification. The accuracy assessment demonstrated satisfactory results, with an overall accuracy of 92.6%. The study paves the way for further monitoring LULC changes in the NBR geographic location. The technique used was adequate to address the objectives of this study.(c) 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Within-field crop diversity and landscape complexity decrease the abundance of fall armyworm larvae in maize cropping systems
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition and spatial arrangement of multiple crop and non-crop habitats at a field and landscape levels have the potential to modify the abundance and structure of arthropod communities. In particular, semi-natural habitats can provide important life support functions to a range of natural enemies of agricultural pests. How such traits might affect generalist predators has poorly been considered in complex landscapes dominated by intercropping and trees within a mosaic of small-scale agricultural plots in Africa. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that crop diversity and landscape complexity in maize cropping systems decrease the abundance of crop pests through natural regulation by generalist predators. For this purpose, we monitored the fall armyworm abundance and predation of sentinel larvae by predatory ants across a set of maize fields with contrasted within-field crop diversity and abundance of semi-natural vegetation including trees and shrubs in their surrounding landscape. A negative effect of crop diversity and landscape complexity on FAW abundance, and a species-specific effect on ant abundance, were observed. However, no significant effect of ant abundance or

TI  - Space-temporal detection of environmental changes in the Brazilian semiarid through Google Earth Engine and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) are the leading cause of worldwide land degradation. However, efficient means of detecting and monitoring these environmental changes improve the understanding of this process, especially in developing more effective policies to combat land degradation. This study evaluated the space-temporal trends of ecological changes in the Cabrob ' o's Desertification Nucleus (CDN), Pernambuco, Brazilian semiarid region, between 2001 and 2021. For this, we manipulated CHIRPS data, MODIS products (MOD13A1, MOD11A2, MCD43A3, and MOD16A2), and MapBiomas data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) digital platform and the QGIS software (version 3.10.9). First, we calculated surface albedo and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). After that, we performed a space-temporal trend assessment for all biophysical parameters via non-parametric tests Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's Slope Estimator (SSE). In addition, we analyzed LULCC over the last 21 years using MapBiomas. The results obtained showed the effectiveness of using these orbital products for long-term environmental analysis, as well as highlighting the municipalities of Bele ' m do Sa similar to o Francisco, Itacuruba, and Floresta with significant trends at the 1% probability level of the biophysical indices (from decrease to potential evapotranspiration, NDVI and VHI, and addition to albedo and surface temperature) due to a more change in land use and cover. This methodology proved effective for studies on the discrimination of space-temporal trends in the CDN region. It will apply in other Caatinga areas after the appropriate meth-odological adjustments. All scripts generated in this work can be accessed and manipulated through the LDA Tool repository in the GEE platform.

TI  - Comparison of surgical resection of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Dogs with Mammary Gland Tumors with or without sentinel lymph node visualization with patent blue dye
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Dogs' axillary lymph node (ALN) is often difficult to locate before surgical resection. The anatomical location of ALN often discourages Veterinarians from surgical lymphadenectomy. Considering the limited literature available, the actual incidence of metastases and the prognostic relevance are poorly understood. Methods:A non-randomized, prospective clinical study was conducted with female dogs (n = 41) with mammary gland tumor (MGT) in the thoracic or cranial abdominal mammary glands. The study investigated the risks of ALN metastasis based on tumors clinical findings, tumor size, histopathological diagnosis and grade. The main aim of this study was to compare ALN resection with or without patent blue 2.5% (PB) dye injection for sentinel lymph node visualization. A total of 46 mastectomies were performed and five animals underwent two mastectomies. In the first group, 17 patients underwent a mastectomy and lymphadenectomy without PB injection (G1). In contrast, in the second group, 24 patients also received PB injections for sentinel lymph node mapping (G2). The ALN was identified in 38/46 cases (82%). The ALN was identified and excised in only 58% of surgeries in G1(19/46), while in group 2, the lymph node was identified in 92% of the cases and resected in 100% of the cases. The use of PB improves ALN's identification and reduces the surgical resection time in dogs with MGT. Results and discussion:Surgical time differed between the two groups, as it was significantly shorter in the PB injection group compared to group 1 (80 vs. 45 min) (p < 0.0001). The overall frequency of ALN metastasis was 32%. Macroscopic abnormalities in the lymph nodes, tumor size (>3 cm), and diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma or grade II/III mammary gland tumors were associated with a higher probability of ALN metastasis. Metastases in the ALNs are more common, in dogs presenting with tumors larger than 3 cm and diagnosed with aggressive histological subtypes. The ALNs should be removed for correct staging, prognostic evaluation, and decision for adjuvant therapy.

TI  - TOM.D: Taking advantage of microclimate data for urban building energy modeling
T2  - ADVANCES IN APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) provides a framework for decarbonization decision-making on an urban scale. However, existing UBEM systems routinely neglect microclimate effects on building energy consumption, potentially leading to major sources of error. In this work, we attempt to address these sources of error by proposing the large scale collection of remote sensing and climate modeling data to improve the capabilities of existing systems. We explore situations when remote sensing might be most valuable, particularly when high quality weather station data might not be available. We show that lack of access to weather station data is unlikely to be driving existing errors in energy models, as most buildings are likely to be close enough to collect high quality data. We also highlight the significance of Landsat8's thermal instrumentation to capture pertinent temperatures for the buildings through feature importance visualizations. Our analysis then characterizes the seasonal benefits of microclimate data for energy prediction. Landsat8 is found to provide a potential benefit of an 8% reduction in electricity prediction error in the spring and summertime of New York City. In contrast, NOAA RTMA may provide a benefit of a 2.5% reduction in natural gas prediction error in the winter and spring. Finally, we explore the potential of remote sensing to enhance the quality of energy predictions at a neighborhood level. We show that benefits for individual buildings translates to the regional level, as we can achieve improved predictions for groups of buildings.

TI  - A Remote-Sensing-Assisted Estimation of Water Use in Rice Paddy Fields: A Study on Lis Valley, Portugal
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice culture is one of the most important crops in the world, being the most consumed cereal grain (755 million tons in 2020). Since rice is usually produced under flooding conditions and water performs several essential functions for the crop, estimating its water needs is essential. Remote sensing techniques have shown effectiveness in estimating and monitoring the water use in crop fields. An estimation from satellite data is a challenge, but could be very useful, in order to spatialize local estimates and operationalize production models. This study intended to derive an approach to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) in rice paddies from a temporal series of satellite images. The experimental data were obtained in the Lis Valley Irrigation District (central coast of Portugal), during the 2019 to 2021 rice growing seasons. The average seasonal ETa (FAO56) resulted 586 +/- 23 mm and the water productivity (WP) was 0.47 +/- 0.03 kg m(-3). Good correlations were found between the crop coefficients (K-c) proposed by FAO and the NDVI evolution in the control rice fields, with R-2 ranging between 0.71 and 0.82 for stages II+III (development + middle) and between 0.76 and 0.82 for stage IV (late). The results from the derived RS-assisted method were compared to the ETa values obtained from the surface energy balance model METRIC, showing an average estimation error of +/- 0.8 mm d(-1), with a negligible bias. The findings in this work are promising and show the potential of the RS-assisted method for monitoring ETa and water productivity, capturing the local and seasonal variability in rice growing, and then predicting the rice yield, being a useful and free tool available to farmers.

TI  - Characteristics of interannual variability in space-based XCO<sub>2</sub> global observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for the largest radiative forcing among anthropogenic greenhouse gases. There is, therefore, a pressing need to understand the rate at which CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere, including the interannual variations (IAVs) in this rate. IAV in the CO2 growth rate is a small signal relative to the long-term trend and the mean annual cycle of atmospheric CO2, and IAV is tied to climatic variations that may provide insights into long-term carbon-climate feedbacks. Observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission offer a new opportunity to refine our understanding of atmospheric CO2 IAV since the satellite can measure over remote terrestrial regions and the open ocean, where traditional in situ CO2 monitoring is difficult, providing better spatial coverage compared to ground-based monitoring techniques. In this study, we analyze the IAV of column-averaged dry-air CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) from OCO-2 between September 2014 and June 2021. The amplitude of the IAV, which is calculated as the standard deviation of the time series, is up to 1.2 ppm over the continents and around 0.4 ppm over the open ocean. Across all latitudes, the OCO-2-detected XCO2 IAV shows a clear relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven variations that originate in the tropics and are transported poleward. Similar, but smoother, zonal patterns of OCO-2 XCO2 IAV time series compared to ground-based in situ observations and with column observations from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) show that OCO-2 observations can be used reliably to estimate IAV. Furthermore, the extensive spatial coverage of the OCO-2 satellite data leads to smoother IAV time series than those from other datasets, suggesting that OCO-2 provides new capabilities for revealing small IAV signals despite sources of noise and error that are inherent to remote-sensing datasets.

TI  - Synergistic use of multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data and airborne LiDAR to retrieve forest floor reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest floor vegetation can account for a notable fraction of forest productivity and species diversity, and the composition of forest floor vegetation is an important indicator of site type. The signal from the forest floor influences the interpretation of optical remote sensing (RS) data. Retrieval of forest floor reflectance properties has commonly been investigated with multiangular RS data, which often have a coarse spatial resolution. We developed a method that utilizes a forest reflectance model based on photon recollision probability to retrieve forest floor reflectance from near-nadir data. The method was tested in boreal, hemiboreal, and temperate forests in Europe, with hemispherical photos and airborne LiDAR as alternative data sources to provide forest canopy structural information. These two data sources showed comparable performance, thus demonstrating the value of using airborne LiDAR as the structural reflectance model input to derive wall-to-wall maps of forest floor reflectance. We derived such maps from multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI and hyperspectral PRISMA satellite images for a boreal forest site. The validation against in situ measurements showed fairly good performance of the retrievals in sparse forests (that had effective plant area index less than 2). In dense forests, the retrievals were less accurate, due to the small contribution of forest floor to the RS signal. We also demonstrated the use of the method in monitoring the recovery of forest floor vegetation after a thinning disturbance. The reflectance model that we used is computationally efficient, making it well applicable also to data from new and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite missions.

TI  - A New Technique for Impervious Surface Mapping and Its Spatio-Temporal Changes from Landsat and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping and monitoring the urban impervious surface area (ISA) is crucial for understanding the impact of urbanization on heat islands and sustainable development. However, less is known about ISA spectra heterogeneity and their similarity to bare land, wetland, and high-rise-building shadows. This study proposes a feature-based approach using decision tree classification (FDTC) to map ISAs and their spatio-temporal changes in a coastal city in southeast China using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and Sentinel-2 images from 2009 to 2021. Atmospheric correction using simplified dark object subtraction (DOS) was applied to Landsat imagery, which enabled faster computation. FDTC's performance was evaluated with three sensors with different spectral and spatial resolutions, with parameter thresholds held constant across remote-sensing images. FDTC produces a high average overall accuracy (OA) of 94.53%, a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.855, and a map-level image classification efficacy (MICE) of 0.851 for ISA mapping over the studied period. In comparison with other indices such as BCI (biophysical composition index), PISI (automated built-up extraction index), and ABEI (perpendicular impervious surface index), the FDTC demonstrated higher accuracy and separability for extracting ISA and bare land as well as wetland and high-rise buildings. The results of FDTC were also consistent with those of two open-source ISA products and other remote sensing indices. The study found that the ISA in Xiamen City increased from 16.33% to 26.17% over the past 13 years due to vegetation occupation, encroachment onto bare land, and reclamation of coastal areas. While the expansion significantly reduced urban vegetation in rapidly urbanizing areas of Xiamen, ambitious park greening programs and massive redevelopment of urban villages resulted in a modest but continuous increase in urban green space.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The rapid acceleration of urbanization has a serious impact on the urban ecological environment. It is of great importance to carry out numerical simulation research on urban spatial thermal environment for improving urban ecological environment. At present, there are few studies on the influence and accuracy evaluation of different vegetation settings in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on the simulation results. Aiming to quantify impacts of vegetation changes and vegetation model settings on the numerical simulation of urban three-dimensional thermal environment, this study 1) based on Gaofen-2 remote sensing data and CFD model, the wind and heat environment at the block scale was simulated and analysed; 2) The vegetation model is assumed to be three models including cold source, constant temperature wall, and porous medium. Based on the heat transfer and cooling mechanism of vegetation, these three different vegetation models and their related CFD parameter settings are used to simulate the 3D spatial thermal environment. The research results show that the distribution of temperature has a great correlation with the direction of wind. The temperature distribution at different heights at night did not show significant differences. Due to the obvious convective heat transfer between the building surface and the atmosphere, the temperature in the upwind direction is significantly lower than that in the downwind direction. At a height of 2 m and below, setting the vegetation as the wall model has the best performance, and at a height above 5 m, the results of the wind and heat environment of the three setting methods are basically similar. The wind environment results of the same vegetation setting are different at different heights.

TI  - Detecting the presence of standing dead trees using airborne laser scanning and optical data
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deadwood is an important indicator of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Identifying areas with large density of standing dead trees through field inventory is challenging, and remotely sensed data can provide a more systematic approach. In this study, we used metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (7.1 points m(-2)) and vegetation indices from optical images (HySpex sensor VNIR-1800: 0.3 m, SWIR-384: 0.7 m) to predict the presence of standing dead trees over a 15.9 km(2) managed forest in Southern Norway. The dead basal area (DBA) of 40 sample plots was computed and used to classify the plots into presence/absence of standing dead trees. An area-based approach (ABA) using logistic regression was initially tested, but due to limited ground reference information, no statistically significant models could be formulated. A tree-based approach (TBA) was used to overcome this limitation. It identified trees on the ALS point cloud with a local maxima function and used a vegetation index to determine if the trees were dead. Between 18% and 42% of the predicted area with standing dead trees intersected a field recorded validation dataset. The TBA provided a good alternative to area-based regression models in the context of few standing dead trees.

TI  - Evolution of sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer patients in a rural setting: 10 years' experience
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard axillary staging procedure of early breast cancer. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles have been found to be comparable to, while overcoming many of the limitations associated with, the current standard of care for SLN biopsies (dual localisation with radioisotope and patent blue dye). Here, SPIO dual localisation (Sienna+(R) and blue dye) is compared to blue dye alone for SLN biopsies in a rural centre where radioisotope techniques are not readily available. Sienna+(R) dual localisation is shown to be more likely to detect nodes (detection rate of 99% compared to 90% when using blue dye alone), and detect more nodes, than blue dye alone. The use of Magseed, a magnetic tracer, was not found to influence node detection. The results from this work show that Sienna+(R) dual localisation is superior to blue dye alone for detecting SLN, suggesting that it is an excellent alternative to dual localisation of radioisotope and blue dye for small centres lacking easy access to a nuclear medicine department.

TI  - Assessment of Active LiDAR Data and Passive Optical Imagery for Double-Layered Mangrove Leaf Area Index Estimation: A Case Study in Mai Po, Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology is a timely and cost-efficient method for leaf area index (LAI) estimation, especially for less accessible areas such as mangrove forests. Confounded by the poor penetrability of optical images, most previous studies focused on estimating the LAI of the main canopy, ignoring the understory. This study investigated the capability of multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI), and airborne LiDAR data for overstory (OLe) and understory (ULe) LAI estimation of a multi-layered mangrove stand in Mai Po, Hong Kong, China. LiDAR data were employed to stratify the overstory and understory. Vegetation indices (VIs) and LiDAR metrics were generated as predictors to build regression models against the OLe and ULe with multiple parametric and non-parametric methods. The OLe model fitting results were typically better than ULe because of the dominant contribution of the overstory to the remotely sensed signal. A single red-edge VI derived from HSI data delivered the lowest RMSE of 0.12 and the highest R-adj(2) of 0.79 for OLe model fitting. The synergetic use of LiDAR metrics and S2 VIs performed best for ULe model fitting with RMSE = 0.33, R-adj(2) = 0.84. OLe estimation benefited from the high spatial and spectral resolution HSI that was found less confounded by the understory. In addition to their penetration attributes, LiDAR data could separately describe the upper and lower canopy, which reduced the noise from other components, thereby improving the ULe estimation.

TI  - Comparison of Various Annual Land Cover Datasets in the Yellow River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land cover (LC) datasets are the basis for global environmental and climate change studies. Recently, numerous open-source annual LC datasets have been created due to advances in remote sensing technology. However, the agreements and sources of error that affect the accuracy of current annual LC datasets are not well understood, which limits the widespread use of these datasets. We compared four annual LC datasets, namely the CLCD, MCD12Q1, CCI-LC, and GLASS-LC, in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) to identify their spatial and temporal agreement for nine LC classes and to analyze their sources of error. The Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope analysis, Taylor diagram, and error decomposition analysis were used in this study. Our results showed that the main LC classes in the four datasets were grassland and cropland (total area percentage > 80%), but their trends in area of change were different. For the main LC classes, the temporal agreement was the highest between the CCI-LC and CLCD (0.85), followed by the MCD12Q1 (0.21), while the lowest was between the GLASS-LC and CLCD (-0.11). The spatial distribution of area for the main LC classes was largely similar between the four datasets, but the spatial agreement in their trends in area of change varied considerably. The spatial variation in the trends in area of change for the cropland, forest, grassland, barren, and impervious LC classes were mainly located in the upstream area region (UA) and the midstream area region (MA) of the YRB, where the percentage of systematic error was high (>68.55%). This indicated that the spatial variation between the four datasets was mainly caused by systematic errors. Between the four datasets, the total error increased along with landscape heterogeneity. These results not only improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal agreement and sources of error between the various current annual LC datasets, but also provide support for land policy making in the YRB.

TI  - Non-target potential of neonicotinoid and fungicide seed cane treatments on Solenopsis invicta
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, Louisiana sugarcane has been grown vegetatively from whole stalks, but innovations in machinery and rising labor costs have increased interest in billet planting. Billets, short stalk pieces containing several viable eyes, are more susceptible to pathogen exposure and may require fungicide and/or insecticide applications at planting to increase stand potential. Work in other crops indicates such treatments may alter arthropod predator abundance, so the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential non-target effects of select treatments at planting on the red important fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta, and other arthropod predators of the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis, in sugarcane. We sampled predators and measured biological control potential in plots treated with a neonicotinoid insecticide and/or fungicide applied as in-furrow sprays or seed cane dips. We then assessed RIFA worker survival and behavior following 48 h exposure in the laboratory. With the exception of one in-furrow sprayed field trial, treatments did not significantly impact RIFA numbers. Treatments did not impact the abundance of other predator groups or biological control potential (borer damage and sentinel egg predation) in any field trial. Laboratory assessments indicated no treatment effect on RIFA behavior metrics after exposure but had mixed results on survival depending on application method. Our data indicate that these seed cane treatments may not disrupt biological control and the greater epigeal arthropod predator community in Louisiana sugarcane. However, tests should be replicated under different environmental conditions to ensure biological control, particularly by RIFA, is maintained with larger-scale use.

TI  - Characterising cropland fragmentation in post-Soviet Central Asia, using Landsat remote-sensing time series data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, agricultural reforms in Central Asia often translated into the fragmentation of large fields into smaller shares. Most remote-sensing-based land use classification approaches are categorical in nature, and thus they are unable to capture these changes. We have developed an approach to detecting the timing of land fragmentation based on textural information from a time series of Landsat images for four Central Asian countries (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) between 1990 and 2019. Our results showed that detected fragmentation events correspond well with documented agrarian reform pro-cesses in the different countries, and validation yielded maximum overall accuracies between 67 and 73%. In a case study of a former collective farm in Kyrgyzstan, we demonstrate how our method can accurately detect changes on the local scale. Texture time series data have great potential for analysing the trajectories of cropland fragmentation, in particular in regions where additional information on land use is limited.

TI  - DILRS: Domain-Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the exponential growth in the speed and volume of remote sensing data, deep learning models are expected to adapt and continually learn over time. Unfortunately, the domain shift between multi-source remote sensing data from various sensors and regions poses a significant challenge. Segmentation models face difficulty in adapting to incremental domains due to catastrophic forgetting, which can be addressed via incremental learning methods. However, current incremental learning methods mainly focus on class-incremental learning, wherein classes belong to the same remote sensing domain, and neglect investigations into incremental domains in remote sensing. To solve this problem, we propose a domain-incremental learning method for semantic segmentation in multi-source remote sensing data. Specifically, our model aims to incrementally learn a new domain while preserving its performance on previous domains without accessing previous domain data. To achieve this, our model has a unique parameter learning structure that reparametrizes domain-agnostic and domain-specific parameters. We use different optimization strategies to adapt to domain shift in incremental domain learning. Additionally, we adopt multi-level knowledge distillation loss to mitigate the impact of label space shift among domains. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance in domain-incremental settings, outperforming existing methods with only a few parameters.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Remote Sensing for Soil Salinization Mapping and Monitoring: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Meeting current needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet theirs is the only path toward achieving environmental sustainability. As the most valuable natural resource, soil faces global, regional, and local challenges, from quality degradation to mass losses brought on by salinization. These issues affect agricultural productivity and ecological balance, undermining sustainability and food security. Therefore, timely monitoring and accurate mapping of salinization processes are crucial, especially in semi-arid and arid regions where climate variability impacts have already reached alarming levels. Salt-affected soil mapping has enormous potential thanks to recent progress in remote sensing. This paper comprehensively reviews the potential of remote sensing to assess soil salinization. The review demonstrates that large-scale soil salinity estimation based on remote sensing tools remains a significant challenge, primarily due to data resolution and acquisition costs. Fundamental trade-offs constrain practical remote sensing applications in salinization mapping between data resolution, spatial and temporal coverage, acquisition costs, and high accuracy expectations. This article provides an overview of research work related to soil salinization mapping and monitoring using remote sensing. By synthesizing recent research and highlighting areas where further investigation is needed, this review helps to steer future efforts, provides insight for decision-making on environmental sustainability and soil resource management, and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration.

TI  - Association of age and inflammatory disease activity in the pivotal natalizumab clinical trials in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFocal inflammatory disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) diminishes with increasing age. Here we use patient-level data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of natalizumab treatment in RRMS to investigate the association of age and inflammatory disease activity. MethodsWe used patient-level data from the AFFIRM (natalizumab vs placebo in relapsing-remitting MS, NCT00027300) and SENTINEL (natalizumab plus interferon beta vs interferon beta in relapsing remitting MS, NCT00030966) RCTs. We determined the proportion of participants developing new T2 lesions, contrast-enhancing lesions (CELs) and relapses over 2 years of follow-up as a function of age, and investigated the association of age with time to first relapse using time-to-event analyses. ResultsAt baseline, there were no differences between age groups in T2 lesion volume and number of relapses in the year before inclusion. In SENTINEL, older participants had a significantly lower number of CELs. During both trials, the number of new CELs and the proportion of participants developing new CELs were significantly lower in older age groups. The number of new T2 lesions and the proportion of participants with any radiological disease activity during follow-up were also lower in older age groups, especially in the control arms. ConclusionsOlder age is associated with a lower prevalence and degree of focal inflammatory disease activity in treated and untreated RRMS. Our findings inform the design of RCTs, and suggest that patient age should be taken into consideration when deciding on immunomodulatory treatment in RRMS.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy Analysis of Regional Block Adjustment Using GF-7 Stereo Images without GCPs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important means of improving positioning accuracy, block adjustment has been used in the improvement and assessment of accuracy for the Chinese Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite. However, there is little research on what factors affect accuracy without ground control points (GCPs). The correlation between accuracy and the images participating in the adjustment is not clear. This paper proposes the correlation coefficients and canonical correlation analysis between five accuracy indicators and three sets of ten adjustment factors, including topographic factors, participating image factors, and tie points (TPs) factors, to quantify the influence of adjustment factors on accuracy. Block adjustment without GCPs for GF-7 stereo imagery is verified in three study areas to evaluate the relationship between accuracy and adjustment factors. The results show that block adjustment without GCPs can improve direct positioning accuracy with an average improvement of 1.27 m in the planar direction and 0.13 m in the elevation direction. Moreover, plane accuracy is more easily affected by three sets of factors, while the influence on elevation accuracy is more balanced. The set of TP factors has the greatest influence on accuracy, and the image overlap is more critical than the image coverage area, number, and time periods. Topographic factors also play an important role, and the influence of the elevation factor with the highest canonical correlation coefficient (-0.71) is more significant than the other two factors, roughness, and slope. The results provide a reference for the improvement of adjustment accuracy without GCPs, the reasonable selection of adjustment images, the optimization of TPs, and the strategy of the partition processing of large-area block adjustment for GF-7 stereo imagery.

TI  - Exploring the Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of China's Four Major Urban Agglomerations in the Luminous Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the knowledge gap regarding the spatiotemporal evolution of Chinese urban agglomerations using long time series of luminescence remote sensing data. The evolution of urban agglomerations is of great significance for the future development and planning of cities. Nighttime light data provide a window for observing urban agglomerations' characteristics on a large spatial scale, but they are affected by temporal discontinuity. To solve this problem, this study proposes a ridge-sampling regression-based Hadamard matrix correction method and constructs consistent long-term nighttime light sequences for China's four major urban agglomerations from 1992 to 2018. Using the Getis-Ord Gi* hot-cold spot, standard deviation ellipse method, and Baidu search index, we comprehensively analyze the directional evolution of urban agglomerations and the correlations between cities. The results show that, after correction, the correlation coefficient between nighttime light intensity and gross domestic product increased from 0.30 to 0.43. Furthermore, this study identifies unique features of each urban agglomeration. The Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration achieved balanced development by shifting from coastal to inland areas. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao urban agglomeration developed earlier and grew more slowly in the north due to topographical barriers. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration in the north has Beijing and Tianjin as its core, and the southeastern region has developed rapidly, showing an obvious imbalance in development. The Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration in the inland area has Chengdu and Chongqing as its dual core, and its development has been significantly slower than that of the other three agglomerations due to the influence of topography, but it has great potential. Overall, this study provides a research framework for urban agglomerations based on four major urban agglomerations to explore their spatiotemporal characteristics and offers insights for government urban planning.

TI  - Best treatment options for occult breast cancer: A meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Occult breast cancer ( OBC) is a rare malignant breast tumor. Because of the rare cases and limited clinical experience, a huge therapeutic difference has existed all over the world and standardized treatments have yet been established.Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase databases to identify the choice of OBC surgical procedures in all studies: (1) patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only; (2) patients undergoing ALND with radiotherapy (RT); (3) patients undergoing ALND with breast surgery (BS); (4) patients undergoing ALND with RT and BS; and (5) patients undergoing observation or RT only. The primary endpoints were mortality rates, the second endpoints were distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence.Results: Among the 3,476 patients, 493 (14.2%) undergo ALND or SLNB only; 632 (18.2%) undergo ALND with RT; 1483 (42.7%) undergo ALND with BS; 467 (13.4%) undergo ALND RT and BS, and 401 (11.5%) undergo observation or RT only. After comparing the multiple groups, both groups 1 and 3 have higher mortality rates than group 4 (30.7% vs. 18.6%, p < 0.0001; 25.1% vs. 18.6%, p = 0.007), and group 1 has higher mortality rates than groups 2 and 3 (30.7% vs.14.7%, p < 0.00001; 30.7 vs. 19.4%, p < 0.0001). Group (1 + 3) had a prognosis advantage over group 5 (21.4% vs. 31.0%, p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference both in the distant recurrence rates and locoregional rates between group (1 + 3) and group (2 + 4) (21.0% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.06; 12.3% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.26).Conclusion: On the basis of this meta-analysis, our study indicates that BS including modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) combined RT may appear as the optimal surgical approach in patients with OBC. RT cannot prolong both the time of distant metastasis and the local recurrences.

TI  - Long-term remote observations of particulate organic phosphorus concentration in eutrophic Lake Taihu based on a novel algorithm
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the long-term spatiotemporal variations in particulate organic phosphorus concentration (CPOP) is imperative for clarifying the phosphorus cycle and its biogeochemical behavior in waters. However, little attention has been devoted to this owing to a lack of suitable bio-optical algorithms that allow the application of remote sensing data. In this study, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, a novel absorption-based algorithm of CPOP was developed for eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. The algorithm yielded a promising performance with a mean absolute percentage error of 27.75% and root mean square error of 21.09 mu g/L. The long-term MODIS-derived CPOP demonstrated an overall increasing pattern over the past 19 years (2003-2021) and a significant temporal heterogeneity in Lake Taihu, with higher value in summer (81.97 +/- 3.81 mu g/L) and autumn (82.07 +/- 3.8 mu g/L), and lower CPOP in spring (79.52 +/- 3.81 mu g/L) and winter (78.74 +/- 3.8 mu g/ L). Spatially, relatively higher CPOP was observed in the Zhushan Bay (85.87 +/- 7.5 mu g/L), whereas the lower value was observed in the Xukou Bay (78.95 +/- 3.48 mu g/L). In addition, significant correlations (r > 0.6, P < 0.05) were observed between CPOP and air temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacterial blooms areas, demonstrating that CPOP was greatly influenced by air temperature and algal metabolism. This study provides the first record of the spatial-temporal characteristics of CPOP in Lake Taihu over the past 19 years, and the CPOP results and regulatory factors analyses could provide valuable insights for aquatic ecosystem conservation.

TI  - Genomic Analysis and Antimicrobial Resistance of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> Isolated from Diarrheal Patients - Beijing Municipality, China, 2019-2021
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is the leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and has a major impact on global public health. The objective of the present study was to conduct whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the genetic diversity, virulence factors, and determinants of antimicrobial resistance of C. jejuni during a 3-year surveillance period in Beijing, China.Methods: A total of 184 clinical isolates were obtained from sentinel hospital surveillance between 2019 and 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the agar dilution method. WGS was employed to characterize the 184 C. jejuni strains.Results: Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed high genetic diversity among the 184 C. jejuni strains, identifying 71 sequence types (STs) and 19 clonal complexes (CCs). The most prevalent ST was ST760 (6.5%), and the most common CC was CC21 (24.5%), consisting of 11 STs. High resistance rates were observed for ciprofloxacin (76.6%), nalidixic acid (76.1%), and tetracycline (71.2%). A total of 77 C. jejuni isolates (41.8%) exhibited multidrug resistance with 43 resistance patterns. Virulome analysis disclosed the differential distribution of virulence factors related to adherence, colonization, chemotaxis, as well as lipo-oligosaccharide and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Resistome analysis demonstrated widespread resistance to quinolones and tetracycline, but low rates of macrolides resistance. The phylogeny, based on whole genome single nucleotide polymorphisms, indicated a high degree of clonality and grouped the C. jejuni strains into six clades. Closely related isolates that were part of a genetic cluster mostly shared a homogenous clonal complex.Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the rising resistance to quinolones and tetracycline, as well as the virulence potential and diverse genotypes identified among C. jejuni strains isolated from diarrheal patients in Beijing.

TI  - NPP and Carbon Emissions under Forest Fire Disturbance in Southwest and Northeast China from 2001 to 2020
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With climate change, frequent forest fires and prolonged fire period occur all over the world. Moreover, carbon emission from forest fire affects the carbon cycle of the forest ecosystem. However, this effect varies by region with no uniform conclusions, and fewer comparative studies exist on such differences between regions. In this paper, net primary productivity (NPP) data MOD17A3 were used as an important parameter of forest carbon absorption, along with MODIS fire spot data MCD14DL and burned area data MCD64A1. Forest carbon lost under forest fire interference in the northeast and southwest natural forest areas of China was studied to explore the role of forest fire in the carbon cycle process and its differences in the unlike regions of China. Here, by means of kernel density analysis and M-K trend test, the characteristics of forest fires in China's southwest and northeast forests were calculated. Forest carbon emission under forest fire disturbance was quantified by reference to the forest fire emission factor list. We show that (1) the total number of forest fire spots in the southwest region from 2001 to 2020 was 1.06 x 10(5), 1.28 times that of Northeast China. However, the total burned area in the southwest was only 67.84% of that in the northeast. (2) The total carbon emissions from forest fires in the southwest from 2001 to 2020 was 37,559.94 Gg, 10.77% larger than the northeast forest, CH4 and CO2 were 13.52% and 11.29% larger respectively. Moreover, the carbon emissions of forest fire in the northeast showed a downward trend, R-2 = 0.16 (p < 0.1), while it remained basically unchanged in the southwest. The contribution of carbon emissions from forest fires changed with forest types, it was shown as: evergreen needleleaf forest (14.98%) > evergreen broadleaf forest (10.81%) > deciduous needleleaf forest (6.52%) > deciduous broadleaf forest (5.22%). (3) From 2001 to 2020, under the premise that the NPP both manifested upward trends, the NPP of the burned areas showed a significant downward trend in the southwest forest, with R-2 = 0.42 (p < 0.05), while it increased in the northeast forest, with R-2 = 0.37 (p < 0.05). It showed negative correlation between NPP of burned areas and forest fire carbon emissions, and forest fire disturbance had no significant effect on forest NPP in Northeast China, while net carbon loss occurred in Southwest China. In general, under different forest fire characteristics, NPP, which represents forest carbon uptake, and carbon emissions from forest fires show differences. The impact of forest fire disturbance on forest carbon process varies with regions. The study can provide some ideas on the effects of forest fire disturbance on climate change.

TI  - Impact of wind farms on local land surface temperature in Qinghai Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Wind power in China is experiencing accelerating growth to meet the need for structural reform of the energy supply, however its impact on the ecological environment urgently needs to be taken into account. In this study, the impact of a wind farm in Gonghe County, Qinghai Province, China, on local land surface temperature (LST) was explored by removing the temporal background using year-by-year LST averaging and filtering the spatial background using pixel-by-pixel LST averaging based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast's ERA5 data. The main findings are as follows: (1) From a long-term series perspective, the LST on the wind farm and the adjacent areas shows an increasing trend, reaching 0.060K/19a in spring; (2) the wind farm exerts a warming effect on the local LST, with a maximum of 7.04 K and a minimum of 1.63 K, and there is a significant spatial matching with the wind farm boundaries, which is more obvious in spring and winter, and less pronounced in summer and autumn; (3) the construction of wind farms also has a potential upward impact on the LST in the adjacent areas, especially in autumn and winter, and the warming effect gradually decreases with increasing distance; (4) the warming effect is most remarkable when the predominant wind directions of the upwind and downwind are close to consistent and the differences in wind volumes are significant. Research findings on the effect of wind farms on local LST are vitally important for strengthening the establishment of wind farms, site selection of wind farms, and the scientific and reasonable utilization of wind energy resources.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A coaxial low-energy surface flashover (LESF) ignitor for CubeSat electric propulsion systems was developed and tested. The ignitor features a coaxial geometry with copper electrodes directly bonded to the inner and outer surfaces of the alumina ceramic tubular insulator. The ignitor proved to be operational throughout (and after) an extended duration test of 10 million pulses. Characterization of a single LESF event via intensified charge-coupled device fast photography showed that the initial plasma was generated along the insulator surface, while the later plasma production was governed by the column attached to the copper electrodes. The plasma plume propagated primarily perpendicular to the insulator surface at around 10(5) m/s. Further investigation on the erosion of ceramic insulator and copper electrodes via energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis of a witness plate exposed to LESF and scanning electron microscopy observation of the electrodes revealed that the ceramic erosion (3.5x10(11) molecules per pulse) was predominant over electrodes erosion (1.3x10(10) atoms per pulse or 3.10 mu g/C).

TI  - Groundwater Potentiality of Wadi Fatimah, Western Saudi Arabia: Geophysical and Remote Sensing Integrated Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To detect groundwater-bearing potential zones in Wadi Fatimah, western Saudi Arabia, geophysical data from three profiles of two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and remote sensing data were gathered, integrated, and evaluated. The DEM and slope maps indicate that Wadi Fatimah has a high potential to store great amounts of groundwater. The maximum elevations range from 0 to 933 m, with an average elevation of 466 m AMSL. The amount of surface water that infiltrates into the ground is affected by the slope. Rainwater can be collected in low-sloped areas and percolate into the subsurface, replenishing groundwater. In the study area, the slope ranged from 0 degrees to 38 degrees. The slopes of Wadi Fatimah ranged from 0 degrees to 9.1 degrees, with highlands having slopes ranging from 9.1 degrees to 38 degrees. Wadi Fatimah has a high stream density. Furthermore, because it is unconfined, the groundwater-bearing zone reaches the ground surface and recharges continuously during the rainy season. The drainage density is 0.433 km/km(2), which is considered normal for coarse drainage. Lithology, infiltration capacity, and topographic relief all have an impact on drainage texture. Because of the basement rocks' low slope, a coarse drainage texture of 0.059 was calculated, indicating additional groundwater recharge from precipitation. Moreover, based on the 2D inversion results of the ERT data, Wadi Fatimah's unconfined aquifer has a high potential for groundwater. This aquifer is distinguished by a zone of low resistivity (less than 100 O.m) and a depth of up to 50 m below the ground surface. This aquifer is underlain by the weathered/fractured and/or fresh basement rocks. Wadi Fatimah basin is recharged by rainfall creating a promising or strategic area for groundwater supply for future planning and urbanization projects in surrounding areas.

TI  - Dynamic change analysis of water spread region and its impact assessment using spectral indices of remotely sensed data
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The identification and systematic monitoring of water spread regions using remote sensing techniques necessitates precise temporal resolution datasets. Landsat data are one of the most popular data sources that provides satellite derived images of the Earth's surface for examining the satellite-based indices of a specific region. In the present research study, Normalized Difference Water Index is employed to identify the surface area of 11 system and non-system lakes in a part of Coimbatore region over the time span of 32 years (1990-2022). Based on the analysis, the water spread region in 1990 is seen to be 13.01 ha which gradually increased to 435.17 ha in 2022. This clearly indicates that there is substantial difference in the rainfall statistics over the years. Computations for cross-validation are done using other indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). A 500 m buffer is created and calculated for vegetation and built-up indices like Chinna kulam 1 and 2, Kumaraswamy Lake, Valankulam, Singanallur and Sengulam lakes which show the decreasing trend of NDVI. Simultaneously, NDBI increased in 2000, which shows that measures were taken to tackle the encroachment of lakes in the city and the concerted efforts of the Governmental authorities and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were fruitful. A decreasing trend is noted in NDBI during 2011 and 2020. The microclimatic conditions and advection current of waterbodies along with boating facilities and parks in some lakes offer city dwellers a tranquil recreational area with respite from vehicular pollution and heat generation from the concrete jungle. This study will be helpful in facilitating policy decisions for future planning and sustainable development of water bodies. It will also be beneficial in devising rehabilitation measures for irrigation tanks and will aid in bringing about agrarian stability of tanks in urban locales.

TI  - Multiclass Land Use and Land Cover Classification of Andean Sub-Basins in Colombia with Sentinel-2 and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data is a challenging problem that has evolved with the update and launch of new satellites in orbit. As new satellites are launched with higher spatial and spectral resolution and shorter revisit times, LULC classification has evolved to take advantage of these improvements. However, these advancements also bring new challenges, such as the need for more sophisticated algorithms to process the increased volume and complexity of data. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in this area. Training deep learning models with complex architectures require cutting-edge hardware, which can be expensive and not accessible to everyone. In this study, a simple CNN based on the LeNet architecture is proposed to perform LULC classification over Sentinel-2 images. Simple CNNs such as LeNet require less computational resources compared to more-complex architectures. A total of 11 LULC classes were used for training and validating the model, which were then used for classifying the sub-basins. The analysis showed that the proposed CNN achieved an Overall Accuracy of 96.51% with a kappa coefficient of 0.962 in the validation data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks, as well as state-of-the-art complex deep learning methods such as ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNet. Moreover, despite being trained in over seven million images, it took five h to train, demonstrating that our simple CNN architecture is only effective but is also efficient.

TI  - The Capabilities of FY-3D/MERSI-II Sensor to Detect and Quantify Thermal Volcanic Activity: The 2020-2023 Mount Etna Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide crucial information to better understand volcanic processes and mitigate associated risks. In recent years, exploiting the growing number of spaceborne polar platforms, several automated volcanic monitoring systems have been developed. These, however, rely on good geometrical and meteorological conditions, as well as on the occurrence of thermally detectable activity at the time of acquisition. A multiplatform approach can thus increase the number of volcanological-suitable scenes, minimise the temporal gap between acquisitions, and provide crucial information on the onset, evolution, and conclusion of both transient and long-lasting volcanic episodes. In this work, we assessed the capabilities of the MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) sensor aboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) platform to detect and quantify heat flux sourced from volcanic activity. Using the Middle Infrared Observation of Volcanic Activity (MIROVA) algorithm, we processed 3117 MERSI-II scenes of Mount Etna acquired between January 2020 and February 2023. We then compared the Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP, in Watt) timeseries against those obtained by MODIS and VIIRS sensors. The remarkable agreement between the timeseries, both in trends and magnitudes, was corroborated by correlation coefficients (?) between 0.93 and 0.95 and coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.79 to 0.84. Integrating the datasets of the three sensors, we examined the effusive eruption of Mount Etna started on 27 November 2022, and estimated a total volume of erupted lava of 8.15 +/- 2.44 x 10(6) m(3) with a Mean Output Rate (MOR) of 1.35 +/- 0.40 m(3) s(-1). The reduced temporal gaps between acquisitions revealed that rapid variations in cloud coverage as well as geometrically unfavourable conditions play a major role in thermal volcano monitoring. Evaluating the capabilities of MERSI-II, we also highlight how a multiplatform approach is essential to enhance the efficiency of satellite-based systems for volcanic surveillance.

TI  - A modified temperature based model for estimation of potential evapotranspiration over Ghataprabha river basin, south India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) is one of the significant hydrological parameters, but complicated to estimate due to various meteorological parameters involved. Accurate estimation of PET at spatial scale is a major requirement for arid and semiarid agriculture regions such as Ghatapraha river basin for study of water balance. Temperature based models have emerged as promising tools in extracting the spatial distribution of the PET, using remote sensed images. The main objective of the study is, to develop a site-specific temperature-based model for estimation of PET in semiarid regions, applicable to Ghataprabha basin. Performance of five different temperature-based PET models were evaluated by comparing with the standard Penman-Monteith equation for the year 2013 and 2014. The Hargreaves-Samani equation performed better with statistical parameters RMSE, MBE, MPE and R-2 of 0.65, 0.43, 10.64 and 0.81 respectively. The model was further calibrated and site-specific modified Hargreaves-Samani equation was developed. The results revealed that spatial PET estimated by modified method based on satellite-derived spatial air temperature data performed better in spatial scale. The proposed approach is new and is advantageous as the spatial distribution of PET can be obtained, with limited data of temperature, where unavailability of the spatial climate data is a major concern.

TI  - European Association of Urology-American Society of Clinical Oncology Collaborative Guideline on Penile Cancer: 2023 Update
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: Penile cancer is a rare disease but has a significant impact on quality of life. Its incidence is increasing, so it is important to include new and relevant evidence in clinical practice guidelines.Objective: To provide a collaborative guideline that offers worldwide physician and patient guidance for the management of penile cancer. Evidence acquisition: Comprehensive literature searches were performed for each section topic. In addition, three systematic reviews were conducted. Levels of evidence were assessed, and a strength rating for each recommendation was assigned according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. Evidence synthesis: Penile cancer is a rare disease but its global incidence is increasing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for penile cancer and pathology should include an assessment of HPV status. The main aim of primary tumour treatment is complete tumour eradication, which has to be balanced against optimal organ preser-vation without compromising oncological control. Early detection and treatment of lymph node (LN) metastasis is the main determinant of survival. Surgical LN staging with sentinel node biopsy is recommended for patients with a high-risk (>= pT1b) tumour with cN0 status. While (inguinal) LN dissection remains the standard for node-positive disease, multimodal treatment is needed in patients with advanced disease. Owing to a lack of controlled trials and large series, the levels of evidence and grades of recommen-dation are low in comparison to those for more common diseases.Conclusions: This collaborative penile cancer guideline provides updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of penile cancer for use in clinical practice. Organ -preserving surgery should be offered for treatment of the primary tumour when feasible. Adequate and timely LN management remains a challenge, especially in advanced dis-ease stages. Referral to centres of expertise is recommended.Patient summary: Penile cancer is a rare disease that significantly impacts quality of life. While the disease can be cured in most cases without lymph node involvement, manage-ment of advanced disease remains challenging. Many unmet needs and unanswered questions remain, underlining the importance of research collaborations and centralisa-tion of penile cancer services. (c) 2023 European Association of Urology.

TI  - Actual evapotranspiration by machine learning and remote sensing without the thermal spectrum
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to use machine learning algorithms to establish a model for estimating the evapotranspiration fraction (ETf) using two data input scenarios from the spectral information of the Sentinel-2 constellation, and to analyze the temporal and spatial applicability of the models to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETr) in agricultural crops irrigated by center pivots. The spectral bands of Sentinel 2A and 2B satellite and vegetation indices formed the first scenario. The second scenario was formed by performing the normalized ratio procedure between bands (NRPB) and joining the variables applied in the first scenario. The models were generated to predict the ETf using six regression algorithms and then compared with ETf calculated by the Simple Algorithm For Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER) algorithm, was considered as the standard. The results possible to select the best model, which in both scenarios was Cubist. Subsequently, ETf was estimated only for the center pivots present in the study area and the classification of land use and cover was accessed through the MapBiomas product. Land use was necessary to enable the calculation of ETr in each scenario, in the center pivots with sugarcane and soybean crops. ETr was estimated using two ETo approaches (ET(o)Brazil and Hargreaves-Samani). It was found that the Hargreaves-Samani equation overestimated ETr with higher errors mainly for center pivots with sugarcane, where systematic error (MBE) ranged from 0.89 to 2.02 mm d(-1). The ET(o)Brazil product, on the other hand, presented statistical errors with MBE values ranging from 0.00 to 1.26 mm d(-1) for both agricultural crops. Based on the results obtained, it is observed that the ETr can be monitored spatially and temporally without the use of the thermal band, which causes the estimation of this parameter to be performed with greater temporal frequency.

TI  - Short communication: Potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and offset tracking in monitoring post-cyclonic landslide activities on Reunion
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the results of an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and SAR offset tracking (OT) study in Cirque de Salazie (CdS), Reunion Island, France, within the context of the RENOVRISK project, a multidisciplinary programme to study the cyclonic risks in the south-western Indian Ocean. Despite numerous landslides in this territory, CdS is one of the more densely populated areas on Reunion Island. One of the aims of the project is to assess whether Sentinel-1 SAR methods can be used to measure landslide motion and/or accelerations due to post-cyclonic activity in CdS. We concentrate on the post-2017 cyclonic activity. We use the Copernicus Sentinel-1 data, acquired between 30 October 2017 and 6 November 2018. Sentinel1 is a C-band SAR, and its signal can be severely affected by the presence of changing vegetation between two SAR acquisitions, particularly in CdS, where the vegetation canopy is well developed. This is why C-band radars such as the ones on board RADARSAT or Envisat, characterized by low acquisition frequency (24 and 36 d, respectively), could not be routinely used in CdS to measure landslide motion with InSAR in the past. In this study, we use InSAR and OT techniques applied to Sentinel-1 SAR. We find that C-band SAR on board Sentinel-1 can be used to monitor landslide motion in densely vegetated areas, thanks to its high acquisition frequency (12 d). OT stacking reveals a useful complement to InSAR, especially in mapping fast moving areas. In particular, we can highlight ground motion in the Hell-Bourg, Ilet a Vidot, Grand-Ilet, Camp Pierrot, and Le Belier landslides.

TI  - NCCT Markers of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion Using Revised Criteria: An External Validation of Their Predictive Accuracy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several NCCT expansion markers have been proposed to improve the prediction of hematoma expansion. We retrospectively evaluated the predictive accuracy of 9 expansion markers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients admitted for intracerebral hemorrhage within 24 hours of last seen well were retrospectively included from April 2016 to April 2020. The primary outcome was revised hematoma expansion, defined as any of a $6-mL or $33% increase in intracerebral hemorrhage volume, a $ 1-mL increase in intraventricular hemorrhage volume, or de novo intraventricular hemorrhage. We assessed the predictive accuracy of expansion markers and determined their association with revised hematoma expansion.RESULTS: We included 124 patients, of whom 51 (41%) developed revised hematoma expansion. The sensitivity of each marker for the prediction of revised hematoma expansion ranged from 4% to 78%; the specificity, 37%-97%; the positive likelihood ratio, 0.417.16; and the negative likelihood ratio, 0.49-1.06. By means of univariable logistic regressions, 5 markers were significantly associated with revised hematoma expansion: black hole (OR = 8.66; 95% CI, 2.15-58.14; P =.007), hypodensity (OR = 3.18; 95% CI, 1.49-6.93; P =.003), blend (OR 1/4 2.90; 95% CI, 1.08-8.38; P =.04), satellite (OR = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.29-6.61; P =01), and Barras shape (OR = 2.41, 95% CI; 1.17-5.10; P =.02). In multivariable models, only the black hole marker remained independently associated with revised hematoma expansion (adjusted OR = 5.62; 95% CI, 1.23-40.23; P =.03).CONCLUSIONS: No single NCCT expansion marker had both high sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of revised hematoma expansion. Improved image-based analysis is needed to tackle limitations associated with current NCCT-based expansion markers.

TI  - Advancing High-Resolution Land Cover Mapping in Colombia: The Importance of a Locally Appropriate Legend
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the remote sensing frameworks related to land cover mapping is necessary to make informed policy, development, planning, and natural resource management decisions. These efforts are especially important in tropical countries where technical capacity is limited. Land cover legend specification is a critical first step when mapping land cover, with consequences for its subsequent use and interpretation of results. We integrated the temporal metrics of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and multispectral data (Sentinel-1 and Sentienel-2) with visual pixel classifications and field surveys using five machine learning algorithms that apply different statistical methods to assess the prediction and mapping of two different land cover legends at a high spatial resolution (10 m) in a tropical region with seasonal flooding. The evaluated legends were CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) and ECOSO, a legend that we defined based on the ecological and socio-economic conditions of the study area. Compared with previous studies, we obtained high accuracies for land cover modeling (kappa = 0.82) and land cover mapping (kappa = 0.76) when using ECOSO. We also found that the CORINE legend generated lower accuracies than the ECOSO legend (kappa = 0.79 for land cover modeling and kappa = 0.61 for the land cover mapping). Although CORINE was developed for European environments, it is the official land cover legend of Colombia, a South American country with tropical ecosystems not found in Europe. Therefore, some of the CORINE classes have ambiguous definitions for the study area, explaining the lower accuracy of its modeling and mapping. We used free and open-access data and software in this research; thus, our methods can be applied in other tropical regions.

TI  - Ground Surface Subsidence Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 in the "Kostolac" Open Pit Coal Mine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open pit coal mining affects surrounding populated areas, resulting in terrain surface deformation. Surface deformation should be monitored as often as possible to control deformations and prevent potential incidents. This paper analyzes time series deformation estimated from the Sentinel-1 satellite images using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry method to monitor subsidence rates caused by open pit mining activities. It is possible to measure deformations using classical geodetic methods, but those are rarely used in practice because they are time-consuming and expensive for application in large areas. Using the open access radar images from the Sentinel-1 mission, 513 images from the repository were downloaded between October 2016 and the end of December 2020. We present the processing steps in detail in order to establish a workflow for the automated processing of vertical displacement estimation using open source tools; a total of 402 images were processed: 215 images belonged to the ascending satellite orbit, 187 images belonged to the descending orbit, and 111 images were rejected because of adverse weather conditions. The PS InSAR technique has never been used for the mines of the Republic of Serbia or for land surveying practices related to deformation monitoring. The results based on the Sentinel-1 images were compared with results from geodetic leveling and with neotectonic uplift trends. The trend lines of vertical displacement obtained from PS and corresponding leveling are significantly similar (a Pearson correlation of 85% with a p-value of 0.015). The final evaluation reported results of vertical displacements at the leveling benchmark of -3.4 mm/year with the PS InSAR method and -2.7 mm/year with the leveling method. A comparison of the PS vertical displacements with a settlement model fits reasonably, suggesting that the measurements are valid. As four years of PS time series data is insufficient to establish undisputable conclusions on the neotectonics uplift, extending the time series (covering at least a decade) implies that this approach will become attractive in future neotectonic uplift trend estimations. This study illustrates not only the ability of Sentinel-1 data in mapping vertical deformations, but the obtained results could also be used for geohazard monitoring and land monitoring in general for the area of interest.

TI  - Satellite data reveal earlier and stronger phytoplankton blooms over fronts in the Gulf Stream region
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fronts affect phytoplankton growth and phenology by locally reducing stratification and increasing nutrient supplies. Biomass peaks at fronts have been observed in situ and linked to local nutrient upwelling and/or lateral transport, while reduced stratification over fronts has been shown to induce earlier blooms in numerical models. Satellite imagery offers the opportunity to quantify these induced changes in phytoplankton over a large number of fronts and at synoptic scales. Here we used 20 years of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) satellite data in a large region surrounding the Gulf Stream to quantify the impact of fronts on surface Chl a (used as a proxy for phytoplankton) in three contrasting bioregions, from oligotrophic to blooming ones, and throughout the year. We computed an heterogeneity index (HI) from SST to detect fronts and used it to sort fronts into weak and strong ones based on HI thresholds. We observed that the location of strong fronts corresponded to the persistent western boundary current fronts and weak fronts to more ephemeral submesoscale fronts. We compared Chl a distributions over strong fronts, over weak fronts, and outside of fronts in the three bioregions. We assessed three metrics: the Chl a excess over fronts at the local scale of fronts, the surplus in Chl a induced at the bioregional scale, and the lag in spring bloom onset over fronts. We found that weak fronts are associated with a local Chl a excess weaker than strong fronts, but because they are also more frequent, they contribute equally to the regional Chl a surplus. We also found that the local excess of Chl a was 2 to 3 times larger in the bioregion with a spring bloom than in the oligotrophic bioregion, which can be partly explained by the transport of nutrients by the Gulf Stream. We found strong seasonal variations in the amplitude of the Chl a excess over fronts, and we show periods of Chl a deficit over fronts north of 45 circle N that we attribute to subduction. Finally we provide observational evidence that blooms start earlier over fronts by 1 to 2 weeks. Our results suggest that the spectacular impact of fronts at the local scale of fronts (up to +60 %) is more limited when considered at the regional scale of bioregions (less than +5 %) but may nevertheless have implications for the region's overall ecosystem.

TI  - WetMapFormer: A unified deep CNN and vision transformer for complex wetland mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ramsar Convention of 1971 encourages wetland preservation, but it is unclear how climate change will affect wetland extent and related biodiversity. Due to the use of the self-attention mechanism, vision transformers (ViTs) gain better modeling of global contextual information and become a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, ViTs require enormous training datasets to activate their image classification power, and gathering training samples for remote sensing applications is typically costly. As such, in this study, we develop a deep learning algorithm called (WetMapFormer), which effectively utilizes both CNNs and vision transformer architectures for precise mapping of wetlands in three pilot sites around the Albert county, York county, and Grand Bay-Westfield located in New Brunswick, Canada. The WetMapFormer utilizes local window attention (LWA) rather than the conventional self-attention mechanism for improving the capability of feature generalization in a local area by substantially reducing the computational cost of vanilla ViTs. We extensively evaluated the robustness of the proposed WetMapFormer with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data and compared it with the various CNNs and vision transformer models which include ViT, Swin Transformer, HybridSN, CoAtNet, a multimodel network, and ResNet, respectively. The proposed WetMapFormer achieves F-1 scores of 0.94, 0.94, 0.96, 0.97, 0.97, 0.97, and 1 for the recognition of aquatic bed, freshwater marsh, shrub wetland, bog, fen, forested wetland, and water, respectively. As compared to other vision transformers, the WetMapFormer limits receptive fields while adjusting translational invariance and equivariance characteristics. The codes will be made available publicly at https://github.com/aj1365/ WetMapFormer.

TI  - Predicting Optical Water Quality Indicators from Remote Sensing Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Tropical Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality degradation of freshwater bodies is a concern worldwide, particularly in Africa, where data are scarce and standard water quality monitoring is expensive. This study explored the use of remote sensing imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms as an alternative to standard field measuring for monitoring water quality in large and remote areas constrained by logistics and finance. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with Landsat 8 imagery were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting three optically active water quality indicators observed monthly in the period from August 2016 to April 2022: turbidity (TUR), total dissolved solids (TDS) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The six ML algorithms studied were the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM), random forest regression (RF), XGBoost regression (XGB), AdaBoost regression (AB), and gradient boosting regression (GB) algorithms. XGB performed best at predicting Chl-a, with an R-2 of 0.78, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.78, mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.082 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.79 mu g/L. RF performed best at predicting TDS (with an R-2 of 0.79, NSE of 0.80, MARE of 0.082, and RMSE of 12.30 mg/L) and TUR (with an R-2 of 0.80, NSE of 0.81, and MARE of 0.072 and RMSE of 7.82 NTU). The main challenges were data size, sampling frequency, and sampling resolution. To overcome the data limitation, we used a K-fold cross validation technique that could obtain the most out of the limited data to build a robust model. Furthermore, we also employed stratified sampling techniques to improve the ML modeling for turbidity. Thus, this study shows the possibility of monitoring water quality in large freshwater bodies with limited observed data using remote sensing integrated with ML algorithms, potentially enhancing decision making.

TI  - Multispectral Satellite Image Analysis for Computing Vegetation Indices by R in the Khartoum Region of Sudan, Northeast Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the most destructive climate-related issues in the Sudan-Sahel region of Africa. As the assessment of desertification is possible by satellite image analysis using vegetation indices (VIs), this study reports on the technical advantages and capabilities of scripting the 'raster' and 'terra' R-language packages for computing the VIs. The test area which was considered includes the region of the confluence between the Blue and White Niles in Khartoum, southern Sudan, northeast Africa and the Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS images taken for the years 2013, 2018 and 2022, which were chosen as test datasets. The VIs used here are robust indicators of plant greenness, and combined with vegetation coverage, are essential parameters for environmental analytics. Five VIs were calculated to compare both the status and dynamics of vegetation through the differences between the images collected within the nine-year span. Using scripts for computing and visualising the VIs over Sudan demonstrates previously unreported patterns of vegetation to reveal climate-vegetation relationships. The ability of the R packages 'raster' and 'terra' to process spatial data was enhanced through scripting to automate image analysis and mapping, and choosing Sudan for the case study enables us to present new perspectives for image processing.

TI  - Review of Land Use Change Detection-A Method Combining Machine Learning and Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Land use change detection (LUCD) is a critical technology with applications in various fields, including forest disturbance, cropland changes, and urban expansion. However, the current review articles on LUCD tend to be limited in scope, rendering a comprehensive review challenging due to the vast number of publications. This paper systematically reviewed 3512 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core database between 1985 and 2022, utilizing a combination of bibliometric analysis and machine learning methods with LUCD as the main focus. The results indicated an exponential increase in the number of LUCD studies, indicating continued growth in this research field. Commonly used methods include classification-based, threshold-based, model-based, and deep learning-based change detection, with research themes encompassing forest logging and vegetation succession, urban landscape dynamics, and biodiversity conservation and management. To build an intelligent change detection system, researchers need to develop a flexible framework that integrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, land use type interpretation, and accuracy evaluation, given the continuous evolution and application of remote sensing data, deep learning, big data, and artificial intelligence.

TI  - The response and sensitivity of global vegetation to water stress: A comparison of different satellite-based NDVI products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an effective proxy for vegetation activity and terrestrial productivity, and the widely used global NDVI products include the third generation Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer NDVI (NDVI3g), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION NDVI (NDVIsp) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI (NDVItr). Here, for the first time, we investigated the differences between the three NDVIs in response and sensitivity to water stress represented by root zone soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit, self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index across climate zones, humidity gradients, vegetation types and tree cover gradients. Over the temperate and arid climates region, the three NDVIs show higher consistent response fractions (CRFs) to water stress in the water-limited regions, with their sensitivity being in the order of NDVI3g < NDVIsp < NDVItr. The three NDVIs tend to exhibit inconsistent re-sponses to water stress in the areas with higher humidity and tree cover, and their sensitivities to water stress fall as humidity and tree cover increase. In addition, the three NDVIs display higher CRFs and sensitivities to water stress over the non-forested areas. Our results also show that, in the cold climates region, the three NDVIs respond in the opposite way to water stress as that in water-limited areas, and NDVI3g has higher sensitivity to water stress than NDVIsp and NDVItr. This study highlights the differences between three NDVIs products for qualifying and quantifying their response and sensitivity to water stress.

TI  - Global declines of offshore gas flaring inadequate to meet the 2030 goal
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Monitoring of gas flaring (GF)-the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction-over most oil- and gas-producing areas is challenging due to high costs or difficult field investigations. As GF contributes to both global warming and air pollution, an up-to-date picture (locations, emissions and trends) of global offshore GF can help countries' energy decarbonization efforts substantially. Although high-resolution satellite sensors regularly capture high-temperature signals from GF, retrieving spatially explicit information and estimating GF volumes from petabyte images remain challenging. Here we developed a monitoring framework and compiled a 20 m resolution inventory of offshore GF sites by analysing similar to 8.53 million Sentinel-2 images. A robust model (R-2 > 0.99) was established to estimate offshore GF volumes from Sentinel-2 metrics. Our findings reveal that Sentinel-2 can pinpoint global offshore GFs to support scientifically sound decision-making; a vital few (similar to 20%) sites are responsible for >80% of offshore GF volumes, calling for more targeted regulations; and the offshore GF volumes have declined by 26.4% from 2016 to 2021. We conclude that the Zero Routine Flaring Initiative by the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership committing governments and oil companies to end routine flaring by no later than 2030 could be 5 years behind schedule.Monitoring of gas flaring (GF) can be expensive and practically difficult, but better information about global offshore GF is needed to inform decarbonization policies. This study presents a monitoring framework, a detailed inventory of offshore GF sites and estimates of GF volumes globally.

TI  - Frequency Distribution Analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) over Iran Using Remote Sensing Observations from Aqua MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental changes such as ablation of ice and snow, drying of lakes, deforestation, desertification and urbanization may affect the thermal properties of the land surface, and hence, it affects the land surface temperature (LST). MODIS LST data, make it possible to investigate the variations in the frequency distribution of LST. In this research, 16 years of MODIS\Aqua LST data (2002-2022) have been analyzed using principal component analysis. This study shows that the frequency distribution of LST in Iran depends to a great extent on altitude and then depends on the terrain surface features. Lakes, river systems, sand dunes, deserts, woodlands, forests and metropolitan areas are among the terrain surface features that affect the frequency distribution of LST. Hence, analysis of the frequency distribution of LST may be considered as a tool for identifying the geographical boundaries of these terrain features. Additionally, it could be a robust tool for tracking the changes in the boundaries of such geographical phenomena over time. Frequency analysis of LST in Iran reveals many natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. For example, the analysis shows that the drying out of Zayanderud downstream and Urmia Lake is related to man-made changes in the upstream. The comparison of the interdecadal of LST shows that the frequency of LST has increased in some temperature categories and decreased in some other temperature categories. In general, the frequency shift of LST both during the day and at night has been toward higher temperatures.

TI  - Dust storm forecasting through coupling LOTOS-EUROS with localized ensemble Kalman filter
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Super dust storms re-occurred over East Asia in 2021 spring and casted great health damages and property losses. It is essential to achieve an accurate dust forecast to reduce the damage for early warning. The forecasting system fundamentally relies on a numerical model which can forecast the full evolution of dust storms. However, large uncertainties exist in model forecasts. Meanwhile, various near-real-time observations are available that contain valuable dust information. A dust storm forecasting system is here developed through coupling a chemical transport model, LOTOS-EUROS, and Localized EnKF (LEnKF) assimilation approach. The assimilations are carried out via an interface of our self-designed assimilation toolbox, PyFilter v1.0. Ground-based PM10 mea-surements from air quality monitoring network are assimilated. Sequential assimilation tests are carried out over the 2021 spring super dust storms. The results show that the assimilation-based forecasting system produces a promising dust forecast than model-only forecast, and the improvements is also validated through comparing to the independent MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD). Superior performance is obtained when LEnKF is imple-mented, as the localization helps EnKF in resolving the PM10 measurements that have a large spatial variability with limited ensemble members. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted to exploit the distance -dependent localization for the LEnKF. Considering both cases, the optimal choice of the distance is tested to be around 500 km: the larger distance is less effective in removing the spurious correction, while the smaller one easily falls into the local optimum and the model would become divergent rapidly.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration assessment based on geographical and temporal weighted regression model and MCD19A2 from 2015 to 2020 in Xinjiang, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 is closely linked to both air quality and public health. Many studies have used models combined with remote sensing and auxiliary data to inverse a large range of PM2.5 concentrations. However, the data's spatial resolution is limited. and better results might have been obtained if higher resolution data had been used. Therefore, this paper establishes a geographical and temporal weighted regression model (GTWR) and estimates the PM2.5 concentration in Xinjiang from 2015 to 2020 using 1 km resolution MCD19A2 (MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Aerosol Optical Thickness Daily L2G Global 1km SIN Grid V006) data and 9 auxiliary variables. The findings indicate that the GTWR model performs better than the simple linear regression (SLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models in terms of accuracy and feasibility in retrieving PM2.5 concentrations in Xinjiang. Simultaneously, by combining the GTWR model with MCD19A2 data, a spatial distribution map of PM2.5 with better spatial resolution can be obtained. Next, the regional distribution of annual PM2.5 concentrations in Xinjiang is consistent with the terrain from 2015 to 2020. The low value area is primarily found in the mountainous area with higher terrain, while the high value area is primarily in the basin with lower terrain. Overall, the southwest is high and the northeast is low. In terms of time change, the six-year PM2.5 shows a single peak distribution with 2016 as the inflection point. Lastly, from 2015 to 2020, the seasonal average PM2.5 concentration in Xinjiang has a significant difference, thereby showing winter (66.15 & mu;g/m(3))>spring (52.28 & mu;g/m(3))>autumn (40.51 & mu;g/m(3))>summer (38.63 & mu;g/m(3)). The research shows that the combination of MCD19A2 data and GTWR model has good applicability in retrieving PM2.5 concentration.

TI  - Management and outcomes of pseudoaneurysms presenting with late hemorrhage following pancreatic surgery: A six-year experience from a tertiary care center
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/PurposeLate hemorrhage following pancreatic surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pseudoaneurysm (PSA) is an important source of late hemorrhage, which is effectively and safely managed by embolization. We aim to retrospectively review the outcomes of embolization for pseudoaneurysms causing late post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage over a period of six-years at our tertiary care center.MethodsBetween 2014 and 2020, 616 pancreatic surgeries were performed and 25 patients had late hemorrhage (occurring > 24 hours post-operatively). The clinical parameters related to late hemorrhage, associated complications, embolization details, treatment success and their short-and long-term outcomes were analyzed.ResultsSixteen of 25 patients had PSA on digital subtraction angiography. Embolization was performed in these patients with technical and clinical success rates of 94.1% and 100%, respectively. Compared to patients without PSA, patients with PSA had significant hemoglobin drop (2.5 g/dL vs. 1.5 g/dL, p = 0.01), higher incidence of sentinel bleed (50% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.05) and lower requirement for surgery for bleeding (0% vs. 44.4%, p = 0.02). Clincally relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula and bile leak were seen in 72% and 52% of patients, respectively. Eight of these embolized patients died due to sepsis. The long-term outcome was good, once the patients were discharged.ConclusionLate hemorrhage after pancreatic surgery was associated with high mortality due to complications such as pancreatic fistula and bile leak. Sentinel bleeding was an important clinical indicator of PSA. Angiographic embolization is safe and effective without any adverse short or long-term outcomes.

TI  - Reservoir Ice Conditions from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing and ERA5-Land: The Manicouagan Hydroelectric Reservoir Case Study
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir ice can have an important impact on the watershed scale and influence hydraulic operations. On the other hand, hydropower generation can also impact the ice regime. In this study, multi-source satellite and ERA5-land data are used to evaluate ice conditions. Specifically, ice-controlling variables (temperature, water levels), ice regime (cover/deformation, thickness) and their interrelations are assessed for a 5-year period from 2017 to 2021. The methodology is applied to the Manicouagan reservoir, one of the largest hydropower reservoirs in Quebec, Canada. The satellite-based land surface temperatures (LSTs) suggest that winter 2021 was the hottest one. Overall, MODIS and Landsat LSTs agree with the ERA5-land temperatures. Ice backscatter from Sentinel-1 indicates that, in general, the reservoir is completely covered by ice from January to March. A correlation of 0.6 and 0.8 is observed between C- and Ku-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal and ice thickness, respectively. Important ice changes inferred from Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) occur approximately at the position where the largest ERA5-land ice thickness differences are observed. Winter water levels are also evaluated using satellite altimetric data to verify their influence on the ice dynamics. They show a decreasing tendency as the winter advances.

TI  - Forecasting harmful algae blooms: Application to Dinophysis acuminata in northern Norway
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dinophysis acuminata produces Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) that contaminate natural and farmed shellfish, leading to public health risks and economically impacting mussel farms. For this reason, there is a high interest in understanding and predicting D. acuminata blooms. This study assesses the environmental conditions and develops a sub-seasonal (7 - 28 days) forecast model to predict D. acuminata cells abundance in the Lyngen fjord located in northern Norway. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to predict future D. acuminata cells abundance by using the past cell concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR), and wind speed. Cells concentration of Dinophysis spp. are measured in-situ from 2006 to 2019, and SST, PAR, and surface wind speed are obtained by satellite remote sensing. D. acuminata only explains 40% of DST variability from 2006 to 2011, but it changes to 65% after 2011 when D. acuta prevalence reduced. The D. acuminata blooms can reach concentration up to 3954 cells l- 1 and are restricted to the summer during warmer waters, varying from 7.8 to 12.7 degrees C. The forecast model predicts with fair accuracy the seasonal development of the blooms and the blooms amplitude, showing a coefficient of determination varying from 0.46 to 0.55. SST has been found to be a useful predictor for the seasonal development of the blooms, while the past cells abundance is needed for updating the current status and adjusting the blooms timing and amplitude. The calibrated model should be tested operationally in the future to provide an early warning of D. acuminata blooms in the Lyngen fjord. The approach can be generalized to other regions by recalibrating the model with local observations of D. acuminata blooms and remote sensing data.

TI  - Secure itemset hiding in smart city sensor data
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sensor data that is often collected in the Internet of Things (IoT) or any smart city environment should be protected against security and privacy concerns. Often, sensor data that is shared by devices in smart cities contains sensitive or private information that can often be shared over different networks and by different smart applications. In the last decade, the area of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) has received a lot of attention as the amount of data received and collected daily is huge. Unfortunately, PPDM mostly applies to binary data. To improve the usefulness of PPDM, we present a more usable version for smart cities called Privacy-Preserving Utility Mining (PPUM), in the form of a Maximal Sensitive Utility-Maximal Sensitive ConflIct (MSU-MSI) algorithm. MSU-MSI finds any conflicting items that may contain sensitive itemsets with high-utility and sanitizes them, stripping them of sensitive and private information while maintaining utility. Any transactions encountered that contain sensitive itemsets are first fed through sanitization processes. This is followed by calculating the total number of items that conflict, and then removing them so sanitization processes can operate more efficiently so as to not redo known sanitization processes. We conduct an in-depth experimental analysis, where our detailed methodology is compared directly with state-of-the-art frameworks such as MSU-MIU, MSU-MAU, HHUIF and MSCIF. Our proposed MSU-MSI shows a higher performance in missing cost, in particular when dealing with highly dense or highly sparse datasets. Moreover, our novel framework is shown to achieve an excellent performance with regards to similarity in database structure and database utility.

TI  - Landsat Satellites Observed Dynamics of Snowline Altitude at the End of the Melting Season, Himalayas, 1991-2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the dynamics of snowline altitude at the end of the melting season (SLA-EMS) is beneficial in predicting future trends of glaciers and non-seasonal snow cover and in comprehending regional and global climate change. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of SLA-EMS in nine glacier areas of the Himalayas, utilizing Landsat images from 1991 to 2022. The potential correlations between SLA-EMS, alterations in temperature, and variations in precipitation across the Himalayas region glacier are also being analyzed. The results obtained are summarized below: (1) the Landsat-extracted SLA-EMS exhibits a strong agreement with the minimum snow coverage at the end of the melting season derived from Sentinel-2, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.6% and a kappa coefficient of 0.85. The SLA-EMS can be accurately obtained by using this model. (2) In the last 30 years, the SLA-EMS in the study areas showed an upward trend, with the rising rate ranging from 0.4 m.a(-1) to 9.4 m.a(-1). Among them, the SLA-EMS of Longbasaba rose fastest, and that of Namunani rose slowest. (3) The SLA-EMS in different regions of the Himalayas in a W-E direction have different sensitivity to precipitation and temperature. However, almost all of them show a positive correlation with temperature and a negative correlation with precipitation.

TI  - Unexpected deterioration of O3 pollution in the South Coast Air Basin of California: The role of meteorology and emissions*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution has long been a prominent environmental threat due to its adverse impacts on vulnerable populations and ecosystems. In recent years, an unexpected increase in O3 levels over the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California has been observed despite reduced precursor emissions and the driving factors behind this abnormal condition remain unclear. In this work, we combine ambient measurements, satellite data, and air quality modeling to investigate O3 and precursor emission trends and explore the impacts of meteorological variability and emission changes on O3 over the SoCAB from 2012 to 2020. Changes in O3 trends were characterized by declining O3 in 2012-2015, and increasing O3 afterwards with the most extreme O3 exceedances in 2020. Basin-wide increases of MDA8 O3 concentrations over warm season were depicted between 2012 and 2020, with the most significant enhancements (5-10 ppb) observed in San Bernardino County. Persistent heatwaves and weak ventilation on consecutive days were closely correlated with O3 exceedances (r2 above 0.6) over inland SoCAB. While decreasing trends in NOx (-4.1%/yr) and VOC emissions (-1.8%/yr) inferred from emission inventory and satellites during 2012-2020 resulted in a slow transition for O3 sensitivity from VOCslimited to NOx-limited, model simulations performed with fixed meteorology indicate that unfavorable meteorological conditions could largely offset regulation benefits, with meteorology anomaly-induced monthly O3 changes reaching 20 ppb (May 2020) and the deterioration of O3 pollution in 2016, 2017, and 2020 was largely attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions. Nevertheless, anthropogenic emission changes may act as the dominant factor in governing O3 variations across the SoCAB when net effects of meteorology are neutral (typically 2018). This work provides a comprehensive assessment of O3 pollution and contributes valuable insights into understanding the long-term changes of O3 and precursors in guiding future regulation efforts in the SoCAB.

TI  - Optimal soil organic matter mapping using an ensemble model incorporating moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, portable X-ray fluorescence, and visible near-infrared data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil mapping of soil organic matter (SOM) is necessary because of its importance for carbon sequestration, soil health, and food security. However, large-scale digital soil mapping of SOM remains a challenge to improve accuracy and provide more local information. To address this knowledge gap, a strategy that incorporates remote and proximal sensing data into an ensemble model for the digital soil mapping is proposed. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, portable X-ray fluorescence, and visible near-infrared spectroscopy data from 402 soil samples were used to map the SOM at a resolution of 90 m, model the SOM with random forest, cubist, and ensemble models, and evaluate its environmental factors in the northeastern and northern Chinese plains, a typical agricultural plain (approximately 66,000,000 ha). The digital maps of the SOM were derived along with their uncertainties. The results show that the visible near-infrared and portable X-ray fluorescence data play an important role in the SOM distribution. Inclusion of these data in the model, improved the R-p(2) by 6.25-35.42 %, and reduced the root mean square error of the prediction by 0.30-1.54 g kg(-1). The ensemble model, which included remote and proximal sensing variables, outperformed the results of previous studies with a root mean square error of 6.68 g kg 1 and provided more detailed information. Thus, this study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The SOM product obtained by this strategy was able to accurately control soil management, and the structural equation model showed that human activities exerted a direct influence on SOM comparable to the overall effect of natural factors on SOM. The contribution of straw mulching to human activities was great with path coefficient >0.50. This suggests that land management, especially straw mulching, should be improved in this area. In summary, this study proposed a novel strategy for accurately and efficiently obtaining SOM products for agricultural decision-making, terrestrial carbon cycling, and carbon stock estimation. Future advancements will focus on more accurate and detailed global SOM maps or carbon storage by integrating multiple models with remote sensing data and proximal sensing data from available soil spectral libraries.

TI  - Dynamic Water Quality Changes in the Main Stream of the Yangtze River from Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are important indicators of water quality. Although water quality can be obtained with high accuracy using traditional measurement methods, the cost is high and the area is limited. In the past a single-satellite remote sensing system was normally used to estimate water quality at a large scale, while bands were fewer with limited accuracy. In this paper, inversion models for TN and TP are obtained and validated in the main stream of the Yangtze River using multi-source remote sensing data. The joint inversion models for TN and TP have higher accuracy (R-2=0.81 and 0.86, RMSE=0.51 and 0.10 mg L-1) than the single-satellite inversion models (R-2=0.61-0.62 and 0.59-0.75, RMSE=0.41-0.61 and 0.07-0.12 mg L-1). Using these models, water quality changes in the Yangtze River are obtained from 2019 to 2021. It is found that TN and TP in the upstream and downstream are high. In spring and autumn, the water quality is poor. The water quality in the Yangtze River is mostly Class III with improvement. Furthermore, it is found that TN and TP are negatively correlated with the water level, temperature and flow in Jiujiang. The p value between water quality and the water level is higher than for other factors, with -0.76 and -0.64 for TN and TP, respectively.

TI  - Climate and Management Practices Jointly Control Vegetation Phenology in Native and Introduced Prairie Pastures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate, human disturbances, and management practices jointly control the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface phenology. However, most studies solely focus on analyzing the climatic controls on the inter-annual variability and trends in vegetation phenology. Investigating the main and interacting effects of management practices and climate might be crucial in determining vegetation phenology and productivity. This study examined the impacts of climate and management practices on vegetation phenology and productivity in adjacent native and introduced prairie pastures, which have detailed long-term management records, by combining climate, management, and satellite remote sensing data (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat). Modeled gross primary production (GPP) using vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) was also included to investigate the dynamics of productivity. When comparing the impacts of the same management practices on different pastures, we used paired comparison, namely, comparing the native and introduced prairies side by side in the same year. The interactions of management practices and climate were investigated through comparing years with similar management but different climate (e.g., years with rainfall or not following baling events) in the same pasture. Results showed that air temperature (Ta) was an important factor in determining the start of the season (SOS) and the length of the season (LOS). Total rainfall (RF) during the annual growing season (AGS, derived from vegetation indices (VIs)) had the largest explanatory power (R-2 = 0.53) in explaining the variations in the seasonal sums of VIs. The variations in GPP were better explained by RF (R-2 = 0.43) than Ta (R-2 = 0.14). Using the thermal growing season (March-October) or AGS climate factors did not show large differences in determining the relationships between phenology, GPP, and climate factors. Drought shortened the LOS and decreased GPP. In terms of management practices, grazing generally reduced the VIs and burning induced early greening-up and enhanced vegetation growth. Drought plus other management practices (e.g., grazing or baling) greatly affected vegetation phenology and suppressed GPP. The negative impacts (i.e., removal of biomass) of grazing on vegetation was compensated by enhanced vegetation growth after good RF. This study demonstrated that the interactions of climate and management practices could be positive (burning plus baling in a good RF year) or negative (grazing/baling plus drought), and can significantly affect vegetation phenology and production.

TI  - Coastal erosion and accretion on the Caribbean coastline of Costa Rica long-term observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies show erosive processes on the Caribbean coastline of Costa Rica. These processes may be accelerated as a result of an increase in the sea level. This study covered the entire Caribbean coastline of Costa Rica between 1986 and 2019. This allowed reporting new sites with accelerated coastal accretion and erosion processes, as well as confirming other processes that have already been identified. The methodology was based on shoreline rising images obtained from Landsat and on their processing in a Geographical Information System supported with the "Digital Shoreline Analysis System" (DSAS) tool. The presence of important accretion areas related to the mouth of significant fluvial systems, such as Colorado, Parismina, Matina, Estrella, and Sixaola rivers is highlighted. Moreover, eight beach sectors showing erosion problems have been analyzed. The beach located to the south of Isla Portillos and beaches located on Cahuita Point stand out due to their intensity. Additionally, an intense beach erosion process has been detected at Soropta in Panam ' a. It should be highlighted that six of the eight sites showing erosion are located within protected zones. This confirms the little anthropic interference on these processes. It was not possible to find a difference between the north and the south of the Caribbean Coast in terms of the magnitude of coastal erosion. The contribution of the rivers is a key factor in the North Caribbean while the responses to the 1991 earthquake conditioned the behavior on the South coast. The results may serve as a basis for management plans or adaptation to climate change proposals.

This paper seeks to analyze those emergent skills, show the skills' impact on the self-organizing skills ecosystem and illustrate how the skills provide a conduit to wholesale global change by creating a talent pipeline designed to generate economic vitality.Design/methodology/approach - Through a system thinking lens and by exploring related skills ecosystem literature, this paper explores the concept of the self-organizing learn-earn skills ecosystem and the role technology plays in the development, implementation and continuation of the process. Tools such as customer, actor, transformation, worldview, owner and environment (CATWOE) and levers have been implemented to probe the maturity, challenges and opportunities the emerging ecosystem provides.Findings - As the ecosystem evolves, there is much to be done to align stakeholders to reach the ecosystem's full potential. However, by applying a systems lens to the work in progress, greater clarity and definition can be achieved, thereby generating more forward momentum to propel the skills movement toward the intended outcomes.Originality/value - While there are many recent publications that define the elements, parameters and attributes of the referenced skills ecosystem, this article aggregates information, through a system thinking lens, to provide a deeper, more cohesive analysis.

TI  - Tide2Topo: A new method for mapping intertidal topography accurately in complex estuaries and bays with time-series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal zones serve as a critical transition between land and ocean and are periodically inundated by tides. They are extremely important to coastal communities as it provides diverse habitats and buffers against marine hazards. However, the reduced river sediment together with sea level rise and coastal reclamation have caused the widespread loss of intertidal areas. Reliable, high-resolution, and up-to-date intertidal topography maps are key information for coastal vulnerability assessment and restoration. Existing approaches to intertidal topography reconstruction involve significant ground surveys, with limited spatial coverage, accuracy, and efficiency, thus, restricting their potential to generalize globally. To address these issues, we propose a pixel-based approach to construct intertidal topography from dense Sentinel-2 satellite time-series and limited ground truth surveys, named as Tide2Topo. Tide2Topo differs conceptually from the widely used waterline method since it considers tidal inundation frequency as a topographic indicator rather than instantaneous waterlines. Therefore, Tide2Topo does not involve manual selection of images at different tide levels. The relationship between intertidal inundation frequency and elevation is calibrated using linear and polynomial models based on a few transect measurements instead of tidal height, preventing errors introduced by inaccurate tidal data. The proposed Tide2Topo was applied and validated in the UK and China over several complicated estuaries and bays with extensive muddy flats or sandy beaches. The results demonstrated that the topography derived from intertidal inundation frequency compared to LiDAR or UAV photogrammetric observations has a root mean square error ranging from 16 to 38 cm. The large errors were found in the tidal channel areas where the inundation frequency calculation was prone to uncertainty. Dense Sentinel-2 time-series observations ensure finer sampling of the tidal cycle, thereby not only eliminating errors caused by spatial interpolation but also maintaining the accuracy of elevation estimations at pixel level. Tide2Topo is a robust, portable and rapid method that is well suited to largescale intertidal topography reconstruction. Future work could use Sentinel-1 SAR as an alternative data source for Tide2Topo, realizing seasonal or annual monitoring of intertidal geomorphological changes.

TI  - Improvement and Assessment of Gaofen-3 Spotlight Mode 3-D Localization Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spotlight image acquired by the Gaofen-3 satellite has a resolution of 1 m, which has great potential for 3-D localization. However, there have been no public reports on the 3-D localization accuracy evaluation of Gaofen-3 spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Here, three study areas were selected from this perspective, and the SAR spotlight stereo images of the study area were acquired using Gaofen-3. In the case of no ground control points (GCPs), based on the Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) model, these images were used for initial 3-D localization; the plane accuracy was better than 10 m in general, and the elevation accuracy was worse than 37 m in general. Subsequently, the RPC model was optimized using geometric calibration technology, and the 3-D localization accuracy was assessed again. The elevation accuracy was significantly improved, which was generally better than 5 m. The plan accuracy was also improved, and it was generally better than 6 m. It can be seen that Gaofen-3 spotlight stereo images are of good quality, and high plane accuracy can be obtained even without GCPs. Geometric calibration technology improves the 3-D localization accuracy, and the elevation accuracy optimization effect is remarkable. Moreover, the optimization effect of plane accuracy is affected by the properties of stereo-image pairs. The optimization effect of plane accuracy is obvious for asymmetric stereo-image pairs, and the optimization effect of plane accuracy is general for symmetric stereo-image pairs.

T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy is considered standard of care for gastric cancer to provide the best possible outcomes and pathologic staging. However, D2 gastrectomy is a technically demanding operation and reported to be associated with increased complications and mortality. Application of sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept in gastric cancer has the potential to reduce patient morbidity; however, SLN techniques are not established for gastrectomy, in part due to lack of practical tracers. An effective and convenient tracer with enhanced SLN accumulation is critically needed.Methods Mannose-labelled magnetic tracer `FerroTrace' and fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) were injected laparoscopically into the stomach submucosa of 8 healthy swine under general anaesthesia. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging was used to highlight draining lymphatic pathways containing ICG, while preoperative T2-weighted MRI and ex vivo magnetometer probe measurements were used to identify nodes containing FerroTrace. Lymphadenectomy was performed either robotically (n = 2) or via laparotomy (n = 6).Results Mixing ICG and FerroTrace ensured concurrence of fluorescent and magnetic signals in SLNs. An initial trial with robotic dissection removed all magnetic LNs (n = 4). In the subsequent laparotomy study that targeted all ICG-LNs based on intraoperative fluorescence imaging, dissection removed an average of 4.7 +/- 1.2 fluorescent, and 2.0 +/- 1.3 magnetic LNs per animal. Both MRI and magnetometer detected 100% of SLNs (n = 7). FerroTrace demonstrated high specificity to SLNs, which contained 76 +/- 30% of total lymphotropic iron, and 88 +/- 20 % of the overall magnetometer signal.Conclusions Through utilisation of this dual tracer approach, SLNs were identified via preoperative MRI, visualised intraoperatively with fluorescence imaging, and confirmed with a magnetometer. This combination pairs the sensitivity of ICG with SLN-specific FerroTrace and can be used for reliable SLN detection in gastric cancer, with potential applications in neoadjuvant therapy.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Mapping with VHR and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping is the first step in monitoring urban sprawl and its environmental, economic and societal impacts. While satellite imagery and vegetation indices are commonly used for LULC mapping, the limited resolution of these images can hamper object recognition for Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). In this study, we utilize very high-resolution (VHR) optical imagery with a resolution of 50 cm to improve object recognition for GEOBIA LULC classification. We focused on the city of Nice, France, and identified ten LULC classes using a Random Forest classifier in Google Earth Engine. We investigate the impact of adding Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture information and spectral indices with their temporal components, such as maximum value, standard deviation, phase and amplitude from the multi-spectral and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. This work focuses on identifying which input features result in the highest increase in accuracy. The results show that adding a single VHR image improves the classification accuracy from 62.62% to 67.05%, especially when the spectral indices and temporal analysis are not included. The impact of the GLCM is similar but smaller than the VHR image. Overall, the inclusion of temporal analysis improves the classification accuracy to 74.30%. The blue band of the VHR image had the largest impact on the classification, followed by the amplitude of the green-red vegetation index and the phase of the normalized multi-band drought index.

TI  - Remote sensing in forestry: current challenges, considerations and directions
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing has developed into an omnipresent technology in the scientific field of forestry and is also increasingly used in an operational fashion. However, the pace and level of uptake of remote sensing technologies into operational forest inventory and monitoring programs varies notably by geographic region. Herein, we highlight some key challenges that remote sensing research can address in the near future to further increase the acceptance, suitability and integration of remotely sensed data into operational forest inventory and monitoring programs. We particularly emphasize three recurrent themes: (1) user uptake, (2) technical challenges of remote sensing related to forest inventories and (3) challenges related to map validation. Our key recommendations concerning these three thematic areas include (1) a need to communicate and learn from success stories in those geographic regions where user uptake was successful due to multi-disciplinary collaborations supported by administrative incentives, (2) a shift from regional case studies towards studies addressing 'real world' problems focusing on forest attributes that match the spatial scales and thematic information needs of end users and (3) an increased effort to develop, communicate, and apply best-practices for map and model validation including an effort to inform current and future remote sensing scientists regarding the need for and the functionalities of these best practices. Finally, we present information regarding the use of remote sensing for forest inventory and monitoring, combined with recommendations where possible, and highlighting areas of opportunity for additional investigation.

TI  - Evaluation of Copernicus DEM and Comparison to the DEM Used for Landsat Collection-2 Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Having highly accurate and reliable Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the Earth's surface is critical to orthorectify Landsat imagery. Without such accuracy, pixel locations reported in the data are difficult to assure as accurate, especially in more mountainous landscapes, where the orthorectification process is the most challenging. To this end, the Landsat Calibration and Validation Team (Cal/Val) compared the Copernicus DEM (CopDEM) to the DEM that is currently used in Collection-2 processing (called "Collection-2 DEM"). NGS ground-surveyed and lidar-based ICESat-2 points were used, and the CopDEM shows improvement to be less than 1 m globally, except in Asia where the accuracy and resolution of the DEM were greater for the CopDEM compared to the Collection-2 DEM. Along with slightly improved accuracy, the CopDEM showed more consistent results globally due to its virtually seamless source and consistent creation methods throughout the dataset. While CopDEM is virtually seamless, having greater than 99% of their data coming from a single source (Tandem-X), there are significantly more voids in the higher elevations which were mostly filled with SRTM derivatives. The accuracy of the CopDEM fill imagery was also compared to the Collection-2 DEM and the results were very similar, showing that the choice of fill imagery used by CopDEM was appropriate. A qualitative assessment using terrain-corrected products processed with different DEMs and viewing them as anaglyphs to evaluate the DEMs proved useful for assessing orbital path co-registration. While the superiority of the CopDEM was not shown to be definitive by the qualitative method for many of the regions assessed, the CopDEM showed a clear advantage in Northern Russia, where the Collection-2 DEM uses some of the oldest and least accurate datasets in the compilation of the Collection-2 DEM. This paper presents results from the comparison study, along with the justification for proceeding with using the Copernicus DEM in future Landsat processing. As of this writing, the Copernicus DEM is planned to be used in Collection-3 processing, which is anticipated to be released no earlier than 2025.

TI  - Lightweight Omnidirectional Radiation Protection for a Photon-Counting Imaging System in Space Applications
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns about the impact of space radiation on spacecraft and their internal instruments have prompted the need for effective protection. However, excessive protection can increase the costs and difficulty of space launches, making it crucial to achieve better shielding protection of lighter weights. In real space orbits, we observed the interference of charged particles on photon-counting imaging detectors and plan to address this issue by adding a shielding ring to the side wall of the detector input terminal. Additionally, a local protection structure was proposed for electronics, where the outer edge was increased to enable particles to reach the same thickness as the shielding box within the PCB range. This approach resulted in an omnidirectional spatial shielding thickness that was nearly identical at any point on the PCB surface. Furthermore, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the energy loss of electrons and protons in materials such as aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Through this analysis, we determined the optimal mass ratio of Al, Ta, and HDPE to achieve the lowest ionization doses at an object's location in the particle environment of the FY-3 satellite orbit. This protection strategy provides a useful design concept for photoelectric detection instruments with high sensitivity.

TI  - Integrating Copernicus Satellite Products and Ground-Truthing for Documenting and Monitoring the Impact of the 2022 Extreme Floods in Pakistan on Cultural Heritage
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The catastrophic floods that hit Pakistan in summer 2022 represent the latest example of climate change-induced extreme events occurring in South Asia. In addition to the dramatic impact on population and infrastructures, this event threatened UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS) and properties of national interest. However, while a wealth of national and international mapping initiatives were conducted based on satellite imagery to assess damage to people, buildings and economic goods, the impact caused to archaeological sites and monuments has not been fully unveiled yet. To bridge this gap and provide an integrated approach that can be used by local end-users to assess damage and, in turn, collect evidence to inform and improve risk management plans, the present paper integrates Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery and mapping products derived from them (e.g., Copernicus Emergency Management Service Global Flood Mapping) with ground-truthing and geospatial datasets. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration between geologists, archaeologists, remote sensing and satellite image analysts, the integration methodology was tested on UNESCO and other heritage sites of national relevance located in the two mostly affected regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh that were intentionally selected to represent different typologies of cultural heritage and governance in Pakistan. Finally, the information extracted from the present analysis was assessed in relation to the current national and international legislations, the official state of conservation reports and the activities conducted at each site to protect them against flood events. Given the accessibility to ready-to-use Copernicus products and that the present analysis can be replicated over time and other sites, the proposed methodology provides a feasible means to exploit satellite data in post-disaster mapping situations and contribute to the decision-making process for risk management.

TI  - The myth of Woman: Simone de Beauvoir and the anthropological discourse on myth
T2  - HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In her feminist classic The Second Sex (1949), Simone de Beauvoir refers to 'the myth of Woman' to denote images of womanhood that rest upon and reinforce beliefs in a static, feminine essence. This article aims to understand what makes this myth mythical. The author argues that Beauvoir employs the term 'myth' to establish a parallel between the way in which modern men relate to women and the worldview of so-called primitives - who she portrays as ruled by a specific, non-rational mode of thought. Beauvoir could thus be read as appropriating an early anthropological discourse on myth, the representatives of which linked myth to non-Western 'primitive' societies, while they depicted Western modernity as haunted by its own primitive-mythical past. However, when situated against this background, Beauvoir's writings on myth are also shown to challenge the very premises upon which this still influential anthropological discourse rest. Whereas the early anthropologists attributed the survival of 'primitive' elements in modernity to a defiance of rationality, Beauvoir's argument suggests that this is better explained by examining how such elements serve the interests of those allegedly rational individuals and groups in power - who she describes as having employed rationality to defend their mythical beliefs.

TI  - Three-dimensional distribution of dust aerosols over the Tarim Basin and the Tibet Plateau during 2007-2021 derived from CALIPSO lidar observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols have been transported from the Tarim Basin (TB) to the Tibet Plateau (TP), which threatens the ecological security of the Asian water tower. However, the dust transportation process has not been understood fully so far. In this study, the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of dust aerosols over the TB and the TP was constructed and the transportation process was analyzed by utilizing Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data. The meteorological background of one typical dust event was discussed and the trajectory of the pollutants was simulated by employing the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ECMWF-ERA5) data and the Backward-trajectory Model. Besides, the importance of multiple natural factors was ranked using Random Forest Model. The results showed that dust aerosols were transported from the TB to the TP noticeably at 4-6 km above sea level, and 4 km above sea level was the dividing height of the dust transportation from the TB to the TP. Dust Aerosol Optical Depth (DAOD) value in the TB and the TP had significant monthly variations, which reached its highest in May and gradually declined. High frequency value of dust occurrence in the TB and the TP appeared in spring. There were always stable dust layers over the TB and the TP with an average thickness of about 0.64 km, which reached their thickest in spring. Furthermore, influenced by updrafts and prevailing westerlies, dust aerosols from the TB were carried to the northern slope of the TP and continued to be uplifted to higher than 6 km to its main body. Relative humidity and average wind speed could inhibit and promote regional air pollution respectively.

TI  - Analysis and Dynamic Evaluation of Eco-Environmental Quality in the Yellow River Delta from 2000 to 2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization and population growth, the ecological environment in the Yellow River Delta has undergone significant changes. In this study, Landsat satellite data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) were utilized to dynamically evaluate the changes in eco-environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta region using the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). Additionally, the CASA model was used to estimate net primary productivity (NPP) and explore the relationship between vegetation NPP, land-use and land-cover change (LUCC), and eco-environmental quality to reveal the complexity and related factors of eco-environmental quality changes in this region. The results show that: (1) Over the past 20 years, the eco-environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta region has changed in a "V" shape. The eco-environmental quality near the Yellow River Basin is relatively better, forming a diagonal "Y" shape, while the areas with poorer eco-environmental quality are mainly distributed in the coastal edge region of the Yellow River Delta. (2) The response of vegetation NPP to eco-environmental quality in the Yellow River Delta region is unstable. (3) Urban construction land in the Yellow River Delta region is strongly correlated with RSEI, and the absolute value of the dynamic degree of land use is as high as 8.78%, with significant land transfer changes. The correlation between arable land and RSEI is weak, while coastal mudflats are negatively correlated with RSEI, with the minimum absolute value of the dynamic degree of land use being -1.01%, and significant land transfer changes. There is no correlation between forest land and RSEI. Our research results can provide data support for the eco-environmental protection and sustainable development of the Yellow River Delta region and help local governments to take corresponding measures.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Interferometry and UAV Aerial Survey for Mapping Coseismic Ruptures: Mts. Sibillini vs. Mt. Etna Volcano
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The survey and structural analysis of surface coseismic ruptures are essential tools for characterizing seismogenic structures. In this work, a procedure to survey coseismic ruptures using satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, directing the survey using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), is proposed together with a field validation of the results. The Sentinel-1 A/B Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath TOPSAR mode offers the possibility of acquiring images with a short revisit time. This huge amount of open data is extremely useful for geohazards monitoring, such as for earthquakes. Interferograms show the deformation field associated with earthquakes. Phase discontinuities appearing on wrapped interferograms or loss-of-coherence areas could represent small ground displacements associated with the fault's ruptures. Low-altitude flight platforms such as UAV permit the acquisition of high resolution images and generate 3D spatial geolocalized clouds of data with centimeter-level accuracy. The generated topography maps and orthomosaic images are the direct products of this technology, allowing the possibility of analyzing geological structures from many viewpoints. We present two case studies. The first one is relative to the 2016 central Italian earthquakes, astride which the InSAR outcomes highlighted quite accurately the field displacement of extensional faults in the Mt. Vettore-M. Bove area. Here, the geological effect of the earthquake is represented by more than 35 km of ground ruptures with a complex pattern composed by subparallel and overlapping synthetic and antithetic fault splays. The second case is relative to the Mt. Etna earthquake of 26 December 2018, following which several ground ruptures were detected. The analysis of the unwrapped phase and the application of edge detector filtering and other discontinuity enhancers allowed the identification of a complex pattern of ground ruptures. In the Pennisi and Fiandaca areas different generation of ruptures can be distinguished, while previously unknown ruptures pertaining to the Acireale and Ragalna faults can be identify and analyzed.

TI  - Role of physical processes in regulating the biological responses in the Eastern Arabian Sea during the late southwest monsoon
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding physical properties and associated biological responses in the marine ecosystem is critical for fisheries and assessing the ocean's role in determining the fate of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. This study reports the different roles of southwest monsoon (SWM) upwelling, oceanic fronts, and mesoscale eddies in supplying nutrients and fueling phytoplankton production in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS). In-situ measurements of physical parameters along with the distribution of biogeochemical parameters in the 100 m water column over a wide latitudinal transect from 8 degrees N to 21 degrees N (Station II-1 to II-14 at 1 degrees interval) along the 68 degrees E were carried out during the late SWM (September 11-19) of 2017. We found distinct features in the study area from the in-situ measurements and satellite data. Primarily, oceanic fronts along with higher instabilities caused vertical mixing at stations II-6, and II-10 (13 degrees N and 17 degrees N). Secondly, eddy-induced lateral advection of high productive water from the Western Arabian Sea (WAS) resulted in high phytoplankton biomass at stations II-7, and II-8 (14 degrees N and 15 degrees N), which led to high concentrations of pigments (chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and fucoxanthin). SWM upwelling induced higher phytoplankton biomass at northern stations II-13 and II-14 and is evident from the higher total organic carbon (TOC), high total bacterial count (TBC) and Chl-a concentration (up to 0.371 mu g/L at II-14). The difference in time lag for vertical mixing at II-6 and II-10 are responsible for the contrasting biological responses in these stations. The present study showed that along with SWM upwelling, eddy-induced lateral advection from WAS and oceanic fronts are also increasing phytoplankton biomass in the EAS. The present study suggests that the high phytoplankton biomass prompted by upwelling, oceanic fronts, and mesoscale eddies can influence CO2 sequestration and the prevailing subsurface oxygen minimum zone in the EAS.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Temporal modelling of Lymnaea natalensis (Krauss, 1848) in tropical aquatic habitats
T2  - ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymnaea natalensis is the only snail intermediate host of Fasciola gigantica, the causative agent of fascioliasis, in Nigeria. The species also serves as intermediate host for many other African trematode species of medical and veterinary importance, and it is found throughout the country. However, there is no detailed information on the factors that influence its distribution and seasonal abundance in the tropical aquatic habitats in Nigeria. This study used the geographic information system and remotely sensed data to develop models for predicting the distribution of L. natalensis in South-Western Nigeria. Both land surface temperature (LST) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted from Landsat satellite imagery; other variables (slope and elevation) were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) while rainfall data were retrieved from the European Meteorology Research Programme (EMRP). These environmental variables were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable habitats of L. natalensis using exploratory regression. A total of 1410 L. natalensis snails were collected vis-a-vis 22 sampling sites. Builtup areas recorded more L. natalensis compared with farmlands. There was no significant difference in the abundance of snails with season (p > 0.05). The regression models showed that rainfall, NDVI, and slope were predictors of L. natalensis distribution. The habitats suitable for L. natalensis were central areas, while areas to the north and south were not suitable for L. natalensis.

TI  - The prognostic role of mitotic rate in cutaneous malignant melanoma: Evidence from a multicenter study on behalf of the Italian Melanoma Intergroup
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to improve the understanding of the prognostic value of tumor mitotic rate (TMR) in cutaneous melanoma and assessed its significance as a predictor for overall, melanoma-specific, and recurrence-free survival. Patients and MethodsThis is a retrospective multicenter Italian cohort study of 13,016 patients diagnosed with and treated for invasive primary melanoma between 2005 and 2020 with median follow-up of 5.5 years. The survival probability was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method, hazard ratios (HRs), and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality and recurrence/death by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. ResultsHigher dermal mitoses number was associated with decreased overall survival. Among patients with TMR 0/mm(2), 1/mm(2), 2/mm(2)-3/mm(2), 4/mm(2)-10/mm(2), and >10/mm(2), 5-year overall survival (OS) was 97.3%, 93.6%, 88.3%, 73.0%, and 60.9%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, compared to TMR of 0/mm(2), HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.08-1.68), 1.70 (95% CI, 1.40-2.07), 2.04 (95% CI, 1.67-2.49), and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.90-3.00) for 1 mitoses/mm(2), 2 mitoses/mm(2)-3 mitoses/mm(2), 4 mitoses/mm(2)-10 mitoses/mm(2), and >10 mitoses/mm(2), respectively. A similar increase in risks was observed in melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The HRs for MSS and RFS for the highest compared to the lowest TMR category were 3.01 (95% CI, 2.20-4.11) and 2.26 (95% CI, 1.88-2.73), respectively. Sentinel lymph-node biopsy positivity was significantly associated with TMR increase even with adjustment for several potential confounders. ConclusionsA clear association was demonstrated between an increasing TMR and decreased OS, MSS, and RFS, suggesting a reconsideration of TMR prognostic role for future inclusion in the melanoma staging system. Plain Language Summary The 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer for melanoma staging removed tumor mitotic rate (TMR) from the staging criteria for T1 melanomas, giving way to ulceration and tumor thickness as stronger prognostic predictors.However, it is still recommended that TMR should be assessed and recorded in all primary invasive melanomas.In a large retrospective multicenter study on primary invasive melanomas, we investigated the prognostic value of TMR to assess its significance as survival predictor.Our results showed a clear association between increasing TMR and decreased patients' survival, suggesting that TMR should be considered for inclusion in the melanoma staging system.

TI  - Influence of spatial heterogeneity on landslide susceptibility in the transboundary area of the Himalayas
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping is a challenging task if spatial heterogeneity is considered. Considering the difference in topography and neglected landslide events, particularly in transboundary areas of the Himalayas, it is necessary to precisely model the susceptibility in relation to spatial heterogeneity. In this study, we have used multisource remote sensing data, open-source geographical data, and multisource landslide event inventories for the past 20 years (2000-2020). In addition, machine learning methods were implemented to establish a landslide susceptibility model with internal landslide drivers within the transboundary areas. Considering the spatial heterogeneity, the landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slope in the transboundary areas of the Himalayas was determined using Google Earth Engine (GEE), an online cloud platform. Furthermore, we generated a thematic map of landslide susceptibility at a spatial resolution of 500 m, considering the contribution rate of each landslide internal driver of the landslide. Finally, we analyzed the landslide drivers in areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event point density. The main results are as follows: (i) elevation, aspect, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are top three internal drivers of susceptibility on the northern and southern slopes. Meanwhile, the northern slope is dominated by geological, seismic, and soil structure parameters while the southern slope is dominated by terrain, geomorphological, and land cover parameters; (ii) elevation, aspect, and FVC of 3400-4100 m, 260 degrees -335 degrees, and 8 %-30 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the northern slope, while elevation, aspect, and FVC of 980-2100 m, 170 degrees -230 degrees, 70 %-98 %, respectively, are related to high landslide susceptibility on the southern slope, which presents more extreme landslide-susceptible areas compared with the northern slope; and (iii) areas with high landslide susceptibility and low landslide event density are universal. These insights demonstrate that modeling and analyzing the heterogeneity of landslide susceptibility of the northern and southern slopes in transboundary areas of the Himalayas are required to provide a reference for locating and preventing landslide disasters, increase to the focus on landslide-susceptible areas, improve the data gap between landslide inventories and actual landslide events, and reduce the impact of missing data in landslide inventories for this region.

TI  - Remote sensing and machine learning applications for aboveground biomass estimation in agroforestry systems: a review
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - The estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in agroforestry systems using remote sensing has proliferated in the last decades. Similarly, machine learning is also being used in AGB assessments. This study reviews the applications of remote sensing and machine learning for AGB estimation in agroforestry systems (AFS). A detailed review was conducted using 33 recent papers by extracting and comparing information on agroforestry type, data sources, methodology, and model accuracy. Statistical tests were performed to evaluate the differences in performances. High- and very-high-resolution imageries (less than 2 m) are widely used for AGB assessment because they helped to delineate heterogeneous features of AFS. Object-based image analysis yielded classification accuracy of up to 90 percent in some cases. Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression are the most common algorithms used for AGB estimation. However, there are no statistically significant differences in the performance between machine learning and other models. Similarly, scholars incorporated spectral indices with spectral bands, texture, and biophysical variables as covariate categories into AGB estimation models. The study finds no significant differences in results (R-squared) by adding more covariate categories. The accuracy of AGB estimates depends upon multiple factors, such as the spectral and spatial resolution, number and types of covariates, methods for AFS delineation and AGB estimation, and types and sizes of AFS. Despite some of the methodological challenges around measuring understory vegetation, advancements in cloud computing like Google Earth Engine and the availability of high-resolution datasets present opportunities for wider use of remote sensing for biomass estimation of AFS. Remote sensing and machine learning have the potential to estimate aboveground biomass over a large area with high accuracy and contribute to carbon monitoring.

TI  - Inversion of Soil Moisture on Farmland Areas Based on SSA-CNN Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a crucial factor in the field of meteorology, hydrology, and agricultural sciences. In agricultural production, surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for crop yield estimation and drought monitoring. For SSM inversion, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a trustworthy data source. However, for agricultural fields, the use of SAR data alone to invert SSM is susceptible to the influence of vegetation cover. In this paper, based on Sentinel-1 microwave remote sensing data and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, a convolution neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-CNN) was suggested to invert farmland SSM. The feature parameters were first extracted from pre-processed remote sensing data. Then, the correlation analysis between the extracted feature parameters and field measured SSM data was carried out, and the optimal combination of feature parameters for SSM inversion was selected as the input data of the subsequent models. To enhance the performance of the CNN, the hyper-parameters of CNN were optimized using SSA, and the SSA-CNN model was built for SSM inversion based on the obtained optimal hyper-parameter combination. Three typical machine learning approaches, including generalized regression neural network, random forest, and CNN, were used for comparison to show the efficacy of the suggested method. With an average coefficient of determination of 0.80, an average root mean square error of 2.17 vol.%, and an average mean absolute error of 1.68 vol.%, the findings demonstrated that the SSA-CNN model with the optimal feature combination had a better accuracy among the 4 models. In the end, the SSM of the study region was inverted throughout four phenological periods using the SSA-CNN model. The inversion results indicated that the suggested method performed well in local situations.

TI  - Toward a versatile spaceborne architecture for immediate monitoring of the global methane pledge
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global methane pledge paves a fresh, critical way toward carbonneutrality. However, it remains largely invisible and highly controversialdue to the fact that planet-scale and plant-level methane retrievals haverarely been coordinated. This has never been more essential within thenarrow window to reach the Paris target. Here we present a two-tieredspaceborne architecture to address this issue. Using this framework, wefocused on the United States, China, the Middle East, and North Africa, andsimultaneously uncovered methane-abundant regions and plumes. These includenew super-emitters, potential leakages, and unprecedented multiple plumes ina single source. More importantly, this framework is shown to challengeofficial emission reports that possibly mislead estimates from global,regional, and site scales, particularly by missing super-emitters. Ourresults show that, in principle, the above framework can be extended to bemulti-tiered by adding upcoming stereoscopic measurements and suitableartificial intelligence, and thus it is sufficiently versatile for immediateand future monitoring of the global methane pledge.

TI  - The Role of Climate in Ignition Frequency
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Many fire management agencies aim to detect and suppress all ignitions within their jurisdiction and may benefit from understanding the causes of year-to-year variation. Ignition variation is likely to be associated with climatically driven changes in fuel quantity or moisture in landscapes where ignition sources vary little over similar temporal scales. We assessed how monthly ignitions varied in south-eastern Australia in response to climate anomalies over approximately nine years. Once accounting for seasonal effects, ignitions increased with temperature and vapour pressure deficit anomalies and decreased with precipitation anomalies. These findings indicate that climatic conditions play a role in limiting ignition frequency via effects on fuel moisture. Our models predicted that warmer and drier conditions during our study caused considerable increases in ignition frequency compared to the long-term average reference period (1961-1990). Like many fire-prone landscapes around the world, our study area is projected to become hotter and drier because of climate change. Fire management agencies will need to improve fire detection and suppression capabilities under a future climate.

TI  - Assessing long-term rainfall trends and changes in a tropical watershed Brantas, Indonesia: an approach for quantifying the agreement among satellite-based rainfall data, ground rainfall data, and small-scale farmers questionnaires
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agreement between meteorological data and societal perception is essential in supporting a robust policy making and its implementation. In humid tropic watersheds like Brantas, such consensus is important for water resources management and policies. This study exemplifies an effort to understand the long-term rainfall characteristics within the watershed and to build a common link among the differing data sources: CHIRPS rainfall satellite data, rain gauge data, and farmers perceptions. Six rainfall characteristics were derived using statistical measures from the scientific data and then were translated to a series of structured questionnaires given to small-scale farmers. A consensus matrix was built to examine the level of agreement among three data sources, supporting the spatial pattern of the meteorological data and farmers perception. Two rainfall attributes were classified with high agreement, four with moderate and one with low agreement. The agreements and discrepancies of rainfall characteristics were found in the study area. The discrepancies originated from the accuracy in translating scientific measurements to practical meanings for farmers, complexity of the farming system, the nature of phenomena in questions, and farmers' ability to record long-term climatic events. This study shows an implication that a combined approach to link scientific data and societal data is needed to support powerful climate policy making.

TI  - Consumption in Non-Pastoral Regions Drove Three-Quarters of Forage-Livestock Conflicts in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage-livestock conflict (FLC) is a major anthropogenic cause of rangeland degradation. It poses tremendous threats to the environment owing to its adverse impacts on carbon sequestration, water supply and regulation, and biodiversity conservation. Existing policy interventions focus on the in situ FLCs induced by local production activities but overlook the role of consumption activities in driving FLCs. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal variations in China's FLCs and the domestic final consumers at the county level by combining remote sensing data and multi-regional input-output model. Results show that during 2005-2015, China's pastoralism induced an average of 82 million tons of FLCs per year. Domestic final demand was responsible for 85-93% of the FLCs in China. There was spatiotemporal heterogeneity in domestic consumption driving China's FLCs. In particular, the final demand of non-pastoral regions was responsible for around three-quarters (74-79%) of the total FLCs throughout the decade. The rangeland-based livestock raising, agricultural and sideline product processing, and catering sectors are important demand-side drivers. These findings can support targeted demand-side strategies and interregional cooperation to reduce China's FLCs, thus mitigating rangeland degradation.

TI  - A cloud-integrated GIS for forest cover loss and land use change monitoring using statistical methods and geospatial technology over northern Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, forest cover has experienced significant impacts from fires and deforestation worldwide due to direct human activities and climate change. This paper assesses trends in forest cover loss and land use and land cover changes in northern Algeria between 2000 and 2020 using datasets extracted from Google Earth Engine (GEE), such as the Hanssen Global Forest Change and MODIS Land Cover Type products (MCD12Q1). Classification was performed using the pixel-based supervised machine-learning algorithm called Random Forest (RF). Trends were analyzed using methods such as Mann-Kendall and Sen. The study area comprises 17 basins with high rainfall variability. The results indicated that the forest area decreased by 64.96%, from 3718 to 1266 km2, during the 2000-2020 period, while the barren area increased by 40%, from 134,777 to 188,748 km2. The findings revealed that the Constantinois-Seybousse-Mellegue hydrographic basin was the most affected by deforestation and cover loss, exceeding 50% (with an area of 1018 km2), while the Seybouse River basin experienced the highest percentage of cover loss at 40%. Nonparametric tests showed that seven river basins (41%) had significantly increasing trends of forest cover loss. According to the obtained results, the forest loss situation in Algeria, especially in the northeastern part, is very alarming and requires an exceptional and urgent plan to protect forests and the ecological system against wildfires and climate change. The study provides a diagnosis that should encourage better protection and management of forest cover in Algeria.

TI  - Spatial Assessment and Prediction of Urbanization in Maseru Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of geospatial data infrastructure and earth observation technology can play an essential role in facilitating the monitoring of sustainable urban development. However, in most developing countries, a spatiotemporal evaluation of urban growth is still lacking. Maseru, Lesotho's capital and largest city, is growing rapidly due to various socioeconomic and demographic driving forces. However, urban expansion in developing countries has been characterized by entangled structures and trends exacerbating numerous negative consequences such as ecological degradation, the loss of green space, and pollution. Understanding the urban land use and land cover (LULC) dynamic is essential to mitigate such adverse impacts. This study focused on mapping and quantifying the urban extension in Maseru, using Landsat imagery from 1988 to 2019, based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. We also simulated and predicted LULC changes for the year 2050 using the cellular automata model of an artificial neural network (ANN-CA). Our results showed a notable increase in the built-up area from 15.3% in 1988 to 48% in 2019 and bare soil from 12.3% to 35.3%, while decreased agricultural land (21.7 to 1.7%), grassland (43.3 to 10.5%) and forest vegetation (5.5 to 3.2%) were observed over the study period. The classified maps have high accuracy, between 88% and 95%. The ANN-CA projections for 2050 show that built-up areas will continue to increase with a decrease in agricultural fields, bare soil, grasslands, water bodies and woody vegetation. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed, long-term study to provide insights on urban growth to planners and other stakeholders in Maseru in order to improve the implementation of the Maseru 2050 urban plan.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change has had a significant impact on glacier recession, particularly in the Arctic, where glacier meltwater is an important contributor to global sea-level rise. Therefore, it is important to accurately quantify glacier recession within this sensitive region, using multiple observations of glacier extent. In this study, we mapped 480 glaciers in Novaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, using object-based image analysis applied to multispectral Landsat satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine and quantify the area changes between 1986-89 and 2019-21. The results show that in 1986-89, the total glacierized area was 22 990 +/- 301 km(2), in 2000-01 the area was 22 525 +/- 308 km(2) and by 2019-21 the glacier area reduced to 21 670 +/- 292 km(2), representing a total of 5.8% reduction in glacier area between 1986-89 and 2019-21. Higher glacier area loss was observed on the Barents Sea coast (7.3%) compared to the Kara (4.2%), reflecting previously observed differences in warming trends. The accuracy of the automatically generated outlines of each layer (1986-89, 2000-01 and 2019-21) was evaluated by comparing with manually corrected outlines (reference data) using random sampling, resulting in an overall accuracy estimate of between 96 and 97% compared to the reference data. This automated approach in Google Earth Engine is a promising tool for rapidly mapping glacier change that reduces the amount of time required to generate accurate glacier outlines.

TI  - Estimation and Validation of Sub-Pixel Needleleaf Cover Fraction in the Boreal Forest of Alaska to Aid Fire Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires, which are a natural part of the boreal ecosystem in Alaska, have recently increased in frequency and size. Environmental conditions (high temperature, low precipitation, and frequent lightning events) are becoming favorable for severe fire events. Fire releases greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide into the environment, creating a positive feedback loop for warming. Needleleaf species are the dominant vegetation in boreal Alaska and are highly flammable. They burn much faster due to the presence of resin, and their low-lying canopy structure facilitates the spread of fire from the ground to the canopy. Knowing the needleleaf vegetation distribution is crucial for better forest and wildfire management practices. Our study focuses on needleleaf fraction mapping using a well-documented spectral unmixing approach: multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). We used an AVIRIS-NG image (5 m), upscaled it to 10 m and 30 m spatial resolutions, and applied MESMA to all three images to assess the impact of spatial resolution on sub-pixel needleleaf fraction estimates. We tested a novel method to validate the fraction maps using field data and a high-resolution classified hyperspectral image. Our validation method produced needleleaf cover fraction estimates with accuracies of 73%, 79%, and 78% for 5 m, 10 m, and 30 m image data, respectively. To determine whether these accuracies varied significantly across different spatial scales, we used the McNemar statistical test and found no significant differences between the accuracies. The findings of this study enhance the toolset available to fire managers to manage wildfire and for understanding changes in forest demography in the boreal region of Alaska across the high-to-moderate resolution scale.

TI  - InSAR-Based Detection of Subsidence Affecting Infrastructures and Urban Areas in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of deformation signals associated with seismicity in alluvial plain areas is a challenging topic that, however, is increasingly studied thanks to the great aid given by remote sensing techniques that exploit Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This study focuses on the determination of the deformation field within the Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy), in the area comprising Modena, Reggio Emilia, and Parma cities. SAR data acquired along both orbits during the Sentinel-1 and Cosmo-SkyMed satellite missions were processed with the Small Baseline Subset interferometric technique from June 2012, after the serious seismic swarm of May 2012, to January 2022, just before the two earthquakes occurred in February 2022. The results, validated with Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, do not highlight displacements correlated with the seismicity but, thanks to their high spatial resolution, it was possible to discriminate areas affected by noticeable subsidence phenomena: (i) the highly industrialized areas located north of the municipalities of Reggio Emilia and Modena cities and (ii) a sector of the high-speed railway sited north of the Reggio Emilia city centre, close to the Reggio Emilia AV Mediopadana station. Here we show that, at least since 2012, the latter area is affected by subsidence which can be related to the secondary consolidation process of the fine soils loaded by the railway embankment. The piezometric level analysis also suggests that the lowering of the groundwater table could accelerate the subsidence rate, affecting the stability of infrastructures in highly populated and industrialized areas.

TI  - Assessment of HARMONIE-AROME in the simulation of the convective activity associated to a subtropical transition using satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Subtropical transition events (STT) are a challenge for forecasting and research due to the hybrid characteristics they give to the cyclones. The ability and skillfulness of the HARMONIE-AROME model to reproduce the cloud structure and convection associated to the October 2014 STT is here evaluated. Brightness temperature, cloud top height and accumulated precipitation are assessed against satellite data using traditional skill scores and object-based techniques specific to forecasting spatial evaluation. The results present differences in the simulation of the cyclone between the periods before and after the transition. They also show a very good performance of the model in the location of the events and a good simulation of the intensity of the variables. The performance is sub-optimal for the estimation of the sizes of the convective objects. Brightness temperature and cloud top heights yield very good results in general, with a slight overestimation in both cases. However, the model struggles to capture the accumulated precipitation. There is scarce work evaluating the HARMONIEAROME model in this type of events; nevertheless, the results are in line with those produced by the simulations with other numerical models. The overall performance of the model is very adequate, although it might be hindered by the internal stability of the model produced by the deep-convection computation.

TI  - Cyclone Yaas: A Curse to Coastal People of Odisha and West Bengal (India)
T2  - NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article describes the intensification of cyclonic storm Yaas from a Depression over the east-central Bay of Bengal (BoB) to a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm over the north-west BoB (Odisha coast), its decay as a depression over the central parts of Jharkhand, and the role of windswept rain and storm surge in flooding with other devastations. For the visualization of flooded areas over the coastal tract of Odisha and West Bengal, the Sentinel-1 SAR dataset has been analysed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. The results from the pixel-based analysis claim with 96.33% overall accuracy that nearly 1593.06 km(2) of coastal land has been inundated due to intense rainfall and storm surges. So, this paper helps to understand how a cyclonic storm like Yaas can also cause significant damage to the Coastal People of Odisha and West Bengal and make their lives miserable.

TI  - An adapted hourly Himawari-8 fire product for China: principle, methodology and verification
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Wildfires exert strong influences on the environment, ecology, economy and public security. However, the existing hourly Himawari-8 fire product produced by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) presents large uncertainties and is not suitable for reliable real-time fire monitoring in China. To fill this gap, the National Satellite Meteorological Center (NSMC) proposed an adaptive hourly Himawari-8 fire product for China based on the original Himawari-8 source by employing a dynamical threshold for fire extraction and a database of ground thermal sources. According to the visually extracted reference and consistency check, we found that the NSMC-Himawari-8 fire product effectively removed a majority of false fire alarms included in the original Himawari-8 fire product. Based on a rare field-collected ground reference dataset, we evaluated the reliability of original Himawari-8 and NSMC-Himawari-8 fire products across China. The overall accuracy of the raw Himawari-8 fire product was 54% and 59% (not considering the omission errors), respectively. As a comparison, by identifying more real fire pixels and avoiding a majority of false fire alarms, the overall accuracy of the NSMC-Himawari-8 fire product was 80% and 84% (not considering the omission errors), respectively, making it an ideal source for improved real-time fire monitoring across China. This research also provides a useful reference for employing a local dataset of underlying surfaces and thermal sources to enhance the accuracy of global fire products in specific regions. The NSMC-Himawari-8 fire product can be downloaded at http://figshare.com (last access: 17 April 2023) with the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21550248 (Chen et al., 2022a).

TI  - Prediction of pathologic complete response after single-dose MR-guided partial breast irradiation in low-risk breast cancer patients: the ABLATIVE-2 trial-a study protocol
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPartial breast irradiation (PBI) is standard of care in low-risk breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Pre-operative PBI can result in tumor downstaging and more precise target definition possibly resulting in less treatment-related toxicity. This study aims to assess the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate one year after MR-guided single-dose pre-operative PBI in low-risk breast cancer patients.MethodsThe ABLATIVE-2 trial is a multicenter prospective single-arm trial using single-dose ablative PBI in low-risk breast cancer patients. Patients >= 50 years with non-lobular invasive breast cancer <= 2 cm, grade 1 or 2, estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, and tumor-negative sentinel node procedure are eligible. A total of 100 patients will be enrolled. PBI treatment planning will be performed using a radiotherapy planning CT and -MRI in treatment position. The treatment delivery will take place on a conventional or MR-guided linear accelerator. The prescribed radiotherapy dose is a single dose of 20 Gy to the tumor, and 15 Gy to the 2 cm of breast tissue surrounding the tumor. Follow-up MRIs, scheduled at baseline, 2 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after PBI, are combined with liquid biopsies to identify biomarkers for pCR prediction. BCS will be performed 12 months after radiotherapy or after 6 months, if MRI does not show a radiologic complete response. The primary endpoint is the pCR rate after PBI. Secondary endpoints are radiologic response, toxicity, quality of life, cosmetic outcome, patient distress, oncological outcomes, and the evaluation of biomarkers in liquid biopsies and tumor tissue. Patients will be followed up to 10 years after radiation therapy.DiscussionThis trial will investigate the pathological tumor response after pre-operative single-dose PBI after 12 months in patients with low-risk breast cancer. In comparison with previous trial outcomes, a longer interval between PBI and BCS of 12 months is expected to increase the pCR rate of 42% after 6-8 months. In addition, response monitoring using MRI and biomarkers will help to predict pCR. Accurate pCR prediction will allow omission of surgery in future patients.

TI  - A Unified Physically Based Method for Monitoring Grassland Nitrogen Concentration with Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of satellite missions provides vast opportunities for continuous vegetation monitoring, crucial for precision agriculture and environmental sustainability. However, accurately estimating vegetation traits, such as nitrogen concentration (N%), from Landsat 7 (L7), Landsat 8 (L8), and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data is challenging due to the diverse sensor configurations and complex atmospheric interactions. To address these limitations, we developed a unified and physically based method that combines a soil-plant-atmosphere radiative transfer (SPART) model with the bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function. This approach enables us to assess the effect of rugged terrain, viewing angles, and illumination geometry on the spectral reflectance of multiple sensors. Our methodology involves inverting radiative transfer model variables using numerical optimization to estimate N% and creating a hybrid model. We used Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate the inverted variables into the hybrid model for N% prediction, resulting in a unified approach for N% estimation across different sensors. Our model shows a validation accuracy of 0.35 (RMSE %N), a mean prediction interval width (MPIW) of 0.35, and an R2 of 0.50, using independent data from multiple sensors collected between 2016 and 2019. Our unified method provides a promising solution for estimating N% in vegetation from L7, L8, and S2 satellite data, overcoming the limitations posed by diverse sensor configurations and complex atmospheric interactions.

TI  - Regional Gravity Model of Greece Based on Satellite, Marine and Terrestrial Data
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Greece is a country structured by land, several islands and sea. A regional gravity model of such a country demands the involvement of several types of gravity data in order to cover all its territory. In this paper, we present the development of a regional combined gravity model of Greece and its surrounding area, by integrating terrestrial, marine (shipborne and altimetry-derived gravity data) and satellite data (GOCE and GRACE data). These kinds of data, especially the terrestrial and marine ones, have passed quality and validation control since they were collected from different organizations, which means that they probably have been acquired and processed with different parameters and formulas. Following that, their integration was accomplished with the application of the least-squares collocation (LSC). Therefore, a newly combined regional gravity model of Greece and its surrounding areas has been developed. This gravity model can be valuable for regional geological and geophysical studies of Greece, since it provides homogeneously the distribution of Complete Bouguer anomaly (CBA) all over Greece, with updated gravity data and in good agreement with the initial gravity datasets that have been used.

TI  - Mapping and simulating the spatial-temporal changes in the Lagos wetland ecosystem: A step-by-step approach to creating a carbon-neutral, sustainable urban city
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lagos is the largest megacity in Africa, with numerous lagoons and wetlands. Due to anthropogenic activities, Lagos' wetlands have undergone significant alterations in the last few decades. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the campaign programs for carbon neutrality in the city offer a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of managing water-related habitats, such as wetlands. Wetlands are essential to accomplishing the SDGs because they provide a solution to many global issues like climate change, food inse-curity, and water scarcity. In some ways, each of the SDGs is related to wetlands, but SDGs 6 and 13 are particularly significant to this study. The application of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a crucial tactic for monitoring the achievement of these SDGs.Objectives: The study aims to map and simulate the spatial-temporal changes in the Lagos wetland from 2000 to 2050 for the achievement of a carbon-neutral city.Methods: In this study, Landsat ETM+ (2000, 2010) and OLI 2020 were used to monitor the spatial-temporal changes in Lagos wetlands. The maximum likelihood classification method was adopted for the supervised classification. The simulation analysis was done with the cellular automata-Markov model.Results: The findings show that the water body increased throughout the study, rising from 658.76 km2 in 2000 to 681.60 km2 in 2010, and to 712.0 km2 in 2020. Marshy areas have decreased progressively from 39.41 km2 in 2000 to 14.48 km2 in 2010 and 0.078 km2 in 2020. Swamps and mangrove wetland classes had changed from 448.24 km2 and 406.29 km2 in 2000 to 317.74 km2 and 538.87 km2 respectively in 2010, and to 435.29 km2 and 405.33 km2 respectively in 2020. The simulated results show that water bodies, swamps, marshy areas, and mangroves will respectively change to 711.99 km2 and 747.11 km2, 405.26 km2 and 400.16 km2, 0.15 km2 and 0.13 km2, as well as 455.29 km2 and 455.30 km2 in the simulated years 2030-2050.Conclusion: The study shows that Lagos has witnessed spatial-temporal changes in its wetland classes within the last two decades. The results prove that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for studying water-related habitats such as wetlands.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARGUMENTATION IN CONTEXT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our time is an apocalyptic time, but the argumentation in this apocalyptic time has hardly been studied by scholars of argumentation. This article shows how both Donald Trump and the jihadist warriors of ISIS appeal to an apocalyptic worldview in their argumentation. The three topos of evil, time and authority from Stephen O'Leary's Arguing the Apocalypse are used in the analysis. Both Trump supporters and jihadist warriors see themselves as fighting for God and their enemies as representing evil forces. For scholars of argumentation the role of arguments woven into narratives that become whole worldviews needs to be studied more thoroughly.

TI  - Evaluation of SST Data Products from Multi-Source Satellite Infrared Sensors in the Bohai-Yellow-East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of sea surface temperature (SST) is of utmost importance in the realm of oceanography. The increasing utilization of satellite data in SST research has highlighted the crucial need to compare and evaluate various satellite data sources. Using iQuam2 in situ SST data, this study aims to assess the accuracy of SST datasets obtained from three polar-orbiting satellites (AVHRR, Modis-Aqua, and Modis-Terra) and one geostationary satellite (Himawari-8) in the Bohai-Yellow-East China Sea (BYECS) throughout 2019. The results showed a strong correlation between satellite and in situ data, with R correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99. However, the accuracy of the satellite datasets exhibited some variability, with Himawari-8 showing the highest deviation error and MODIS-Aqua showing the least. Subsequently, the Modis-Aqua data were used as a benchmark to evaluate the SST data of the other three satellites over the previous six years (July 2015-June 2021). The results indicate that, in addition to intricate temporal variations, the deviations of the three satellites from Modis-Aqua also show significant spatial disparities due to the effect of seawater temperature. Compared to Modis-Aqua, the deviation of Himawari-8 generally displayed a negative trend in BYECS and showed pronounced seasonal variation. The deviation of AVHRR showed a negative trend across all regions except for a substantial positive value in the coastal region, with the time variation exhibiting intricate features. The SST values obtained from MODIS-Terra exhibited only marginal disparities from MODIS-Aqua, with positive values during the day and negative values at night. All three satellites showed significantly abnormal bias values after December 2020, indicating that the MODIS-Aqua-derived SST reference dataset may contain outliers beyond this period. In conclusion, the accuracy of the four satellite datasets varies across different regions and time periods. However, they could be effectively utilized and integrated with relevant fusion algorithms to synthesize high-precision datasets in the future.

TI  - Defensive symbiosis in the wild: Seasonal dynamics of parasitism risk and symbiont-conferred resistance
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasite-mediated selection can rapidly drive up resistance levels in host populations, but fixation of resistance traits may be prevented by costs of resistance. Black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) benefit from increased resistance to parasitoids when carrying the defensive bacterial endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa. However, due to fitness costs that come with symbiont infection, symbiont-conferred resistance may result in either a net benefit or a net cost to the aphid host, depending on parasitoid presence as well as on the general ecological context. Balancing selection may therefore explain why in natural aphid populations, H. defensa is often found at intermediate frequencies. Here we present a 2-year field study where we set out to look for signatures of balancing selection in natural aphid populations. We collected temporally well-resolved data on the prevalence of H. defensa in A. f. fabae and estimated the risk imposed by parasitoids using sentinel hosts. Despite a marked and consistent early-summer peak in parasitism risk, and significant changes in symbiont prevalence over time, we found just a weak correlation between parasitism risk and H. defensa frequency dynamics. H. defensa prevalence in the populations under study was, in fact, better explained by the number of heat days that previous aphid generations were exposed to. Our study grants an unprecedentedly well-resolved insight into the dynamics of endosymbiont and parasitoid communities of A. f. fabae populations, and it adds to a growing body of empirical evidence suggesting that not only parasitism risk, but rather multifarious selection is shaping H. defensa prevalence in the wild.

TI  - An in-field heat treatment to reduce <i>Cercospora beticola</i> survival in plant residue and improve Cercospora leaf spot management in sugarbeet
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSugarbeets account for 55 to 60% of U.S. sugar production. Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), primarily caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora beticola, is a major foliar disease of sugarbeet. Since leaf tissue is a primary site of pathogen survival between growing seasons, this study evaluated management strategies to reduce this source of inoculum. MethodsFall- and spring-applied treatments were evaluated over three years at two study sites. Treatments included standard plowing or tilling immediately post-harvest, as well as the following alternatives to tillage: a propane-fueled heat treatment either in the fall immediately pre-harvest or in the spring prior to planting, and a desiccant (saflufenacil) application seven days pre-harvest. After fall treatments, leaf samples were evaluated to determine C. beticola viability. The following season, inoculum pressure was measured by monitoring CLS severity in a susceptible beet variety planted into the same plots and by counting lesions on highly susceptible sentinel beets placed into the field at weekly intervals (fall treatments only). ResultsNo significant reductions in C. beticola survival or CLS were observed following fall-applied desiccant. The fall heat treatment, however, significantly reduced lesion sporulation (2019-20 and 2020-21, P < 0.0001; 2021-22, P < 0.05) and C. beticola isolation (2019-20, P < 0.05) in at-harvest samples. Fall heat treatments also significantly reduced detectable sporulation for up to 70- (2021-22, P < 0.01) or 90-days post-harvest (2020-21, P < 0.05). Reduced numbers of CLS lesions were observed on sentinel beets in heat-treated plots from May 26-June 2 (P < 0.05) and June 2-9 (P < 0.01) in 2019, as well as June 15-22 (P < 0.01) in 2020. Both fall- and spring-applied heat treatments also reduced the area under the disease progress curve for CLS assessed the season after treatments were applied (Michigan 2020 and 2021, P < 0.05; Minnesota 2019, P < 0.05; 2021, P < 0.0001). DiscussionOverall, heat treatments resulted in CLS reductions at levels comparable to standard tillage, with more consistent reductions across year and location. Based on these results, heat treatment of fresh or overwintered leaf tissue could be used as an integrated tillage-alternative practice to aid in CLS management.

TI  - Landslide detection and inventory updating using the time-series InSAR approach along the Karakoram Highway, Northern Pakistan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karakoram Highway (KKH) is frequently disrupted by geological hazards mainly landslides which pose a serious threat to its normal operation. Using documented inventory, optical imagery interpretation, and frequency-area statistics, the features of slope failure, the spatial distribution, and their link to numerous contributing factors have all been effectively explored along the KKH. An updated inventory for the area was recreated using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) persistent scatterer (PS) technology to further investigate millimetre-accurate measurements of slope deformation (V-slope). Utilizing the PS approach, Sentinel-1 data from Jan 2018 to Jan 2022 were processed by which we obtained a deformation rate (V-Slope) that varies between 0 and 364 mm/year. A total number of 234 landslides were cited from the literature and classified while 29 new potential landslides were detected and several pre-existing landslides were redefined by the InSAR approach, which was incorporated to generate an updated landslide susceptibility model with 86.6% of prediction precision in the area under curve method. As previous studies done by applying the InSAR technique incorporated a short span temporally and they missed some highly deforming zones like Budalas and Khanabad landslides, contain mean velocities>50 mm/yr, which we studied individually in this work. In this study, a comprehensive application of the InSAR technique to assessing its performance in detecting and analysing landslides has been applied. The deformation velocity (V-slope) model shows high displacement in some regions, which needed to be further investigated by geoscientists, and the updated developed landslide inventory and susceptibility map can be used for land use planning and landslide mitigation strategies.

TI  - Phenomic and genomic prediction of yield on multiple locations in winter wheat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Genomic selection has recently become an established part of breeding strategies in cereals. However, a limitation of linear genomic prediction models for complex traits such as yield is that these are unable to accommodate Genotype by Environment effects, which are commonly observed over trials on multiple locations. In this study, we investigated how this environmental variation can be captured by the collection of a large number of phenomic markers using high-throughput field phenotyping and whether it can increase GS prediction accuracy. For this purpose, 44 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) elite populations, comprising 2,994 lines, were grown on two sites over 2 years, to approximate the size of trials in a practical breeding programme. At various growth stages, remote sensing data from multi- and hyperspectral cameras, as well as traditional ground-based visual crop assessment scores, were collected with approximately 100 different data variables collected per plot. The predictive power for grain yield was tested for the various data types, with or without genome-wide marker data sets. Models using phenomic traits alone had a greater predictive value (R-2 = 0.39-0.47) than genomic data (approximately R-2 = 0.1). The average improvement in predictive power by combining trait and marker data was 6%-12% over the best phenomic-only model, and performed best when data from one full location was used to predict the yield on an entire second location. The results suggest that genetic gain in breeding programmes can be increased by utilisation of large numbers of phenotypic variables using remote sensing in field trials, although at what stage of the breeding cycle phenomic selection could be most profitably applied remains to be answered.

TI  - Topographic hydro-conditioning to resolve surface depression storage and ponding in a fully distributed hydrologic model
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface depressions play a central role in the transformation of rainfall to ponding, infiltration and runoff, yet digital elevation models (DEMs) used by spatially distributed hydrologic models that resolve land surface processes rarely capture land surface depressions at spatial scales relevant to this transformation. Methods to generate DEMs through processing of remote sensing data, such as optical and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have favored surfaces without depressions to avoid adverse slopes that are problematic for many hydrologic routing methods. Here we present a new topographic conditioning workflow, Depression-Preserved DEM Processing (D2P) algorithm, which is designed to preserve physically meaningful surface depressions for depression-integrated and efficient hydrologic modeling. D2P includes several features: (1) an adaptive screening interval for delineation of depressions, (2) the ability to filter out anthropogenic land surface features (e.g., bridges), (3) the ability to blend river smoothing (e.g., a general downslope profile) and depression resolving functionality. From a case study in the Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed, D2P successfully resolved 86% of the ponds at a DEM resolution of 10 m. Topographic conditioning was achieved with minimum impact as D2P reduced the number of modified cells from the original DEM by 51% compared to a conventional algorithm. Furthermore, hydrologic simulation using a D2P processed DEM resulted in a more robust characterization on surface water dynamics based on higher surface water storage as well as an attenuated and delayed peak streamflow.

TI  - Data-to-data translation-based nowcasting of specific sea fog using geostationary weather satellite observation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense sea fog events are responsible for many traffic accidents and fatalities. Research has demonstrated the difficulty in distinguishing sea fog from clouds. This study presents a sea fog nowcasting method that uses brightness temperature (BT) at a mid-wave infrared (MWIR) 3.7 mu m bands and the BT difference between MWIR and long-wave infrared 10.8 mu m bands of communication, ocean, and meteorological satellite data through a data-to-data (D2D) translation based on a conditional generative adversarial networks technique. Sixty fog events that occurred in the Yellow Sea from 2017 to 2020 were used to develop the model. The D2D prediction model for predicting sea fog from 15-min to 2-h ahead with 15 min intervals was trained by stacking individual prediction time datasets in an array of 512 x 512 x 4 pixels for training and 512 x 512 x 8 pixels for testing. Otsu's thresholding method was used to determine sea fog pixels. The sea fog prediction model showed excellent statistical scores, such as the probability of detection = 0.923, false alarm ratio = 0.032, critical success index = 0.895, Heidke skill score = 0.909, and post agreement = 0.968 for 1 h-ahead of a sea fog forecast. Consequently, our study can make a scientific and operational contribution to fog forecasting as useful fog-related data, in addition to other numerical prediction data and ground observation data.

TI  - Contribution of Landscape Transformation in the Development of Heat Islands and Sinks in Urban and Peri-Urban Regions in the Chota-Nagpur Plateau, India
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in the contemporary world are experiencing shifts in local climatic conditions that are primarily linked to rapid urban growth, carbon emissions, and environmental degradation. In the present study, land surface temperature (LST) in urban and peri-urban regions of the city of Ranchi was estimated and correlated with land use/land cover (LULC) using temporal LANDSAT satellite images from 2000 to 2014 on a bi-annual basis. The study exhibited a gradual increase in built-up land with total growth of 47.65 sq. km (135%) at the cost of vegetation (-6.8%), rock outcrops (-44.16%), and other LULCs (0.81%). Spatiotemporal LST variability exhibited an increase in area under high-temperature (>38 ?) zones as compared to moderate (30 ? to 38 ?) and low-temperature (<30 ?) zones. Although the LST distinctively escalated in all LULC in the month of May from 2000 to 2014, urban areas exhibited cooler conditions than their environs at a regional scale, except for 2006. A higher surface temperature was observed over bare rock (min/max: 28-43?), fallow land (25-42 ?), and industrial built-up areas (31-43 ?), followed by vegetation (24-34 ?) and waterbodies (22-30 ?). The rapid land transformation to an impervious surface, degradation of vegetation coverage and its health, deforestation due to urbanization, the dumping of non-treated wastewater into reservoirs, and pollution altogether led to an increase in urban heat islands (UHI). The study demonstrated that the LST increased in urban regions but appeared cooler than those of its peri-urban counterparts because of the presence of barren land and rock outcrops. The existing tenancy act had an indirect impact on maintaining natural landscapes and controlling the LST within the Ranchi region. The study recommends nature-based solutions in terms of plantation and green roofing within the rising LST zones located in the urban core and in peripheral rock outcrops collectively to minimize the rising impact of LST in urban and peri-urban regions.

TI  - Exploration of the shared genes and signaling pathways between lung adenocarcinoma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a type of interstitial lung disease (ILD), is a chronic disease with an unknown etiology. The occurrence of lung cancer (LC) is one of the main causes of death in patients with IPF. However, the pathogenesis driving these malignant transformations remains unclear; therefore, this study aimed to identify the shared genes and functional pathways associated with both disease conditions.Methods: Data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. To identify overlapping genes in both diseases, the "limma" package in R software and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were used. Venn diagrams were used to obtain the shared genes. The diagnostic value of the shared genes was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment was performed on the shared genes between lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and IPF, and the genes were also functionally enriched using Metascape. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. Finally, the link between shared genes and common antineoplastic medicines was investigated using the CellMiner database.Results: The coexpression modules associated with LUAD and IPF were discovered using WGCNA, and 148 genes were found to overlap. In addition, 74 upregulated and 130 downregulated overlapping genes were obtained via differential gene analysis. Functional analysis of the genes revealed that these genes are primarily engaged in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways. Furthermore, COL1A2, POSTN, COL5A1, CXCL13, CYP24A1, CXCL14, and BMP2 were identified as potential biomarkers in patients with LUAD secondary to IPF showing good diagnostic values. Conclusions: ECM-related mechanisms may be the underlying link between LC and IPF. A total of 7 shared genes were identified as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for LUAD and IPF.

TI  - An accurate fringe extraction model of small- and medium-sized urban areas using multi-source data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban fringes are of great significance to urban development as connecting hubs between urban and rural areas. However, there are many problems in urban fringes, including disorderly spatial layout, waste of social resources, and low quality of human settlements. Rapid and accurate identification of urban fringes has important practical significance for optimizing urban spatial layout, controlling urban unlimited expansion, and protecting land resources. Given the lack of suitable and high-quality fringe extraction models for small- and medium-sized urban areas, this study was based on Gaofen-2 (GF-2) imagery, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) imagery, point of interest (POI) data, and WorldPop data, taking the landscape disorder degree, POI kernel density, and night light intensity as urban feature factors and constructing a fringe extraction model of small- and medium-sized urban areas (FEM-SMU). Taking Hantai District in China as the study area, the results of the model were compared to the landscape disorder degree threshold method and POI kernel density breakpoint analysis method, while the generality of the model was further tested in Shangzhou and Hanbin Districts. The results show that the FEM-SMU model has evident improvements over the conventional methods in terms of accuracy, detail, and integrity, and has higher versatility, which can better meet the research needs of small- and medium-sized urban fringes.

TI  - Lake Turbidity Mapping Using an OWTs-bp Based Framework and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake turbidity, representing a general indicator of water 'cloudiness', is a key parameter in many monitoring programs. It is not possible to cover all lakes with frequent in situ monitoring. Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) can help to fill the gaps if a robust turbidity retrieval methodology is developed. Previously published results demonstrated the usefulness of MSI at a limited regional scale, while our aim was to develop methodology that allows monitoring turbidity over the whole of China. We proposed methodology with a reflectance that can be classified into optical water types (OWTs), and then a back propagation neural network model (BP-TURB) is used to estimate turbidity. The reflectance of in situ lake samples extracted from MSI imagery was clustered as three OWTs, and validation performance was satisfactory: R-2 > 0.81, RMSE < 17.54, and MAE < 11.20. This allowed us to map turbidity in all Chinese lakes, of which the area is larger than 1 km(2). A larger percentage of clear lakes (53.26%) with low turbidity levels (<10 NTU) was found in 2020 than in 2015 (37.43%). Lakes in the plateau regions generally exhibited lower turbidity than those situated in the plains regions, for which the turbidity patterns were determined by lake volume, averaged depth, and elevation. We demonstrated that the Sentinel-2 MSI data with the novel approach proposed by us allows for mapping lake turbidity over a large variety of lakes and extensive geographic conditions, as well as for revealing temporal changes in these lakes and their links to lake abiotic characteristics.

TI  - An Assessment of Relations between Vegetation Green FPAR and Vegetation Indices through a Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is widely used in remote sensing-based production models to estimate gross or net primary production. The forest canopy is composed primarily of photosynthetically active vegetation (PAV, green leaves) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV e.g., branches), which absorb PAR but only the PAR absorbed by PAV is used for photosynthesis. Green FPAR (the fraction of PAR absorbed by PAV) is essential for the accurate estimation of GPP. In this study, the scattering by arbitrary inclined leaves (SAIL) model was reconfigured to partition the PAR absorbed by forest canopies. The characteristics of green FPAR and its relationships with spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2, and SAVI) were analyzed. The results showed that green FPAR varied with the canopy structure. In the forests with high coverage, the green FPAR was close to the total FPAR, while in the open forests, the green FPAR was far smaller than the total FPAR. Plant area index had more important impacts on the green FPAR than the proportion of PAV and optical properties of PAV. The significant relationships were found between spectral vegetation indices and the green FPAR, but EVI was more suitable to describe the variation of canopy green FPAR.

TI  - Hybrid Leadership in African Neo-Pentecostalism
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across institutions and professions, leadership philosophy is considered the driver of organisational culture in achieving the overall objectives. Although individuals' leadership cultures may vary, intersections and hybridity are present in many spheres, including that of some African Neo-Pentecostal Leaders (ANPLs). To underscore the hybrid leadership of the ANPLs, qualitative research was conducted, with data collected from 20 participants through one-on-one interviews across Africa. The results revealed the hybridisation of African Neo-Pentecostal leadership styles vis-a-vis African monarchical and religious traditions based on four variables: accountability, ownership and succession plan, healing, and gerontocracy. The results also revealed the benefits and challenges of their hybridity. Subsequently, using Jesus's model of servant leadership to analyse the four variables, the benefits and challenges were critiqued. The analysis identified culture, African spiritual worldview, gerontocracy, and submissive theology as factors influencing such syncretic or hybrid practices. The analysis also delineated the theological, socio-economic, legal, and transgenerational implications of such hybrid leadership. This article concludes with cautionary remarks regarding boundaries, servant leadership, and morality.

TI  - Methodological estimation to quantify drought intensity based on the NDDI index with Landsat 8 multispectral images in the central zone of the Gulf of Mexico
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Drought is a slow evolution phenomenon drastically affecting the environment and human activities. Nowadays, there are several indices to study drought. They can be based on in-site measurements of meteorological stations or remote perception data. However, Mexico's number of functioning meteorological stations from the National Meteorological Service (NMS) is steadily decreasing. Nevertheless, the NMS reports drought conditions through the Mexican Drought Monitor (MDM), which uses different methods to estimate drought levels. These reports are provided every 15 days for each municipality. However, the methods the NMS utilizes are unknown to the general public. Thus, in-situ studies which try to estimate drought are limited by the MDM data constrictions. Consequently, remote perception is an alternative to solve the lack of stations and the MDM data restrictions, depending on the region. Therefore, this research aims to: 1) Develop a methodology to quantify drought intensity based on the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) with Landsat 8 multispectral images in the municipalities of the central zone of the Gulf of Mexico for drought and no drought periods. 2) Analyze and compare the NDDI behavior against the MDM from the NMS during the same periods.Methods: The methodology consisted of estimating the NDDI by using Landsat 8 multispectral images. Further on, NDDI drought values were compared with the MDM.Results: Results showed that NDDI values increase from July to October during a drought period, coinciding with months when precipitation is low, and temperature is high. Additionally, it was found that the NDDI coincides with the MDM data in 46% of the municipalities having drought conditions when temperatures increased 2.1 degrees C and precipitations decreased by 668 mm. Furthermore, the NDDI coincided in 16% of the municipalities during no drought periods with the maximum increases in temperatures at 1.4 degrees C and precipitation reduced by 386 mm.Discussion: The NDDI estimated by Landsat 8 images can determine drought behavior in the study zone during periods with limited reduced precipitation and temperature increases.

TI  - Towards Digital Twins of the Oceans: The Potential of Machine Learning for Monitoring the Impacts of Offshore Wind Farms on Marine Environments
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increasing number of offshore wind farms, monitoring and evaluating the effects of the wind turbines on the marine environment have become important tasks. Here we conducted a feasibility study with the focus on monitoring these effects by utilizing different machine learning methods. A multi-source dataset for a study site in the North Sea is created by combining satellite data, local in situ data and a hydrodynamic model. The machine learning algorithm DTWkNN, which is based on dynamic time warping and k-nearest neighbor, is used for multivariate time series data imputation. Subsequently, unsupervised anomaly detection is performed to identify possible inferences in the dynamic and interdepending marine environment around the offshore wind farm. The anomaly results are analyzed in terms of location, density and temporal variability, granting access to information and building a basis for explanation. Temporal detection of anomalies with COPOD is found to be a suitable method. Actionable insights are the direction and magnitude of potential effects of the wind farm on the marine environment, depending on the wind direction. This study works towards a digital twin of offshore wind farms and provides a set of methods based on machine learning to monitor and evaluate offshore wind farm effects, supporting stakeholders with information for decision making on future maritime energy infrastructures.

TI  - Not so terrifying after all? A set of failed replications of the mortality salience effects of Terror Management Theory
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror Management Theory (TMT) postulates that humans, in response to awareness of their death, developed complex defenses to remove the salience and discomfort stemming from those thoughts. In a standard paradigm to test this theory, an individual is presented with a death-related prime (Mortality Salience; MS), such as writing the details of their own death, or something neutral, such as watching television. After a distractor task (for delay), participants complete the dependent variable, such as rating how much they like or agree with a pro- or anti-national essay and its author. Individuals in the MS condition typically exhibit greater worldview defense than control conditions by rating the pro-national essay more positively and the anti-national essay more negatively. We completed five separate studies across five unique samples with the goal of replicating and extending this well-established pattern to provide further understanding of the phenomena that underlie the effects of MS. However, despite using standard procedures, we were unable to replicate basic patterns of the dependent variable in the MS conditions. We also pooled all responses into two meta-analyses, one examining all dependent variables and one focusing on the anti-national essay; yet the effect sizes in these analyses did not significantly differ from zero. We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of these (unintended) failures to replicate. It is not clear if these null findings were due to methodological limitations, restraints of online/crowd-sourced recruitment, or ever-evolving sociocultural factors.

TI  - Extent, Severity, and Temporal Patterns of Damage to Cuba's Ecosystems following Hurricane Irma: MODIS and Sentinel-2 Hurricane Disturbance Vegetation Anomaly (HDVA)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide a range of ecosystem services but may be increasingly threatened by climate change in the North Atlantic due to high-intensity storms. Hurricane Irma (Category 5) hit the northern coast of Cuba in September 2017, causing widespread damage to mangroves; losses have not yet been extensively documented due to financial and logistical constraints for local scientists. Our team estimated Irma's impacts on Cuban ecosystems in a coastal and upland study area spanning over 1.7 million ha. We developed a multi-resolution time series "vegetation anomaly" approach, where post-disturbance observations in photosynthetically active vegetation (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) were normalized to the reference period (dry season mean over a historical time series). The Hurricane Disturbance Vegetation Anomaly (HDVA) was used to estimate the extent, severity, and temporal patterns of ecological changes with Sentinel-2 and MODIS data and used vicarious validation with microsatellite interpretation (Planet). HDVA values were classed to convey qualitative labels useful for local scientists: (1) Catastrophic, (2) Severe, (3) Moderate, (4) Mild, and (5) No Loss. Sentinel-2 had a limited reference period (2015-2017) compared to MODIS (2000-2017), yet the HDVA patterns were similar. Mangrove and wetlands (>265,000 ha) sustained widespread damages, with a staggering 78% showing damage, largely severe to catastrophic (0-0.81 HDVA; >207,000 ha). The damaged area is 24 times greater than impacts from Irma as documented elsewhere. Caguanes National Park (>8400 ha, excluding marine zones) experienced concentrated, severe mangrove and wetland damages (nearly 4000 ha). The phenological declines from Irma's impacts took up to 17 months to fully actualize, a much longer period than previously suggested. In contrast, dry forests saw rapid green flushes post-hurricane. With the increase of high-intensity storm events and other threats to ecosystems, the HDVA methods outlined here can be used to assess intense to low-level damages.

TI  - Semi-automated bathymetry using Sentinel-2 for coastal monitoring in the Western Mediterranean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearshore bathymetry is one of the main parameters used in coastal studies. However, regular and continuous bathymetries are scarce due to the difficulty of continuous data collection using traditional surveys. Remote sensing offers an attractive alternative to conventional collection methods for acquiring freely available, reliable, and frequent high-resolution data from space missions, such as the European Union's Copernicus programme Sentinel-2A/B satellites, which are increasingly demonstrating their potential to derive bathymetric information. Consequently, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is being used more regularly because of its low cost and high efficiency. In this study, we apply a log-transformed band ratio SDB model in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Mallorca Island, Spain). This model has been widely used in the Caribbean and along the U.S. coast, among other sites, with outstanding results in heterogeneous environments. The SDB model consists of an automatic multi-scene approach applied over several images corrected by a robust atmospheric correction model (ACO-LITE), a switching model, and a procedure to remove pixels from optically deep waters. We retrieve depths up to 14 m with a mean bias of 0.02 m and a median absolute error of 0.71 m compared with multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) data. The outcomes of this study confirm the effectiveness of the multi-scene approach to automatically correct the imagery to derive accurate depths and characterize erosional and accretion patterns annually. Furthermore, it highlights the benefit of the switching model to take advantage of the spectral sensitivity of different multi-band ratio approaches. This study will provide the scientific community with substantial knowledge and improved SDB techniques to consolidate the understanding of nearshore processes in such a relevant ecosystem as the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Reduction and reconstruction strategy of active thermal control system based on unsupervised learning and thermo-optics for spaceborne high-resolution remote sensor
T2  - APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of small Earth observation satellites with high performance optical remote sensors has received much attention in recent years due to its responsiveness and immediacy. As one of the most resource-intensive subsystems of spacecrafts, the active thermal control system (ATCS) should be optimized; however, manual thermal design does not guarantee an optimal solution and requires months. For this purpose, we presented a ATCS's reduction and reconstruction strategy based on an unsupervised learning framework, in which factor loadings are applied to combine kernel-based principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture model clus-tering. This strategy was implemented on a spaceborne high-resolution remote sensor (HRS) with 0.5 m ground sample distance. As a result, with the cumulative variance contribution rate > 90 % and 10 Gaussian distribu-tions, the reconstructed ATCS of HRS had a 78.6 % reduction rate and took only 3 h, which suggests the high efficiency and low computational cost of the proposed strategy. Finally, the performed orbital thermal and thermo-optical integrated analyses indicated that temperature fluctuations were within +/- 0.02-0.6 degrees C and op-tical surface errors were within the tolerance. The average modulation transfer function in the tangential and sagittal directions decreased by only 2 % and 2.5 %, respectively, and the radius of the spot root mean square was considerably smaller than the size of one pixel (8.75 mu m). These results prove the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategy. This study solved the problem of identifying the optimal ATCS for optical remote sensors and significantly reducing the ATCS's resource occupancy, which provided a reliable research basis for the devel-opment of high-performance small Earth observation satellites. Additionally, the proposed strategy is versatile and can be used in thermal engineering applications of various complex spacecrafts and payloads.

TI  - Real-time precise orbit determination for FY-3C and FY-3D based on BDS and GPS onboard observation
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The code multipath error associated with elevation in BDS-2 is one of the main factors whose impact on the precision of real-time reduced-dynamic precise orbit determination (POD) using spaceborne multi-global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) observation data for FengYun-3C (FY-3C) and FengYun-3D (FY-3D) satellites. The aim is to construct a code multipath piece-wise linear error model and analyse the contribution of BDS-2 to the performance of low earth orbit POD. Conclusions are drawn out from the experimental results: (1) the real-time POD average precision of FY-3C and FY-3D is improved by about 11% and 12% after the correction of BDS-2 code multipath error; (2) Due to the small number of available BDS-2 satellites and the limited accuracy of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite real-time orbit products, the precision of the real-time overlapping comparison for FY-3C/FY-3D by using the BDS-2 onboard observation data can only reach the decimetre level. However, with the BDS-2 signal capture capability of the FY-3D onboard GNSS Occultation Sounder upgraded, the average precision of the BDS-2-based POD for FY-3D is better than that of FY-3C in each direction and with 10% improvement in the average 3 dimensional-root mean square (3D-RMS); (3) Cases of onboard global positioning system (GPS), GPS + BDS-2 (with GEO), and GPS + BDS-2 (without GEO) for real-time POD can meet 5-8 cm precision requirement. The average 3D-RMS of the real-time POD for FY-3C/FY-3D, which utilises onboard GPS + BDS-2 data is inferior only to GPS data, owing to the influence of the orbit accuracy of GEO satellites. However, after excluding the influence of GEO satellites, the average result (3D-RMS) of the real-time POD for FY-3C (6.11 cm) and FY-3D (5.95 cm) is better than those of other cases.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation Analysis of Lake Area Based on the ESTARFM Model: A Case Study of Qilu Lake in Yunnan Province, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Qilu Lake is one of the nine plateau lakes in Yunnan Province, China. In recent years, under the influence of extreme climate and human activities, the area of Qilu Lake has shrunk significantly, the water level has dropped, and the problem of water shortage has become increasingly serious. Based on the Landsat and MODIS image data from 2000 to 2020, this study applied the ESTARFM spatiotemporal fusion model to unify the data images used in the study to February, used three kinds of water body indexes, selected the water body index most suitable for the study area to extract relevant information, and analyzed the spatiotemporal change characteristics of Qilu Lake area in the last 20 years. The results showed that: (1) Based on the ESTARFM model, the Landsat and MODIS data on 18 January 2020, the Landsat and MODIS data on 9 May 2020, and the MODIS data on the date to be predicted (February 13) were fused to obtain the Landsat image data of the predicted date, which met the accuracy requirements; (2) Taking 2005 as an example, the NDWI, MNDWI, and AWEI(sh) indexes were used to extract the water body with the precisions of 99.0%, 99.6% and 98.6%, respectively, and then the MNDWI water body index was selected to extract the lake area; (3) In the past 20 years, the overall area of Qilu Lake has shown a downward trend, with the area reduced by 0.7132 km(2). From 2000 to 2010, the lake area was relatively stable, fluctuating up and down around 36 km(2). From 2010 to 2015, the lake area decreased sharply, with a change rate of -40%. After 2015, the lake area gradually increased; (4) The spatial change of Qilu Lake area mainly occurred in the southwest and west, which decreased by 0.44 km(2) and 0.49 km(2), respectively, and there were small fluctuations in other directions. In the past two decades, the shape index of Qilu Lake has shown a downward trend as a whole; the contour of the lake tends to be simplified, the contour is complex and stable from 2000 to 2010, and the shape index decreases from 2.17 to 1.74 from 2010 to 2020; (5) The change in the Qilu Lake area is positively correlated with the change in the water level. Polynomial models with different times were selected as the model for retrieving water level elevation from the Qilu Lake water surface area, with a highest correlation coefficient of 0.9259. The temporal and spatial changes of the Qilu Lake area in the last 20 years are the result of the joint action of natural factors and socio-economic factors. According to the analysis, the annual average temperature, annual precipitation, annual average sunshine hours, and population density are the main driving forces leading to the change. In the future, the government and relevant researchers should strengthen real-time monitoring and regular research, formulate and optimize emergency plans to deal with changes in the ecological environment of lakes, and promote the sustainable development of the ecological environment and social economy of the basin.

TI  - Study on sentinel symptoms and influencing factors of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To explore the symptom clusters of gastric cancer patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy, identify the sentinel symptom of each symptom cluster, and compare the differences in sentinel symptoms of patients for gastric cancer with different characteristics. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Patients with postoperative gastric cancer who received chemotherapy in the medical oncology department from October 2021 to July 2022 were selected for the study using a con-venience sampling method.The General Information Questionnaire and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Gastrointestinal Cancer (MDASI-GI) were used for the survey.Results: A total of 245 patients participated in the study. There were five symptom clusters in the patients. Fa-tigue, nausea, sadness, and taste alteration were the sentinel symptoms of the disease symptom cluster, gastrointestinal symptom cluster, emotional symptom cluster, and neurotoxic symptom cluster, respectively. No clear sentinel symptom was found in the gastric-cancer-specific symptom cluster. Statistically significant dif-ferences were observed in fatigue, nausea, sadness, and taste alteration among patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer with differences in gender, duration since diagnosis, tumor site, chemotherapy regimen, chemotherapy cycle, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, albumin level, plasma D-dimer level, indirect bilirubin level, glutamic pyruvic transaminase level, total bile acid level, and uric acid level. Conclusion: People with postoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer experience multiple concurrent symp-toms. Of the multiple symptoms that occur simultaneously, patients tend to focus on 1 or 2 symptoms of particular significance and use the occurrence of 1 symptom to explain the others. The understanding of symptom clusters and sentinel symptoms could be beneficial to assess and manage both in postoperative patients with gastric cancer during chemotherapy. Clinical staff should use sentinel symptoms as the targets for symptom cluster evaluation and effective intervention.

TI  - Civilizational Populism in Domestic and Foreign Policy: The Case of Turkey
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates whether Turkish populism has undergone a 'civilizational turn' akin to what Brubaker, Haynes, Yilmaz, and Morieson have described occurring among populist parties in Europe and North America. The article applies Yilmaz and Morieson's definition of 'civilizational populism' to Turkey under the rule of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) in order to determine whether the party conforms to this definition. The article investigates how the AKP, an Islamist and populist political party lead by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has increasingly incorporated what we term 'civilizational populism' into its discourse. The article shows the impact of civilizational populism on Turkey's domestic and foreign policy under the AKP rule. The article finds that the AKP has increasingly, and especially since the 2013 Gezi Park protests and the mysterious coup attempt in 2016, construed opposition between the Turkish 'self' and the 'other' not in primarily nationalist terms, but in religious and civilizational terms, and as a conflict between the Ottoman-Islamic 'self' and 'Western' other. Furthermore, the article finds that the AKP's domestic and foreign policies reflect its civilizational populist division of Turkish society insofar as the party is attempting to raise a 'pious generation' that supports its Islamizing of Turkey society, and its nostalgic neo-Ottomanist power projections in the Middle East. Finally, the paper discusses how the AKP's civilizational populism has become a transnational populist phenomenon due to the party's ability to produce successful television shows that reflect its anti-Western worldview and justify its neo-Ottoman imperialism in the Middle East.

TI  - A Study on the Impact of Roads on Grassland Degradation in Shangri-La City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shangri-La is located in the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has a fragile ecology. The plateau grassland has suffered from irreversible degradation under the influence of human activities. To address this issue, the Sentinel-2A data obtained is used in this study to calculate the RVI and build an inversion model of grassland degradation grade with GDI data, which was used to obtain the area and proportion of grassland degradation. Landscape indexes were then calculated for different degradation grades of grassland to examine the correlation between roads and degraded grassland in spatial distance and the spatial distribution characteristics of different degradation grades of grassland. The results show that the grassland area in Shangri-La was 2207.94 km(2), of which the heavily degraded area reaches 824.03 km(2), exceeding the undegraded grassland area by 172.62 km(2), indicating that the grassland degradation is severe. From south to north, the proportion of heavily degraded and moderately degraded grassland in townships gradually decreased, while the proportion of lightly degraded and undegraded grassland gradually increased. The townships with high percentages of degraded grassland were predominantly located in the southern area, where there was a dense road network and well-developed transport networks, particularly along National Highway 214, which is the main road in Shangri-La. Conversely, townships with low percentages are generally located in the north with dispersed roads and sparse transport lines. The study's outcomes are significant in providing a better understanding of the current status of grassland degradation and promoting the sustainable utilization of grassland resources in Shangri-La.

TI  - The Current Treatment Trends and Survival Patterns in Melanoma Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB): A Multicenter Nationwide Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In melanoma treatment, an approach following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been recently deescalated from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) to active surveillance based on phase III trials data. In this study, we aim to evaluate treatment strategies in SLNB-positive melanoma patients in real-world practice. Methods: Five-hundred-fifty-seven melanoma SLNB-positive patients from seven comprehensive cancer centers treated between 2017 and 2021 were included. Kaplan-Meier methods and the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model were used for analysis. Results: The median follow-up was 25 months. Between 2017 and 2021, the percentage of patients undergoing CLND decreased (88-41%), while the use of adjuvant treatment increased (11-51%). The 3-year OS and RFS rates were 77.9% and 59.6%, respectively. Adjuvant therapy prolonged RFS (HR:0.69, p = 0.036)), but CLND did not (HR:1.22, p = 0.272). There were no statistically significant differences in OS for either adjuvant systemic treatment or CLND. Lower progression risk was also found, and time-dependent hazard ratios estimation in patients treated with systemic adjuvant therapy was confirmed (HR:0.20, p = 0.002 for BRAF inhibitors and HR:0.50, p = 0.015 for anti-PD-1 inhibitors). Conclusions: Treatment of SLNB-positive melanoma patients is constantly evolving, and the role of surgery is currently rather limited. Whether CLND has been performed or not, in a group of SLNB-positive patients, adjuvant systemic treatment should be offered to all eligible patients.

TI  - Introducing a map of soil base cation concentration, an ecologically relevant GIS-layer for Amazonian forests
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil maps are crucial for habitat and species distribution modeling under present and future conditions, thereby providing relevant background information for conservation planning. In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and proba-bility of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network-Based Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Flood Mapping Using NovaSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of most SAR-based flood classification and segmentation derived from semi-automated algorithms is often limited due to complicated radar backscatter. However, deep learning techniques, now widely applied in image classifications, have demonstrated excellent potential for mapping complex scenes and improving flood mapping accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to compare the image classification accuracy of three convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoder-decoders (i.e., U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLapV3) by leveraging the end-to-end ArcGIS Pro workflow. A specific objective of this method consists of labelling and training each CNN model separately on publicly available dual-polarised pre-flood data (i.e., Sentinel-1 and NovaSAR-1) based on the ResNet convolutional backbone via a transfer learning approach. The neural network results were evaluated using multiple model training trials, validation loss, training loss and confusion matrix from test datasets. During testing on the post-flood data, the results revealed that U-Net marginally outperformed the other models. In this study, the overall accuracy and F1-score reached 99% and 98% on the test data, respectively. Interestingly, the segmentation results showed less use of manual cleaning, thus encouraging the use of open-source image data for the rapid, accurate and continuous monitoring of floods using the CNN-based approach.

TI  - Land cover degradation in the reference and monitoring periods of the SDG Land Degradation Neutrality Indicator for Switzerland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation impacts most terrestrial biomes across all world regions. To address global change challenges emanating from degrading natural resources, many countries voluntarily set themselves the goal of achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). Baseline conditions are to be established over a reference period (2000 - 2015). With seven more years to monitor this Sustainable Development Goal 15 indicator - SDG15.3.1 until the year 2030, the scientific basis for operationalizing LDN is still evolving. The non-availability of annual land use-land cover maps of sufficient resolution in various countries, among them Switzerland, is a major factor hampering the assessment at national and local levels. Land cover change is assessed for seven land categories (that is, Tree-covered area, Grassland, Cropland, Wetland, Artificial Surfaces, Otherland, and Waterbody). Land cover change is a major LDN sub-indicator required to assess the proportion of degraded land to total land area (SDG15.3.1). Annual land cover datasets from 2015 to 2020 were produced at 10 m from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images using a Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System-based workflow. An evaluation of degradation in land cover is presented in support of the operationalization of LDN in Switzerland. Drawing upon the understanding that changes made to land use-land cover may act as precursors to land degradation processes, transitions relating to the loss of natural cover were identified based on the land cover change criteria during the reference and the monitored periods. The criteria were developed for relating land cover transitions to degrading and non-degrading processes. Such transitions were grasslands to tree-covered areas and croplands to artificial surfaces due to settlement development. For example, the amount of cropland converted to artificial surface areas was greater in absolute terms during the monitored period than during the reference period. Also, the regeneration of natural cover involving transitions from otherland to grassland and from grasslands to tree-covered areas was found. Overall trends between 2000 and 2020 in Switzerland are the increasing settlement areas in the Central Plateau, the Alpine valleys of Valais and Ticino, largely at the expense of croplands and the bush encroachment of pastures such as in the Jura. This study's contributions include an enhanced workflow for annual land cover mapping for the entire Switzerland and the adaptation of the land cover change criteria to fit the Swiss context. The proposed mapping method has the potential to fill the gap between the production cycles of the Swiss Corine and Arealstatistik land use data.

TI  - Systematic daytime increases in atmospheric biases linked to dry soils in irrigated areas in Indian operational forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of land-atmosphere coupling in forecast models can significantly impact weather prediction. A previous case study in Northern India incorporating both model and observational data identified atmospheric biases in a high-resolution forecast linked to soil moisture that impacted the representation of the monsoon trough, an important driver of regional rainfall. The aim of the current work is to understand whether this behavior is present in operational forecasts run by the India National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). We utilize satellite observations and reanalysis to evaluate model fields in June, July, August, and September forecasts from 2020. Our analysis reveals systematic rapid growth in warm boundary layer biases during the daytime over North West India, which weaken overnight, consistent with excessive daytime surface sensible heat flux. The cumulative effect of these biases produces temperatures more than 4K warmer in 60-h forecasts. These effects are enhanced by dry surface conditions. The biases impact circulation in the forecasts, which have implications for regional rainfall. The spatial distribution of warm biases in the Indo-Gangetic Plain is remarkably consistent with the location of areas equipped for irrigation, a process that is not explicitly represented in the model. Our results provide compelling evidence that the development of an irrigation scheme within the model is needed to address the substantial forecast biases that we document.

TI  - Viral infections at the animal-human interface-Learning lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
T2  - MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This Lilliput explores the current epidemiological and virological arguments for a zoonotic origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the role of bats, pangolins and racoon dogs as viral reservoirs has not yet been proven, a spill-over of a coronavirus infection from animals into humans at the Huanan food market in Wuhan has a much greater plausibility than alternative hypotheses such as a laboratory virus escape, deliberate genetic engineering or introduction by cold chain food products. This Lilliput highlights the dynamic nature of the animal-human interface for viral cross-infections from humans into feral white tail deer or farmed minks (reverse zoonosis). Surveillance of viral infections at the animal-human interface is an urgent task since live animal markets are not the only risks for future viral spill-overs. Climate change will induce animal migration which leads to viral exchanges between animal species that have not met in the past. Environmental change and deforestation will also increase contact between animals and humans. Developing an early warning system for emerging viral infections becomes thus a societal necessity not only for human but also for animal and environmental health (One Health concept). Microbiologists have developed tools ranging from virome analysis in key suspects such as viral reservoirs (bats, wild game animals, bushmeat) and in humans exposed to wild animals, to wastewater analysis to detect known and unknown viruses circulating in the human population and sentinel studies in animal-exposed patients with fever. Criteria need to be developed to assess the virulence and transmissibility of zoonotic viruses. An early virus warning system is costly and will need political lobbying. The accelerating number of viral infections with pandemic potential over the last decades should provide the public pressure to extend pandemic preparedness for the inclusion of early viral alert systems.

TI  - A <i>Priori</i> Knowledge Based Ground Moving Target Indication Technique Applied to Distributed Spaceborne SAR System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Through formation flying, the distributed spaceborne SAR(synthetic aperture radar) system can increase the number of spatial degree of freedoms (DOFs) and provide flexible multi-baselines for SAR-GMTI (ground moving target indication), which improves the system performance. This paper proposes an a priori knowledge-based adaptive clutter cancellation and moving target detection technique applied to the distributed spaceborne SAR-GMTI systems. Firstly, the adaptive clutter cancellation technique is exploited to suppress the ground clutter. A priori knowledge, such as road network information, is integrated to the adaptive clutter cancellation processor to reduce any moving target steering vector mismatch. Secondly, adaptive matched filter (AMF) and adaptive beamformer orthogonal rejection test (ABORT) are exploited as adaptive detection techniques for moving target detection. Due to the dense road network, the moving target steering vector estimation may be ambiguous for the different position and orientation of the roads. The multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) technique is proposed to detect the moving targets and resolve the potential ambiguities. A scheme is exploited to detect, classify, and relocate the moving targets. Finally, simulation experiments and performance analysis have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Evolution Characteristics and Driving Forces of the Surface Thermal Environment in Lanzhou City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect is becoming more and more serious due to the continuous expansion of cities in China, and improving the urban thermal environment is an important prerequisite for creating a livable city. Based on the Landsat TM images of 2001 and 2011 and Landsat TIRS images of 2021, this study investigated the spatial and temporal distribution and evolution characteristics of the urban thermal environment in Lanzhou City in the last 20 years by using the radiation equation conduction method to invert the surface temperature of Lanzhou City. The results show the following: (1) The radiation range of the medium temperature zone in Lanzhou City spreads in an "extended" style from 2001 to 2021 until it covers the whole main urban area, the secondary high and low temperatures decrease, and the corresponding medium temperature zone increases over a large area. (2) The average temperatures of Lanzhou urban area and its arable land, forest, grassland, and water area within the urban area reaches 10-25 degrees C, and the heat island area decreases by 9.56% in 20 years, with the high-temperature zone decreasing by 42.32%. (3) The proportion of water bodies and the proportion of impermeable surfaces are dominant factors in the spatial differentiation of surface temperature, and the interaction and synergy of various influencing factors affect the spatial differentiation of surface temperature.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: a prospective cohort study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study evaluated the identification efficiency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) to accurately represent the axillary node status in early-stage breast cancer.Method In total, 109 consecutive consenting patients with clinically node-negative and T1-2 breast cancer were included in this study. All patients received CEUS to identify SLN before surgery, and a guidewire was deployed to locate SLN in those who were successfully explored by CEUS. The patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and the blue dye was used to trace SLN during the surgery. The decision to perform axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) depended on the intraoperative pathological identification of SLN by CEUS (CE-SLN). The concordance rate of pathological status between CE-SLN and dyed SLN was calculated.Result The CEUS detection rate was 96.3%; CE-SLN failed in 4 patients. Among the remaining 105 successful identifications, 18 were CE-SLN positive by intraoperative frozen section, and one with CE-SLN micrometastasis was diagnosed by paraffin section. No additional lymph node metastases were found in CE-SLN-negative patients. The concordance rate of pathological status between CE-SLN and dyed SLN was 100%.Conclusion CEUS can accurately represent the status of axillary lymph nodes in patients with clinically node-negative and small tumor burden breast cancer.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network -Support Vector Machine Model-Gaussian Process Regression: A New Machine Model for Predicting Monthly and Daily Rainfall
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall prediction is an important issue in water resource management. Predicting rainfall helps researchers to monitor droughts, surface water and floods. The current study introduces a new deep learning model named convolutional neural network (CONN)- support vector machine (SVM)- Gaussian regression process (GPR) to predict daily and monthly rainfall data in Terengganu River Basin, Malaysia. The CONN-SVM-GRP model can extract the most important features automatically. The main advantage of the new model is to reflect the uncertainty values in the modelling process. The lagged rainfall values were used as the input variables to the models. The proposed CONN-SVM-GRP model successfully decreased the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of other models by 5.9%-23% at the daily scale and 20%-61% at the monthly scale. The CONN-SVM-GRP model also provided the lowest uncertainty among other models, making it a reliable tool for predicting data points and intervals. Hence, it can be concluded that CONN-SVM-GRP model contributes to the sustainable management of water resources, even when satellite data is unavailable, by using lagged values to predict rainfall. Additionally, the model extracts important features without using preprocessing methods, further improving its efficiency. Overall, the CONN-SVM-GRP model can help researchers predict rainfall, which is essential for monitoring water resources and mitigating the impacts of droughts, floods, and other natural disasters.

TI  - The role of bots in spreading conspiracies: Case study of discourse about earthquakes on Twitter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we identified seven most widely spread conspiracy discourses about earthquakes. These conspiracy discourses link earthquakes to military activities like secret nuclear bomb testing, God's Providence like the punishment of humans for their sins, space activities like aliens visiting our planet, the US secret weather control program HAARP, tests of the Large Hadron Collider, fracking projects, and freemasonic plots. Following the major earthquake in Indonesia at the end of November 2022, we extracted data from Twitter by keywords using the Hoaxy tool for tracking the spread of information on Twitter. Applying the Bot Sentinel tool, we also got data on the sentiment of the users. The divine and military discourses dominated the conspiracy discussion, followed by the discussions about extraction and HAARP. Though there were more human-like accounts than bot-like accounts, we found a positive correlation between the frequency of tweets on the conspiracy discourses and the bot scores of the accounts, which suggests that bot-like accounts were tweeting more than human-like accounts. It was also found that normal accounts tweeted more than toxic accounts, and there was a positive relationship between the bot score and the toxicity level of an account. It suggests that bot-like accounts were involved more in disruptive activities than human-like accounts.

TI  - COVID-19 surveillance in Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Senegal and Uganda: strengths, weaknesses and key Lessons
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAs part of efforts to rapidly identify and care for individuals with COVID-19, trace and quarantine contacts, and monitor disease trends over time, most African countries implemented interventions to strengthen their existing disease surveillance systems. This research describes the strengths, weaknesses and lessons learnt from the COVID-19 surveillance strategies implemented in four African countries to inform the enhancement of surveillance systems for future epidemics on the continent.MethodsThe four countries namely the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda, were selected based on their variability in COVID-19 response and representation of Francophone and Anglophone countries. A mixed-methods observational study was conducted including desk review and key informant interviews, to document best practices, gaps, and innovations in surveillance at the national, sub-national, health facilities, and community levels, and these learnings were synthesized across the countries.ResultsSurveillance approaches across countries included - case investigation, contact tracing, community-based, laboratory-based sentinel, serological, telephone hotlines, and genomic sequencing surveillance. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, the health systems moved from aggressive testing and contact tracing to detect virus and triage individual contacts into quarantine and confirmed cases, isolation and clinical care. Surveillance, including case definitions, changed from contact tracing of all contacts of confirmed cases to only symptomatic contacts and travelers. All countries reported inadequate staffing, staff capacity gaps and lack of full integration of data sources. All four countries under study improved data management and surveillance capacity by training health workers and increasing resources for laboratories, but the disease burden was under-detected. Decentralizing surveillance to enable swifter implementation of targeted public health measures at the subnational level was a challenge. There were also gaps in genomic and postmortem surveillance including community level sero-prevalence studies, as well as digital technologies to provide more timely and accurate surveillance data.ConclusionAll the four countries demonstrated a prompt public health surveillance response and adopted similar approaches to surveillance with some adaptations as the pandemic progresses. There is need for investments to enhance surveillance approaches and systems including decentralizing surveillance to the subnational and community levels, strengthening capabilities for genomic surveillance and use of digital technologies, among others. Investing in health worker capacity, ensuring data quality and availability and improving ability to transmit surveillance data between and across multiple levels of the health care system is also critical. Countries need to take immediate action in strengthening their surveillance systems to better prepare for the next major disease outbreak and pandemic.

TI  - Healthcare chaplains' conflicting and ambivalent positions regarding meaning in life and worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE CHAPLAINCY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Western society is increasingly a spiritual society, but not so much a society that draws on clearly delineated religious or worldview pillars anymore. Within healthcare, there's a growing attention to the spiritual dimension of health and the collaborative spiritual care that is needed for person-centered care. This changing religious/worldview and healthcare landscape is influencing healthcare chaplaincy. In this case study in-depth interviews were conducted with a chaplaincy team within a large healthcare organization in The Netherlands. Dialogical Self Theory was used as the theoretical framework in the narrative analysis of these stories. This provided insights into how these chaplains negotiate their professional identity within a changing healthcare landscape. It is concluded that there are multiple and often contradictory and conflicting positions within and between chaplains and that it is a challenge for healthcare chaplains to integrate the "old" and "new" representations of chaplaincy.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Data, Morpho-Metric Analysis, and Integrated Method Approach for Flood Risk Assessment: Case Study of Wadi Al-Arish Landscape, Sinai, Egypt
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating and predicting the occurrence and spatial remarks of climate and rainfall-related destructive hazards is a big challenge. Periodically, Sinai Peninsula is suffering from natural risks that enthuse researchers to provide the area more attention and scientific investigation. Extracted information from the morpho-metric indices aids in understanding the flood potentiality over various sizes of drainage catchments. In this work, the morpho-metric analysis has been used in order to model the relative signals of flood vulnerability of 16 catchments in northern Sinai. The geospatial technique has been applied to process the digital elevation models (DEMs) in order to produce different analysis maps. Basic geometries, in addition to several morpho-metric indices, were extracted and analyzed by investigating the digital elevation models. Three different effective methods were applied separately to build up three models of flood susceptibility behaviors. Finally, two flood susceptibility signals were defined: the integration method and accurate pixel level conditions models. The integrated method analysis indicates that the western half of the study landscape, including catchments (12, 13, and 14), presents high levels of flood susceptibility in addition to catchment 9 in the eastern half, whereas the other catchments were found to provide moderate levels. The integrated flood susceptibility final map overlaid one of the most effective topographic indices (topographic position index, TPI). The integrated results aided in understanding the link of the general catchments morphometry to the in situ topography for mapping the different flood susceptibility locations over the entire study landscape. Therefore, this can be used for investigating the surface-specific reduction strategy against the impacts of flood hazards in the proposed landscape.

TI  - Biologically-coupled bisphosphonate chaperones effectively deliver molecules to the site of soft tissue-bone healing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tendon injuries are common and often treated surgically, however, current tendon repair healing results in poorly organized fibrotic tissue. While certain growth factors have been reported to improve both the strength and organization of the repaired enthesis, their clinical applicability is severely limited due to a lack of appropriate delivery strategies. In this study, we evaluated a recently developed fluorescent probe, Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Sentinel-3 that is composed of a bone-targeting bisphosphonate (BP) moiety linked to fluorochrome and quencher molecules joined via a cathepsin K-sensitive peptide sequence. Using a murine Achilles tendon-to-bone repair model, BP-based and/or Ctsk-coupled imaging probes were applied either locally or systemically. Fluorescence imaging was used to quantify the resultant signal in vivo. After tendon-bone repair, animals that received either local or systemic administration of imaging probes demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence signal at the repair site compared to the sham surgery group at all time points (p < 0.001), with signal peaking at 7-10 days after surgery. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel BP-based targeting and Ctsk-activated delivery of molecules to the site of tendon-to-bone repair and creates a foundation for further development of this platform as an effective strategy to deliver bioactive molecules to sites of musculoskeletal injury.

TI  - A Spatiotemporally Constrained Interpolation Method for Missing Pixel Values in the Suomi-NPP VIIRS Monthly Composite Images: Taking Shanghai as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS/DNB) nighttime light data is a powerful remote sensing data source. However, due to stray light pollution, there is a lack of VIIRS data in mid-high latitudes during the summer, resulting in the absence of high-precision spatiotemporal continuous datasets. In this paper, we first select nine-time series interpolation methods to interpolate the missing images. Second, we construct image pixel-level temporal continuity constraints and spatial correlation constraints and remove the pixels that do not meet the constraints, and the eliminated pixels are filled with the focal statistics tool. Finally, the accuracy of the time series interpolation method and the spatiotemporally constrained interpolation method (STCIM) proposed in this paper are evaluated from three aspects: the number of abnormal pixels (NP), the total light brightness value (TDN), and the absolute value of the difference (ADN). The results show that the images simulated by the STCIM are more accurate than the nine selected time series interpolation methods, and the image interpolation accuracy is significantly improved. Relevant research results have improved the quality of the VIIRS dataset, promoted the application research based on the VIIRS DNB long-time series night light remote sensing image, and enriched the night light remote sensing theory and method system.

TI  - Establishing a Reliable Assessment of the Green View Index Based on Image Classification Techniques, Estimation, and a Hypothesis Testing Route
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development policies and spatial planning for maintaining greenery are crucial for all major cities in the world, and the measurement of green space indicators in planning practice needs to evolve in response to the demands of the times and technological drivers. This study explores an informal urban green space indicator, the green view index (GVI), which uses the visual perception of an observer to measure the quality of urban space by simulating the pedestrian perspective of the road in street-view image data and then calculating the proportion of vegetation in the road landscape. The GVI is different from macro indicators, such as public recreational green space, forest coverage, and green space rate, which are derived from planning data or remote sensing data in traditional urban planning; it starts from the bottom-up perception of individual residents and is more relevant to their subjective demands. At present, most international cities have made outstanding achievements in controlling public recreational green space, forest coverage, green space rates, and other macrolevel indicators of urban spatial quality; however, with the promotion of the concept of "human-oriented" urban planning, the potential restoration of urban spatial quality at the microlevel is gradually being recognized. To ensure the efficiency and reliability of this study, inspired by computer vision techniques and related GVI studies, a research method based on chromaticity was built to identify the proportions of green vegetation in street view images, and the credibility was improved by eliminating unreliable data. By using this method, we could evaluate a city at an overall scale instead of the previous block scale. The final research result showed that Shenzhen is friendly to human visual senses, and the GVI of the streets in developed areas is generally higher than that in developing areas. The geostatistical analysis of the green viewpoint data provides a more intuitive guide for researchers and planners, and it is believed to inform the planning and design of environmentally friendly, smart, and sustainable future cities.

TI  - Using aerial LiDAR to assess regional availability of potential habitat for a conservation dependent forest bird
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed data can inform conservation efforts that target forest wildlife, however, few spatial data products are able to quantify fine-scale aspects of structural variation within forests. Increased availability of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets that cover broad spatial extents and ownership types (e.g., entire states) provide useful information regarding canopy and understory structure within forested landscapes. The fusion of LiDAR data with field-based species surveys can advance our understanding of species-habitat re-lationships and improve the effectiveness of conservation programs to recover habitat-limited species. The Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is a forest-dependent songbird that nests in structurally-complex young forest across eastern North America. As with many early-successional obligates, this species has been declining for decades due, in part, to the steady loss of young forest/shrubland nesting habitat. Although con-servation programs have begun restoring Golden-winged Warbler habitat, these efforts are currently limited by the inability to identify existing habitat across large spatial extents and diverse ownership patterns. Recent availability of state-wide LiDAR data for Pennsylvania provides an opportunity to overcome this limitation. From 2019 to 20, we surveyed for Golden-winged Warblers and structural vegetation at 837 sites across six forest blocks in eastern Pennsylvania. We combined these data with LiDAR derived forest structural metrics to develop statistical models to predict patterns of occupancy. Golden-winged Warbler occupancy probability was explained by models containing several LiDAR-derived structural metrics (e.g., percentage of first returns between 1 and 5 m in height, structural complexity, etc.). Moreover, models fit with LiDAR-derived covariates predicted occu-pancy much better than those using only field-measured vegetation covariates (Delta AICc = 53.27). Mapped pre-dictions of Golden-winged Warbler occupancy revealed potential habitat (especially regenerating timber harvests) on both private and public lands. These results demonstrate the efficacy of LiDAR for modeling forest bird habitat associations, and how such data sources can provide a valuable tool for conservation planning.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Heat Island Effect, Heat Stress and Public Health in Colombo, Sri Lanka and Shenzhen, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human health, energy and comfort are determined by the climate that remains in the physical environment. Regarding urban climate, few studies assess the urban heat island effect, heat stress, and public health as geographical representations. This study seeks to fill this gap by selecting Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Shenzhen, China, comparatively, two coastal cities with different climate conditions. We quantified and compared the effects of heat waves and their impacts on public health and the effect of urbanization on urban heat islands (UHI). Heat-related public health issues have been calculated using the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect was analyzed using Land Surface Temperature (LST), created based on Landsat images obtained in 1997, 2009 and 2019. A rapid increase in temperature and humidity creates an uncomfortable environment in both cities, but apparent differences can be observed in climatic phenomena. During the summer (June to August), the prevailing atmospheric condition in Shenzhen makes a "Very severe stress" with Heatstroke highly likely. Nevertheless, seven months (November to April) are found as "Comfortable" without having any heat-related health injuries. However, Colombo has never been classified as "Comfortable" throughout the year. Out of twelve, five months (April to August) are found as "Very severe stress" with Heatstroke highly likely. When considering the urban expansion and UHI, a fast expansion can be observed in Colombo than in Shenzhen. Consequently, with the more severe heat-related public health and rapid urban heat island expansion, Colombo makes it more stressful than Shenzhen city. Our findings highlight the comparison between heat-related public health and urban heat island between two coastal cities with different climate conditions and under rapid urbanization processes. Therefore, it is imperative to assess these risks and respond effectively.

TI  - The role of imaging and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with T3b-T4b melanoma with clinically negative disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies demonstrate minimal utility of pre-operative imaging for low-risk melanoma; however, imaging may be more critical for patients with high-risk disease. Our study evaluates the impact of peri-operative cross-sectional imaging in patients with T3b-T4b melanoma. MethodsPatients with T3b-T4b melanoma who underwent wide local excision were identified from a single institution (1/1/2005 - 12/31/2020). Cross-sectional imaging was defined as body CT, PET and/or MRI in the perioperative period, with the following findings: in-transit or nodal disease, metastatic disease, incidental cancer, or other. Propensity scores were created for the odds of undergoing pre-operative imaging. Recurrence free survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. ResultsA total of 209 patients were identified with a median age of 65 (IQR 54-76), of which the majority were male (65.1%), with nodular melanoma (39.7%) and T4b disease (47.9%). Overall, 55.0% underwent pre-operative imaging. There were no differences in imaging findings between the pre- and post-operative cohorts. After propensity-score matching, there was no difference in recurrence free survival. Sentinel node biopsy was performed in 77.5% patients, with 47.5% resulting in a positive result. ConclusionPre-operative cross-sectional imaging does not impact the management of patients with high-risk melanoma. Careful consideration of imaging use is critical in the management of these patients and highlights the importance of sentinel node biopsy for stratification and decision making.

TI  - Six Years of IKFS-2 Global Ozone Total Column Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ozone plays an important role in the biosphere's absorbing of dangerous solar UV radiation and its contributions to the Earth's climate. Nowadays, ozone variations are widely monitored by different local and remote sensing methods. Satellite methods can provide data on the global distribution of ozone and its anomalies. In contrast to measurement techniques based on solar radiation measurements, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) satellite measurements of thermal radiation provide information, regardless of solar illumination. The global distribution of total ozone columns (TOCs) measured by the IKFS-2 spectrometer aboard the "Meteor M N2" satellite for the period of 2015 to 2020 is presented. The retrieval algorithm uses the artificial neural network (ANN) based on measurements of TOCs by the Aura OMI instrument and the method of principal components for representing IKFS-2 spectral measurements. Latitudinal and seasonal dependencies on the ANN training errors are analyzed and considered as a first approximation of the TOC measurement errors. The TOCs derived by the IKFS-2 instrument are compared to independent ground-based and satellite data. The average differences between the IKFS-2 data and the independent TOC measurements are up to 2% (IKFS-2 usually slightly underestimates the other data), and the standard deviations of differences (SDDs) vary from 2 to 4%. At the same time, both the analysis of the ANN approximation errors of the OMI data and the comparison of the IKFS-2 results with independent data demonstrate an increase in discrepancies towards the poles. In the spring-winter period, SDDs reach 8% in the Southern and 6% in the Northern Hemisphere. The technique presented can be used to process the IKFS-2 spectral data, and as a result, it can provide global information on the TOCs in the period of 2015-2020, regardless of the solar illumination and the presence of clouds.

TI  - Efficiency analysis of reinsurers in India: a three stage fuzzy closed system DEA approach
T2  - OPSEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper a three-stage closed system fuzzy network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed to assess the competency of reinsurers (both Indian and Foreign branch) functioning in India by disintegrating the complex service process into three sub-processes. The production, investment, and effectiveness frameworks are appraised in three stages. The output of the first stage is considered as the input for the second stage, and the output of the second stage is an input for the third stage. The fuzzy DEA findings reveal the individual efficiency score of production, investment, and the effectiveness sub-processes of each Decision-Making Unit (DMUs), which also ascertains the results of conventional DEA for all three stages. The data for this study has been taken from the Indian Insurance Regulator (IRDAI), spanning three years from FY 2017-2020.

TI  - Twenty years of experience with less radical fertility-sparing surgery in early-stage cervical cancer: Pregnancy outcomes
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The standard procedure in cervical cancer is radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND). Because of the increasing age of women bearing children, fertility has become a major challenge. We present pregnancy results after less radical fertility-sparing surgery in women with IA1, LVSI positive, IA2 and IB1 (<2 cm, infiltration less than half of the cervical stroma).Materials and method. All women (n = 91) underwent laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping with fro-zen section followed by PLND and "selective parametrectomy" (removal of afferent lymphatic channels from the paracervix) if sentinel nodes (SLN) are negative. If lymph nodes were verified negative by definitive histopathol-ogy, patients were treated by simple trachelectomy (IB1) or large cone (IA1/IA2) biopsy 1 week after primary surgery.Results. From 1999 to 2018, 91 women were enrolled in the study (median age 29.1 years, range 21-40). Fer-tility was spared in 76 (83.5%) women; 13 (17.1%) women did not plan future pregnancy and 63 (82.9%) had pregnancy desires. Fifty-four of 63 women conceived (pregnancy rate 85.7%) and 48 of 63 delivered 58 babies (delivery rate 76.2%). Thirty-nine women delivered in term (67.2%): 13 women between 32 and 36 + 6 weeks of pregnancy, 3 between 28 and 31 + 6 weeks and 3 between 24 and 27 + 6 weeks. Only one woman still plans pregnancy. One woman is currently pregnant.Conclusion. The goal of fertility-sparing surgery is to produce good oncological results and promising preg-nancy outcomes. Pregnancy results after less radical fertility-sparing procedures show promise (pregnancy rate 82.9% and delivery rate 76.2%).(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - FEPVNet: A Network with Adaptive Strategies for Cross-Scale Mapping of Photovoltaic Panels from Multi-Source Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is transitioning to renewable energy, with photovoltaic (PV) solar power being one of the most promising energy sources. Large-scale PV mapping provides the most up-to-date and accurate PV geospatial information, which is crucial for planning and constructing PV power plants, optimizing energy structure, and assessing the ecological impact of PVs. However, previous methods of PV extraction relied on simple models and single data sources, which could not accurately obtain PV geospatial information. Therefore, we propose the Filter-Embedded Network (FEPVNet), which embeds high-pass and low-pass filters and Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) into a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) to improve its noise resistance and adaptive feature extraction capabilities, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of PV extraction. We also introduce three data migration strategies by combining Sentinel-2, Google-14, and Google-16 images in varying proportions and transferring the FEPVNet trained on Sentinel-2 images to Gaofen-2 images, which improves the generalization performance of models trained on a single data source for extracting PVs in images of different scales. Our model improvement experiments demonstrate that the Intersection over Union (IoU) of FEPVNet in segmenting China PVs in Sentinel-2 images reaches 88.68%, a 2.37% increase compared to the HRNet. Furthermore, we use FEPVNet and the optimal migration strategy to extract photovoltaics across scales, achieving a precision of 94.37%. In summary, this study proposes the FEPVNet model with adaptive strategies for extracting PVs from multiple image sources, with significant potential for application in large-scale PV mapping.

TI  - Patterns and controls of ecosystem service values under different land-use change scenarios in a mining-dominated basin of northern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring future land use/cover change (LULC) and ecosystem service values (ESV) dynamics is crucial for sustainable development from regional to global scales. However, ESV dynamics is significantly affected by economic development and policy changes, and future projections of ESV are generally characterized by large uncertainties due to complexity in LULC dynamics. Mining activities are supposed to exert significant effects on ESV dynamics, while the patterns and controls of ESV in mining-dominated basins are still less understood, especially under different land-use scenarios. Here, based on multi-source remote sensing data and land-use data in the Fenhe River Basin, we integrated the SD model, Markov model and PLUS model to simulate LULC in the Fenhe River Basin under four scenarios, i.e., the economic development priority (EDP), natural development priority (ND), cultivated land protection priority (CLP), and ecological protection priority (EPP). Based on ESV equivalent coefficient method and geographical detector, we further determined the patterns and controls of ESV. Results showed that construction land and cultivated land were mainly concentrated in the central parts of the basin, and grassland and woodland were concentrated in the edge area of the basin. Over the past two decades, construction land and woodland have experienced significant expansion, while the areas of grasslands and cultivated lands have declined due to mining activities. The high-value and sub-high-value areas of ESV were concentrated in woodland, grassland, reservoir and concentrated water area of mainstream and tributary. The low-value area was mainly located in the gathering area of construction land. The total ESV showed a downward trend with time, and the highest decline in the total ESV under the four land use scenarios was the EDP, while the lowest drop was the EPP. The highest contribution rate of ESV was woodland, which was equivalent to the contribution rate of cultivated land, grassland and water area, totally accounting for 58.54% of the whole ESV. The geographical detector method indicated that distance to the residential area, soil erodibility, distance to the river, soil type and annual average temperature were the main driving factors affecting the spatial patterns of ESV. Our results highlighted the fundamental role of mining activity in affecting LULC characterized by grassland and cultivated land shrinkage, and suggested that mining areas rehabilitation should be given priority in terms of further improving ESV in mining-dominated basins.

TI  - Estimation of particulate matter concentrations in Turkiye using a random forest model based on satellite AOD retrievals
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates intra-daily PM10 concentrations at 213 inland and coastal monitoring sites in Turkiye from 2008 to 2019 using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). An estimation model based on the random forest (RF) approach was developed using the AOD data from the Terra satellite, the meteorological data, and aerosol diagnostics from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and other auxiliary variables. First, the correlation between the matched PM10 concentrations and MODIS AOD was investigated simply with the quadrant regression (QR) approach. Next, the feature selection procedure was applied to obtain the most significant predictive variables for the estimation model. Then, the spatial and temporal performances of the developed RF model were intensely discussed. Finally, a bias analysis based on the most influential input parameters was also performed to examine the potential errors in the estimated PM10 concentrations. As a result, the RF model showed moderately good performance, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.72 and low root mean square error (RMSE) over the entire country, which was better than the results of previous studies in the region. Moreover, the model better estimated PM10 concentrations at individual monitoring sites (with R up to 0.90), particularly in coastal regions. However, overfitting occurred in areas with low populations and few monitoring stations. Additionally, the RF model's performance varied slightly across different seasons, such as autumn (R approximately equal to 0.69), spring (R approximately equal to 0.65), winter (R approximately equal to 0.64), and summer (R approximately equal to 0.60), and it did not adequately estimate intra-daily PM10 concentrations at the seasonal scale. Furthermore, the bias analyses indicated that higher PM10 and dust mass concentrations, u and v wind components were significant parameters that caused bias in the estimations. Finally, this study provides valuable information for further applications in PM10 patterns and represents the first step toward constructing a high-resolution satellite-based air quality monitoring network in Turkiye.

T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Scientific evaluation of ecological environmental quality is the premise of realizing regional ecological sustainable development. Taking Landsat series satellite images from 1990 to 2020 as the data source, on the basis of the entropy remote sensing ecological index (E-RSEI), combining the Mann-Kendall significance test, Theil-Sen Median analysis, Hurst exponent, and stability analysis, the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of ecological environmental quality in typical ecological areas of the Yellow River Basin were analyzed in the context of multi-spatiotemporal scales. In addition, the effects of eight environmental and human factors on the change in E-RSEI were quantified using a geodetector. The results showed that:① in the past 31 years, the average value of E-RSEI was 67.5%, which showed an increasing trend on the time scale, with an average increase of 0.066·(10 a)-1. On the spatial scale, E-RSEI was higher in the west and the south lower in the east and the north. ② The ecological environmental quality will continue to improve in the future, but 9.33% of the areas have potential risks of degradation. ③ Precipitation was the dominant environmental factor that affected the spatial distribution of E-RSEI in this area, and the influence of human factors was low. Compared with that of single factors, the interaction of factors had a stronger impact on ecological environmental quality, and the interaction between precipitation and other factors played a leading role. The results of this study can provide a scientific reference for the sustainable development of ecological environmental quality in the ecological zone of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Annual and Seasonal Trends of Vegetation Responses and Feedback to Temperature on the Tibetan Plateau since the 1980s
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation-temperature relationship is crucial in understanding land-atmosphere interactions on the Tibetan Plateau. Although many studies have investigated the connections between vegetation and climate variables in this region using remote sensing technology, there remain notable gaps in our understanding of vegetation-temperature interactions over different timescales. Here, we combined site-level air temperature observations, information from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies (GIMMS) dataset, and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of air temperature, vegetation, and land surface temperature (LST) on the Tibetan Plateau at annual and seasonal scales. We achieved these spatiotemporal patterns by using Sen's slope, sequential Mann-Kendall tests, and partial correlation analysis. The timescale differences of vegetation-induced LST were subsequently discussed. Our results demonstrate that a breakpoint of air temperature change occurred on the Tibetan Plateau during 1994-1998, dividing the study period (1982-2013) into two phases. A more significant greening response of NDVI occurred in the spring and autumn with earlier breakpoints and a more sensitive NDVI response occurred in recent warming phase. Both MODIS and GIMMS data showed a common increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the Tibetan Plateau for all timescales, while the former had a larger greening area since 2000. The most prominent trends in NDVI and LST were identified in spring and autumn, respectively, and the largest areas of significant variation in NDVI and LST mostly occurred in winter and autumn, respectively. The partial correlation analysis revealed a significant negative impact of NDVI on LST during the annual scale and autumn, and it had a significant positive impact during spring. Our findings improve the general understanding of vegetation-climate relationships at annual and seasonal scales.

TI  - A New Method for Crop Type Mapping at the Regional Scale Using Multi-Source and Multi-Temporal Sentinel Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping at high resolution is crucial for various purposes related to agriculture and food security, including the monitoring of crop yields, evaluating the potential effects of natural disasters on agricultural production, analyzing the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture, etc. However, accurately mapping crop types and ranges on large spatial scales remains a challenge. For the accurate mapping of crop types at the regional scale, this paper proposed a crop type mapping method based on the combination of multiple single-temporal feature images and time-series feature images derived from Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Firstly, crop type classification was performed separately using multiple single-temporal feature images and the time-series feature image. Secondly, with the help of information entropy, this study proposed a pixel-scale crop type classification accuracy evaluation metric, i.e., the CA-score, which was used to conduct a vote on the classification results of multiple single-temporal images and the time-series feature image to obtain the final crop type map. A comparative analysis showed that the proposed classification method had excellent performance and that it can achieve accurate mapping of multiple crop types at a 10 m resolution for large spatial scales. The overall accuracy (OA) and the kappa coefficient (KC) were 84.15% and 0.80, respectively. Compared with the classification results that were based on the time-series feature image, the OA was improved by 3.37%, and the KC was improved by 0.03. In addition, the CA-score proposed in this study can effectively reflect the accuracy of crop identification and can serve as a pixel-scale classification accuracy evaluation metric, providing a more comprehensive visual interpretation of the classification accuracy. The proposed method and metrics have the potential to be applied to the mapping of larger study areas with more complex land cover types using remote sensing.

TI  - Construction and Assessment of a Drought-Monitoring Index Based on Multi-Source Data Using a Bias-Corrected Random Forest (BCRF) Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought significantly impacts agricultural production, highlighting the need for accurate monitoring. Accurate agricultural-drought-monitoring models are critical for timely warning and prevention. The random forest (RF) is a popular artificial intelligence method but has not been extensively studied for agricultural drought monitoring. Here, multi-source remote sensing data, including surface temperature, vegetation index, and soil moisture data, were used as independent variables; the 3-month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI_3) was used as the dependent variable. Soil texture and terrain data were used as auxiliary variables. The bias-corrected RF model was used to construct a random forest synthesized drought index (RFSDI). The drought-degree determination coefficients (R2) of the training and test sets reached 0.86 and 0.89, respectively. The RFSDI and SPEI_3 fit closely, with a correlation coefficient (R) above 0.92. The RFSDI accurately reflected typical drought years and effectively monitored agricultural drought in Northeast China (NEC). In the past 18 years, agricultural drought in NEC has generally decelerated. The degree and scope of drought impacts from 2003 to 2010 were greater than those from 2010 to 2020. Agricultural drought occurrence in NEC was associated with dominant climatic variables such as precipitation (PRE), surface temperature (Ts), relative humidity (RHU), and sunshine duration (SSD), alongside elevation and soil texture differences. The agricultural drought occurrence percentage at 50-500 m elevations reached 94.91%, and the percentage of occurrence in loam and sandy soils reached 90.31%. Water and temperature changes were significantly correlated with the occurrence of agricultural drought. Additionally, NEC showed an alternating cycle of drought and waterlogging of about 10 years. These results have significant application potential for agricultural drought monitoring and drought prevention in NEC and demonstrate a new approach to comprehensively evaluating agricultural drought.

TI  - Evolutionary trends of urban expansion and its sustainable development: Evidence from 80 representative cities in the belt and road initiative region
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) region has undoubtedly led to changes in the scale, form, and pattern of cities to accommodate the expansion of industry, housing, and commerce and to produce sus-tained impacts on environmental sustainability. However, limited studies have yet to systematically investigate the urban expansion in this area. Based on a systematic research path of "pattern-mode-coordination-sustain -ability", this study quantified the urban expansion dynamics of BRI countries and 80 representative cities from 2000 to 2018 using multi-source remote sensing data and the Global Atlas of Urban Expansion. The results show that in terms of dynamic rules, the share of urban lands grew from 0.32 % in 2000 to 0.66 % in 2018 (an increase of 250,600 km2) and is estimated to increase to 1.68 % in 2018-2030. Countries in developing regions (i.e., West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Asia) are predicted to become the new high-value centers of urban expansion intensity (UEI). The UEI of BRI cities showed a significant developing region orientation and "high in the east and low in the west" distribution pattern but would gradually shift towards a spatially homogeneous and discrete distribution. BRI cities can be divided into four expansion modes (center-periphery, double-winged strip, dual -core cluster, and single-winged mutation expansion), each with a different evolutionary dynamic mechanism. Regarding coordination, there is a great demand for land expansion by population and economic growth in BRI cities. This dependence increased as the city's UEI index rose; when the UEI exceeded 3 %, the dependence became more pronounced. The investigations also showed that the adverse ecological effects of urban land expansion are gradually increasing at the urban scale. Furthermore, the ecological impacts of population growth are usually the strongest for BRI's countries and cities, and the intensity showed a synergistic growth trend with the UEI index. This study provides new insights into the dynamic features of BRI's urban expansion from national to urban scales and historical to future periods, while also contributing new perspectives from the BRI to optimal global land management and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Surgical therapy of the axilla-is less more?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - For breast cancer patients with clinically node-negative disease (cN0), the implementation of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) more than two decades ago has reduced surgical radicality in the axilla and thus the morbidity rate without a loss of oncologic safety. For patients with suspicious axillary lymph nodes (cN+) who undergo primary surgery, complete axillary dissection (ALND) remains the standard of care. However, if neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is indicated and conversion to a clinically nonsuspicious nodal status is achieved (ycN0), targeted removal of the initially most suspicious axillary lymph node, the target lymph node (TLN), in combination with SLNB, may avoid ALND in patients with pathological complete remission of the axillary lymph nodes (ypN0).

TI  - Study on the Source of Debris Flow in the Northern Scenic Spot of Changbai Mountain Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern scenic area of Changbai Mountain is a high-incidence area of debris flow disasters, which seriously threaten the safety of tourist's lives and property. Monitoring debris flow and providing early warning is critical for timely avoidance. Monitoring the change of debris flow source is an effective way to predict debris flow, and the change of source can be reflected in the settlement deformation of the study area. The offset tracking technique (OT) is insensitive to the coherence of SAR images and can resist the decoherence of D-InSAR and SBSA-InSAR to a certain extent. It is a technical means for monitoring large gradient deformation. It has been widely used in the field of seismic activity, glaciers and landslides in recent years, but few scholars have applied this technique in the field of debris flow. In this paper, we use OT techniques in combination with field surveys, Google imagery and Sentinel-1 data to monitor surface deformation in the northern scenic area of Changbai Mountain in 2017 and use D-InSAR techniques to compare and complement the OT monitoring results. The results of this study show that for monitoring surface deformation in the study area after a mudslide, it is better to use both methods to determine the surface deformation in the study area rather than one, and that both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and yet can complement each other. Finally, we have predicted the development trend of mudflows in the study area by combining the calculated single mudflow solids washout, which will help to improve the long-term monitoring and warning capability of mudflows in the study area. The study also enriches the application of offset-tracking technology and D-InSAR in the field of geohazard monitoring and provides new ideas and methods for the study of mudflow material source changes.

TI  - Spirituality and intentions to engage in Covid-19 protective behaviours
T2  - SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accumulating evidence points to spirituality as a belief system that contributes to low trust in science, with self-identified spiritual individuals reporting high levels of unwarranted scepticism towards science in general and vaccination specifically. We investigated whether self-identified spirituality also predicts intentions to engage with Covid-19 protective measures during the pandemic. In Studies 1-3 (N = 774), we asked participants to report their spirituality and desire to be vaccinated against Covid-19 shortly after the first vaccine rollout. In Studies 2-3, we included measures of scepticism towards and intentions to comply with Covid-19 prevention measures (handwashing, wearing face coverings, distancing). As expected, stronger self-reported spirituality involved lower desire to be vaccinated, controlling for various worldview and demographic variables. Yet, we found no evidence for spirituality to predict scepticism towards other Covid-19 preventative behaviours or intentions to engage with them. Our findings corroborate and extend previous literature on science rejection, demonstrating that spirituality is uniquely involved in vaccine rejection.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the destruction caused by a tsunami is a challenging task that must be completed quickly with limited resources and information. To address this issue, we propose a method for accurate damage mapping using binary classification of high-resolution satellite imagery, where we enhance the performance of three pre-trained deep neural network models (Vgg19, Inception, and Xception). The pre-trained models are used, which have been previously trained on large datasets, and transferred to our tsunami problem. We also develop a custom network architecture specifically designed for tsunami damage detection using high-resolution remote sensing data, improving the accuracy of automated binary classification. We investigate the impact of various parameters and learning rates to detect small objects, demonstrating the suitability of our approach for tsunami damage assessment. Our network outperforms traditional and current deep learning-based approaches, as it shows low bias and high variance datasets that result in a skillful model. Specifically, we observe that Inception-v3 performs best on the dataset, exhibiting good behavior with low errors and achieving the best overall score with 24.11 min, while other models score between 30.50 min for Vgg19 and 45.33 min for Xception. Our study focuses on two important binary classification categories, tsunami-stricken and non-stricken areas, for which we train the proposed framework on a dataset comprising 30,000 small tiles of high-resolution satellite images obtained from Mexer satellite images. The model is validated on 8000 images using the Jupyter notebook of the Anaconda deep learning framework.

TI  - Deep Learning Approaches for Wildland Fires Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data: Detection, Mapping, and Prediction
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Wildland fires are one of the most dangerous natural risks, causing significant economic damage and loss of lives worldwide. Every year, millions of hectares are lost, and experts warn that the frequency and severity of wildfires will increase in the coming years due to climate change. To mitigate these hazards, numerous deep learning models were developed to detect and map wildland fires, estimate their severity, and predict their spread. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning techniques for detecting, mapping, and predicting wildland fires using satellite remote sensing data. We begin by introducing remote sensing satellite systems and their use in wildfire monitoring. Next, we review the deep learning methods employed for these tasks, including fire detection and mapping, severity estimation, and spread prediction. We further present the popular datasets used in these studies. Finally, we address the challenges faced by these models to accurately predict wildfire behaviors, and suggest future directions for developing reliable and robust wildland fire models.

TI  - Decoding Chambal River Shoreline Transformations: A Comprehensive Analysis Using Remote Sensing, GIS, and DSAS
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal sand mining has been identified as a significant cause of harm to riverbanks, as it leads to excessive removal of sand from rivers and negatively impacts river shorelines. This investigation aimed to identify instances of shoreline erosion and accretion at illegal sand mining sites along the Chambal River. These sites were selected based on a report submitted by the Director of the National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS) to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India. The digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS v5.1) was used during the elapsed period from 1990 to 2020. Three statistical parameters used in DSAS-the shoreline change envelope (SCE), endpoint rate (EPR), and net shoreline movement (NSM)-quantify the rates of shoreline changes in the form of erosion and accretion patterns. To carry out this study, Landsat imagery data (T.M., ETM+, and OLI) and Sentinel-2A/MSI from 1990 to 2020 were used to analyze river shoreline erosion and accretion. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were used to detect riverbanks in satellite images. The investigation results indicated that erosion was observed at all illegal mining sites, with the highest erosion rate of 1.26 m/year at the Sewarpali site. On the other hand, the highest accretion was identified at the Chandilpura site, with a rate of 0.63 m/year. We observed significant changes in river shorelines at illegal mining and unmined sites. Erosion and accretion at unmined sites are recorded at -0.18 m/year and 0.19 m/year, respectively, which are minor compared to mining sites. This study's findings on the effects of illegal sand mining on river shorelines will be helpful in the sustainable management and conservation of river ecosystems. These results can also help to develop and implement river sand mining policies that protect river ecosystems from the long-term effects of illegal sand mining.

TI  - Investigating the Feasibility of Using Satellite Rainfall for the Integrated Prediction of Flood and Landslide Hazards over Shaanxi Province in Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-triggered flood and landslide hazards pose significant threats to human lives and infrastructure worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the applicability of three satellite rainfall data sets-namely, CMORPH, GPM, and TRMM-for the prediction of flood and landslide hazards using a coupled hydrological-slope stability model. The spatial distribution of annual rainfall from the three satellite data sets was similar to that of gauge rainfall, with an increasing trend from the north to the south of Shaanxi Province. The average annual rainfall of CMORPH was the lowest, while that of TRMM was the highest. The modeled discharges forcing by satellite rainfall generally matched the observed discharges at four hydrological stations for the period 2010-2012, with average correlation coefficients of 0.51, 0.61, and 0.57 for the CMORPH, GPM, and TRMM rainfall, respectively. The exceedance probabilities of modeled discharges for the three satellite rainfall data sets were close to those of the observations, particularly when the discharges were low. Moreover, the landslide prediction results demonstrated that the three satellite rainfall data sets could simulate the spatial distribution of landslide events well; these simulations were consistent with the information in the landslide inventory map. Furthermore, when compared to the classical Intensity-Duration (ID) rainfall threshold method, the physically based slope stability model presented higher global accuracy under all three satellite rainfall data sets. The global accuracy of GPM rainfall was the highest among the three data sets (0.973 for GPM vs. 0.951 for CMORPH and 0.965 for TRMM), indicating that GPM rainfall provides the highest quality compared to CMORPH and TRMM rainfall. These findings provide a crucial basis for the application of satellite rainfall data in the context of flood and landslide prediction.

TI  - Geothermal Exploration Using Remote Sensing, Surface Temperature, and Geophysical Data in Lunayyir Volcanic Field, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy consumption worldwide has undergone a recent shift, with hydrocarbons, coal, and new energy sources taking center stage. However, fossil fuels face criticism due to their negative impacts on the environment through air pollution. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable, and eco-friendly alternative that can be harnessed for power generation. The Lunayyir volcanic field is located in the western part of Saudi Arabia and has been identified as a potential geothermal resource. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the gravity, magnetic, and land surface temperature data collected over the study area is conducted to investigate the geothermal potential. The gravity data are processed using standard techniques to correct for instrument drift, diurnal variations, and topographic effects and to filter out high-frequency noise. The magnetic data are processed using standard procedures. Analysis of the gravity data shows that the Lunayyir volcanic field is characterized by a series of gravity anomalies, which can be interpreted as indicative of the presence of subsurface geologic structures that are similar in geothermal areas, such as faults, fractures, and intrusions. The magnetic data, on the other hand, show that the volcanic field has a relatively low magnetic susceptibility, which is consistent with the presence of volcanic rocks implying shallow heat sources. Landsat satellite data are utilized to calculate the land surface temperature through the use of GIS software. Additionally, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is calculated using the near-infrared and red bands of the Landsat satellite. The land surface temperature of the year 2007 shows the relatively high temperature at the surface as compared to 2000 and 2021, which is an indication of volcanic activities in the subsurface. It is suggested that these structures may provide conduits for hot fluids, which could potentially be exploited for geothermal energy production. The obtained results emphasize the importance of combining different geophysical datasets to obtain a better understanding of underground geology and geothermal systems. In general, this study improves the assessment of the Lunayyir volcanic field in the western part of Saudi Arabia for geothermal energy.

TI  - Assessment of prediction model of the CPUE of neon flying squid with different sources of remote sensing data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately building the relationship between the oceanographic environment and the distribution of neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) is very important to understand the potential habitat pattern of O. bartramii. However, when building the prediction model of O. bartramii with traditional oceanographic variables (e.g., chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) and sea surface temperature (SST)) from space-borne observations, part of the important spectrum characteristics of the oceanic surface could be masked by using the satellite data products directly. In this study, the neglected remote sensing information (i.e., spectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and brightness temperature (BT)) is firstly incorporated to build the prediction model of catch per unit effort (CPUE) of O. bartramii from July to December during 2014-2018 in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. Results show that both the conventional oceanographic variables and the neglected remote sensing data are suitable for building the prediction model, whereas the overall root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted CPUE of O. bartramii with the former is typically less accurate than that with the latter. Hence, the Rrs and BT could be a more suitable data source than the Chl a and SST to predict the distribution of O. bartramii, highlighting that the potential value of the neglected variables in understanding the habitat suitability of O. bartramii.

AB  - Although much has been written about Yoshimoto Takaaki's political philosophy and Terayama Shuji's art as two of the most relevant figures in the culture of the Japanese long 1968, it has not yet been addressed how the qualitative content of their respective works displayed a similar worldview through different media to the point of generating a sort of indirect dialogue. This article aims to fill this gap in our understanding by addressing this connection through the analysis of the intersection between Yoshimoto's influential theory of taishu ('the masses') and Terayama's parody of characters, as epitomized in his most iconic film Sho o suteyo machi e deyo (Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets, 1971). Likewise, I critically explore how Yoshimoto and Terayama's anti-establishment distrust of ideology and words contributed to the ethos of the Japanese New Left, especially its student Zenkyoto (All-Campus Joint Struggle Committees) movement, halfway between the modern and the postmodern. The interdisciplinary approach to two such seemingly distant media as written political philosophy and cinema will dialectically contribute to our understanding of the cultural history of the Japanese long 1968 by tracing the thread of its anti-establishment imagination.

TI  - Disease specific air quality health index (AQHI) for spatiotemporal health risk assessment of multi-air pollutants
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While significant reductions in certain air pollutant concentrations did not induce obvious mitigations of health risks, a shift from air quality management to health risk prevention and control might be necessary to protect public health. This study thus constructed an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for respiratory (Res-AQHI), cardiovascular (Car-AQHI), and allergic (Aller-AQHI) risk groups using mixed exposure under multi-air pollut-ants and portrayed their distribution and variation at multiple spatiotemporal scales using spatial analysis in GIS with the medical big data and air pollution remote sensing data by taking Hunan Province in China as a case. Results showed that the AQHIs constructed for specific health-risk groups could better express their risks than common AQHI and AQI. Moreover, based on the spatiotemporal association of health and environmental in-formation, the allergic risk group in Hunan provided the highest health risk mainly affected by O3. The following cardiovascular and respiratory risk groups can be significantly attributed to NO2. Moreover, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of AQHIs within regions was also evident. On the annual scale, the population in the air health risk hotspots for respiratory and cardiovascular risk decreased, while allergic risks increased. Meanwhile, on seasonal scale, the hotspots for respiratory and cardiovascular risks expanded significantly in winter while completely disappearing for allergic risk. These findings suggest that disease specific AQHIs effectively disclose the health effects of multi-air pollutants and their subsequently varied spatiotemporal distribution patterns.

TI  - DF-UHRNet: A Modified CNN-Based Deep Learning Method for Automatic Sea Ice Classification from Sentinel-1A/B SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the goal of automatic sea ice mapping during the summer sea ice melt cycle, this study involved designing a fully automatic sea ice segmentation method based on a deep learning semantic segmentation network applicable to summer SAR images, which achieved high accuracy and the fully automatic extraction of sea ice segmentation during the summer ice melt cycle by optimizing the process, improving the pixel-level semantic segmentation network, and introducing high-resolution sea ice concentration features. Firstly, a convolution-based, high-resolution sea ice concentration calculation method is proposed and was applied to the deep learning task. Secondly, the proposed DF-UHRNet network was improved upon by designing high- and low-level fusion modules, introducing an attention mechanism, and reducing the number of convolution layers and other operations, and it can effectively fuse high- and low-scale semantic features and global contextual information based on reducing the overall number of network parameters, enabling it to achieve pixel-level classification. The results show that this method meets the needs associated with the automatic mapping and high-precision classification of thin ice, one-year ice, open water, and multi-year ice and effectively reduces the model size.

TI  - Detailed preoperative lymphatic mapping by lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node identification: a pictorial essay
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Pre-operative lymphatic mapping for sentinel node identification is essential for accurate staging in patients with several solid cancers and for important prognostic implications. Tc-99m-labelled colloid lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative sentinel lymph node detection using a gamma probe represent a well-established nuclear medicine technique and a detailed imaging method thanks to the advent of hybrid multi-modality SPET/CT. Through the description of numerous clinical cases, different in terms of cancer type and fields of application, we aimed to bring out the strengths and advantages of pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy that make it still today incomparable to other techniques.

TI  - Morbid obesity increases the failure rate of sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the success rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using indocyanine green and near-infrared imaging. Sentinel lymph node mapping is recommended for patients with endometrial carcinoma to reduce the rate of full lymphadenectomy and its associated morbidity such as lymphedema. A retrospective review was conducted of robotic hysterectomy procedures for patients with a coded diagnosis of endometrial cancer and a cost code for indocyanine green discharged between March, 2016 and August, 2019. Preoperative characteristics included age, BMI, and number of prior abdominal surgeries (includes cervical, adnexal, uterine or rectal procedures, caesarian section, or appendectomy). Intra and postoperative characteristics included procedure time (incision to close), estimated blood loss, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, uterine weight, uterine diameter, FIGO Grade, myometrial depth, and depth of myometrial invasion. SLN and non-SLN number, location, and pathology were recorded. The primary outcome was the bilateral success rate for SLN mapping. Patients with class III obesity (BMI > 40) were found to have a significantly lower success rate for SLN mapping when compared with all other BMI categories (54.1% vs. 76.1%, respectively, p < 0.01).

TI  - A Deep Feature Fusion Method for Complex Ground Object Classification in the Land Cover Ecosystem Using ZY1-02D and Sentinel-1A
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the successful application of multimodal deep learning (MDL) methods for land use/land cover (LULC) classification tasks, their fusion capacity has not yet been substantially examined for hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Hyperspectral and SAR data have recently been widely used in land cover classification. However, the speckle noise of SAR and the heterogeneity with the imaging mechanism of hyperspectral data have hindered the application of MDL methods for integrating hyperspectral and SAR data. Accordingly, we proposed a deep feature fusion method called Refine-EndNet that combines a dynamic filter network (DFN), an attention mechanism (AM), and an encoder-decoder framework (EndNet). The proposed method is specifically designed for hyperspectral and SAR data and adopts an intra-group and inter-group feature fusion strategy. In intra-group feature fusion, the spectral information of hyperspectral data is integrated by fully connected neural networks in the feature dimension. The fusion filter generation network (FFGN) suppresses the presence of speckle noise and the influence of heterogeneity between multimodal data. In inter-group feature fusion, the fusion weight generation network (FWGN) further optimizes complementary information and improves fusion capacity. Experimental results from ZY1-02D satellite hyperspectral data and Sentinel-1A dual-polarimetric SAR data illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional feature-level image fusion (FLIF) and MDL methods, such as S(2)ENet, FusAtNet, and EndNets, both visually and numerically. We first attempt to investigate the potentials of ZY1-02D satellite hyperspectral data affected by thick clouds, combined with SAR data for complex ground object classification in the land cover ecosystem.

TI  - A Multi-Pixel Split-Window Approach to Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval from Thermal Imagers with Relatively High Radiometric Noise: Preliminary Studies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the following decade(s), a set of satellite missions carrying thermal infrared (TIR) imagers with a relatively high noise equivalent differential temperature (NEdT) are expected, e.g., the high resolution TIR imagers flying on the future Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA), Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM) and NASA-JPL/ASI Surface Biology and Geology Thermal (SBG) missions or the secondary payload on board the ESA Earth Explorer 10 Harmony. The instruments on board these missions are expected to be characterized by an NEdT of ?0.1 K. In order to reduce the impact of radiometric noise on the retrieved sea surface temperature (SST), this study investigates the possibility of applying a multi-pixel atmospheric correction based on the hypotheses that (i) the spatial variability scales of radiatively active atmospheric variables are, on average, larger than those of the SST and (ii) the effect of atmosphere is accounted for via the split window (SW) difference. Based on 32 Sentinel 3 SLSTR case studies selected in oceanic regions where SST features are mainly driven by meso to sub-mesoscale turbulence (e.g., corresponding to major western boundary currents), this study documents that the local spatial variability of the SW difference term on the scale of ?3 x 3 km(2) is comparable with the noise associated with the SW difference. Similarly, the power spectra of the SW term are shown to have, for small scales, the behavior of white noise spectra. On this basis, we suggest to average the SW term and to use it for the atmospheric correction procedure to reduce the impact of radiometric noise. In principle, this methodology can be applied on proper scales that can be dynamically defined for each pixel. The applicability of our findings to high-resolution TIR missions is discussed and an example of an application to ECOSTRESS data is reported.

TI  - Utility of daily 3 m Planet Fusion Surface Reflectance data for tillage practice mapping with deep learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tillage practices alter soil surface structure that can be potentially captured by satellite images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. This study explored tillage practice mapping using the daily Planet Fusion surface reflectance (PF-SR) gap-free 3 m data generated by fusing PlanetScope with Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS surface reflectance data. The study area is a 220 x 220 km2 agricultural area in South Dakota, USA, and the study used 3285 PF-SR images from September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. The PF-SR images for the sur-veyed 433 fields were sliced into 10,747 training (70%) and evaluation (30%) non-overlapping time series patches. The training and evaluation patches were from different fields for evaluation data independence. The performance of four deep learning models (i.e., 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN), 3D CNN, CNN-Long short-term memory (LSTM), and attention CNN-LSTM) in tillage practice mapping, as well as their sensitivity to different spatial (i.e., 3 m, 24 m, and 96 m) and temporal resolutions (16-day, 8-day, 4-day, 2-day and 1-day) were examined. Classification accuracy continuously increased with increases in both temporal and spatial resolutions. The optimal models (3D CNN and attention CNN-LSTM) achieved-77% accuracy using 2-day or daily 3 m resolution data as opposed to-72% accuracy using 16-day 3 m resolution data or daily 24 m resolution data. This study also analyzed the feature importance of different acquisition dates for the two optimal models. The 3D CNN model feature importances were found to agree well with the tillage practice time. High feature importance was associated with observations during the fall and spring tillage period (i.e., fresh tillage signals) whereas the crop peak growing period (i.e., tillage signals weathered and confounded by dense canopy) was characterized by a relatively low feature importance. The work provides valuable insights into the utility of deep learning for tillage mapping and change event time identification based on high resolution imagery.

TI  - Evaluation of Low-Cost Radiometer for Surface Reflectance Retrieval and Orbital Sensor's Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the Arable Mark 2 sensor, an automated and low-cost radiometer, for its potential to retrieve surface reflectance data and validate orbital sensors such as the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) Level 2 product. While orbital sensors are widely used for monitoring solar radiation changes, managing natural resources, and understanding climatic trends, atmospheric effects can make it challenging to obtain accurate measurements. Equipped with multiple sensors, including long-wave and short-wave radiometers, the Arable Mark 2 sensor can measure upwelling and downwelling irradiance to calculate surface reflectance. To assess the accuracy and consistency of the Arable Mark 2 sensor, the study performed a cross-calibration using a ground truth measurement collected with the Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) as the reference point. Additionally, a spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) was applied across the calibrated Arable surface reflectance to compare it against the orbital sensor. An automated library aided in calculating SBAF for the days with unavailable hyperspectral data. The study found that the Arable Mark 2 sensor can provide accurate surface reflectance data that can be used for orbital sensor validation. The Arable sensor was successfully calibrated against the ASD FieldSpec with an average difference of less than 1/10 reflectance unit (reflectance unit = 0.01) for the blue, green, yellow, and red bands. The red-edge and NIR-1 bands showed an average difference of less than 1/2 reflectance units, while the NIR-2 band had an average difference of less than 1/10 reflectance unit of calibration accuracy. The calibrated Arable surface reflectance data was then compared against orbital sensor surface reflectance data, and the results showed good agreement between the two datasets. The study concludes that the low-cost and automated nature of the Arable Mark 2 sensor makes it a promising tool for surface reflectance retrieval and orbital sensor validation.

TI  - Towards better delineation of hydrothermal alterations via multi-sensor remote sensing and airborne geophysical data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating various tools in targeting mineral deposits increases the chance of adequate detection and characterization of mineralization zones. Selecting a convenient dataset is a key for a precise geological and hydrothermal alteration mapping. Remote sensing and airborne geophysical data have proven their efficiency as tools for reliable mineral exploration. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Advanced land imager (ALI), Landsat 8 (L8), and Sentinel 2 data are widely-used data among various types of remote sensing images in resolving lithological and hydrothermal alteration mapping over the last two decades. ASTER is a well-established satellite in geological remote sensing with detailed Short-wave infrared (SWIR) range compared to visible and near-infrared region (VNIR) that controls iron-associated alteration detection. On contrary, ALI has excellent coverage of the VNIR area (6 bands), but does not possess the potentiality of ASTER for the SWIR and thermal regions. Landsat 8 is widely used and highly recommended for lithological and hydrothermal alteration mapping. The higher spatial (up to 10 m) resolution of Sentinel 2 MSI has preserved its role in producing accurate geological mapping. Notwithstanding the foregoing, implementing the four datasets in a single study is time-consuming. Thus, an important question when commencing an exploration project for hydrothermal alterations-related mineralization (orogenic mineral deposits in the current research) is: which dataset should be adopted to fulfill proper and adequate outputs? Here the four widely recommended datasets (ASTER, ALI, L8, and sentinel 2) have been tested by applying the widely-accepted techniques (false color combinations, band ratios, directed principal component analysis, and constrained energy minimization) for geological and hydrothermal alteration mapping of Gabal El Rukham-Gabal Mueilha district, Egypt. The study area is covered mainly by Neoproterozoic heterogeneous collection of ophiolitic components, island arc assemblage, intruded by enormous granitic rocks. Additionally, airborne magnetic and radiometric data were applied and compared with the remote sensing investigations for deciphering the structural and hydrothermal alteration patterns within the study area. The results demonstrated a different extent from one sensor to another, highlighting their varied efficacy in detecting hydrothermal alterations (mainly hydroxyl-bearing alterations and iron oxides). Moreover, the analysis of airborne magnetic and radiometric data showed hydrothermal alteration zones that are consistent with the detected alteration pattern. The coincidence between high magnetic anomalies, high values of the K/eTh ratio, and the resultant alterations confirm the real alteration anomalies. Over and above that, the remote sensing results and airborne geophysical indications were verified with fieldwork and petrographic investigations, and strongly recommend combining ASTER and Sentinel 2 results in further investigations. Based on the outputs of the current research, we expect better hydrothermal alteration delineation by adopting the current findings as they sharply narrow the zones to be further investigated via costly geophysical and geochemical methods in mineral exploration projects.

TI  - How Does Religion Deter Adolescent Risk Behavior?
T2  - CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a theoretical model that describes four explanations (mechanisms) why religious adolescents display less risk behavior than nonreligious adolescents. Specifically, religions affect the extent to which adolescents (a) have opportunities to engage in risk behavior, (b) find risk behavior appealing, (c) view risk behavior as morally acceptable, and (d) exert self-control over their impulses. These mechanisms are not unique to religions. However, our model identifies three features of religion that can nurture them. First, religions offer a worldview that can affect whether adolescents regard risk behavior as appealing and morally acceptable and can influence self-control. Second, central to most religions is a God that monitors and judges behavior, which can influence self-control and beliefs about what is appealing and morally acceptable. Third, religions provide a community of people who can limit opportunity to engage in risk behavior, influence the appeal and moral acceptability of risk behavior, and can foster self-control by providing support.

TI  - The Application of Mixed Reality to Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo explore the value of mixed reality (MR) in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer.MethodsA total of 300 patients with breast cancer who underwent SLNB enrolled and were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, only dye (an injection of methylene blue) was used to detect sentinel lymph nodes, while in group B MR was used for positioning in addition to dye. (MR localization method: Before the surgery, we built a 1:1 3D reconstruction model based on the patient's CT or MRI original data, and after the patient was injected with dye, we completed MR localization by overlapping the pre-marked image with the model.)ResultsDuring surgery, the detection time in group B was significantly shorter than in group A (3.62 +/- 1.20 vs.7.87 +/- 1.86; p < 0.001). At 1-month post-surgery follow-up, the incidence of pain in group B was lower than that in group A (2.70 vs. 8.28%, p = 0.036). The incidence of upper limb dysfunction was lower in group B than in group A (2.03 vs. 8.97%, p = 0.009). In terms of the incidence of pain, group B was better than group A (0.68 vs. 3.45%, p = 0.094). The satisfaction of the two groups was scored, and the results showed that group B was better than group A (4.04 +/- 0.91 vs.3.32 +/- 0.94, p < 0.001).ConclusionThe application of MR to SLNB in breast cancer can significantly reduce the detection time and the occurrence of complications and improve patient satisfaction.

TI  - Inter-Continental Transfer of Pre-Trained Deep Learning Rice Mapping Model and Its Generalization Ability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of rice planting areas plays an important role in maintaining food security. With powerful automatic feature extraction capability, crop mapping based on deep learning methods has become one of the most important research directions of crop remote sensing recognition. However, the training of deep learning models often requires a large number of samples, which restricts the application of these models in areas with a lack of samples. To address this problem, based on time-series Sentinel-1 SAR data, this study pre-trained the temporal feature-based segmentation (TFBS) model with an attention mechanism (attTFBS) using abundant samples from the United States and then performed an inter-continental transfer of the pre-trained model based on a very small number of samples to obtain rice maps in areas with a lack of samples. The results showed that an inter-continental transferred rice mapping model was feasible to achieve accurate rice maps in Northeast China (F-score, kappa coefficient, recall, and precision were 0.8502, 0.8439, 0.8345, and 0.8669, respectively). The study found that the transferred model exhibited a strong spatiotemporal generalization capability, achieving high accuracy in rice mapping in the three main rice-producing regions of Northeast China. The phenological differences of rice significantly affected the generalization capability of the transferred model, particularly the significant differences in transplanting periods, which could have resulted in a decrease in the generalization capability of the model. Furthermore, the study found that the model transferred based on an extremely limited number of samples could attain a rice recognition accuracy equivalent to that of the model trained from scratch with a substantial number of samples, indicating that the proposed method possessed strong practicality, which could dramatically reduce the sample requirements for crop mapping based on deep learning models, thereby decreasing costs, increasing efficiency, and facilitating large-scale crop mapping in areas with limited samples.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the association of mixed exposure to greenness and nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and hypertension among the older adults aged 65 years and over in China. Methods: The study subjects were from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey from 2017 to 2018. A total of 15 423 older adults aged 65 years and over meeting the criteria were finally included in the study. A questionnaire survey was used to collect information on demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits and self-reported prevalence of hypertension. Blood pressure values were obtained through physical examination. The level of normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) was measured by the Medium-resolution Imaging Spectral Radiator(MODIS) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA). The concentration of NO2 was from China's surface air pollutant data set. Meteorological data was from NASA MERRA-2. The exposure to NDVI and NO2 for each study subject was calculated based on the area within a 1 km radius around their residence. The association between mixed exposure of NDVI and NO2 as well as their interaction and hypertension in older adults was analyzed by using the multivariate logistic regression model. The restrictive cubic spline(RCS) function was used to explore the exposure-response relationship between greenness and NO2 and the risk of hypertension in study subjects. Results: The mean age of 15 423 older adults were (85.6±11.6). Women accounted for 56.3%(8 685/15 423) and 55.6%(8 578/15 423) lived in urban areas. The mean time of residence was (60.9±28.5) years. 59.8% of participants were with hypertension. The mean NDVI level was 0.41±0.13, and the mean NO2 concentration was (32.18±10.36) mug/cm3. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NDVI was inversely and linearly associated with the hypertension in older adults, with the OR(95%CI) value of 0.959(0.928-0.992). Compared with the T1 group of NDVI, the risk of hypertension was lower in the T3 group, with the OR(95%CI) value of 0.852(0.769-0.944), and the trend test was statistically significant(P<0.05). Compared with the T1 group of NO2, the risk of hypertension was higher in the T2 and T3 groups, with OR(95%CI) values of 1.160(1.055-1.275) and 1.244(1.111-1.393), and the trend test was statistically significant (P<0.05). The result of the RCS showed that NDVI was inversely and linearly associated with hypertension in older adults. NO2 was nonlinearly associated with hypertension in older adults. The interaction analysis showed that NDVI and NO2 had a negative multiplicative interaction on the risk of hypertension, with OR(95%CI) value of 0.995(0.992-0.997). Conclusion: Exposure to greenness and NO2 are associated with hypertension in older adults.
AB  - 目的： 探讨绿地空间和NO2暴露与中国老年人高血压的关联。 方法： 研究对象来自20172018年中国健康影响因素跟踪调查，最终纳入15 423名符合标准≥65岁老年人为研究对象。采用问卷调查收集人口学特征、生活习惯、自我报告高血压患病情况等信息，通过体格检查获取血压值等资料。归一化差异植被指数（NDVI）来源于美国宇航局的中分辨率成像光谱仪（MODIS）测量结果。NO2浓度来源于中国地面空气污染物数据集。气象数据来自美国宇航局MERRA-2。每个研究对象的NDVI、NO2的暴露量基于其居住地点周围1 000 m半径内的面积进行计算。通过多因素logistic回归模型分析NDVI、NO2混合暴露及其交互作用与老年人高血压患病的关联。采用限制性立方样条（RCS）函数分别探索绿地、NO2与中国老年人高血压患病风险的暴露-反应关系。 结果： 15 423名老年人年龄为（85.6±11.6）岁；女性占56.3%（8 685/15 423）；居住在城镇占55.6%（8 578/15 423）；居住时间为（60.9±28.5）年；高血压者占59.8%（9 225/15 423）；NDVI为0.41±0.13；NO2浓度为（32.18±10.36）mug/m3。多因素logistic回归模型分析结果显示，NDVI与老年人高血压患病风险呈负向线性关联，OR（95%CI）值为0.959（0.928~0.992）；与NDVI的T1组相比，T3组罹患高血压的风险较低，OR（95%CI）值为0.852（0.769~0.944），趋势检验具有统计学意义（P<0.05）；与NO2的T1组相比，T2组、T3组罹患高血压的风险较高，OR（95%CI）值分别为1.160（1.055~1.275）、1.244（1.111~1.393），趋势检验具有统计学意义（P<0.05）。RCS的分析结果显示，NDVI与老年人高血压患病风险呈负向线性关联；NO2与老年人高血压患病风险呈非线性关联。交互作用分析结果显示，NDVI与NO2对高血压患病风险具有负相乘交互作用［OR（95%CI）：0.995（0.992~0.997）］。 结论： 绿地空间、NO2暴露与老年人高血压患病均存在关联。.

TI  - East Asia dust storms in spring 2021: Transport mechanisms and impacts on China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In spring 2021, several strong dust export processes crossed over East Asia, including the combined transport of Mongolia Gobi and Inner Mongolia dust. Based on CAMS forecast systems and satellite sensors, we analyzed the transport mechanisms and impact on China. Our case studies illustrate that in all 4 dust storms, the initial phase of transport was strongly confined by a low-level Mongolian cyclone facilitated by a deep cold-core upper trough. Using a methodology based on MODIS Deep Blue AOD data enables us to estimate the dust optical depth (DOD) and the impact of dust plumes on different areas in China. The result shows that North China was the most affected area in all cases, second only to the source region, with a mean observed DOD >0.8 and depolarization ratio > 0.2. The vertical distribution of the aerosol frequency of occurrence (FoO) was yielded using the CALIOP aerosol classification result. Dust storms were the dominant factor within 6 km (peaked at 2-3 km), while a significant amount of transported smoke aerosols dominated the upper troposphere. Even in dust storms, anthropogenic aerosols still occupied a high proportion of China's atmosphere, especially in South China, indicating the great contribution of human activities. As a subdominant aerosol type, polluted dust showed a profile similar to that of polluted continental aerosols, with peak heights generally lower than that of pure dust, at approximately 1-2 km. The development of cyclone/anticyclone activities was mostly modulated by the at-mospheric dynamic background. By discussing the climatic index related to dust storm occurrence in East Asia, we found that the high-frequency years in the 21st century have a satisfactory correspondence with the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the positive phase of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). These findings may have positive significance for dust forecasting in East Asia in the future.

TI  - Analysis of Multi-Temporal Shoreline Changes Due to a Harbor Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landforms are continuously shaped by natural and human-induced forces, exacerbating the associated coastal hazards and risks. Changes in the shoreline are a critical concern for sustainable coastal zone management. However, a limited amount of research has been carried out on the coastal belt of Sri Lanka. Thus, this study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution of the shoreline dynamics on the Oluvil coastline in the Ampara district in Sri Lanka for a two-decade period from 1991 to 2021, where the economically significant Oluvil Harbor exists by utilizing remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Shorelines for each year were delineated using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager images. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was applied as a spectral value index approach to differentiate land masses from water bodies. Subsequently, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool was used to assess shoreline changes, including Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). The results reveal that the Oluvil coast has undergone both accretion and erosion over the years, primarily due to harbor construction. The highest SCE values were calculated within the Oluvil harbor region, reaching 523.8 m. The highest NSM ranges were recorded as -317.1 to -81.3 m in the Oluvil area and 156.3-317.5 m in the harbor and its closest point in the southern direction. The maximum rate of EPR was observed to range from 3 m/year to 10.7 m/year towards the south of the harbor, and from -10.7 m/year to -3.0 m/year towards the north of the harbor. The results of the LRR analysis revealed that the rates of erosion anomaly range from -3 m/year to -10 m/year towards the north of the harbor, while the beach advances at a rate of 3 m/year to 14.3 m/year towards the south of the harbor. The study area has undergone erosion of 40 ha and accretion of 84.44 ha. These findings can serve as valuable input data for sustainable coastal zone management along the Oluvil coast in Sri Lanka, safeguarding the coastal habitats by mitigating further anthropogenic vulnerabilities.

TI  - Delineation of Orchard, Vineyard, and Olive Trees Based on Phenology Metrics Derived from Time Series of Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to propose an accurate and cost-effective analytical approach for the delineation of fruit trees in orchards, vineyards, and olive groves in Southern France, considering two locations. A classification based on phenology metrics (PM) derived from the Sentinel-2 time series was developed to perform the classification. The PM were computed by fitting a double logistic model on temporal profiles of vegetation indices to delineate orchard and vineyard classes. The generated PM were introduced into a random forest (RF) algorithm for classification. The method was tested on different vegetation indices, with the best results obtained with the leaf area index. To delineate the olive class, the temporal features of the green chlorophyll vegetation index were found to be the most appropriate. Obtained overall accuracies ranged from 89-96% and a Kappa of 0.86-0.95 (2016-2021), respectively. These accuracies are much better than applying the RF algorithm to the LAI time series, which led to a Kappa ranging between 0.3 and 0.52 and demonstrates the interest in using phenological traits rather than the raw time series of the remote sensing data. The method can be well reproduced from one year to another. This is an interesting feature to reduce the burden of collecting ground-truth information. If the method is generic, it needs to be calibrated in given areas as soon as a phenology shift is expected.

TI  - High-Resolution Precipitation Modeling in Complex Terrains Using Hybrid Interpolation Techniques: Incorporating Physiographic and MODIS Cloud Cover Influences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The inclusion of physiographic and atmospheric influences is critical for spatial modeling of orographic precipitation in complex terrains. However, attempts to incorporate cloud cover frequency (CCF) data when interpolating precipitation are limited. CCF considers the rain shadow effect during interpolation to avoid an overly strong relationship between elevation and precipitation in areas at equivalent altitudes across rain shadows. Conventional multivariate regression or geostatistical methods assume the precipitation-explanatory variable relationship to be steady, even though this relation is often non-stationarity in complex terrains. This study proposed a novel spatial mapping approach for precipitation that combines regression-kriging (RK) to leverage its advantages over conventional multivariate regression and the spatial autocorrelation structure of residuals via kriging. The proposed hybrid model, RK (GT + CCF), utilized CCF and other physiographic factors to enhance the accuracy of precipitation interpolation. The implementation of this approach was examined in a mountainous region of southern Syria using in situ monthly precipitation data from 57 rain gauges. The RK model's performance was compared with conventional multivariate regression models (CMRMs) that used geographical and topographical (GT) factors and CCF as predictors. The results indicated that the RK model outperformed the CMRMs with a root mean square error of <8 mm, a mean absolute percentage error range of 5-15%, and an R-2 range of 0.75-0.96. The findings of this study showed that the incorporation of MODIS-CCF with physiographic variables as covariates significantly improved the interpolation accuracy by 5-20%, with the largest improvement in modeling precipitation in March.

TI  - SNOWED: Automatically Constructed Dataset of Satellite Imagery for Water Edge Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the shoreline over time is essential to quickly identify and mitigate environmental issues such as coastal erosion. Monitoring using satellite images has two great advantages, i.e., global coverage and frequent measurement updates; but adequate methods are needed to extract shoreline information from such images. To this purpose, there are valuable non-supervised methods, but more recent research has concentrated on deep learning because of its greater potential in terms of generality, flexibility, and measurement accuracy, which, in contrast, derive from the information contained in large datasets of labeled samples. The first problem to solve, therefore, lies in obtaining large datasets suitable for this specific measurement problem, and this is a difficult task, typically requiring human analysis of a large number of images. In this article, we propose a technique to automatically create a dataset of labeled satellite images suitable for training machine learning models for shoreline detection. The method is based on the integration of data from satellite photos and data from certified, publicly accessible shoreline data. It involves several automatic processing steps, aimed at building the best possible dataset, with images including both sea and land regions, and correct labeling also in the presence of complicated water edges (which can be open or closed curves). The use of independently certified measurements for labeling the satellite images avoids the great work required to manually annotate them by visual inspection, as is done in other works in the literature. This is especially true when convoluted shorelines are considered. In addition, possible errors due to the subjective interpretation of satellite images are also eliminated. The method is developed and used specifically to build a new dataset of Sentinel-2 images, denoted SNOWED; but is applicable to different satellite images with trivial modifications. The accuracy of labels in SNOWED is directly determined by the uncertainty of the shoreline data used, which leads to sub-pixel errors in most cases. Furthermore, the quality of the SNOWED dataset is assessed through the visual comparison of a random sample of images and their corresponding labels, and its functionality is shown by training a neural model for sea-land segmentation.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tall cell variant of invasive papillary breast carcinoma is exceedingly rare, with only 30 cases reported in the literature. This report describes a case of a 47-year-old woman who presented to the clinic with bilateral breast masses on a screening mammogram. The patient was lost to follow-up, but she presented again after 4 years when the right breast mass significantly grew in size over several months. Mammography showed a 1.9 cm right breast mass and a 2.3 cm left breast mass. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy revealed right breast triple negative invasive carcinoma of the tall cell papillary variant and left breast fibroadenomatoid nodules. She underwent bilateral lumpectomies with a right sentinel lymph node biopsy and was started on chemotherapy after surgical excision.

TI  - Ore- and P′osa-Type Conditions for Partitioning 2-Edge-Coloured Graphs into Monochromatic Cycles
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, Letzter confirmed a conjecture of Balogh, Bar ' at, Gerbner, Gy ' arf ' as, and S ' arko center dot zy, proving that every large 2-edge-coloured graph G on n vertices with minimum degree at least 3n/4 can be partitioned into two monochromatic cycles of different colours. Here, we propose a weaker condition on the degree sequence of G to also guarantee such a partition and prove an approximate version. This resembles a similar generalisation to an Ore-type condition achieved by Bar ' at and S ' arko center dot zy.Continuing work by Allen, Bo center dot ttcher, Lang, Skokan, and Stein, we also show that if deg(u) + deg(v) 4n/3 + o(n) holds for all non-adjacent vertices u, v is an element of V (G), then all but o(n) vertices can be partitioned into three monochromatic cycles.

TI  - Impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on water quality along the coast of Morocco
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the marine activities and all the anthropogenic activities along the coast have been shut off for several months. The total suspended matter (TSM) was analyzed before and during COVID-19 lockdown in the coast of Morocco. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess all the changes reflected through the coast in April of 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In the absence of the ground observations during this period, the remote sensing data was used in this study. The results showed a gradual reduction in TSM concentration, indicating a positive improvement during the lockdown period. The TSM concentrations during this period decreased by 40.59% on average compared with the pre-lock-down period. Further, the turbidity in the water has reduced at each stretch of the rivers. Remote sensing is a powerful tools for analyzing turbidity over the whole littoral areas, even in the absence of field observations. The ongoing pandemic shows that an ocean with cleaner water is possible. These findings provide a general reference on the state of the Moroccan coast that could contribute to improve policy and future monitoring program.

This study employed an improved two-layer network Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technology to obtain high-precision land subsidence in Singapore from 2015 to 2019. Landsat images from 1973 to 2020 were also utilized to extract changes in Singapore's coastline. Geological, topographical, and global sea level rise data were integrated to investigate the causes and impacts of land subsidence in Singapore. The results indicate that the areas with severe subsidence coincide with land reclamation areas, where subsidence is mainly due to soil consolidation. Based on WorldDEM, land subsidence, and sea level rise data, the maximum inundation depth in Singapore by 2050 is estimated to be 1.24 m, with the Marina Bay area in Singapore's central business district being the most vulnerable to sea level rise. This study provides data support and a scientific basis for understanding the impact of land subsidence on Singapore's coastal areas under the influence of multiple factors using advanced InSAR technology.

TI  - Assessing complex aeolian dune field morphology and evolution with Sentinel-1 SAR imagery-Possibilities and limitations
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian dune movement poses a threat to critical infrastructure, urban areas, water resources as well as agriculture. This threat is expected to increase in the coming years due to land degradation, desertification and climate change. Several approaches have been used to investigate the evolution of dune fields. Satellite remote sensing can be considered one of the most accurate tools for the continuous monitoring of global sand covered surfaces. Although early studies found a great potential in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for dune assessment, the full potential has not been explored as of yet. Therefore, in this study, we present a novel method for assessing complex dune field morphology based on the easily accessible and globally available Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) SAR dataset. In this application, dune features are extracted based on backscatter properties related to the local incidence angle. This provides a clear identification of (1) active dune sand, (2) dune ridges and (3) inter-dune ripples. By extracting these features through profiles, the multi-timescale evolution of the Western Mongolian dune field Bor Khyar was analysed through three areas of interest (AOIs) based on the spectral technique of continuous wavelets. The result of this investigation gives new insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of dunes scale and their response to aeolian activity, revealing differences in aeolian activity as well as inter- and intra-annual variations in the dune morphology. These results are promising and highlight the potential in using satellite SAR imagery for dune monitoring.

TI  - COVID-19 and Breast Cancer: Analysis of Surgical Management of a Large Referral Center during the 2020-2021 Pandemic Period
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since December 2019 and was officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. Due to the rapid transmission and the high fatality rate, drastic emergency restrictions were issued, with a negative impact on routine clinical activities. In particular, in Italy, many authors have reported a reduction in the number of breast cancer diagnoses and critical problems in the management of patients who accessed the breast units during the dramatic first months of the pandemic. Our study aims to analyze the global impact of COVID-19 in the two years of the pandemic (2020-2021) on the surgical management of breast cancer by comparing them with the previous two years. Methods: In our retrospective study, we analyzed all cases of breast cancer diagnosed and surgically treated at the breast unit of "Citta della Salute e della Scienza" in Turin, Italy, making a comparison between the 2018-2019 pre-pandemic period and the 2020-2021 pandemic period. Results: We included in our analysis 1331 breast cancer cases surgically treated from January 2018 to December 2021. A total of 726 patients were treated in the pre-pandemic years and 605 in the pandemic period (-121 cases, 9%). No significant differences were observed regarding diagnosis (screening vs. no screening) and timing between radiological diagnosis and surgery for both in situ and invasive tumors. There were no variations in the breast surgical approach (mastectomy vs. conservative surgery), while a reduction in axillary dissection compared to the sentinel lymph node in the pandemic period was observed (p-value < 0.001). Regarding the biological characteristics of breast cancers, we observed a greater number of grades 2-3 (p-value = 0.007), pT stage 3-4 breast cancer surgically treated without previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p-value = 0.03), and a reduction in luminal B tumors (p-value = 0.007). Conclusions: Overall, we report a limited reduction in surgical activity for breast cancer treatment considering the entire pandemic period (2020-2021). These results suggest a prompt resumption of surgical activity similar to the pre-pandemic period.

TI  - Snow Cover Temporal Dynamic Using MODIS Product, and Its Relationship with Precipitation and Temperature in the Tropical Andean Glaciers in the Alto Santa Sub-Basin (Peru)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The retreats of the planet's tropical glaciers are natural indicators of the variation of precipitation, temperature, and other variables. The glaciers of the Alto Santa sub-basin are sources of freshwater storage for consumptive and non-consumptive use for different sectors. As a result of climatic variations, it is essential to analyze the dynamics of the snow cover area (SCA). The methodology consisted of processing 6578 MODIS Snow Cover MOD10A1 product images and generating 18-year time series using the Platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) was used to estimate the extent of snow cover, and to validate the MODIS snow cover product, we used the same overlapping date of Landsat 5 and 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1, to examine the relationships between daily precipitation and temperature. The standardized correlation results gave good results with stations over 4500 m.a.s.l., such as Artesonraju AP2 (4828 m.a.s.l.) of -0.84 and -0.74, precipitation, and temperature. These results show coherent behaviors of the retreat due to the variation of the climatological variables. In some years, there were anomalies in the conduct of the three variables, but these originated from events of natural weather phenomena. Regarding the dynamics of the SCA in 18 years, it decreased from 649 km(2) to 311.6. km(2) between 2000 and 2017, representing a retreat of 41%; we can conclude and confirm that the glacier retreat is imminent due to the consequences of climate change, which would affect the security of freshwater from the tropical glaciers of the Peruvian Andes.

TI  - A scenario modelling approach to assess management impacts on soil erosion in coffee systems in Central America
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the major causes of soil degradation worldwide, because it causes the depletion of soil organic carbon, nutrients, and water holding capacity. In Central America, coffee production is vulnerable to soil erosion since it often occupies steep slopes with high annual precipitation. To assess management options to control erosion, soil and vegetation field data were collected from 90 Costa Rican and 96 Guatemalan coffee plantations, mainly shaded, distributed in six coffee production areas. Soil erosion was modelled using the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation), integrating soil and vegetation cover field data, with remote sensing data. Management scenarios were developed to assess the role of two principal coffee management strategies in mitigating soil erosion: increasing vegetation cover, and soil conservation practices. Average estimated erosion rates of 17 and 7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) were predicted for plantations of Costa Rica and Guatemala, respectively, with erosion from coffee plantations representing between 23% and 40% of the estimated erosion of the watershed within which they were situated. If all plantations achieved vegetation cover equivalent to the best 25% of plantations, the estimated erosion would be reduced by 7% in Costa Rica and 8% in Guatemala. If all plantations implemented soil conservation practices, estimated erosion would be reduced by 11% in Costa Rica and 35% in Guatemala. With the two combined management strategies a reduction of estimated erosion of 17% and 40% was predicted in Costa Rica and Guatemala, respectively. The reduction in erosion from soil conservation or better vegetative cover varied among regions within countries depending on current management, local climate, and topography. These results show the importance of coffee system and soil management practices in moderating erosion from highland coffee production, and how RUSLE analyses can identify priority practices in different regions supporting more effective policies to reduce soil erosion.

TI  - Oil palm plantations in an aging agricultural landscape in the eastern Amazon: Pushing Amazon forests farther from biodiversity-friendly landscapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations across the tropics are intended to promote sustainable production by incorporating degraded lands while sparing old-growth forests. Here, we examine the trajectory of an Amazonian-forest focal landscape as it experiences the expansion of oil palm and its interactions with multiple land-uses. Land-use composition, landscape spatial configuration and structure in a 765.65-km2 watershed were examined over a 16 -yr period (2002-2018) via Landsat imagery. Briefly, (1) old-growth forest coverage dropped from 37.3 % to 18.3 % across the whole landscape, (2) secondary forest and arable fields expanded until 2014, and (3) oil palm plantations emerged in 2010 with a positive trend thereafter, resulting in an 11.9 % expansion until 2018. In 2018, only 140.7 km2 of old-growth forest persisted, while oil palm plantations covered 91.8 km2. Oil palm expansion resulted from 14 land-use trajectories, with changes involving old-growth forests accounting for half the area (48.1 %) covered by plantations in 2018. However, only 0.4 % of the plantation area resulted from a direct conversion of old-growth forests. Landscape structure became increasingly degraded, which included the elimination of gallery forests, the proliferation of edge-affected habitats and the collapse of forest structural connectivity. Our results suggest that the eastern Amazon is still experiencing forest loss and exhibit highly dynamic land-use changes. Furthermore, landscapes continue to suffer degradation of key attributes related to biodiversity persistence and the provision of ecosystem services. Oil palm plantations have a catalytic effect on land-use dynamics, speeding up forest shrinking and landscape degradation. The oil palm sector requires a better governance based on guidelines able to guarantee either the persistence or the emergence of biodiversity-friendly landscapes.

TI  - Multivariate Calibration of the SWAT Model Using Remotely Sensed Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed hydrologic variables, in conjunction with streamflow data, have been increasingly used to conduct multivariable calibration of hydrologic model parameters. Here, we calibrated the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model using different combinations of streamflow and remotely sensed hydrologic variables, including Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) Evapotranspiration (ET), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET, and Soil MERGE (SMERGE) soil moisture. The results show that adding remotely sensed ET and soil moisture to the traditionally used streamflow for model calibration can impact the number and values of parameters sensitive to hydrologic modeling, but it does not necessarily improve the model performance. However, using remotely sensed ET or soil moisture data alone led to deterioration in model performance as compared with using streamflow only. In addition, we observed large discrepancies between ALEXI or MODIS ET data and the choice between these two datasets for model calibration can have significant implications for the performance of the SWAT model. The use of different combinations of streamflow, ET, and soil moisture data also resulted in noticeable differences in simulated hydrologic processes, such as runoff, percolation, and groundwater discharge. Finally, we compared the performance of SWAT and the SWAT-Carbon (SWAT-C) model under different multivariate calibration setups, and these two models exhibited pronounced differences in their performance in the validation period. Based on these results, we recommend (1) the assessment of various remotely sensed data (when multiple options available) for model calibration before choosing them for complementing the traditionally used streamflow data and (2) that different model structures be considered in the model calibration process to support robust hydrologic modeling.

TI  - Application of MaxEnt Model in Biomass Estimation: An Example of Spruce Forest in the Tianshan Mountains of the Central-Western Part of Xinjiang, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating the above-ground biomass (AGB) of spruce forests and analyzing their spatial patterns are critical for quantifying forest carbon stocks and assessing regional climate conditions in China's drylands, with significant implications for the sustainable management and conservation of forest ecosystems in the Tianshan Mountains. The K-Means clustering algorithm was used to divide 144 measured AGB samples into four AGB classes, combined with remote sensing data from Landsat products, 19 bioclimatic variables, 3 topographical variables, and 3 soil variables to generate probability distributions of four AGB classes using the MaxEnt model. Finally, the spatial distribution of AGB was mapped using the mathematical formulae available in the GIS software. Results indicate that (1) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of the AGB models for all classes exceeded 0.8, indicating satisfactory model accuracy; (2) the dominant factors affecting the distribution of different AGB classes varied. The primary dominant factors for the first-fourth AGB classes model were altitude (20.4%), precipitation of warmest quarter (Bio18, 15.7%), annual mean temperature (Bio1, 50.5%), and red band (Band4, 26.7%), respectively, and the response curves indicated that the third AGB model was more tolerant of elevation than the first and second AGB classes; (3) the AGB has a spatial distribution pattern of being higher in the west and low in the east, with a "single-peaked" pattern in terms of latitude, and the average AGB of pixels was 680.92 t.hm(-2); (4) the correlation coefficient between measured and predicted AGB is 0.613 (p < 0.05), with the average uncertainty of AGB estimation at 39.32%. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial patterns and drivers of AGB in spruce forests in the Tianshan Mountains, which can inform effective forest management and conservation strategies.

TI  - Inversion and Validation of FY-4A Official Land Surface Temperature Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared data of Fengyun 4A (FY-4A) geostationary meteorological satellite can be used to retrieve hourly land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, seven candidate algorithms are compared and evaluated. The Ulivieri (1985) algorithm is determined to be optimal for the algorithm of FY-4A LST official products. The refined algorithm coefficients for distinguishing dry and moist atmosphere were established for daytime and nighttime, respectively. Then, FY-4A LST official products under clear-sky conditions are produced. The validation results show that: (1) Compared with in-situ measured LST data at the HeBi crop measurement network, the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 2.139 and 2.447 K. Compared with in-situ measured LST data at Naqu alpine meadow site of Tibet plateau, the RMSE was 2.86 K. (2) When compared with the MODIS LST product, the RMSE was 1.64, 2.17, 2.6, and 1.73 K in March, July, October, and December, respectively. By the bias long-time change at a single site, RMSE of the XLHT (city) and GZH (desert) sites were 2.735 and 2.97 K, respectively. Overall, the preferred algorithm exhibits good accuracy and meets the required accuracy of the FY-4A mission.

TI  - Mapping Phenology of Complicated Wetland Landscapes through Harmonizing Landsat and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important CO2 sinks and methane sources, and their seasonality and phenological cycle play an essential role in understanding the carbon budget. However, given the spatial heterogeneity of wetland landscapes and the coarser spatial resolution of satellites, the phenological retrievals of wetlands are challenging. Here we examined the phenology of wetlands from 30 m harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (LandSent30) and 500 m MODIS satellite observations using the ground phenology network PhenoCam as a benchmark. This study used all 11 available wetland PhenoCam sites (about 30 site years), covering diverse wetland types from different climate zones. We found that the LandSent30-based phenology results were in overall higher consistency with the PhenoCam results compared to MODIS, which could be related to the better explanation capacity of LandSent30 data in the heterogeneous landscapes of wetlands. This also means that the LandSent30 has an advantage over the 500 m MODIS regarding wetland vegetation phenological retrievals. It should be noted that the LandSent30 did not show a greatly improved performance, which could be related to the specificity and complexity of the wetlands landscape. We also illustrated the potential effects of the location and observation direction of PhenoCam cameras, the selection of Region of Interest (ROI), as well as the landscape composition of the site. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of wetland phenology from both ground and remote sensing observations at different scales, which paves the road for understanding the role of wetlands in global climate change and provides a basis for understanding the real phenological changes of wetland surfaces.

TI  - Clinical application of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging navigation for pediatric renal cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIndocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been widely used in the surgical treatment of adult renal cancers, but its application in pediatric renal cancers has rarely been reported. This study aims to summarize the experience of ICG fluorescence imaging in pediatric renal cancers and explores its safety and feasibility.MethodsThe clinical features, surgical information, ICG administration regimen, near infrared radiography data in vivo and ex vivo and pathological results of children with renal cancers using ICG navigation were analyzed and summarized.ResultsThere were 7 cases of renal cancer, including 4 cases of Wilms tumor (WT), 1 case of malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (MRTK) and 2 cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). By intraoperative intravenous injection of ICG from 2.5 to 5 mg (0.05-0.67 mg/kg), the tumors were visualized in 6 cases in vivo or ex vivo, and the tumor visualization failed in 1 case due to renal artery embolization before operation. By injecting 5 mg ICG into the normal renal tissue during the operation, 3 patients achieved fluorescent localization of sentinel lymph nodes. No ICG-related adverse reactions were found in any of the patients during or after operation.ConclusionsICG fluorescence imaging is safe and feasible for renal cancers in children. Intraoperative administration can achieve tumor and sentinel lymph node visualization which will facilitate the development of nephron sparing surgery (NSS). However, the technique is affected by ICG dose, anatomical conditions around the tumor, and renal blood flow. A proper dose of ICG and the complete removal of perirenal fat are helpful for the fluorescence imaging of the tumor. It has potential in the operation of renal cancer in children.

TI  - Factors Associated With Upstaging of Melanoma Thickness on Final Excision
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The incidence and risk factors associated with upstaging from initial biopsy to definitive excision in cutaneous melanoma have not been established. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of tumor stage upstaging and associated risk factors using the National Cancer Database.Methods: A retrospective study of the National Cancer Database between 2012 and 2016 was performed. The cohort of patients undergoing excision of melanoma with available data comprised 133,592 patients. Differences in characteristics for upstaging were determined using Wilcox rank-sum, chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression to determine factors associated with upstaging.Results: Incidence of upstaging was 5.2%. Upstaged patients were older, male, of non-White race, and of lower education level (P < 0.001). Lesions of the head/neck and lower extremity had increased incidence of upstaging compared to the trunk (P < 0.001). Nodular and acral lentiginous melanoma was associated with higher incidence of upstaging compared to superficial spreading melanoma (P < 0.001). Patients with lymphovascular invasion had increased risk of upstaging (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Upstaging of melanoma is infrequent but is significantly more prevalent in non-White patients and those with lower educational status. Provider and patient edu-cation should include the higher risk of upstaging in these groups and the possible need for further surgical intervention, such as re-excision of margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Improved estimates of abortion rates in tsetse (<i>Glossina</i> spp.)
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Abortion rates were assessed among 170, 846 tsetse (154,228 Glossina pallidipes and 19,618 Glossina morsitans morsitans) sampled in Zimbabwe in 1988-1999. The study produced improved estimates of abortion rates and how these varied with fly age and size and temperatures experienced during pregnancy. An abortion was diagnosed if the uterus was empty and the largest oocyte G. pallidipes and G. m. morsitans were 0.64% (95% ci: 0.59-0.69) and 0.83% (0.62-1.10) for trapped flies and 2.03% (1.77-2.31) and 1.55% (1.20-1.98) for flies from artificial refuges. Abortion rates increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increasing wing length and wing fray. Contrary to laboratory findings, abortion rates did not increase in the oldest flies. Percentages of tsetse with empty uteri, regardless of abortion status, were significantly higher than estimated abortion percentages. For tsetse from traps, 4.01% (95% ci: 3.90-4.13) of G. pallidipes and 2.52% (2.14-2.95) of G. m. morsitans had empty uteri; for flies from artificial refuges, the percentages were 12.69% (12.07-13.34) and 14.90% (13.82-16.02), respectively. Abortion losses are small relative to losses at all other stages of life.

TI  - AST: Adaptive Self-supervised Transformer for optical remote sensing representation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the variation in spatial resolution and the diversity of object scales, the interpretation of optical remote sensing images is extremely challenging. Deep learning has become the mainstream solution to interpret such complex scenes. However, the explosion of deep learning model architectures has resulted in the need for hundreds of millions of remote sensing images for which labels are very costly or often unavailable publicly. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the main reasons for this data thirst, i.e., (i) limited representational power for model learning, and (ii) underutilization of unlabeled remote sensing data. To overcome the above difficulties, we present a scalable and adaptive self-supervised Transformer (AST) for optical remote sensing image interpretation. By performing masked image modeling in pre-training, the proposed AST releases the rich supervision signals in massive unlabeled remote sensing data and learns useful multi-scale semantics. Specifically, a cross-scale Transformer architecture is designed to collaboratively learn global dependencies and local details by introducing a pyramid structure, to facilitate multi-granular feature interactions and generate scale-invariant representations. Furthermore, a masking token strategy relying on correlation mapping is proposed to achieve adaptive masking of partial patches without affecting key structures, which enhances the understanding of visually important regions. Extensive experiments on various optical remote sensing interpretation tasks show that AST has good generalization capability and competitiveness.

TI  - Experimental Study on Ultrasonic Assisted Turning of GH4068 Superalloy
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - GH4068 superalloy is a new type of nickel-based superalloy in the aerospace field. It is an important alloy material for the manufacture of aircraft tubular components and aero-engine hot-end components. These components need to be machined with good surface quality to meet their use requirements. New hybrid machining processes can improve the quality of surface finish compared to conventional machines. In this paper, ultrasonic assisted turning (UAT) technology was applied to the machining of GH4068 superalloy. The experimental system of UAT was established. Experiments of UAT and conventional turning (CT) of GH4068 superalloy were carried out to study the effects of cutting speed, feed speed, cutting depth and vibration amplitude on cutting force and surface roughness. The surface morphology of the workpiece and chip were observed. The experimental results show that F-x and F-y can be reduced by a maximum of 44% and 63%, respectively, and the surface roughness can be reduced by a maximum of 31% after adding ultrasonic vibration. Compared with CT, the UAT has a better machining quality, a more obvious chip-breaking effect, and a smaller chip bending radius, which guides the high-quality processing of the GH4068 superalloy.

TI  - Petrogenesis of Gerf Neoproterozoic carbonatized peridotites (Egypt): Evidence of convergent margin metasomatism of depleted sub-arc mantle
T2  - LITHOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gerf Neoproterozoic ophiolitic rocks in the Southern Eastern Desert of Egypt represent the largest ophiolite nappe in the Arabian-Nubian Shield and have been preserved as part of the N-S striking Allaqi-Heiani suture zone. Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, ASTER and Sentinel-1B data successfully discriminate the Gerf ophiolitic section and the structural framework of the study area. This study has applied spectral transform approaches, consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), band ratio (BR) and minimum noise fraction (MNF) for lithological and structural mapping. NW-SE and N-S structural trends are dominant and control the distribution of talc-car-bonates and ophicarbonates. The mantle section comprises dominantly harzburgites with subordinate dunites and is rarely cut by dike-like bodies of clinopyroxenites; these peridotites have been partially to completely converted to serpentinites and related rocks. The primary Gerf peridotites are low in TiO2 (0.01 wt%), Al2O3 (0.50 wt%), and CaO (0.44 wt%) content on average, but are rich in Ni (up to 2758 ppm) and Cr (2906 ppm) relative to primitive mantle, suggesting their highly refractory residual nature after high degrees of partial melting, similar to forearc peridotites. This is confirmed by chemistry of their relic primary minerals, namely olivine (Fo: 91-93.7; NiO: 0.28-0.43 wt%), chromian spinel (Cr# 0.75 on average), orthopyroxene (Mg#: 0.92-0.93) and clinopyroxene (Mg#: 0.89-0.90). Gerf serpentinized peridotites also show ranges of oxygen fugacity (Delta log integral O2, FMQ + 0.2 - FMQ + 1.4) and equilibrium temperature (770-900 degrees C), consistent with those of forearc peridotites. Bulk-rock analyses of ultramafic rocks and in-situ analyses of their pyroxenes reveal enrichment of fluid mobile elements (FME: e.g., B, Cs, Pb, Sr) relative to high-field strength elements (e.g., Nb, Zr, Ti, Ta), indicating intense metasomatism of Gerf peridotites by slab-derived fluids. The Gerf peridotites have been subjected to intense CO2 input from the subducted slab to form carbonate-rich rocks beneath the arc-forearc region. Carbonates (mainly magnesite) replace serpentine minerals and their formation synchronizes with the transition from lizardite to antigorite at temperatures,-250 degrees to-350 degrees C. The CO2-rich fluids increase the Au content because of alteration and break down of Au-bearing sulphides, and this process formed Au mineralization in carbonate-rich rocks. The maximum amount of CO2 expulsion from the subducted slab increases with increasing mantle depth, and structural trends as ophicarbonates are abundant in thick parts of the ophiolite sequence in the Gerf area that was highly dissected by NW-SE, N-S and E-W striking faults. This confirms that structures control on distribution of the ophiocarbonate rocks in Gerf ophiolite. Calculated parental melts in equilibrium with Gerf peridotite spinels have boninitic affinities, suggesting their generation during the forearc stage, but parental melts of Gerf clinopyroxenite veins resemble N-MORB-like melts, indicating melt meta-somatism of sub-arc mantle by impregnated mafic melts during early subduction initiation. Clinopyroxenite veins resemble N-MORB-like melts, indicating melt metasomatism of sub-arc mantle by impregnated mafic melts during early subduction initiation. Clinopyroxenite veins crystallized from MOR-like melts as a result of interaction between these melts and depleted peridotites in the sub-arc mantle during asthenosphere upwelling or as small mantle plumes ascending through the slab window

TI  - Landscape fires disproportionally affect high conservation value temperate peatlands, meadows, and deciduous forests, but only under low moisture conditions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape fires are a natural component of the Earth System. However, they are of growing global concern due to cli-mate change exacerbating their multiple impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, carbon storage, human health, econo-mies, and wider society. Temperate regions are predicted to be at greatest risk of increasing fire activity due to climate change, where fires can seriously impact important ecosystems for biodiversity and carbon storage, such as peatlands and forests. There is insufficient literature on the background prevalence, distribution, and drivers of fires in these regions, especially within Europe, to assess and mitigate their risks. Using a global database of fire patches based on the MODIS FireCCI51 product, we address this knowledge gap by quantifying the current prevalence and size of fires in Polesia, a 150,000 km2 area comprising a mosaic of peatland, forest, and agricultural habitats in north-ern Ukraine and southern Belarus. Between 2001 and 2019, fires burned 31,062 km2 of land, and were most frequent in spring and autumn. Although most fires started in agricultural land, fires disproportionately affected natural and semi-natural land cover types, particularly in protected areas. Over one fifth of protected land burned. Coniferous for-ests were the most common land cover type in protected areas, but fires mostly occurred in meadows, open peatlands (especially fen and transition mires), and native deciduous forests. These land cover types were highly susceptible to fires under low soil moisture conditions, but the risk of fire was low under average or higher soil moisture conditions. Restoring and maintaining natural hydrological regimes could be an effective nature-based solution to increase the re-silience of fire-vulnerable ecosystems and support global biodiversity and carbon storage commitments under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change and Convention on Biological Diversity.

TI  - Using a semantic edge-aware multi-task neural network to delineate agricultural parcels from remote sensing images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a semantic edge-aware multi-task neural network (SEANet) to obtain closed boundaries when delineating agricultural parcels from remote sensing images. It derives closed boundaries from remote sensing images and improves conventional semantic segmentation methods for the extraction of small and irregular agricultural parcels. SEANet integrates three correlated tasks: mask prediction, edge prediction, and distance map estimation. Related features learned from these tasks improve the generalizability of the network. We regard boundary extraction as an edge detection task and extract rich semantic edge features at multiple levels to improve the geometric accuracy of parcel delineation. Moreover, we develop a new multi-task loss that considers the uncertainty of different tasks. We conducted experiments on three high-resolution Gaofen-2 images in Shandong, Xinjiang, and Sichuan provinces, China, and on two medium-resolution Sentinel-2 images from Denmark and the Netherlands. Results showed that our method produced a better layout of agricultural parcels, with higher attribute and geometric accuracy than the existing ResUNet, ResUNet-a, R2UNet, and BsiNet methods on the Shandong and Denmark datasets. The total extraction errors of the parcels produced by our method were 0.214, 0.127, 0.176, 0.211, and 0.184 for the five datasets, respectively. Our method also obtains closed boundaries by one single segmentation, leading to superiority as compared with existing multi-task networks. We showed that it could be applied to images with different spatial resolutions for parcel delineation. Finally, our method trained on the Xinjiang dataset could be successfully transferred to the Shandong dataset with different dates and landscapes. Similarly, we obtained satisfactory results when transferring from the Denmark dataset to the Netherlands dataset. We conclude that SEANet is an accurate, robust, and transferable method for various areas and different remote sensing images. The codes of our model are available at htt ps://github.com/long123524/SEANet_torch.

TI  - Multispectral versus texture features from ZiYuan-3 for recognizing on deciduous tree species with cloud and SVM models
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species recognition accuracy greatly affects forest remote sensing mapping and forestry resource monitoring. The multispectral and texture features of the remote sensing images from the ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite at two phenological phases of autumn and winter (September 29th and December 7th) were selected for constructing and optimizing sensitive spectral indices and texture indices. Multidimensional cloud model and support vector machine (SVM) model were constructed by the screened spectral and texture indices for remote sensing recognition of Quercus acutissima (Q. acutissima) and Robinia pseudoacacia (R. pseudoacacia) on Mount Tai. The results showed that, the correlation intensities of the constructed spectral indices with tree species were preferable in winter than in autumn. The spectral indices constructed by band 4 showed the superior correlation compared with other bands, both in the autumn and winter time phases. The optimal sensitive texture indices for both phases were mean, homogeneity and contrast for Q. acutissima, and contrast, dissimilarity and second moment for R. pseudoacacia. Spectral features were found to have a higher recognition accuracy than textural features for recognizing on both Q. acutissima and R. pseudoacacia, and winter showing superior recognition accuracy than autumn, especially for Q. acutissima. The recognition accuracy of the multidimensional cloud model (89.98%) does not show a superior advantage over the one-dimensional cloud model (90.57%). The highest recognition accuracy derived from a three-dimensional SVM was 84.86%, which was lower than the cloud model (89.98%) in the same dimension. This study is expected to provide technical support for the precise recognition and forestry management on Mount Tai.

TI  - A predictive model of velocity for local hydrokinetic power assessment based on remote sensing data
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrokinetic power is a small-scale, zero-head form of hydropower with the potential to address renewable energy needs for many communities, including those in the Arctic. An impediment to its wide deployment is the ability to screen suitable stream reaches for adequate power generation. Remote resource assessment of streams, particularly the estimation of mean velocity, is valuable for assessing the potential of new locations prior to field visits. Many studies have investigated remote sensing techniques for stream velocity prediction through machine learning and empirical relations, but most of these studies relied at least partly on in-situ data and were not suitable for small width streams. This study addresses these gaps with a Random Forest machine learning model that uses only remotely sensible data to estimate velocities of small and large streams at locations across Alaska. The developed model, validated by velocity gage readings, had a mean prediction error of 24%, at the lower end of error rates (20-30%) found for large channel widths. Novel geometric and temporal parameters were developed and found to importantly influence predictive accuracy (e.g. slope, stream meanders). Remotely sensible data enables future model expansion by those interested in assessing new sites for community energy planning.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution of Land Use Change and Eco-Environmental Effects in the Chang-Zhu-Tan Core Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past 20 years, the integration process of the Chang-Zhu-Tan region has been accelerating, and land use has undergone significant changes. Land use change is a fundamental factor causing changes in the quality of the ecological environment. It is crucial to analyze land use change in the context of rapid urbanization and its impact on the ecological environment to promote sustainable and high-quality regional development. This study takes the Chang-Zhu-Tan core area, which has the highest development and construction intensity, as the study area. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, the land use information is extracted using Landsat remote sensing image data and the random forest method. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is constructed to analyze the ecological and environmental effects of land use change based on the spatial and temporal changes of land use types and ecological and environmental quality in the Chang-Zhu-Tan core area from 2000 to 2020. The results show that the most critical land use change in the study area from 2000 to 2020 is mainly the sharp increase in construction land, accompanied by a continuous decrease in forest and cropland. During this period, the eco-environmental quality of the study area showed a declining trend, with significant differences in spatial distribution, generally showing a distribution pattern of suburban counties outperforming central urban areas. In addition, the distribution and changes in land use and ecological environment quality coincide spatially. Different land use types have different impacts on ecological environment quality, with the conversion of forest and cropland to construction land being the main reason for the deterioration of eco-environmental quality in the study area. This study provides a basis for the coordinated development of the ecological environment and social economy in the Chang-Zhu-Tan area.

TI  - Current Approaches to Salvage Surgery for Head and Neck Cancer: A Comprehensive Review
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Salvage surgeries of head and neck cancer are often complicated and do not always show decent results. This type of procedure is tough on the patient, as many crucial organs can be affected. A long period of reeducation usually follows the surgery because of the need to rehabilitate functions such as speech or swallowing. In order to lighten the journey of the patients, it is important to develop new technologies and techniques to ease the surgery and limit its damages. This seems even more crucial since progress has been made in the past years, allowing more salvage therapy to take place. This article aims at showing the available tools and procedures for salvage surgeries, such as transoral robotic surgery, free-flap surgery, sentinel node mapping, and many others, that help the work of the medical team to operate or obtain a better understanding of the status of the cancer when taken in charge. Yet, the surgical procedure is not the only thing determining the outcome of the operation. The patient themself and their cancer history also play an important part in the care and must be acknowledged.

TI  - An alternative view on size and impact history of Ramgarh Crater, India: Evidence from high-resolution remote sensing imagery and gravity data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ramgarh structure of south-east Rajasthan is currently established as an asteroid impact crater in India that was excavated in undeformed target sedimentary rocks of the Vindhyan Supergroup of Meso- to Neoproterozoic age. The size of this impact crater is debatable, and two opposing ideas of similar to 2.4 km and similar to 10 km diameter exist. The geomorphology of the crater has been re-evaluated using a Sentinel-2A false-coloured imagery of band combination 8, 4, 3 (spatial resolution 10 m) and Landsat-7 Satellite panchromatic imagery of Path/Row 146/042 and SRTM data (spatial resolution 30 m), along with satellite Bouguer gravity data downloaded from GGMplus besides our routine geological field work. Our observation on satellite imageries suggests that the geomorphologic high (similar to 200 m) encircling the Ramgarh structure represents the actual crater's rim which has a diameter of similar to 2.4 km. Our satellite gravity data show that the maximum negative Bouguer anomalies (-60 to -51 mGal) only coincide with this geomorphological high surrounding the Ramgarh structure, confirming this structural high of diameter similar to 2.4 km represents the rim of the crater.

TI  - Impact of growth of a medium-sized Indian coastal city on urban climate: A case study using data fusion and analytics
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, unlike mega cities, little is known about how the growth of small and medium-sized cities (SMSC) impacts urban climate. Further, such impacts are amplified in coastal settings. We use data fusion and analytics to study how the growth of Thiruvananthapuram, a typical medium-sized coastal city in India, modifies the urban climate. The datasets used are National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land products, NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and Indian Meteorological Department surface observations contained within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) global compilation of in-situ obser-vations. The study found a similar to 48% increase in urban and built-up land cover over the last two decades, causing an increase in albedo, surface roughness and a decrease in emissivity and moisture availability. Decreasing moisture availability most affected air temperature, with urban growth adding to large-scale climatic trends of increasing monthly mean daily maximum (+1 degrees C), minimum (+0.4 degrees C) and average temperatures (+0.22 degrees C). Sea-breeze circulation strengthened in response to increasing coastal urbanization and the inland propagation modified with increased convergence and (potentially) rainfall, near the coast.

TI  - Regulatory B cells producing IL-10 are increased in human tumor draining lymph nodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of different immune cell subsets, especially T cells, in anti-tumor immune response is well established. In contrast to T cells, the anti-tumor contribution of B cells has been scarcely investigated. B-cells are often overlooked, even though they are important players in a fully integrated immune response and constitute a substantial fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) known also as Sentinel Nodes. In this project, samples including TDLNs, non-TDLNs (nTDLNs) and metastatic lymph nodes from 21 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed by flow cytometry. TDLNs were characterized by a significantly higher proportion of B cells compared with nTDLNs (P = .0127). TDLNs-associated B cells contained high percentages of naive B cells, in contrary to nTDLNs which contained significantly higher percentages of memory B cells. Patients having metastases in TDLNs showed a significantly higher presence of immunosuppressive B regulatory cells compared with metastasis-free patients (P = .0008). Elevated levels of regulatory B cells in TDLNs were associated with the advancement of the disease. B cells in TDLNs were characterized by significantly higher expression of an immunosuppressive cytokine-IL-10 compared with nTDLNs (P = .0077). Our data indicate that B cells in human TDLNs differ from B cells in nTDLNs and exhibit more naive and immunosuppressive phenotypes. We identified a high accumulation of regulatory B cells within TDLNs which may be a potential obstacle in achieving response to novel cancer immunotherapies (ICIs) in head and neck cancer.

TI  - The influence of cognitive and affective components of the sentinel event on alcohol use following a brief intervention with trauma patients
T2  - ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective Alcohol-related injury is a sentinel event, an unanticipated medical event that may prompt a re-evaluation of health behaviors, such as alcohol use. Few studies have examined the psychological components of the sentinel event that motivate behavior change. In the present study, we examined the influence of cognitive and affective components of an alcohol-related injury on changes in alcohol use following a brief intervention.Method Injured patients (n = 411) who were drinking prior to their injury admission were recruited from three urban Level I trauma centers and randomized to receive brief advice or brief motivational intervention with or without a 1-month booster session. Assessments were completed at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Three groups were created based on endorsement (yes/no) of items assessing cognitive and affective components of the injury event: neither component, the cognitive component only, and both the cognitive and affective components.Results Mixed-effects models indicated that participants who endorsed both the cognitive and affective components had greater reductions in peak alcohol use from baseline to 3-month follow-up than those who did endorsed neither component. By contrast, participants who endorsed the cognitive component, but not the affective component, had greater increases in average drinks per week and percentage of days of heavy drinking from 3- to 12-month follow-ups than those who endorsed neither component.Conclusion These results provide preliminary support for further consideration of an affective component of alcohol-related injuries that may motivate subsequent reductions in drinking following a sentinel event.

TI  - Predicting air quality via multimodal AI and satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important major driving forces behind climate change and environmental issues that the Earth is currently facing is the pollution of the air which remains a key symptom of negative human influence on the environment. Air pollution is often invisible to the eye which can make its detection challenging, unlike the destruction of the land or waterways. Given that air-quality monitoring stations are typically ground-based, their abilities to detect pollutant distributions are often restricted to wide areas. Satellites, however, have the potential for studying the atmosphere at large; the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus project satellite, "Sentinel-5P"is a newly launched satellite capable of measuring a variety of pollutant information with publicly available data outputs. This paper seeks to create a multi-modal machine learning model for predicting air-quality metrics with high precision so that it will be applicable to locations where monitoring stations do not exist. The inputs of this model will include a fusion of ground measurements and satellite data with the goal of highlighting pollutant distribution and motivating change in societal and industrial behaviours. A contemporary method for fusing satellite information with pollution measurements is studied, suggesting that simpler models can work as effectively as neural network models that are constructed with state-of-the-art architectures. A new dataset of continental European pollution monitoring station measurements is created with features including altitude, population density, environmental classification of local areas, and satellite data from the ESA Copernicus project. This dataset is used to train a multi-modal ML model, Air Quality Network (AQNet) capable of fusing these various types of data sources to output predictions of various pollutants. These predictions are then aggregated to create an "air-quality index" that could be used to compare air quality over different regions. Three pollutants, NO2, O3, and PM10, are predicted successfully by AQNet and the network was found to be useful compared to a model only using satellite imagery. It was also found that the addition of supporting tabular data improves predictions. When testing the developed AQNet on out-of-sample data of the UK and Ireland, we obtain satisfactory estimates though on average pollution metrics were roughly overestimated by around 20%.

TI  - Land Subsidence in a Coastal City Based on SBAS-InSAR Monitoring: A Case Study of Zhuhai, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The superimposed effects of sea level rise caused by global warming and land subsidence seriously threaten the sustainable development of coastal cities. In recent years, an important coastal city in China, Zhuhai, has been suffering from severe and widespread land subsidence; however, the characteristics, triggers, and vulnerability assessment of ground subsidence in Zhuhai are still unclear. Therefore, we used the SBAS-InSAR technique to process 51 Sentinel-1A images to monitor the land subsidence in Zhuhai during the period from August 2016 to June 2019. The results showed that there was extensive land subsidence in the study area, with a maximum rate of -109.75 mm/yr. The surface had sequentially undergone a process of minor uplift and decline fluctuation, sharp settlement, and stable subsidence. The distribution and evolution of land subsidence were controlled by tectonic fractures and triggered by the thickness of soft soil, the intensity of groundwater development, and the seasonal changes of atmospheric precipitation. The comprehensive index method and the analytic hierarchy process were applied to derive extremely high subsidence vulnerability in several village communities and some traffic arteries in Zhuhai. Our research provides a theoretical basis for urban disaster prevention in Zhuhai and the construction planning of coastal cities around the world.

TI  - Validation of a microRNA liquid biopsy assay for diagnosis and risk stratification of invasive cutaneous melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Noninvasive molecular biomarkers are needed to improve the early, accurate and precise diagnosis of invasive cutaneous melanoma.Objectives To independently validate a previously identified circulating microRNA signature of melanoma (MEL38), and, secondly, to develop a complementary microRNA signature, optimized for prognostication.Patients and Methods MicroRNA expression profiling was performed on plasma samples from a multicentre observational case-control study, involving patients with primary or metastatic melanoma, melanoma in situ, nonmelanoma skin cancer, or benign naevi. MicroRNA profiles from patients with length of survival, treatment and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) data were used to develop the prognostic signature. The primary outcome of interest for MEL38 was its association with melanoma status, including area under the curve, binary diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and incidence-adjusted positive and negative predictive values. The prognostic signature was assessed using rates of survival per risk group and relationship to conventional predictors of outcome.Results Circulating microRNA profiles of 372 patients with invasive melanoma and 210 control individuals were generated. The average age of all participants was 59 years; 49% were male. A MEL38 score > 5.5 indicated the presence of invasive melanoma. Overall, 551/582 (95%) of patients were correctly diagnosed, with 93% sensitivity and 98% specificity. MEL38 score ranged from 0 to 10 with an area under the curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.97-0.99, P < 0.001). A novel prognostic 12-microRNA signature ( MEL12) developed from 232 patients identified low-, standard- or high-risk groups, with 94%, 78% and 58% rates of 10-year melanoma-specific survival, respectively (log-rank P < 0.001). MEL12 prognostic risk groups were significantly associated with clinical staging (chi(2), P < 0.001) and SLNB status (P = 0.027). Patients who were classified as high risk by MEL12 were approximately three times more likely to have melanoma detected in their sentinel lymph nodes compared to low-risk patients.Conclusions The circulating MEL38 signature may assist in diagnosing patients with invasive melanoma vs. other conditions associated with a lower - or negligible - risk of mortality. A complementary and prognostic MEL12 signature is predictive of SLNB status, clinical stage and probability of survival. Plasma microRNA profiling may help to optimize existing diagnostic pathways as well as enable personalized, risk-informed melanoma treatment decisions.

TI  - Impact assessment of land use/land cover changes on surface runoff characteristics in the Shetrunji River Basin using the SWAT model
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use/land cover (LU/LC) change has a considerable effect on the runoff characteristics of any watershed. LU/LC change studies are necessary for policymakers to identify the challenges and adopt the course of action such as soil and water conservation measures for improvement. The current research is undertaken for the upper Shetrunji River basin using a hydrological model linked with GIS. Input data like LU/LC, meteorological, and soil elements are necessary to execute watershed modeling. The model was calibrated and validated in SWAT-CUP using the SUFI-2 algorithm. The data from 2000 to 2010 were utilized for calibration, whereas the data from 2011 to 2020 were used for validation with a three-year warm-up period from 1997 to 1999. LU/LC change detection has been accomplished using ERDAS IMAGINE 2015 via a supervised classification approach. Close agreement was obtained between simulated and observed streamflow data during model calibration (NSE = 0.74 and R-2 = 0.78) and validation (NSE = 0.70 and R-2 = 0.73). LU/LC change detection shows that agricultural, urban, and water body areas increased between 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, and forest areas increased in 2010 and decreased in 2020. Thus, it is concluded that the change in LU/LC significantly influenced the runoff of the upper Shetrunji River basin.

TI  - Analyzing Long-Term High-Rise Building Areas Changes Using Deep Learning and Multisource Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-rise building areas (HRBs) provide significant social and environmental services and play a crucial role in modern urbanization. The large-scale and long-term spatial distribution of HRBs is of great interest to many fields, such as urban planning and local climate analysis. While previous studies have confirmed the value of Sentinel-2 images in extracting HRBs and their changes, current work is limited to relatively local areas and short-term analysis. One reason is due to the fact that the earliest Sentinel-2 image can only date back to 2015. To address this research gap, this paper proposes an efficient procedure to intelligently extract HRBs and their changes from multitemporal Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images, using a specifically designed fully convolutional network. To validate the proposed method, we selected four typical cities in China, namely, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou, as study areas. We utilized Landsat-7 images acquired in 2000 and 2010, along with Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2020, as experimental data. We extracted and analyzed three periods of HRBs and their changes in the four cities, along with urban rail terminal data and gross domestic product (GDP) data in the same period. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently extract HRBs and their changes in the four cities over the past 20 years, with an overall accuracy of more than 90%. HRBs changes are primarily driven by urban planning policies and geographical factors. There is a strong positive correlation between the increase in HRBs and the increase in rail terminals, both in terms of quantity and spatial distribution. Additionally, there is a positive correlation between HRBs increase and GDP increase in terms of quantity, but the trend varies in different cities due to their diverse developing modes. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed method can be a potential operational tool to extract large-scale and long-term HRBs and their changes in China.

TI  - Water Resource Surveillance for the Salton Sea in California By Adaptive Sequential Monitoring of Its Landsat Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gradual loss of water resource in the Salton Sea has got much attention from researchers recently for its damage to the local environment and ecosystems for human beings, animals and plants. To monitor the water resource of the lake, researchers usually obtain certain water resource indices manually from databases such as the satellite images of the region. In this paper, we develop a new method to monitor the area of the Salton Sea automatically. By this method, the lake boundary is first segmented from each satellite image by an image segmentation procedure, and then its area is computed by a numerical algorithm. The sequence of lake areas computed from satellite images taken at different time points is then monitored by a control chart from the statistical process control literature. Because the lake area changes gradually over time, the control chart designed for detecting process mean drifts is used here for the water resource surveillance application.

TI  - Assessing the Contributions of Urban Green Space Indices and Spatial Structure in Mitigating Urban Thermal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space takes a dominant role in alleviating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Most investigations into the effects of cooling factors from urban green spaces on the UHI have evaluated the correlation between each factor and land surface temperature (LST) separately, and the contribution weights of various typical cooling factors in mitigating the thermal environment have rarely been analyzed. For this research, three periods of Landsat 8 data captured between 2014 and 2018 of Xuzhou during the summer and autumn seasons were selected along with corresponding meteorological and flux measurements. The mono-window method was employed to retrieve LST. Based on the characteristics of the vegetation and spatial features of the green space, eight factors related to green space were selected and computed, consisting of three indices that measure vegetation and five metrics that evaluate landscape patterns: vegetation density (VD), evapotranspiration (ET), green space shading degree (GSSD), patch area ratio (PLAND), largest patch index (LPI), patch natural connectivity (COHESION), patch aggregation (AI), and patch mean shape index distribution (SHPAE_MN). Linear regression and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analyses between each green space factor and LST showed that there were significant negative linear and spatial correlations between all factors and LST, which proved that the eight factors were all cooling factors. In addition, LST was strongly correlated with all factors (|r| > 0.5) except for SHPAE_MN, which was moderately correlated (0.3 < |r| < 0.5). Based on this, two principal components were extracted by applying principal component analysis with all standardized green space factors as the original variables. To determine the contribution weight of each green space factor in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect, we multiplied the influence coefficient matrix of the initial variables with the standardized multiple linear regression coefficients between the two principal component variables and LST. The final results indicated that the vegetation indices of green space contribute more to the alleviation of the UHI than its landscape pattern metrics, and the contribution weights are ranked as VD >= ET > GSSD > PLAND approximate to LPI > COHESION > AI > SHAPE_MN. Our study suggests that increasing vegetation density is preferred in urban planning to mitigate urban thermal environment, and increasing broadleaf forests with high evapotranspiration and shade levels in urban greening is also an effective way to reduce ambient temperature. For urban green space planning, a priority is to multiply the regional green space proportion or the area of largest patches. Second, improving the connectivity or aggregation among patches of green space can enhance their ability to cool the surrounding environment. Altering the green space spatial shape is likely the least significant factor to consider.

TI  - Untangling the Integral Impact of Land Use Change, Economic, Ecological and Social Factors on the Development of Burabay District (Kazakhstan) during the Period 1999-2021
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term spatiotemporal Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis is an objective tool for assessing patterns of sustainable development (SD). The basic purpose of this research is to define the Driving Mechanisms (DM) and assess the trend of SD in the Burabay district (Kazakhstan), which includes a city, an agro-industrial complex, and a national natural park, based on the integrated use of spatiotemporal data (STD), economic, environmental, and social (EES) indicators. The research was performed on the GEE platform using Landsat and Random Forest. The DM were studied by Multiple Linear Regression and Principal Component Analysis. SD trend was assessed through sequential transformations, aggregations, and integrations of 36 original STD and EES indicators. The overall classification accuracy was 0.85-0.97. Over the past 23 years, pasture area has changed the most (-16.69%), followed by arable land (+14.72%), forest area increased slightly (+1.81%), and built-up land-only +0.16%. The DM of development of the AOI are mainly economic components. There has been a noticeable drop in the development growth of the study area in 2021, which is apparently a consequence of the COVID-19. The upshots of the research can serve as a foundation for evaluating SD and LULC policy.

TI  - Vegetation carbon input moderates the effects of climate change on topsoil organic carbon in China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change affects soil organic carbon (SOC) and contributes to the uncertainty of terrestrial carbon sinks in the global carbon budget. The response of SOC to climate change and its associated control processes are still not well understood at the national level due to limited surface monitoring and control experiments. With changes in vegetation growth and the regulation of its carbon input, the feedback of topsoil SOC to climate change is likely to become more complex at broad geographical scales. Here, on the basis of the long-term satellite remote sensing data from 2000 to 2019, multiple linear regression and pathway analyses were applied to the raster scale to investigate the importance of vegetation carbon input relative to climate change impacts on topsoil SOC in China and quantify the direct effects of climate change on topsoil SOC and the indirect effects through vegetation net primary productivity (NPP). The results show that the overall trend of increase in topsoil SOC in China from 2000 to 2019 is significant (P < 0.05), and most regions show a good development trend in the future, except for some areas in the Central South, East, and Northeast regions, where a risk of degradation exists. Relative to climate change, the dominant areas of NPP impact on topsoil SOC in China occupy a considerable proportion, especially in the North, Northwest, and Central South regions, with area proportions of 68.15 %, 49.52 %, and 47.99 %, respectively. The indirect positive impacts of climate change on changes in topsoil SOC in China through vegetation carbon input offset the direct negative impacts in most areas. These results have important implications for enhanced prediction of future SOC changes and provide references for terrestrial carbon sinks management strategies in the context of response to climate change.

TI  - Satellites reveal Earth's seasonally shifting dust emission sources
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing mineral dust impacts on Earth's systems requires numerical models of the dust cycle. Differences between dust optical depth (DOD) measurements and modelling the cycle of dust emission, atmospheric transport, and deposi-tion of dust indicate large model uncertainty due partially to unrealistic model assumptions about dust emission fre-quency. Calibrating dust cycle models to DOD measurements typically in North Africa, are routinely used to reduce dust model magnitude. This calibration forces modelled dust emissions to match atmospheric DOD but may hide the correct magnitude and frequency of dust emission events at source, compensating biases in other modelled pro-cesses of the dust cycle. Therefore, it is essential to improve physically based dust emission modules. Here we use a global collation of satellite observations from previous studies of dust emission point source (DPS) di-chotomous frequency data. We show that these DPS data have little-to-no relation with MODIS DOD frequency. We calibrate the albedo-based dust emission model using the frequency distribution of those DPS data. The global dust emission uncertainty constrained by DPS data (+/- 3.8 kg m-2 y-1) provides a benchmark for dust emission model de-velopment. Our calibrated model results reveal much less global dust emission (29.1 +/- 14.9 Tg y-1) than previous estimates, and show seasonally shifting dust emission predominance within and between hemispheres, as opposed to a persistent North African dust emission primacy widely interpreted from DOD measurements. Earth's largest dust emissions, proceed seasonally from East Asian deserts in boreal spring, to Middle Eastern and North African deserts in boreal summer and then Australian shrublands in boreal autumn-winter. This new analysis of dust emissions, from global sources of varying geochemical properties, have far-reaching implications for current and fu-ture dust-climate effects. For more reliable coupled representation of dust-climate projections, our findings suggest the need to re-evaluate dust cycle modelling and benefit from the albedo-based parameterisation.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic environmental changes are the key drivers in expansion of cities in the form of higher surface temperature than the expected one. This study aims to investigate the seasonality and homogeneity of surface temperatures in Indian city and its environs. To this end, we utilized day and night-time remote sensing data collected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites from 2003 to 2020, encompassing the summer, monsoon and winter seasons. Our investigation reveals that the outskirts of urban centres experience significantly higher surface temperatures and more intense Urban Heat Indices (UHI) throughout the day. The temperature differential in the study area is consistently high throughout the year. Notably, both during the day and at night, the metropolitan areas of Ahmedabad city exhibit significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding rural regions. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggests that the most reliable results are obtained using the day-day and night-night combinations during the summer, monsoon and winter seasons, as opposed to the day-night and night-day combinations. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermal characteristics of urban regions, highlighting the need for appropriate mitigation strategies to combat the effects of UHI and promote sustainable development.

TI  - The Use of Regional Data Assimilation to Improve Numerical Simulations of Diurnal Characteristics of Precipitation during an Active Madden-Julian Oscillation Event over the Maritime Continent
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of regional data assimilation on diurnal characteristics of precipitation and winds over the Maritime Continent (MC) using a set of cloud-permitting-scale (similar to 3 km) numerical simulations with the mesoscale community Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the NCEP Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI)-based ensemble-3DVAR hybrid data assimilation system. Numerical experiments focus on January 2018, when a well-defined, active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagated through the MC region. Available conventional and satellite data are assimilated. Results show that simulated precipitation with data assimilation generally agrees better with satellite-derived rainfall than the control simulation without data assimilation. Simulations with data assimilation also reproduce the diurnal cycle of precipitation better, especially for the timing of the precipitation peak. Data assimilation modulates the overstrong (overweak) diurnal forcing over the land (ocean) in the control simulation. The vertical phase shift of the thermodynamic environment, associated with the timing of vertical motion transition along with low-level water vapor supplies, results in maximum precipitation occurring later, especially over land. To further demonstrate the impact of data assimilation, an additional experiment assimilates NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS)-derived ocean surface winds. The results indicate that the assimilation of CYGNSS data exhibits an evident impact on the diurnal variation of surface variables and a similar shift in the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Overall, this study highlights the importance of regional data assimilation in improving the representation of precipitation over the MC, paving the way for a better understanding of the interactions of local diurnal convective precipitation cycles with MJO.

AB  - Landscape ecology studies are based on the concept that most local phenomena cannot be completely understood without considering the role of the surrounding landscape. A key factor in landscape ecology is the heterogeneous distribution of resources that different species use for food and reproduction. In this paper, we analyse the role of patch quality together with landscape attributes on the distribution and abundance of Arhopalus rusticus in the central west of Cordoba Province in Argentina.Land cover was estimated using Landsat 8 scenes. Landscape was quantified by estimating the focal patch area, the distance to nearest pine patch and the quality of the patch through the enhanced vegetation index obtained from the MODIS satellite. Generalised linear mixed models were employed to analyse the relationship between the independent variables and A. rusticus abundance. A multi-model inference approach was employed to select the best model.The distance to nearest pine patch and the enhanced vegetation index of the previous year showed a negative relationship with A. rusticus abundance, while the relationship with the focal patch area and the enhanced vegetation index of the year in which the sampling took place was positive.Our results show that although landscape pattern of pine patches affects the invading capability of A. rusticus in a direct way, the forest patch quality is an important factor that limits the capability of the insect to establish itself in an area.

TI  - Revisiting the role of secondary towns: How different types of urban growth relate to poverty in Indonesia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in assessing whether big city growth has effects that differ from the effects of secondary town growth, especially in terms of impacts on poverty. It can be difficult to study these issues with typical sub-national economic data because urban growth often occurs outside the administrative boundaries of cities. An emerging literature therefore uses remote sensing to measure patterns of urban growth without being restricted by limitations of data for administrative areas. We add to this literature by combining poverty estimates from annual socio-economic surveys fielded from 2011 to 2019 with remote sensing data on night-time lights for 41 big cities and for secondary towns in 497 Indonesian dis-tricts. We measure growth on the extensive (lit area) and intensive (brightness within lit area) margins, and distinguish between growth of big cities and of secondary towns and our spatial econometric models allow global and local spillovers. The extensive margin growth of secondary towns is associated with lower rates of poverty but no similar association holds for big city growth. These patterns corroborate earlier findings from India. Potential productivity advantages of big cities and concerns about agricultural land loss to expanding towns may imply that urban growth patterns that favour big cities are warranted, while on the other hand these new results suggest, from a poverty reduction point of view, that policies to favour secondary towns may be warranted. Policymakers in countries like Indonesia therefore face dif-ficult trade-offs when developing their urbanization strategies. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can crop modelling, proximal sensing and variable rate application techniques be integrated to support in-season nitrogen fertilizer decisions? An application in corn
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization in corn is often based on uniform rates and yield goals without considering the spatial and temporal variability of yield potential. It is well documented how uniform N rates lead to low N use effi-ciencies and environmental issues, resulting in reduced profit for farmers. Several site-specific approaches have been proposed to capture the yield spatial variability and adjust N rates to the actual crop nutrient requirements. The current study presents two original, site-specific N fertilization approaches, where two approaches at inte-grating crop simulation models, seasonal forecast and proximal sensing were tested across two corn seasons (2019 and 2020) in a field with significant spatial variability. In the first approach, top dressing N prescription maps were determined using the DSSAT crop model run with historical weather data, while in the second one, the maps were determined coupling DSSAT with seasonal forecasts and proximal sensing. Compared to the uniform fertilization treatment, both model-based approaches led to higher yields, N efficiency and gross margin in 2019 but not in 2020. The 2020 season was characterized by several major rainfall events, which were not present in the historical or seasonal forecast datasets. This inconsistency led to a substantial underestimation of the N leaching events in both model-based methodologies and consequently to higher-than-needed N fertilizer recommendations. Future studies should therefore focus on identifying ways to provide accurate seasonal esti-mates of extreme weather events to enable crop models to provide better N recommendations. In addition, the integration of proximal and remote sensing data into the crop model should be tested later in the season when spatial variability in crop N status peaks.

TI  - Data Mining and Machine Learning Algorithms for Optimizing Maize Yield Forecasting in Central Europe
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning (ML), serves as a valuable tool for decision support in crop management under ongoing climate change. However, ML implementation to predict maize yield is still limited in Central Europe, especially in Hungary. In this context, we assessed the performance of four ML algorithms (Bagging (BG), Decision Table (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network-Multi Layer Perceptron (ANN-MLP)) in predicting maize yield based on four different input scenarios. The collected data included both agricultural data (production (PROD) (ton) and maize cropped area (AREA) (ha)) and climate data (annual mean temperature degrees C (Tmean), precipitation (PRCP) (mm), rainy days (RD), frosty days (FD) and hot days (HD)). This research adopted four scenarios, as follows: SC1: AREA+ PROD+ Tmean+ PRCP+ RD+ FD+ HD; SC2: AREA+ PROD; SC3: Tmean+ PRCP+ RD+ FD+ HD; and SC4: AREA+ PROD+ Tmean+ PRCP. In the training stage, ANN-MLP-(SC1) and ANN-MLP-(SC4) outperformed other ML algorithms; the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.99 for both, while the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) were 107.9 (ANN-MLP-(SC1)) and 110.7 (ANN-MLP-(SC4)). In the testing phase, the ANN-MLP-(SC4) had the highest r value (0.96), followed by ANN-MLP-(SC1) (0.94) and RF-(SC2) (0.94). The 10-fold cross validation also revealed that the ANN-MLP-(SC4) and ANN-MLP-(SC1) have the highest performance. We further evaluated the performance of the ANN-MLP-(SC4) in predicting maize yield on a regional scale (Budapest). The ANN-MLP-(SC4) succeeded in reaching a high-performance standard (r = 0.98, relative absolute error = 21.87%, root relative squared error = 20.4399% and RMSE = 423.23). This research promotes the use of ANN as an efficient tool for predicting maize yield, which could be highly beneficial for planners and decision makers in developing sustainable plans for crop management.

TI  - Improvement of VV-polarization tilt MTF for Gaofen-3 SAR data of a tropical cyclone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an essential modulation transfer function (MTF) on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), denoted as tilt modulation, is improved through five vertical-vertical (VV) polarized Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images acquired in Global Observation (GLO) and Wide ScanSAR (WSC) mode that were captured during the 2017 tropical cyclone (TC) season in the western Pacific Ocean. These images are reprocessed to be Level-1B products and collocated with the wind fields from Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction System - Typhoons Model. More than 9,000 matchups are exploited for studying the dependence of tilt on the wind speed and incidence angle. It is found that quantitative tilt MTF (herein denoted as the derivative scattering coefficient), which is proportional to first-order derivative normalized radar cross-section with respect to incidence angle, is inversely related with the incidence angle between 14 degrees and 46 degrees. In addition, the wind speed has an obvious influence on the derivative scattering coefficient due to each scattering facet essentially being modulated by strong wind-induced long-waves, whereas traditional tilt MTF does not conform to the actual situation. However, the sensitivity of wind speed on the derivative scattering coefficient weakens at larger incidence angles (>40 degrees). Following this rationale, the empirical tilt MTF in VV polarization has been developed. The reanalysis results indicate that the values from empirical tilt MTF could depict the role of wind. The improvement herein could overcome the limitation in tilt MTF, namely, the lack of a strong wind's influence, and it is expected to be implemented for SAR wave retrieval in TCs.

TI  - Synergistic use of multi-satellite remote sensing to detect forest fires: A case study in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire frequency is increasing owing to climate change. Therefore, better forest fire monitoring strategies are required, as they can start unexpectedly and spread rapidly. Earth observation satellites can efficiently prompt rapid responses to forest fires. In this study, Burned Area Index (BAI) and difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) were analysed to detect and monitor a forest fire in Korea using data from four sun-synchronous satellites and one geostationary satellite, and the results were compared in terms of their spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. KOMPSAT-3A efficiently estimated detailed information of the fire on a local-scale for its spatial resolution but was limited to only observing the local-scale fire due to its narrow swath. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 were adequate for observing the forest fire on both local- and large-scales and provided more spectral bands and temporal information, which increased the accuracy of detecting the fire damage. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and GK-2A showed the highest temporal resolution and enabled early detection of the wildfire and its duration, but their low spatial resolutions limited damage estimates to the local-scale. Thus, satellites worldwide may be used synergistically to ensure efficient responses to frequent and massive forest fires.

TI  - Urban sprawl characterization and its impact on peri-urban agriculture in Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, using multi-date landsat imagery
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying and characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban areas is mandatory in many disciplines, e.g., in environmental studies, infrastructure, and agriculture. The current research work investigates the overall trends of urban development and agricultural land changes of Sidi Bel Abbes city, for the years 1987, 1999, 2009 and 2019. To this end, Landsat archives have been considered due to its excellent temporal coverage, appropriate spatial dimension for urban characterization, and free data access. Multiple classifiers decision fusion technique was performed to characterize the spatial distribution of the built-up areas followed by agricultural land changes estimation through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The results reveal that over the last three decades, a significant increase of built-up lands has been settled at the expense of peri-urban agriculture where the net-growth rate (%) of built-up areas and agricultural land per year between 1987 to 1999, 1999 to 2009 and 2009 to 2019 were + 4.2, + 2.83, + 2.11 and -1.66, -0.94, -0.69 respectively. The multi-temporal assessment of urban change and orientation permitted the identification of slow (southeast) and fast (north-east) sprawling areas. In addition, to understand the built-up expansion effects on the agricultural land-cover, urban sprawl was analyzed and the results show that the settlement areas generally increased in the whole study period, which was around 39.01% of the total area (7077 ha) and similarly, peri-urban agriculture areas decreased by approximately 32% from the arable lands (4648 ha).

TI  - Orthorectification of Data from the AHI Aboard the Himawari-8 Geostationary Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of geostationary meteorological satellites for land remote sensing has attracted much attention after the launch of the Himawari-8 satellite equipped with a sensor with enhanced land observation capabilities. In the context of land remote sensing, geolocation errors are often a critical issue, especially in mountainous regions, where a precise orthorectification process is required to maintain high geometric accuracy. The present work addresses the issues related to orthorectification of the new-generation geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites by applying an algorithm known as the ray-tracing indirect method to the data acquired by the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard the Himawari-8 satellite. The orthorectified images of the AHI were compared with data from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). The comparison shows a clear improvement of the geometric accuracy, especially in high-elevation regions located far from the subsatellite point. The results indicate that approximately 7.3% of the land pixels are shifted more than 3 pixels during the orthorectification process. Furthermore, the maximum displacement after the orthorectification is up to 7.2 pixels relative to the location in the original image, which is of the Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, serious problems caused by occlusions in the images of GEO sensors are clearly indicated. It is concluded that special caution is needed when using data from GEO satellites for land remote sensing in cases where the target is in a mountainous region and the pixels are located far from the subsatellite point.

AB  - The soil consists of organic mixture and mineral components, with air and water forming the spaces between them. To keep the soil nutrients within the limits of Field Potential and Essential nutrients and thus optimize crop production, productivity, and profitability, crop water needs can be assessed and irrigation regulated by measuring soil moisture. Emerging prediction models must enhance prediction performance, such as generalization, prediction accuracy, and multi-purpose processing capability. This paper introduces the implementation of classification algorithms like a Decision tree and Naive Bayes, such as hydrological and remote sensing data, to generate precise predictions of soil moisture using statistical evidence. The results show that soil moisture prediction for polluted soil, the Decision tree is efficient and useful. Its good ability to match and generalize data can enrich the system parameters while ensuring high predictive accuracy soil moisture data patterns and values, providing an important theoretical basis for moisture conservation and management of scarcity.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Fires in the boreal forest occur with natural frequencies and patterns. Burned area (BA) is an essential variable in assessing the impact of climate change in boreal regions. Aims. Spatial wildfire occurrence data since the 1950s are available for North America. However, there are no reliable data for Eurasia, mainly for Siberia, during the 1980s and 1990s. Methods. A Bayesian-network algorithm was applied to the Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) Version 5 to generate a BA DataSet (BA-LTDR-DS) for the Boreal region from 1982 to 2020, validated using official reference data and compared with the MODIS MCD64A1 product. Key results. A high correlation (>93%) with all the reference BA datasets was found. BA-LTDR-DS data grouped by decades estimated a linear increase in BA of 4.47 million ha/decade. This trend provides evidence of how global warming affects fire activity in these boreal forests. Conclusions. BA-LTDR-DS constitutes a unique data source for the pre-MODIS era, and becomes a reliable source when other products with higher spatial/spectral resolution are not available. Implications. The BA-LTDR-DS dataset constitutes the longest time series developed for the boreal region at this spatial resolution. BA-LTDR-DS could be used as input in global climate models, helping improve wildfire prediction capabilities and understand the interactions between fire, climate and vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Migration and Food Security of North Central Region, Nigeria
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security is adversely affected by challenges posed by changes in land use and land cover (LULC). LULC change impacts ecosystem functions and services, leading to migration of people, particularly rural dwellers. This paper uses multispectral satellite remote sensing, net migration data, household survey, stakeholders' meetings, Focus Group Discussions (FGD), expert interviews and yields and estimated land mass of maize, rice, groundnut, cassava, and yam to assess the extent of LULC in Niger, Kwara, and Benue states of North Central Region of Nigeria and their relevance for migration and food security. Remote sensing data for 1990, 2000, 2013, and 2020 were extracted from Landsat imageries to obtain LULC change. Household survey was conducted to validate the data obtained from Landsat imageries. The results of LULC between 1990 and 2020 show that most of the vegetation, agricultural land, and water body areas in Kwara and Benue States have been converted to built-up areas and barren land, while an increase in agricultural land and built-up areas was observed in Niger State. Our household survey, stakeholders' meetings, and interviews showed that there was a continuous massive migration of people, particularly young farmers, to cities leaving most of the existing agricultural lands uncultivated. This was due to the losses in agricultural land and conversion of some of the other LULC classes to barren land. We conclude that if this permanent migration remains uncontrolled, it will have significantly negative future impacts on food security of Nigeria. It is recommended that the government and its sub-ordinary administrative entities invest in more reliable infrastructure and attractive living environment for the rural dwellers to reduce the rate of rural-urban migration in the study areas.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to demonstrate the extent of forest cover at high altitudes in Sulaymaniyah Governorate (Province) in the Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq, from 1984 to 2021 and discuss and explain the changes. The forest data were collected from the satellite digital images of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) from 1984 to 2008 and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) from 2014 to 2021. Data preprocessing preparation included employing a radiometric calibration to convert the images from radiance to Top Atmospheric Reflectance (TOA) in order to remove the cosine effect of different solar zenith angles. Next, a quick atmospheric correction (QUAC) was applied to remove atmospheric noise, particles, molecules and vapor from the data; then the basic equation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to extract the forest data for 98 samples taken from across the study area. The study shows that forest cover more than doubled during the survey period: in 1984, 9.1% of the study area was covered by forest, but by 2021 forest cover had increased to 18.4%. We discuss how this increase in forest cover is related to better forest management and preservation by the government and by improving the population's environmental awareness.

TI  - Improved burned area mapping using monotemporal Landsat-9 imagery and convolutional shift-transformer
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery, specifically Landsat, have been widely used for mapping and monitoring wildfire burned areas. The new Landsat-9 satellite - with higher radiometric resolution compared to its predecessors, and improved temporal resolution when combined with Landsat-8 (similar to 8 days) - enables a wide range of applications, particu-larly burned area mapping (BAM). We propose a novel deep learning BAM model that leverages the strengths of the convolutional layers for deep feature generation from Landsat-9 imagery and shift-transformer block for burned area classification. The performance of the model is evaluated in five large fire case studies across the globe. BAM results are also compared with two state-of-the-art models, namely residual convolutional neural network and vision transformer. The proposed convolutional shift-transformer (CST) outperforms other models with an F1-score of greater than 96% across the case studies. Furthermore, CST only requires a single post-fire image that reduces computational costs compared to traditional models that use bi-temporal images.

TI  - Modeling the intensity of surface urban heat island based on the impervious surface area
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is anticipated to be intensified and cause severe damage to human society under future urbanization and climate change. Due to the complicated human -nature interactions in the urban domain, it is challenging to characterize the intensity of UHI quantitatively, especially at the global scale. Here, we proposed a framework to estimate the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) based on satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) and the derived impervious surface area (ISA) data across 355 cities worldwide from 2003 to 2018. First, we employed linear regression models to estimate LST using ISA as the explanatory variable, given that the LST generally elevated with increasing urban intensity along the urban-rural gradient. Then, using the modeled LST, we estimated the spatiotemporal patterns of SUHII worldwide. The established linear regression models with ISA as the explanatory variable perform reasonably well in estimating LST for both daytime and nighttime, with average RMSEs of 1.40 and 0.80 degrees C, respectively. The resulting SUHII reasonably captures the spatial heterogeneity across cities in the world, with the highest value in the tropical region at daytime and in the arid region at nighttime. The estimated and observed SUHII show good agreement with average R2 values of 0.81 and 0.72 for daytime and nighttime, respectively. Using ISA as an indicator for LST estimation, this study first implemented a comprehensive estimation of SUHII at the global scale. The proposed methodology is of great potential to project future SUHII by expanding urban impervious surfaces under diverse scenarios jointly determined by shared socioeconomic path-ways and climate change scenarios.

TI  - Walnut Acreage Extraction and Growth Monitoring Based on the NDVI Time Series and Google Earth Engine
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Walnut (Juglans regia) planting is the main economic pillar industry in southern Xinjiang. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, the NDVI maximum synthesis method was used to estimate changes in the walnut cultivation area in Ganquan Town, South Xinjiang, from 2017 to 2021. The simultaneous difference between NDVI and meteorological conditions was also used to monitor the growth and correlation analysis of walnuts from April to September 2021. To improve the classification accuracy of the extracted walnut plantation area, Sentinel-2 image data were selected, and features were trained using the random forest algorithm, and by combining topographic features, texture features, NDVI, and EVI. The results show that, compared with Statistical Yearbook data, the average error of the extracted walnut planted area is less than 10%, the overall classification accuracy is 92.828%, the average kappa coefficient is 90.344%, and the average walnut classification accuracy is 94.4%. The accuracy of the data was significantly improved by adding vegetation indices EVI and NDVI compared with the single vegetation index. An analysis of the results from monitoring comparative growth shows that the growth of walnuts in Ganquan was better during the hardcore and oil transformation stages compared with 2020, and in the fruit development stage, the growth was the same as in 2020, and overall, the growth of walnuts in 2021 was better than in previous years.

TI  - Groundwater analysis using Gravity Recovery, Climate Experiment and Google Earth Engine: Bundelkhand region, India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - India is one of the highest consumers of groundwater in the world. This precious resource is important for socio-economic development and it has been extremely rapidly depleting. Therefore, monitoring of groundwater storage (GWS) change is of great significance. Dependence on in-situ groundwater measurement for accurate assessment of regional-scale GWS changes is constrained, especially over extended durations, due to poor spatiotemporal coverage of in-situ measurement and uncertainty in the storage process. In present study, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which offers quantitative measurement of terrestrial water storage (TWS) coupled with TerraClimate data, has been used to estimate the changes in GWS from 2002 to 2017 for the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, India. Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS are the processing software employed to process and analyse the satellite data. It was observed that, on average GWS, has been depleted by 112 mm during the studied period. The highest GWS fluctuation was observed in 2012(-247 mm to -60 mm); the lowest fluctuation for year 2009, (-162 mm to-43 mm). Volumetric groundwater depletion in the study area was calculated using the average GWS depletion. There is a reduction of 1,12,000 m3 groundwater per unit square kilometre area over the period of 16 years, however, 3.29 x 109 m3 in the entire studied region. Because of the rugged topography and hard rock terrain, the recharge process is poor. The population of the area increased by 24%, or by a factor of two, throughout the research period.

TI  - Validation, inter-comparison, and usage recommendation of six latest VIIRS and MODIS aerosol products over the ocean and land on the global and regional scales
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS and VIIRS aerosol products have been used extensively by the scientific community. Products in operation in-clude MODIS Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) and VIIRS DT, DB, and NOAA Environmental Data Record products. This study comprehensively validated and inter -compared aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) over land and the ocean of these six products (seven different algorithms) on regional and global scales using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations. In particular, we used AERONET inversions to classify AOD and AE biases into different scenarios (depending on absorption and particle size) to obtain retrieval error characteristics. The spatial pat-terns of the products and their differences were also analyzed. Collectively, although six satellite AODs are in good agreement with ground observations, VIIRS DB (land and ocean) and MODIS MAIAC (land only) AODs show better validation metrics globally and better performance in 8/10 world regions. Therefore, they are more recommended for usage. Although land AE retrievals are not capable of quantitative application at both instantaneous and monthly scales, their spatial patterns show qualitative potential. Ocean AE shows a relatively high correlation coefficient with ground measurements (>0.75), meeting the fraction of expected accuracy (> 0.70). Error characteristic analyses em-phasize the importance of aerosol particle size and absorption-scattering properties for land retrieval, indicating that improving the representation of aerosol types is necessary. This study is expected to facilitate the usage selection of operating VIIRS and MODIS products and their algorithm improvements.

TI  - Design of effective outpatient sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 decision-making: a modeling study
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDecision-makers impose COVID-19 mitigations based on public health indicators such as reported cases, which are sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand for diagnostic testing, and hospital admissions, which lag infections by up to two weeks. Imposing mitigations too early has unnecessary economic costs while imposing too late leads to uncontrolled epidemics with unnecessary cases and deaths. Sentinel surveillance of recently-symptomatic individuals in outpatient testing sites may overcome biases and lags in conventional indicators, but the minimal outpatient sentinel surveillance system needed for reliable trend estimation remains unknown.MethodsWe used a stochastic, compartmental transmission model to evaluate the performance of various surveillance indicators at reliably triggering an alarm in response to, but not before, a step increase in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The surveillance indicators included hospital admissions, hospital occupancy, and sentinel cases with varying levels of sampling effort capturing 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100% of incident mild cases. We tested 3 levels of transmission increase, 3 population sizes, and conditions of either simultaneous transmission increase or lagged increase in the older population. We compared the indicators' performance at triggering alarm soon after, but not prior, to the transmission increase.ResultsCompared to surveillance based on hospital admissions, outpatient sentinel surveillance that captured at least 20% of incident mild cases could trigger an alarm 2 to 5 days earlier for a mild increase in transmission and 6 days earlier for a moderate or strong increase. Sentinel surveillance triggered fewer false alarms and averted more deaths per day spent in mitigation. When transmission increase in older populations lagged the increase in younger populations by 14 days, sentinel surveillance extended its lead time over hospital admissions by an additional 2 days.ConclusionsSentinel surveillance of mild symptomatic cases can provide more timely and reliable information on changes in transmission to inform decision-makers in an epidemic like COVID-19.

TI  - Estimating Advance of Built-Up Area in Desert-Oasis Ecotone of Cholistan Desert Using Landsat
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been few attempts to estimate the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) on ecosystem services in desert-oasis ecotones, which are recognized as critical ecological barriers and buffers that prevent deserts from expanding into oases. This research investigated how remote sensing and geographic information technology may be used to monitor changes in LULC in the Cholistan desert and the Bahawalpur region of Pakistan between the years 2015 and 2022. The objective of this research was to identify thematic and statistical shifts in LULC in the study area due to various human interventions in the area. Landsat-8 images were processed using the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique using 500 training samples to categorize the study area into four LULC classes, i.e., desert/barren land, waterbodies, vegetation, and built-up areas, with an overall accuracy of 93% and 98% for 2015 and 2022, respectively. Results indicate a significant expansion in built-up area in 2022, which is up to 43%, agriculture and vegetation area declined by 8%, waterbodies decreased by 41%, and desert area decreased by 2% when compared with 2015. The change detection approach revealed that agricultural land was directly encroached on by rapidly increasing built-up area and urbanization as the area had an overall 19% rise in population growth within eight years with an annual growth rate of more than 3%. This study will be helpful to assess the quantity of spatial and temporal changes in the desert ecosystem, which is usually ignored by policymakers and governments due to less economic activity, although it plays a huge role in biodiversity conservation and balancing the regional ecosystem.

T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper surveys flood mapping and modelling in Nigeria in regard to frequency and impact of floods in the last decade. The aim is to understand the frequency and patterns of flooding and approaches to its modelling in relation to current practices globally. The northern part of Nigeria is affected more by flooding than the south, so should be prioritised for flood management. The use of remote sensing data with GIS techniques is the most common approach to flood modelling in Nigeria. Bayesian and machine learning approaches should be used, in preference to process-based models.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Bare Soil Temporal Mosaics of 6-Year Periods for Soil Organic Carbon Content Mapping in Central France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based soil organic carbon content (SOC) mapping over wide regions is generally hampered by the low soil sampling density and the diversity of soil sampling periods. Some unfavorable topsoil conditions, such as high moisture, rugosity, the presence of crop residues, the limited amplitude of SOC values and the limited area of bare soil when a single image is used, are also among the influencing factors. To generate a reliable SOC map, this study addresses the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) temporal mosaics of bare soil (S2Bsoil) over 6 years jointly with soil moisture products (SMPs) derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 images, SOC measurement data and other environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models, lithology maps and airborne gamma-ray data. In this study, we explore (i) the dates and periods that are preferable to construct temporal mosaics of bare soils while accounting for soil moisture and soil management; (ii) which set of covariates is more relevant to explain the SOC variability. From four sets of covariates, the best contributing set was selected, and the median SOC content along with uncertainty at 90% prediction intervals were mapped at a 25-m resolution from quantile regression forest models. The accuracy of predictions was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation, repeated five times. The models using all the covariates had the best model performance. Airborne gamma-ray thorium, slope and S2 bands (e.g., bands 6, 7, 8, 8a) and indices (e.g., calcareous sedimentary rocks, "calcl") from the "late winter-spring" time series were the most important covariates in this model. Our results also indicated the important role of neighboring topographic distances and oblique geographic coordinates between remote sensing data and parent material. These data contributed not only to optimizing SOC mapping performance but also provided information related to long-range gradients of SOC spatial variability, which makes sense from a pedological point of view.

TI  - Sentinel-3 SLSTR active fire (AF) detection and FRP daytime product-Algorithm description and global intercomparison to MODIS, VIIRS and landsat AF data
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) senses the Earth from onboard two concurrently operating European Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) satellites. As the Terra platform carrying the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is reaching its end of life, the S3 Active Fire Detection and FRP products generated from data captured by S3 SLSTR are expected to soon become the main global active fire (AF) product for the mid-morning and evening low Earth orbit timeslots. The S3 night-time AF product issued by the European Space Agency (ESA) has been operational since March 2020, and here we report on the significant adjustments made to enable the generation of a complimentary daytime product. Similar to MODIS, SLSTR possesses two middle infrared channels, both a 'standard' (normal gain; S7) channel and a 'fire' (low-gain; F1) channel but in contrast to MODIS by day even the ambient background land surface is often saturated in the SLSTR standard gain MIR (S7) channel. This saturation necessitates far greater use of the F1 channel data by day for active fire detection than by night, even though F1 has characteristics which make its data more challenging to combine with that from the other SLSTR thermal infrared channels. Here we report on the approaches used to combine S7 and F1 data for optimized daytime AF detection, and also detail the other algorithm adjustments found necessary to include in the daytime AF product algorithm. We compare the resulting daytime SLSTR AF product data to that generated from near-simultaneous views provided by MODIS onboard Terra. When both sensors detect the same active fire cluster at similar time, there is minimal bias shown between the two FRP retrievals (the ordinary least squares linear best fit between matched SLSTR and MODIS per-fire FRP matchups has a slope of 0.97). At the regional scale, the S3 product detects 70% of the AF pixels that the matching MODIS product reports, but also provides a further (16%) set of unique AF pixel detections. Regional FRP totals derived from SLSTR appear slightly lower than those from MODIS, and the OLS linear best fit between these regional FRP matchup datasets has a slope of 0.91. This is largely due to SLSTR performing less well in detecting the lowest FRP fires by day, whereas by night the S3 product performs a little better than MODIS due to the increased night-time use of S7 in the earlier AF pixel detection stages. Global fire mapping at a 0.25 degrees grid cell resolution shows very similar daytime fire patterns and FRP totals from S3 and Terra MODIS, with SLSTR detecting around twice the number of AF pixels due to the algorithm being more effective at identifying low FRP pixels at the edges of fire clusters. Regional time series case studies also show very similar temporal patterns between S3 and Terra MODIS. Longer-term intercomparisons such as these will provide the knowledge necessary to use MODIS and SLSTR AF products together to analyse long-term AF trends. Comparing near simultaneous observations of fires by SLSTR and from the 30 m spatial resolution Landsat Operational Land Image (OLI) data, we find that once there are around 150 OLI active fire pixels detected within the area of an SLSTR pixel, the chances of that SLSTR pixel being classed as an active fire by the daytime algorithm rises to almost 100%. The daytime SLSTR AF Detection and FRP product based on the algorithm described herein has been fully operational since March 2022 and is available from the Sentinel-3 Science Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).

TI  - Paddy Rice Phenological Mapping throughout 30-Years Satellite Images in the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Honghe Hani Rice Terraces represent the coexistence between natural and cultural systems. Despite being listed as a World Heritage Site in 2013, certain natural and anthropogenic factors have changed land use/land cover, which has led to a reduction in the size of the paddy rice area. It is difficult to accurately assess these changes due to the lack of historical maps of paddy rice croplands with fine spatial resolution. Therefore, we integrated a random forest classifier and phenological information to improve mapping accuracy and stability. We then mapped the historical distribution of land use/land cover in the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces from 1989-1991 to 2019-2021 using the Google Earth Engine. Finally, we analyzed the driving forces of land use types in the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces. We found that: (1) forests, shrubs or grasslands, and other croplands could be discriminated from paddy rice during the flooding and transplanting period, and water bodies and buildings could also be discriminated from paddy rice during the growing and harvesting period. (2) Inputting phenological feature data improved mapping accuracy and stability compared with single phenological periods. (3) In the past thirty years, 10.651%, 8.810%, and 5.711% of paddy rice were respectively converted to forests, shrubs or grasslands, and other croplands in the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces. (4) Lower agricultural profits and drought led to problems in identifying the driving mechanisms behind paddy rice distribution changes. This study demonstrates that phenological information can improve the mapping accuracy of rice terraces. It also provides evidence for the change in the size of the rice terrace area and associated driving forces in Southwest China.

TI  - Fine Resolution Classification of New Ice, Young Ice, and First-Year Ice Based on Feature Selection from Gaofen-3 Quad-Polarization SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method of sea ice classification based on feature selection from Gaofen-3 polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations was proposed. The new approach classifies sea ice into four categories: open water (OW), new ice (NI), young ice (YI), and first-year ice (FYI). Seventy parameters that have previously been applied to sea ice studies were re-examined for sea ice classification in the Okhotsk Sea near the melting point on 28 February 2020. The 'separability index (SI)' was used for the selection of optimal features for sea ice classification. Full polarization parameters (the backscatter intensity contains the horizontal transmit-receive intensity (s(hh)(0)), Shannon entropy (SEi), the spherical scattering component of Krogager decomposition (K-s)), and hybrid polarization parameters (horizontal receive intensity(s(rh)(0)), hybrid-pol Shannon entropy (CPSEi), the correlation coefficient (?(rh-rv)) between the s(rh)(0) and s(rv)(0), and the surface scattering component of m - a decomposition as) were determined as the optimal parameters for the different work modes of SAR. The selected parameters were used to classify sea ice by the random forest classifier (RFC), and classification results were validated by manually interpreted ice maps derived from Landsat-8 data. The classification accuracy of OW, NI, YI and FYI reached 95%, 96%, 98% and 85%, respectively.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of using Sentinel-1 and 2 or high-resolution aerial imagery data with Machine Learning and Data Science Techniques to Model Peatland Restoration Progress - a Northern Scotland case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatland is a globally important store of carbon. Peatland restoration efforts are being increasingly undertaken yet effective monitoring of landscape-scale restoration projects has been limited. A particular gap in our understanding is the length of time required before a site reaches the target state. To address this, a classification model based on remote sensing data was developed for a peatland restoration area on blanket bog in northern Scotland, UK, to evaluate whether post-restoration trajectories followed predictable trends over time. The model was trained against a chronosequence of sites within a 20 x 10 km study area that are being restored following drainage and intensive non-native afforestation. Two versions of the model were created to compare the accuracy obtainable from the suite of Sentinel-2 satellite data versus sub-metre resolution aerial imagery from GetMapping (RGB and IR). The Sentinel-2 based model greatly outperformed the aerial imagery-based model. Adding surface slope to the classification did not significantly improve the accuracy of prediction. Prediction of starting and target land covers was very robust, and both the most recent and oldest restoration sites were well predicted spatially. The main uncertainties in the model were within sites of intermediate restoration age, and sites which underwent additional treatments after the initial restoration. Using standard vegetation and wetness indices as indicators, it was possible to track the progression of areas that had been felled and rewetted towards the spectral signal of the control blanket bog locations. A further study examined the use of multiple years of satellite data (2015-2021) and including Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, and confirmed the findings obtained with only a single climatically average year, and furthermore examined the efficacy of different restoration methods. We observed consistent trends of restoration sites beginning to resemble the target hydrologically and ecologically functional blanket bog state after 10-20 years post intervention.

AB  - Wetlands are a critical component of the landscape for climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, and human health and prosperity. Keeping an eye on wetland vegetation is crucial due to it playing a major role in the planet's carbon cycle and ecosystem management. By measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) emitted by plants, we can get a precise understanding of the current state and photosynthetic activity. In this study, we applied the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm to map ChF in the Biebrza Valley, which has a unique ecosystem in Europe for peatlands, as well as highly diversified flora and fauna. Our results revealed the advantages of using a set of classifiers derived from EO Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite image mosaics to accurately map the spatio-temporal distribution of ChF in a terrestrial landscape. The validation proved that the XGBoost algorithm is quite accurate in estimating ChF with a good determination of 0.71 and least bias of 0.012. The precision of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements is reliant upon determining the optimal S-2 satellite overpass time, which is influenced by the developmental stage of the plants at various points during the growing season. Finally, the model performance results indicated that biophysical factors are characterized by greenness- and leaf-pigment-related spectral indices. However, utilizing vegetation indices based on extended periods of remote sensing data that better capture land phenology features can improve the accuracy of mapping chlorophyll fluorescence.

TI  - Wastewater concentrations of human influenza, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and seasonal coronavirus nucleic-acids during the COVID-19 pandemic: a surveillance study
T2  - LANCET MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Respiratory disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; however, surveillance for circulating respiratory viruses is passive and biased. Wastewater-based epidemiology has been used to understand SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection rates at a community level but has not been used to investigate other respiratory viruses. We aimed to use wastewater-based epidemiology to understand community viral respiratory infection occurrence.Methods A retrospective wastewater-based epidemiology surveillance study was carried out at a large wastewater treatment plant located in California, USA. Using droplet digital RT-PCR, we measured RNA concentrations of influenza A and influenza B viruses, RSV A and RSV B, parainfluenza (1-4) viruses, rhinovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, and metapneumovirus in wastewater solids three times per week for 17 months (216 samples) between Feb 1, 2021, and June 21, 2022. Novel probe-based RT-PCR assays for non-influenza viral targets were developed and validated. We compared viral RNA concentrations to positivity rates for viral infections from clinical specimens submitted to California Sentinel Clinical Laboratories (sentinel laboratories) to assess concordance between the two datasets.Findings We detected RNA from all tested viruses in wastewater solids. Human rhinovirus (median concentration 4300 [0-9500] copies per gram dry weight) and seasonal human coronaviruses (35 000 [17 000-56 000]) were found at the highest concentrations. Concentrations of viral RNA correlated significantly and positively with positivity rates of associated viral diseases from sentinel laboratories (tau 0 center dot 32-0 center dot 57, p<0 center dot 0009); the only exceptions were influenza B and RSV A, which were rarely detected in wastewater solids. Measurements from wastewater indicated coronavirus OC43 dominated the seasonal human coronavirus infections whereas parainfluenza 3 dominated among parainfluenza infections during the study period. Concentrations of all tested viral RNA decreased noticeably after the omicron BA.1 surge suggesting a connection between changes in human behaviour during the surge and transmission of all respiratory viruses.Interpretation Wastewater-based epidemiology can be used to obtain information on circulation of respiratory viruses at a localised, community level without the need to test many individuals because a single sample of wastewater represents the entire contributing community. Results from wastewater can be available within 24 h of sample collection, generating real time information to inform public health responses, clinical decision making, and individual behaviour modifications.Copyright (c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - The Effects of Different Types of Classism on Psychological Outcomes: Preliminary Findings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - In interpersonal relationships, people make assumptions about others' social class standing and interact with them based on these assumptions, which constitutes classism. Classism has an adverse impact on people's overall functioning, although scholarly attention on the unique impact of different types of classism, as proposed the Social Class Worldview Model-Revised (SCMW-R; Liu, 2011), has lagged behind. To address this gap in the literature, we explored how different types of classism (i.e., downward, upward, and lateral) can account for unique variance as predictors of psychological outcomes. Overall, our findings indicate that there is a unique impact of different types of classism on psychological outcomes (i.e., stress, anxiety, well-being, attitudes toward mental health care), beyond social status and overall discrimination alone.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes of evapotranspiration over the Zoige Wetland Basin in China using TSEB and GF satellites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zoige wetland located in the eastern margin of the Tibet Plateau, is very important for the runoff regulation and biodiversity in the Yellow River basin. Due to the large non-uniformity of the alpine wetland surface, the use of higher spatial resolution satellite remote sensing data is essential to match or validate the results of ground observation. The land evapotranspiration in this survey was estimated by using the GF-4 satellite data from 2016 to 2020 into the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, and the estimated evapotranspiration is compared to the ground observation. The results show that: (1) the regression analysis of the actual observed evapotranspiration and the evapotranspiration estimated by the TSEB model shows that the actual evapotranspiration and the evapotranspiration calculated by the TSEB model have a good positive linear correlation (R-2 > 0.8) at the Maqu observation site and the Huahu wetland observation site. Therefore, the accuracy of the evapotranspiration calculated by the TSEB model is high. (2) The spatio-temporal distribution of evapotranspiration and relevant land surface variables is generally characterized by high in the southeast and low in the northwest over the Zoige wetland basin. (3) The mean daily evapotranspiration for different GF-4 observation over the Zoige area is as follows: 1.8 mm on 8 April 2018, 3.6 mm on 20 July 2016, 1.4 mm on 29 November 2020 and 0.9 mm on 15 December 2017, and the magnitudes of evapotranspiration of the different surface are as follows: waterbody > grassland > bare land. (4) The histogram of the frequency distribution of evapotranspiration show that 3.2-4.0 mm on 20 July 2016, 0-0.8 mm on 15 December 2017, 0.8-1.6 mm on 8 April 2018 and 1.6-2.4 mm on 29 November 2020 are the maximum evapotranspiration range over the Zoige wetlands area.

TI  - UK long-term monitoring dataset: assessing factors affecting biomarkers commonly used in environmental programmes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term programmes like the UK Clean Seas Environmental Monitoring Programme (CSEMP) rely on biological effects techniques, including biomarkers, to assess if chemical pollutants are affecting sentinel species in the aquatic environment. In this study, we have applied mixed and fixed effect linear models to the long-term CSEMP dataset (2005-2018) to evaluate if factors such as region (location), sex, age, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor (CF), contribute to the variability observed in the levels of 3 well established biomarkers (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in muscle-AChE, induction of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase-EROD and presence of biliary 1-hydroxypyrene-1-OH pyrene) used to monitor biological effects of contaminants in dab (Limanda limanda) around UK waters. Regional differences (location) were a significant explanatory variable for the 3 biomarkers. Substantial differences were found in regional average muscle AChE activity, overall indicating the East Coast regions as likely more impacted by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. organophosphates and carbamates). We report for the first time that, while accounting for region, sex and gonadosomatic index are significant predictors of muscle acetylcholinesterase isoform in dab (R-2 = 0.13-0.15), and therefore advise the future analysis of this marker should be done by sex when reporting for marine environmental purposes. Dab condition factor is also a significant predictor for both enzymatic markers (AChE and EROD) but not for 1-OH pyrene. Sex and age, and their interaction, were the strongest variables (R-2 = 0.46) influencing hepatic EROD, showing that although overall females had higher hepatic EROD, male dab hepatic EROD increased with age. Correlations between the three biomarkers might assist in discerning types of prevalent regional contamination over the studied period. Our results highlight the factors to account for when assessing if environmental contamination is contributing to the responses of these 3 biomarkers in dab, and other flatfish species, used in marine environmental monitoring programmes.

TI  - Links between light availability and spectral properties of forest floor in European forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing using spectral data has been commonly applied to retrieve tree layer properties while the monitoring of forest floor remains a less studied topic. We investigated the links between light availability at forest floor, and forest floor's spectral reflectance properties (350-2500 nm) and fractional cover across boreal and temperate Europe. We hypothesized that tree canopy structure (and thus, light availability at forest floor) is linked not only to the vegetation composition of forest floor, as has been shown previously, but also to forest floor's spectral reflectance properties, and that these relationships differ between forest biomes. Data were collected in situ from a total of 67 forest stands in southern boreal, hemiboreal, temperate floodplain, and temperate mountain sites. The variation of light availability at forest floor was linked to both the forest floor's composition and spectral reflectance properties. Each study site exhibited site-specific spectral features and a different mean reflectance spectrum. Openness in tree canopies was related to an increase in the fractional cover of vascular plants and to a decrease of plant litter, consequently enhancing the forest floors' spectral absorptance features in the red and shortwave-infrared wavelengths, as well as reflectance in the near-infrared region. Also, the variations of normalized difference index values and red edge positions as functions light availability at forest floor and forest floor's composition were different for each site. Our results suggest that incorporating biomespecific relationships between tree canopy structure and forest floor reflectance properties would improve interpretation of optical remote sensing data. The measurement data are openly available.

TI  - Cloud removal using scattering model and evaluation via semi-realistic simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal is an essential task in remote sensing data analysis. As the image sensors are distant from the earth ground, it is likely that part of the area of interests is covered by cloud. Moreover, the atmosphere in between creates a constant haze layer upon the acquired images. To recover the ground image, we propose to use scattering model for temporal sequence of images of any scene in the framework of low rank and sparse models. We further develop its variant, which is much faster and yet more accurate. To measure the performance of different methods objectively, we develop a semi-realistic simulation method to produce cloud cover so that various methods can be quantitatively analysed, which enables detailed study of many aspects of cloud removal algorithms, including verifying the effectiveness of proposed models in comparison with the state-of-the-arts, including deep learning models, and addressing the long standing problem of the determination of regularization parameters. Theoretic analysis on the range of the sparsity regularization parameter is provided and verified numerically.

TI  - <i>Portunus pelagicus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758) as a Sentinel Species to Assess Trace Metal Occurrence: A Case Study of Kuwait Waters (Northwestern Arabian Gulf)
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal pollution can adversely impact marine life, such as crabs, which can accumulate it in different organs and potentially transfer and biomagnify along the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. This study aimed to examine the concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in sediment, water, and crab tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, and carapace) of the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus in the coastal areas of Kuwait, northwestern Arabian Gulf. Samples were collected from Shuwaikh Port, Shuaiba Port, and Al-Khiran areas. The accumulation of metals in crabs were higher in the carapace > gill > digestive gland, and the highest metal concentration was found in crabs collected from Shuwaikh > Shuaiba > Al-Khiran. The metal concentrations in the sediments were in the order Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Zn was the highest metal concentration detected in marine water sampled from the Al-Khiran Area, whereas the lowest metal was Cd sampled in water from the Shuwaikh Area. The results of this study validate the marine crab P. pelagicus as a relevant sentinel and prospective bioindicator for evaluating heavy metal pollution in marine ecosystems.

TI  - Mapping fine-spatial-resolution vegetation spring phenology from individual Landsat images using a convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and mapping vegetation dynamics using remote sensing data are essential for our understanding of land surface processes. Most current satellite-based methods process vegetation index time-series data from a series of images to retrieve key points that correspond to vegetation phenophases. As deep learning approaches have been found to be powerful in processing individual images, we tested the applicability of convolutional neural network (CNN) in mapping vegetation growth days (VGD) and the start of growing season (SOS) from each Landsat image at fine-spatial-resolution. To provide references for both model training and testing, we applied the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to fuse image pairs of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for four Landsat tiles in China. We then applied a first derivative method to retrieve VGD for the fused satellite data at fine-spatial-resolution. The CNN model was trained using each fused individual image as the model inputs and derived VGD as the targets. The trained model was further used to map VGD from individual Landsat image. The result could match the reference map well as indicated by the evaluation metrics. In terms of VGD, the method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.85 and a root mean squared error of 8.17 days. In terms of SOS, the method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.75 and a root mean squared error of 4.09 days. Compared with existing methods that require time series of satellite data spanning the entire growth cycles to retrieve phenological metrics, this study provides an alternative method to map VGD as well as SOS using individual Landsat image. Our study highlights the power of deep learning models in extracting phenological features from individual remote sensing images. Researchers can use our methods to predict near real-time VGD and SOS in the future.

TI  - Study of the relationship between urbanization and environment in the Jiulong river basin based on coupling coordination degree model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has placed the sustainable development of some watershed ecosystems in jeopardy. In order to achieve sustainable urban development, it is vital to identify the coupling mechanisms between urbanization and the ecological environment quality. This study establishes indicators to evaluate the Jiulong River Basin's urbanization and ecological environment systems. These are utilized to analyze spatial and temporal changes and build a coupling coordination degree model. This research investigates the level of development coordination between urbanization and the ecological environment quality in the basin. The data sources include nighttime lighting and Landsat data from 2000 to 2020. The findings indicated the following: 1) Urbanization levels in the basin rise annually, and the years 2010-2020 represent a stage of high urbanization growth. In addition, the development levels are spatially heterogeneous, with high levels in the south and low levels in the north. 2) The ecological environment quality category for the basin is generally Excellent; however, many facets of the climate and human activity drastically lowered this grade in 2005. 3) In the basin, there is a basic coordination relationship between urbanization and environmental quality, but the number of cities falling into the moderate imbalance category has grown. 4) Increasing the urbanization level raises the coordination between urbanization and the ecological environment more than improving environmental quality, but antagonistic effects make it necessary to strengthen the protection of the ecological environment alongside economic development. From the viewpoint of counties, this study examines the long-term interactions between the ecological environment and urbanization in Fujian Province, China. Recommendations for balancing urban development and environmental concerns in coastal watersheds are presented, providing references to the fact that the future of this area of China can be sustainable.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil salinity based on the Google Earth Engine platform with multitemporal synthetic remote sensing images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately analyzing the spatial distribution of salinity at the regional scale is crucial for regional sustainable development. Currently, there are no reliable approaches for mapping salinity due to the substantial spatial variability of soil salinity. However, remote sensing technology has been successfully used to monitor soil properties in various locations. This research investigates an approach to choose the most appropriate remote sensing time window using a cloud computing platform and synthesizes multitemporal remote sensing images for high spatial resolution digital mapping of salinization at the regional scale. The research site for this experiment is the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis in Xinjiang, China. In the first stage, we screen the Landsat-8 surface reflectance datasets for four-time windows: April-October, May-September, June-August multitemporal, and July single -date images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. Then, we synthesize images based on mini-mum, maximum, mean, and median values and construct multiple spectral indices. We completed model training and digital mapping in the second stage using a geemap. For the first time, we used geemap to integrate a local scikit-learn machine learning library with GEE to train a machine learning model. Next, we performed salinity prediction and mapping based on the best data set. This study demonstrates that (1) Various environmental variables contribute differently to modeling in the same time window. Additionally, these variables exhibit variation across different time windows. However, certain indices, including clay index (CLEX), near infrared (NIR), difference vegetation index (DVI), carbonate index (CAEX), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), canopy response salinity (CRSI), and elevation, demonstrate stable contributions across different time windows. (2) Employing GEE to choose the suitable time window for synthesizing remote sensing images has a better pre-diction effect compared to single-date image prediction accuracy. Through experimental comparison, the best time window is May-September. (3) The mean synthesis approach from May to September exhibits the best performance in the model, while the median synthesis approach exhibits stable performance in the other two individual time windows. (4) Combining scikit-learn with GEE using Geemap improves model optimization and enhances the mapping performance. This study broadens the application of GEE in soil mapping and improves salinity prediction using multitemporal synthetic pictures with time frames.

Pictorial representations instead of written reports on prior learning experiences with science were used as a data-gathering tool. In this study, we incorporated worldview theory and bilingual and cultural border crossing constructs as the lens to interpret participants' reports on their personal conceptions about science learning. Implications of this study invite science teacher educators to consider the lived experiences and histories of their preservice teachers as crucial conditions for effective preparation of future teachers working with minority students.

TI  - Mind the Like-Minded. The Role of Social Identity in Prosocial Crowdfunding
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Current social challenges have increased the interest in globally spread collective actions, especially those taking place in virtual space. Crowdfunding is one form of online activism that has recently gained importance. Although research conducted so far indicates the significance of social motives among participants of crowdfunding campaigns, knowledge about the psychosocial mechanisms involved in its effectiveness is limited. This article attempts to reinforce the position of crowdfunding as one of the forms of collective action and to expand knowledge about possible psychosocial factors that could shape participation in crowdfunding campaigns. In three pre-registered studies (N = 823), we found that the social identity based on a shared worldview positively correlated with the intention to participate in prosocial crowdfunding. Moreover, the relationship between opinion-based group identity and collective action varied depending on participation type (predicted vs. experienced engagement in a campaign). In other words, when people gather in communities built around shared opinions on a given social issue, they develop a sense of community, which can translate into activities for the benefit of the group such as supporting crowdfunding campaigns. However, in the case of actual behaviour, unlike with the declaration of participation, the strength of the relationship with social identity significantly diminishes. The results are discussed in relation to the theory of collective action.

TI  - Impact assessment of urbanization on vegetation net primary productivity: A case study of the core development area in central plains urban agglomeration, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization process has a negative or positive impact on vegetation growth. Net primary productivity (NPP) is an effective indicator to characterize vegetation growth status. Taking the core development area of the Central Plains urban agglomeration as the study area, we estimated the NPP and its change trend in the past four decades using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and statistical analysis based on meteorological and multi-source remote sensing data. Meanwhile, combined with the urbanization impact framework, we further analyzed urbanization's direct and indirect impact on NPP. The results showed that the urban area increased by 2688 km(2) during a high-speed urbanization process from 1983 to 2019. As a result of the intense urbanization process, a continuous NPP decrease (direct impact) can be seen, which aggravated along with the acceleration of the urban expansion, and the mean value of direct impact was 130.84 g C center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). Meanwhile, urbanization also had a positive impact on NPP (indirect impact). The indirect impact showed an increasing trend during urbanization with a mean value of 10.91 g C center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). The indirect impact was mainly related to temperature in climatic factors. The indirect impact has a seasonal heterogeneity, and high-temperature environments of urban areas are more effective in promoting vegetation growth in autumn and winter than in summer. Among different cities, high-speed development cities have higher indirect impact values than medium's and low's because of better ecological construction. This study is of great significance for understanding the impact of urbanization on vegetation growth in the Central Plains urban agglomeration area, supporting urban greening plans, and building sustainable and resilient urban agglomerations.

TI  - Estimating Forest Above-Ground Biomass in Central Amazonia Using Polarimetric Attributes of ALOS/PALSAR Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are essential to understand forest structure and plan forest inventories with the purpose of natural resource management and environmental conservation efforts. We developed a method for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) from power and phase-radar attributes in L-band images. The model was based on the variables "P-v" (from Freeman-Durden decomposition) and "s degrees(HH)", complemented by the attributes of Touzi decomposition "a(S)(2)", "t(m)", " f(S)(3)", and " f(S)(2)". The analyses demonstrated the contribution of volumetric, multiple, and direct scattering resulting from the interaction between the signal and the random structure of canopies and their forest biomass. The proposed model had good predictive capacity and a positive correlation (R-2 = 0.67 and = 0.81, respectively), with Syx = 56.9 Mg ha(-1) and a low average estimation error of 7.5% at R-2 = 0.81 in the validation. An additional exploratory analysis of the parallel polarimetric responses did not reveal a defined pattern for the different phytophysiognomies-although all indicated a predominance of multiple and/or volumetric scattering. This fact can be related to the floristic and structural variation in the primary forest units, the degree of human intervention in legal logging, and the differences among succession stages.

TI  - Performances between the FY-4A/GIIRS and FY-4B/GIIRS Long-Wave InfraRed (LWIR) channels under clear-sky and all-sky conditions
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The observation-minus-background (O - B) bias characteristics are compared for the Long-Wave InfraRed (LWIR) channels of the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on board Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) and Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) satellites under clear-sky and all-sky conditions. Under the clear-sky condition, the data quality of the FY-4B/GIIRS is better than that of the FY-4A/GIIRS. Specifically, the standard deviations (<1 K) of the O - B values for FY-4B/GIIRS LWIR channels are smaller than those (>1 K) of the FY-4A/GIIRS, especially in carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) absorption bands. The diurnal variations of the mean O - B biases for the O3 band of the FY-4B/GIIRS are less than those of FY-4A/GIIRS. To our surprise, the diurnal variations of O - B biases for the FY-4B/GIIRS and FY-4A/GIIRS channels show an obvious antiphase characteristic in the CO2 band, which could be caused by diurnal environmental field variations from the different geostationary (GEO) platforms. In addition, the FY-4B/GIIRS channel 7 (703.75 cm(-1)) has smaller pixel-dependent biases than those of FY-4A/GIIRS. Under the all-sky condition, the observation and cloudy simulation (Bcloudy) for channels 7 (703.75 cm(-1)), 36 (721.875 cm(-1)), and 320 (900 cm(-1)) of the FY-4B/GIIRS are more consistent than those of FY-4A/GIIRS with smaller root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), which also indicates a better observation quality in the cloudy area.

TI  - Towards developing comparable optical and SAR remote sensing inundation mapping with hydrodynamic modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inundation mapping is an essential part of environmental monitoring, flood disaster management and risk mitigation. There are many earth observation sensors that can provide spatial information about inundation extent at different times. However, these extents need to be comparable to provide an accurate and consistent estimate of a flood's progression. Monitoring inundation extent around the peak of a flood event is important because it captures the hazardous period during a large flood event, and it identifies connections between off-stream waterholes and flood waters for environmental monitoring. This paper presents results from a study comparing near-coincident flood inundation maps derived from optical (Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-2 and VIIRS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1 and NovaSAR-1) remote sensing imagery. We also compare all inundation maps derived from remote sensing data with near-coincident hydrodynamic (HD) modelling. The study was conducted for the Fitzroy floodplain in Western Australia, a large, complex and remotely located river basin. The results show that optical remote sensing data have average F1 scores ranging from 0.57 to 0.65 when compared to the HD model results, with Landsat and MODIS performing best. Sentinel-1 and NovaSAR-1 SAR have a poor agreement (average F1 score of 0.31 and 0.35 respectively) when compared to the HD model results, particularly within scattered vegetation adjacent to the river channel, with better results in open water on the floodplain and in the river. If comparisons are made only during the peak flood stage, the F1 scores improve for the optical data (0.61 up to 0.8). Comparisons of the remote sensing inundation maps show that the optical data are suitable for interchangeable mapping during large flood events.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation and prediction of ecological quality based on remote sensing ecological index - a case study of Zhanjiang City, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant portion of Zhanjiang City's ecological land areas have been reduced as a result of the city's growing urbanization, which has caused the city's ecological environment quality to decline. In order to monitor the quality of the ecological environment, the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) is frequently utilized. In this study, the Landsat series satellite images from 2000, 2005, 2009, 2015, and 2020 were used. The Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wetness (WET), Normalized Differential Build-up and bare Soil Index (NDBSI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were the four indicators utilized in the RSEI to quantitatively evaluate the changes in ecological environment quality in Zhanjiang City. The results are as follows. (1) The mean RSEI values for the years 2000, 2005, 2009, 2015, and 2020 are, respectively, 0.579, 0.597, 0.597, 0.607, and 0.601. In addition, the overall ecological environment of Zhanjiang is very good. In terms of spatial differences, the ecological environment quality in the central and southeastern parts of Zhanjiang is significantly higher than that in other areas, while the ecological environment quality in its coastal town areas is much worse. The lower RSEI index of developed land in coastal areas proves that the RSEI index can reflect the deterioration of the urban environment in coastal areas from 2000 to 2020. Therefore, the RSEI can be used to evaluate the ecological environment quality of Zhanjiang City. (2) The ecological environment changes in the study area are "substantially better," "better," "no change," "worse," and "much worse," respectively, according to the difference in RSEI processed between 2000 and 2020. These changes were 38.38, 6,047, 13.93, 6.65, and 34.58%. The percentage of ecological environmental quality in Zhanjiang City that has become better is higher than that has become worse. This indicates that the quality of ecological environment in Zhanjiang City has improved between 2000 and 2020. (3) The regression produced the following equation for the association, which was significant at the 0.053 level: 100*Rsei = 154.69-1.18*IS(R = 0.66). The remote sensing ecological index for Zhanjiang in 2035 is 0.488 when the city's planned population and area are added together.

TI  - Random forest method for analysis of remote sensing inversion of aboveground biomass and grazing intensity of grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) and grazing intensity (GI) and their distribution in space is of great significance to grassland management and eco-conservation. Remote-sensing technology is widely applied, but it is difficult to measure accurately when monitoring GI. In this study, the neural network, random forest and statistical function models of the relationship between Landsat NDVI and AGB were constructed by field survey and literature data collection in Inner Mongolia grassland, China. By comparing the accuracy among the three models, we constructed a remote-sensing retrieving model of grass AGB. We also estimated the grassland AGB during the peak growing season (August) for Inner Mongolia. Frequency histograms were then made to identify AGB thresholds under four GI levels (light or ungrazed, moderate grazing, overgrazing and extreme grazing) for each of three grassland types (meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe). This study shows that the random forest model simulates grass AGB more accurately than other models. The spatial distribution of AGB in Inner Mongolia grasslands showed a tendency of decreasing from southeast to northwest, with an increasing trend in the last 10 years. The four GI levels in 2021 accounted for 18%, 25%, 36% and 21% of the grasslands in Inner Mongolia, respectively, and over the last 10 years the GI first improved and then deteriorated. This study provides a guideline to remote monitoring for grassland AGB and GI, and supplies scientific support for sustainable management and grassland restoration of large-scale grasslands.

TI  - Mapping tea plantation area using phenology algorithm, time-series Sentinel-2 and Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea plants are evergreen broad-leaved perennial shrubs, and their spectral characteristics are very similar to those of other evergreen vegetation, making it difficult to distinguish them. Currently, the most commonly used method of tea plantation extraction is machine learning, which classifies tea plantation through various feature combinations and algorithms. The disadvantage of these methods is that they require a large number of local training samples, making it challenging to produce an accurate model applicable to a large region. Furthermore, complex feature combinations and indicators may result in over-fitting, reducing the accuracy of the results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new algorithm suitable for tea plantation extraction in extensive regions. This paper uses Shihe District, Henan Province, China as a case in 2019, combined with Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A/B images, and develops a new phenological-based algorithm to extract the tea plantation area. Firstly, we generated an evergreen vegetation map. Secondly, based on high-quality time series curves, the tea plant growth period was divided into seven parts to extract phenological indicators for classification. Finally, the tea plantation in the study area was extracted on a per-pixel basis. The overall accuracy of the algorithm is 87.59%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.80. This study demonstrates the potential of the phenology-algorithms in extracting tea plantation areas and provides an advanced scheme and scientific basis for extracting tea plantation in other years, and also offers a reference for identifying tea plantation in other regions. Additionally, this paper generated a map of classified phenological indicators to provide guidance for monitoring tea plants growth.

TI  - Approaches to assessing the daily average ground surface soil heat flux on a regional scale over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The daily average ground surface soil heat flux (G0_daily) has been widely applied in land surface models. The accuracy of modeling G0_daily greatly impacts the estimation of the evapotranspiration and heat and moisture exchanges between the atmosphere and ground surface in frozen ground regions. We propose two methods for estimating G0_daily over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP): the combination method (CM) and the sine method (SM). The instantaneous surface soil heat flux (G0_ins) is estimated at multiple times per day using the CM, and then, G0_daily is obtained. The SM simulates G0_daily by estimating G0_ins during the satellite transit based on the diurnal variation in the sinusoidal curves of G0_ins under clear-sky conditions. For G0_ins, the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) of the CM are more than 10 W/m2 lower and 0.12 higher than those of the surface energy balance system (SEBS), respectively. For G0_daily, at the four sites (TGLMS, Naqu, Biru, and Nierong), the RMSE and the correlation coefficient (R) values of the CM are better than those of the SM by -0.86 W/m2, 9.04 W/m2, 4.33 W/m2, and 2.55 W/m2 and 0.19, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.08, respectively. The CM is applicable under all weather conditions and multi-period and multi-parameter observations throughout a day. Due to the principle of the SM, it can only simulate G0_daily when the satellite observes at least once each in the daytime and nighttime under clear-sky conditions. The SM overcomes the shortcomings of the CM, i.e., the requirements of complex input parameters and a large data volume. The advantage of the high spatial resolution of polar-orbiting satellite remotely sensed data (such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data) is given full play by the SM.

TI  - Mapping understory plant communities in deciduous forests from Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understory plant communities are an integral component of deciduous forests, playing a vital role in the overall health of the ecosystem. However, remote sensing of understory plant communities is challenging due to the obstruction by the forest canopy. In this study, we proposed an automated dense Sentinel-2 time series-based approach for understory plant communities and created maps of four understory classes (i.e., native shrubs of greenbrier and mountain laurel, and invasive shrubs of barberry and the assemblage of mixed invasive) at 10 m resolution in Connecticut's deciduous forests in 2020. A harmonic time series model and three years of Sentinel-2 time series from 2019 to 2021 were used to classify understory species based on their unique, intra-annual phenology characteristics. The time series model coefficients captured the subtle phenology differences and created synthetic cloud-free images within a short temporal window in the spring prior to canopy leaf-on (hereafter called "observation window"). During the observation window, Sentinel-2 data penetrated the deciduous overstory canopy and observed the unique trajectories of different understory species due to their phenology differences. We also calculated spatial texture features (i.e., mean, second moment, and contrast from gray level co-occurrence matrix) based on the synthetic images created within the observation window to capture the different conditions of leaf growth and distinct spatial patterns within deciduous forests. By using the spectral, temporal, and spatial features as input variables from dense Sentinel-2 data, auxiliary data (i.e., LiDAR and soil drainage layer), a random forest classifier, and a new strategy to iteratively select representative sample (namely ISRS), understory species maps were created with an overall accuracy of approximately 93%, and the user's and producer's accuracies varied from 39% to 99% for the three mapped understory species and one assemblage of species. The proposed method created an accurate binary map of understory presence with an overall accuracy of 95%, a producer's accuracy of 84%, and a user's accuracy of 68%. Additionally, we separated the invasive (i.e. barberry and mixed invasive of multi-flora rose, oriental bittersweet, honeysuckle, winged euonymus, and autumn olive) and native (greenbrier and mountain laurel) species with an overall accuracy of 94%. We estimated that the invasive species cover an area of 649.33 +/- 140.59 km(2), which occupied a large proportion (similar to 53%) of the shrub understory in Connecticut's deciduous forests.

TI  - Prevalence, aetiology, vaccination coverage and spatio-temporal pattern among patients admitted with acute bacterial meningitis to the sentinel hospital surveillance network in Yemen, 2014-20, before and during the civil war
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a serious health issue in Yemen where civil war, which continues unabated, has crippled the healthcare system. We conducted a nationwide retrospective observational study in Yemeni sentinel hospitals to identify the prevalence, aetiology, vaccination coverage and spatio-temporal pattern of ABM in children aged <5 years before and during the civil war, 2014-20. Methods Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from hospitalized children and were analysed macroscopically for appearance and microscopically by Gram stain and white blood cell count. Culture and latex agglutination tests were performed. Data on the prevalence of and vaccination coverage for ABM were obtained from the Ministry of Health. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the annual percent change (APC) of ABM prevalence and vaccination coverage. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the association between ABM prevalence and vaccination coverage. Results In total, 11 339 hospitalized children had suspected cases of ABM (prevalence, 40.07/100 000 of the whole Yemeni population) and 2.6% (293/11 339) of suspected ABM cases were confirmed (prevalence, 1.04/100 000 of the whole Yemeni population). The dominant pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The civil war reduced the Hib and pneumococcal vaccination coverage (APC = -1.92), reaching its lowest (79.5%) in 2018. The prevalence of suspected ABM increased (APC = 3.46), reaching its maximum (6.08/100 000 of the whole Yemeni population) in 2019. The conflict inversely correlated with the ABM prevalence and vaccination coverage (Pearson correlation coefficient (r), -0.69 to -0.53). Ta'izz region, which was severely affected by the civil war, had the highest prevalence of suspected ABM (120.90/100 000 of the whole Yemeni population) and lowest vaccination coverage (60%). Conclusions The civil war had a negative impact on vaccination coverage and coincided with increasing prevalence of ABM in Yemen. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the dominant causative pathogen.

TI  - Canopy composition drives variability in urban growing season length more than the heat island effect
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The elevated heat of urban areas compared to their surroundings makes humid temperate cities a useful preview of future climate effects on natural forest phenology. The utility of this proxy rests on the expectation that trees in urban areas alter their phenology in response to warmer site conditions in spring and fall. However, it is possible that apparent lengthening of the growing season is instead governed by human-driven tree species selection and plant functional type (PFT; trees, shrubs, turfgrass) heterogeneity typical of managed landscapes. Without the use of highly spatially and temporally resolved remote sensing data, the roles of tree taxonomy and local site characteristics (e.g., impervious cover) in controlling phenology remain confounded. To understand the drivers of earlier start of season (SOS) and later end of season (EOS) among urban trees, we estimated individual tree phenology using >130 high-resolution satellite images per year (2018-2020) for similar to 10,000 species-labeled trees in Washington, DC. We found that species identity alone accounted for 4x more variability in the timing of SOS and EOS compared with a tree's planting location characteristics. Additionally, the urban mix of PFTs may be more responsible for apparent advances in SOS (by between 1.8 +/- 1.3 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 days) than heat per se. The results of this study caution against associating longer growing seasons in cities-observed in moderate to coarse resolution remote sensing imagery-to within-species phenological plasticity and demonstrate the power of high-resolution satellite data for tracking tree phenology in biodiverse environments.

TI  - Multiple Sentinels in a Cooperative Breeder Synchronize Rather Than Coordinate Gazing
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinels can detect predators and rivals early by monitoring their surroundings from vantage points. Multiple sentinels in a group may reduce the perceived predation risk by diluting the risk and increasing collective detection, especially if sentinels monitor different areas at the same time. We investigated sentinel behavior in groups of the Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma caerulescens). Sentinels in this species turn their heads frequently to monitor different areas for threats. As predicted, we found that sentinels turned their heads less frequently in the presence of other sentinels. Multiple sentinels, however, tended to gaze in the same direction at the same time more often than predicted by chance alone. Gaze synchronization reduces the efficiency of collective detection by reducing visual coverage at any one time at the group level. Despite the benefits of the presence of other sentinels, our results highlight the limits to collective detection when multiple individuals are vigilant at the same time.

TI  - Estimating river discharge from rainfall satellite data through simple statistical models
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative knowledge of river discharge measurements is essential for understanding coastal and estuarine dynamics and salinity variations. However, direct measurements are scarce for a large portion of rivers in Brazil. In this study, five simple models based on remote sensing and local rainfall datasets (MERGE) for the Ribeira de Iguape catchment are used to estimate the Valo Grande Channel (VGC) discharge on the southeastern coast of Brazil. These models use linear, quadratic, exponential, and two different multiple linear regression methods. The predicted VGC discharge time series resulting from each model is compared with the estimated time series based on in situ data from the Water and Electric Energy Department (DAEE in Portuguese). The estimated time series presented reasonable results, with skills varying from 0.84 to 0.92 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indices varying from 0.54 to 0.75, with the highest values corresponding to the multiple linear regression models. This methodology allowed us to reproduce longer time series at a daily frequency, as well as monthly averages between 2000 and 2020.

TI  - NDVI-Based Assessment of Land Degradation Trends in Balochistan, Pakistan, and Analysis of the Drivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation destroys human habitats, and vegetation is a marker reflecting land degradation. In this article, the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, which has a fragile ecological environment, was selected as a typical case to analyze its land degradation over 21 years. Relevant studies that used the NDVI and remote sensing data to monitor land degradation already existed. Based on the data product of MODIS, this study obtained the spatio-temporal trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes from 2000 to 2020 using the sen+ Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Hurst index and analyzed the driving factors of land degradation and restoration by employing the multiple stepwise regression method. The residual analysis method was an effective tool for distinguishing between anthropogenic and climatic impacts, given that not all regions have a significant correlation between the NDVI and rainfall. The main climatic drivers of the NDVI were derived based on the Geodetector analysis and stripped of the main climatic factors by residual analysis to explore the influence of anthropogenic factors on the NDVI. The results show the following: (1) Balochistan is dominated by land restoration. Land restoration is mainly dominated by climate as well as both climate and human factors, and land degradation is mainly dominated by climate and human factors. (2) The Geodetector-based study found high correlations between the NDVI and TMP, MAP, AET and PET, complementing most previous residual analyses that considered only precipitation and temperature. In Balochistan, TMP, AET, PET and MAP were the dominant climatic factors affecting the spatial distribution of the NDVI; TMP with MAP and TMP with AET were the main interactive factors in the spatial distribution of the NDVI. (3) The article quantifies the impact of the anthropogenic drivers on land degradation. Human activities positively influenced the NDVI in 91.02% of the area and negatively influenced it in 8.98% of the area. (4) The overall trend of the NDVI was mainly stable, with stronger improvement than degradation, and showed strong persistence. The above findings enrich our understanding of the climatic impacts of land degradation and human impacts in arid or semi-arid regions and provide a scientific basis for ecological engineering to achieve ecological conservation and quality development in Balochistan, Pakistan.

TI  - Between the Placement Problem and the Reconciliation Problem. Philosophical Naturalism Today
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific naturalism-the conception according to which the natural sciences, and possibly physics alone, set the limits of ontology and epistemology-is characterized by a strong monistic tendency. For this reason, all versions of scientific naturalism face the so-called "placement problem", which concerns the features of the ordinary view of the world that, at least prima facie, do not fit into the scientific view of the world (think of consciousness, moral properties, free will, and intentionality). To address this problem, scientific naturalists use three strategies: reductionism, eliminativism, and mysterianism-none of which, it is argued, produces satisfying results. Liberal naturalism opts instead for a pluralistic attitude in both ontology and epistemology but accepts a constraint according to which one should accept no entity or explanation that is incompatible with the scientific worldview. Liberal naturalism faces the "reconciliation problem", which concerns the relationship between the scientific and the ordinary views of the world once one denies ontological and epistemological priority to either of them. Three strategies for addressing this problem are presented: according to the first, the ordinary worldview and the scientific world are categorically distinct; according to the second, the former emerges from the latter; according to the third, between them there is a relation of global supervenience. Other objections to liberal naturalism are finally presented and addressed.

TI  - Time-series analysis of Sentinel-1/2 data for flood detection using a discrete global grid system and seasonal decomposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated flood detection using earth observation data is a crucial task for efficient flood disaster man-agement. Current solutions to identify flooded areas usually rely on calculating the difference between new observations and static, pre-calculated water extents derived by either single acquisitions or timely aggregated products. Such pre-calculated datasets, however, lack representation of real-world seasonality and short-term changes in trend.In this paper we present a complete workflow to automatically detect hydrological extreme events and their spatial extent, which automatically adapts to local seasonality and trend. For that we rely on a novel combination of well-established algorithms and tools to detect anomalies in time-series of water extent across large study areas. The data is binned into a discrete global grid system H3, which greatly simplifies aggregation across spatial and temporal resolutions. For each grid cell of an H3 resolution we perform a time-series decomposition using Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) of the cell's proportion which is covered with surface water. All cells receive an anomaly score, calculated with extended isolation forest (EIF) on the residuals for each step in time. A burst of anomalies represents a hydrological extreme event like a flood or low water level.The presented methodology is applied on Sentinel-1/2 data for two study areas, one near Sukkur, Pakistan and the other one in Mozambique. The detected anomalies correlate with reported floods and seasonal variations of the study areas. The performance of the process and the possibility to use different H3 resolutions make the proposed methodology suitable for large scale monitoring.

TI  - Intraoperative sentinel node biopsy, is it worth the wait?
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In our institution, the study of selective sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) is per-formed intraoperatively. The main objective of our study is to know the proportion of patients who benefits from the waiting of the results of SLNB.Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients operated on our center between January 1 st, 2018 and June 30, 2019 was carried out. We included women diagnosed with T1-T2 tumors, treated by lumpectomy and SLNB studied using OSNA method.Results: Our study included 149 women. There were not statistically significant differences in terms of demographic data between the group treated with axillary lymph node dissec-tion (ALND) and exclusively SLNB group. After analysis of SLN intraoperatively, there were performed 18 axillary lymphadenectomies. Only in six of these 18 cases, three or more sentinel nodes were founded. The location of the tumor, the presence of lymphovascular permeation and the total tumor load (TTL) showed statistically significant differences between groups. Only the TTL was established as the independent factor of the need for ALND.Conclusions: Obtaining a deferred result of the SLNB allowed reducing the time of anesthesia and occupation of the operating room, since in a high percentage of cases an additional procedure is not performed.# 2022 AEC.

M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma surgery has changed significantly in recent years. The highly radical operations with many complications, in addition to which the complete and disease-free survival remained low, were gradually replaced by less radical operations. With the introduction of new systemic treatments (targeted and immuno-oncological) in adjuvant indications, certain surgeries, such as elective block dissections, have now been displaced from surgical treatments and the role of surgery has also been re-evaluated. The surgery for primary tumor removal, reexcision, sentinel lymph node biopsy and lymph region surgery, and surgical treatment of skin and distant metastases have changed. In this summary communication, the authors provide an overview of the currently accepted surgical therapy of melanoma malignum based on the international literature and their own practice.

TI  - Super resolution of historic Landsat imagery using a dual generative adversarial network (GAN) model with CubeSat constellation imagery for spatially enhanced long-term vegetation monitoring
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed spatial representations of terrestrial vegetation are essential for precision agricultural applications and the monitoring of land cover changes in heterogeneous landscapes. The advent of satellite-based remote sensing has facilitated daily observations of the Earth's surface with high spatial resolution. In particular, a data fusion product such as Planet Fusion has realized the delivery of daily, gap-free surface reflectance data with 3-m pixel resolution through full utilization of relatively recent (i.e., 2018-) CubeSat constellation data. However, the spatial resolution of past satellite sensors (i.e., 30-60 m for Landsat) has restricted the detailed spatial analysis of past changes in vegetation. In order to overcome the spatial resolution constraint of Landsat data for long-term vegetation monitoring, we propose a dual remote-sensing super-resolution generative adversarial network (dual RSS-GAN) approach combining Planet Fusion and Landsat 8 data to simulate spatially enhanced long-term timeseries of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance from vegetation (NIRv). We evaluated the performance of the dual RSS-GAN against in situ tower-based continuous measurements (up to 8 years) and remotely piloted aerial system-based maps of cropland and deciduous forest in the Republic of Korea. The dual RSS-GAN enhanced spatial representations in Landsat 8 images and captured seasonal variation in vegetation indices (R2 > 0.90, for the dual RSS-GAN maps vs in situ data from all sites). Overall, the dual RSSGAN reduced Landsat 8 vegetation index underestimations compared with in situ measurements; relative bias values of NDVI ranged from - 5.8 % to 0.3 % and - 12.4 % to - 3.7 % for the dual RSS-GAN and Landsat 8, respectively. This improvement was caused by spatial enhancement through the dual RSS-GAN, which reflects fine-scale information from Planet Fusion. Finally, the dual RSS-GAN maps showed both spatial enhancement and reducing the underestimation of vegetation index in historic Landsat dataset from 1984. This study presents a new approach for resolving sub-pixel spatial information in Landsat images.

TI  - Fueling sentinel node via reshaping cytotoxic T lymphocytes with a flex-patch for post-operative immuno-adjuvant therapy
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical updates suggest conserving metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) of breast cancer (BC) patients during surgery; however, the immunoadjuvant potential of this strategy is unknown. Here we leverage an immune-fueling flex-patch to animate metastatic SLNs with personalized antitumor immunity. The flex-patch is implanted on the postoperative wound and spatiotemporally releases immunotherapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD-1) and adjuvants (magnesium iron-layered double hydroxide, LDH) into the SLN. Genes associated with citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are enriched in activated CD8(+) T cells (CTLs) from metastatic SLNs. Delivered aPD-1 and LDH confer CTLs with upregulated glycolytic activity, promoting CTL activation and cytotoxic killing via metal cation-mediated shaping. Ultimately, CTLs in patch-driven metastatic SLNs could long-termly maintain tumor antigen-specific memory, protecting against high-incidence BC recurrence in female mice. This study indicates a clinical value of metastatic SLN in immunoadjuvant therapy.Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) represent the sites where micro-metastasis can first develop, however they are also important to mount effective anti-tumor immune responses. Here the authors describe the design of a flex-patch loaded with anti-PD-1 antibodies and immuno-adjuvant nanosheets, layered double hydroxide, to fuel anti-tumor immune response in the SLN for postsurgical breast cancer adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Spatial variability of diurnal temperature range and its associations with local climate zone, neighborhood environment and mortality in Los Angeles
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization alters the Earth's emissivity and leads to intraurban differences in temperature variations, including diurnal temperature range (DTR). Despite DTR as a factor of thermal discomfort and mortality risk worldwide, its spatial variability and intraurban associations with local climate zone (LCZ), neighborhood environment and mortality risk have not been investigated. This study first applied the LCZ framework to evaluate associations between climatesensitive urban design and long-term DTR exposure in Los Angeles, a megacity with the largest DTR in the United States. Using fine-scale daytime and nighttime Landsat thermal imagery to quantify DTR, we found that compact low-rise areas had high DTR, high-rise areas with moderate DTR, and natural areas with the lowest. Young-age, non-white and low-income populations were vulnerable and exposed to high DTR. A spatial Bayesian Poisson regression confirmed that neighborhoods with higher DTR exhibited higher mortality risk after controlling for socioeconomic factors (relative risk: 1.047, 95% credibility interval 1.013-1.082). We did not observe a significant association between mean temperature and mortality in our study. As spatial variability of DTR induces heterogeneous exposure and the evidence that long-term DTR exposure is positively associated with mortality across neighborhoods, planners and policymakers should consider urban landscaping to mitigate large DTR for risk reduction.

TI  - Phytoplankton dynamics in nearshore regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula in relation to a variable frontal zone in the Gerlache Strait
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gerlache Strait is a narrow channel that separates the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) from the Palmer Archipelago. This area is characterized by the presence of interconnected fjords, bays, islands, and channels that serve as a refuge for megafauna during summer. Through the framework of FjordPhyto - a citizen science collaboration with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) vessels - we assessed phytoplankton biomass and composition in surface waters of six under-explored nearshore areas connected to the Gerlache Strait (between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S) during three consecutive seasons, from November to March (2016-2019). During the first two seasons, we found significant differences in the phytoplankton community distribution and successional patterns to the north and south of the sampling area; the greatest differences were evidenced mainly in the months of high biomass, December and January. During December, cryptophytes bloomed in the north, while microplanktonic diatoms dominated in the south, and during January, small centric diatoms dominated in the north, while prasinophytes bloomed in the south. This spatial distinction in phytoplankton communities were mainly associated with the occurrence of a surface thermal front in the Gerlache Strait around 64.5 degrees S. The presence of the front separating warm waters to the north and colder waters to the south, during the months of December to February, was confirmed by the analysis of 10 years of remote sensing data. By contrast, during the third season, low biomass prevailed, and no differences in the phytoplankton composition between the north and south areas were observed. The third season was the coldest of the series, with smaller differences in water temperature north and south of the usual front location. This study shows for the first time a complete overview of the phytoplankton composition throughout the entire growth season (November through March) in the nearshore areas of the WAP between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S. The results of this work contribute to the understanding of the phytoplankton community in relation to small scale physical features during the Antarctic austral summer.

TI  - Self-supervision assisted multimodal remote sensing image classification with coupled self-looping convolution networks
T2  - NEURAL NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, remote sensing community has seen a surge in the use of multimodal data for different tasks such as land cover classification, change detection and many more. However, handling multimodal data requires synergistically using the information from different sources. Currently, deep learning (DL) techniques are being religiously used in multimodal data fusion owing to their superior feature extraction capabilities. But, DL techniques have their share of challenges. Firstly, DL models are mostly constructed in the forward fashion limiting their feature extraction capability. Secondly, multimodal learning is generally addressed in a supervised setting, which leads to high labelled data requirement. Thirdly, the models generally handle each modality separately, thus preventing any cross-modal interaction. Hence, we propose a novel self-supervision oriented method of multimodal remote sensing data fusion. For effective cross-modal learning, our model solves a self-supervised auxiliary task to reconstruct input features of one modality from the extracted features of another modality, thus enabling more representative pre-fusion features. To counter the forward architecture, our model is composed of convolutions both in backward and forward directions, thus creating self-looping connections, leading to a self-correcting framework. To facilitate cross-modal communication, we have incorporated coupling across modality-specific extractors using shared parameters. We evaluate our approach on three remote sensing datasets, namely Houston 2013 and Houston 2018, which are HSI-LiDAR datasets and TU Berlin, which is an HSI-SAR dataset, where we achieve the respective accuracy of 93.08%, 84.59% and 73.21%, thus beating the state of the art by a minimum of 3.02%, 2.23% and 2.84%.

TI  - Deep Learning-based Near-real-time Monitoring of Autumn Irrigation Extent at Sub-pixel Scale in a Large Irrigation District
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood irrigation is widely applied in harvested croplands of arid regions and can be classified as autumn/winter irrigation (AI) depending on the time of application. Due to its high water consumption, real-time monitoring of the AI extent is crucial to improve its scheduling. We proposed a remote sensing-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model for near-real-time monitoring of AI extent at sub-pixel scale. The model loosely coupled MODIS data with Sentinel-2 data to solve the mixed pixel issue of MODIS data, and calibrated Sentinel-2 thresholds for AI identification by a random forest (RF) module to extract large-scale reference data with high temporal frequencies. The variable importance estimated by RF is used as a reference for feature screening in the LSTM model. As Sentinel-2 images are not available daily, LSTM models trained with incomplete sequences were validated using multiple validation approaches. The model was applied to the Hetao Irrigation District, the largest irrigation district in arid region of China, and delivered reasonable performance with coefficient of determination of over 0.82 and mean absolute error of around 10.7%. Classification of irrigation patterns using simulated time series of irrigation area fractions revealed eight different irrigation patterns from 2010 to 2020 in the study region. Results indicate that the maximum fraction of AI area upstream is closely related to the cropland distribution pattern. The AI patterns changed significantly over the 11 years, with a more pronounced reduction in irrigation duration for individual pixels in the downstream area. These changes are associated with two important land policies implemented in many regions of China, land consolidation and land transfer. The proposed model demonstrates the potential for near-real-time monitoring of autumn irrigation extent within large irrigation districts, which can aid in AI scheduling and provide insight into irrigation patterns and practices.

TI  - Digital mapping of heavy metals in urban soils: A review and research challenges
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Review
AB  - Heavy metal pollution in urban soil is one of the global environmental problems, and monitoring its spatial distribution can provide basic data for assessing and managing the ecological and environmental problems. Due to the strong human activities in the urban space and the high heterogeneity and fragmentation of the landscape, it is of great significance to explore how to characterize the diversity in human activities within the city and to establish a paradigm for mapping spatial distribution of heavy metal in urban soils. This paper reviewed the theory of soil-landscape model, the data sources for extracting environmental variables, and the geo-statistical methods for establishing regression models. Furthermore, receptor models for tracing heavy metals were dis-cussed. We suggested that using multi-source heterogeneous geographic data (geological data, soil type data, meteorological data, terrain data, time series Landsat images) to extract environmental covariates. In particular, integrating social perception data (point of interest, Tencent user data) and remote sensing image data to extract the urban functional district types that reflect differences in human activities. GeoDetector is recommended to select key environmental covariates that spatially coupling with urban soil heavy metals, and combined with receptor models to trace the sources of heavy metals. Machine learning algorithm is a good choice to construct the estimation models by cooperating with key environmental variables, and to verify the general transferability of the models by using the local weighted and 'spiking' modeling strategies. The newly introduced methods and ideas may be expected to provide technical methods for the monitoring of heavy metal pollution in urban soils, and to further expand the application of digital soil mapping theories and methods in urban soil mapping.

TI  - Quantification of Microtopography in Natural Ecosystems Using Close-Range Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Microtopography plays an important role in various ecological, hydrologic, and biogeochemical processes. However, quantifying the characteristics of microtopography represents a data-intensive challenge. Over the last decade, high-resolution or close-range remote sensing data and techniques have emerged as powerful tools to quantify microtopography. Traditional field surveys were mostly limited to transects or small plots, using limited sets of observations but with the decrease in the cost of close-range remote sensing technologies and the increase in computing performance, the microtopography even in forested environments can be assessed. The main objective of this article is to provide a systematic framework for microtopographic studies using close-range remote sensing technologies. This is achieved by reviewing the application of close-range remote sensing to capture microtopography and develop microtopographic models in natural ecosystems. Specifically, to achieve the main objectives, we focus on addressing the following questions: (1) What terrain attributes represent microtopography in natural ecosystems? (2) What spatial resolution of terrain attributes is needed to represent the microtopography? (3) What methodologies have been adopted to collect data at selected resolutions? (4) How to assess microtopography? Current research, challenges, and applicability of close-range remote sensing techniques in different terrains are analyzed with an eye to enhancing the use of these new technologies. We highlight the importance of using a high-resolution DEM (less than 1 m(2) spatial resolution) to delineate microtopography. Such a high-resolution DEM can be generated using close-range remote sensing techniques. We also illustrate the need to move beyond elevation and include terrain attributes, such as slope, aspect, terrain wetness index, ruggedness, flow accumulation, and flow path, and assess their role in influencing biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, species distribution, and biodiversity. To assess microtopography in terms of physical characteristics, several methods can be adopted, such as threshold-based classification, mechanistically-based delineation, and machine learning-based delineation of microtopography. The microtopographic features can be analyzed based on physical characteristics such as area, volume, depth, and perimeter, or by using landscape metrics to compare the classified microtopographic features. Remote sensing techniques, when used in conjunction with field experiments/data, provide new avenues for researchers in understanding ecological functions such as biodiversity and species distribution, hydrological processes, greenhouse gas emissions, and the environmental factors that influence those parameters. To our knowledge, this article provides a comprehensive and detailed review of microtopography data acquisition and quantification for natural ecosystem studies.

TI  - Evaluation of High-Resolution Land Cover Geographical Data for the WRF Model Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased computing power has made it possible to run simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical model in high spatial resolution. However, running high-resolution simulations requires a higher-detail mapping of landforms, land use, and land cover. Often, higher-resolution data have limited coverage or availability. This paper presents the feasibility of using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) land use and land cover data and alternative high-resolution global coverage land use/land cover (LULC) data from Copernicus Global Land Service Land Cover Map (CGLS-LC100) V2.0 in high-resolution WRF simulations (100 x 100 m). Global LULC data with a resolution of 100 m are particularly relevant for areas not covered by CLC. This paper presents the method developed by the authors for reclassifying land cover data from CGLS-LC100 to MODIS land use classes with defined parameters in the WRF model and describes the procedure for their implementation into the model. The obtained simulation results of the basic meteorological parameters from the WRF simulation using CLC, CGLS-LC100 and default geographical data from MODIS were compared to observations from 13 meteorological stations in the Warsaw area. The research has indicated noticeable changes in the forecasts of temperature, relative humidity wind speed, and direction after using higher-resolution LULC data. The verification results show a significant difference in weather predictions in terms of CLC and CGLS-LC100 LULC data implementation. Due to the fact that better results were obtained for CLC simulations than for CGLS-LC100, it is suggested that CLC data are first used for simulations in numerical weather prediction models and to use CGLS-LC100 data when the area is outside of CLC coverage.

TI  - Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using Indocyanine Green After Failing Scintigraphy in Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer that carries a high rate of lymph node involvement and death. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for the staging of the disease. Scintigraphy using radioactive isotopes (RI) such as technetium 99m (Tc99) remains the gold standard for the detection of SLNs, however, recently indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been used to aid in the detection of SLNs. We present the case of a patient who presented with MCC of the face and two SLNs successfully identified with ICG fluorescence despite the fact that they were not detected by intraoperative scintigraphy using Tc99. The use of ICG fluorescence imaging in MCC is safe and improves the ability to detect SLNs when combined with RI.

TI  - Policy entrepreneurs and individuals: Influence and behavior in pandemic response
T2  - PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Policy entrepreneurs have traditionally been recognized for their ability to influence policymakers by framing policy problems and pairing them with preferred solutions. Does their influence extend to the public? We examine this question in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We analyze whether an individual's perception of a visible, national-level policy entrepreneur, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Dr. Anthony Fauci, influences their perceived risk of contracting the virus and their uptake of recommended COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. Findings indicate that approval of Dr. Fauci predicts individual risk perceptions and uptake of mask wearing practices, with his influence particularly strong among conservatives. However, Dr. Fauci's influence as a policy entrepreneur waned over time and was moderated by a host of factors such as an individual's worldview, perceptions of policy environment, and media consumption.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPeople with multiple health conditions are more likely to have poorer health outcomes and greater care and service needs; a reliable measure of multimorbidity would inform management strategies and resource allocation.AimTo develop and validate a modified version of the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score in an extended age range, using clinical terms that are routinely used in electronic health records across the world (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms, SNOMED CT).Design and settingObservational study using diagnosis and prescriptions data from an English primary care sentinel surveillance network between 2014 and 2019.MethodIn this study new variables describing 37 health conditions were curated and the associations modelled between these and 1-year mortality risk using the Cox proportional hazard model in a development dataset (n = 300 000). Two simplified models were then developed a 20-condition model as per the original Cambridge Multimorbidity Score and a variable reduction model using backward elimination with Akaike information criterion as the stopping criterion. The results were compared and validated for 1-year mortality in a synchronous validation dataset (n = 150 000), and for 1-year and 5-year mortality in an asynchronous validation dataset (n = 150 000).ResultsThe final variable reduction model retained 21 conditions, and the conditions mostly overlapped with those in the 20-condition model. The model performed similarly to the 37- and 20-condition models, showing high discrimination and good calibration following recalibration.ConclusionThis modified version of the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score allows reliable estimation using clinical terms that can be applied internationally across multiple healthcare settings.

TI  - Chikomexochitl: an Indigenous research methodology rooted in the Masewal people's worldview
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Masewal (Indigenous people who live in the Huasteca region, Mexico) associate Chikomexochitl (seven flower or corn-child) to a ritual practice and also with the five stages of the development of corn, from seed until the harvest is completed. Just as corn grows, the five stages of the development of corn provides us with a framework to centre the importance of building relationships of trust that grow over time when doing research with Indigenous communities. First, we provide a description of the Huasteca region. We then engage in a critical discussion to challenge the dominant western positivist approach in research, which has historically served to undermine Indigenous perspectives as less valid forms of knowledge. Masewal people's narratives give meaningful insight into the Masewal worldview and the importance of corn and the corn plant. Finally, we propose the use of Chikomexochitl as an Indigenous research methodology rooted in the Masewal worldview.

TI  - Delineation and optimization of cotton farmland management zone based on time series of soil-crop properties at landscape scale in south Xinjiang, China
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional farmland management approaches treat farmland as a homogeneous unit, leading to uneven distribution and waste of resources, which is contrary to precision agriculture. Management zones (MZ) delineation is an essential method of site-specific management (SSM) for accomplishing variable rate input of resources in subregions by recognizing the heterogeneity of farmland soils. Aimed at the soil salinization problem in Xinjiang, this study estimates the salt content of soil profiles and essential nutrient content using time series Sentinel-2 images and machine learning methods, and describes crop growth conditions through dynamic time warping. Subsequently, geographically weighted principal component analysis and possibilistic fuzzy C-means algorithm were employed to outline MZ based on soil-crop characteristics. Three scales (10 m, 100 m, and field scales divided by ridges) were examined to obtain the optimal scale of delineation. Soil-crop properties were estimated at a spatial resolution of 10 m using machine learning methods with R2 > 0.65. In the zoning process, the field scale was selected with accuracy and practicality in agricultural practices, with comparatively higher homogeneity within zones and variation between zones. The soils in the study area were categorized into three zones at field scale with a fuzzy performance index of 0.68, a normalized classification entropy of 0.71, and fuzzy class of 0.30. Soil function is primarily restricted by salinity and fertility. Fertilizer recommendation strategies were given for the three zones. This study uses time-series remote sensing images to obtain a high-precision estimation of soil-crop characteristics at 10 m, and optimize the scale of farmland management zoning, which provides a valuable technology and scale selection for SSM for cotton management zone delineation in saline farmland in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of Aerosol Optical Depth in Huaihai Economic Zone from 1982 to 2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), quantifying the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere, is widely regarded as a crucial indicator for research on atmospheric physics and regional air quality. At present, the inversion of AOD from observation of satellite remote sensing sensors has become the main technology for large-scale monitoring of aerosol load. The Huaihai Economic Zone is the connecting belt of two key areas of atmospheric governance (the Yangtze River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China), and it has been suffering from air pollution for many years and few studies of AOD focus on this region. Therefore, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the AOD are explored using MODIS AOD data and AVHRR AOD data in this region during the period from 1982 to 2021 in this study. The correlation coefficients between the AOD of satellite observation and actual air pollution were analyzed by combining PM2.5 pollutant concentration and air quality index (AQI) data. The results showed that the AOD is higher in the northwest than in the southeast, and it is different from season to season. The annual variation of AOD in the Huaihai Economic Zone is a W-shaped trend from 1982 to 2011, while the trend of annual AOD is decreasing after 2011. In terms of seasons, the whole differences in AOD are evident, exhibiting AOD values in summer > those in spring > those in autumn > and those in winter. Furthermore, it indicated that the quarterly and monthly variation of the AOD tends to be flat in recent years. Since 2015, the concentration of PM2.5 has continued to decline, the same as that of AQI. Meanwhile, the quarterly and monthly differences in PM2.5 are still obvious, with higher PM2.5 in winter and lower PM2.5 in summer. However, it also represented that PM2.5 is significantly higher in spring than in autumn from 2015 to 2018, which is the opposite for 2019 to 2021. Lastly, the correlation between AOD and PM2.5/AQI is also given; i.e., the correlation coefficients of AOD with PM2.5/AQI are 0.84/0.82, with the highest correlation coefficient in autumn (R = 0.86/0.91) and the lowest in winter (R = 0.46/0.48).

TI  - Spatial timing of circulating seasonal influenza A and B viruses in China from 2014 to 2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major outbreaks of influenza virus occurred in China in 2017-2018. To describe the pattern of influenza circulation and timing of seasonal epidemics, we analyzed data from influenza-like illness (ILI) specimens on surveillance wards of sentinel hospitals during 2014-2018. Among 1,890,084 ILI cases, 324,211 (17.2%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza A virus (particularly A/H3N2), which circulates annually, was detected in 62% of cases, compared with influenza B virus in 38% of cases. The detection rate of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses were 3.56%, 7.07%, 2.08%, and 3.45%, respectively. Influenza prevalence was generally stable over the four years analyzed, but obvious outbreaks occurred in 2015-2016 (17.28%) and 2017-2018 (22.67%), with B/Victoria and B/Yamagata contributing to these outbreaks, respectively. In the south, a characteristic peak in infections was detected in the summer (week 23-38), which was not detected in the north. Influenza B was found high frequency in school-age children (5-14 years) with 4.78% of B/Victoria and 6.76% of B/Yamagata. Therefore, the epidemiological characteristics of seasonal influenza were complex in China during 2014-2018, presenting distinctions in region, season, and susceptible population. These findings underline the importance of enhancing year-round influenza surveillance and provide a reference for the timing and variety of influenza vaccination.

TI  - Delineation of agricultural fields in arid regions from Worldview-2 datasets based on image textural properties
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Barren lands are being transformed into agricultural fields with the growing demand for agriculture-based products. Hence, monitoring these regions for better planning and management is crucial. Surveying with high-resolution RS (remote sensing) satellites like Worldview-2 provides a faster and cheaper solution than conventional surveys. In the study, the arid region comprising cropland and barrenlands are efficiently and autonomously delineated using its spectral and textural properties using state-of-the-art random forest (RF) ensemble classifiers. The textural information window size is optimized and at a GLCM (gray-level co-occurrence matrix) window size of 13, a stable trend in classification accuracy was observed. A further rise in window sizes did not improve the classification accuracy; beyond GLCM 19, a decline in accuracy was observed. Comparing GLCM-13 RF with the no-GLCM RF classifier, the GLCM-based classifiers performed better; thus, the textural information assisted in removing isolated crop-classified outputs that are falsely predicted pixel groups. Still, it also obscured information about barren lands present within croplands. Delineation accuracy was 93.8 % for the no-GLCM RF classifier, whereas, for the GLCM-13 RF classifier, an accuracy of 97.3 % was observed. Thus, overall, a 3.5 % improvement in accuracy was observed while using the GLCM RF classifier with window size 13. The textural information with proper calibration over high-spatial resolution datasets improves crop delineation in the present study. Henceforth, a more accurate cropland identification will provide a better estimate of the actual cropland area in such an arid region, which will assist in formulating a better resource management policy.

TI  - Identification of land subsidence hazard in asadabad plain using the PS-InSAR method and its relationship with the geological characteristics
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the permanent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique was utilized to monitor land subsidence in Asadabad city and the adjoining plains located in the west of Iran using Sentinel-1A satellite images in the 2015-2018 period. Based on the results, the Bad Khoreh area exhibited the maximum subsidence rate of about 224 mm/year among the examined areas in the county in the selected period. Also, the rate of land subsidence had increased from the urban areas toward the plains. Moreover, the processing of underground water level data of piezometric wells in the study area indicates that land subsidence in Asadabad city and the adjacent plains has a direct relationship with the overexploitation of groundwater resources during the 2015-2018 period. Furthermore, subsurface geology and land subsidence were analyzed based on information gathered from eleven wells with a total depth of 614 m. The examination of borehole logs and profiles demonstrated that the areas composed of fine clay and sand had undergone severer subsidence than those composed of coarse-grained sediment due to the greater consolidation and compressibility of the grain sediment.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of vegetation fires in Europe
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disasters are defined as negative events that affect the lives of all living things on earth with their various effects. Fires which are one of these natural disasters, are the partial or complete burning of vegetated areas caused by natural or man-made causes. Today, monitoring and managing fires with Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools are considered an integral part of and after their occurrence. RS and GIS are regarded as extremely useful and modern methods for data analysis, querying, and visualization in disaster management. The aim of this study is to determine the local and general patterns of the fires in the European continent by examining them with spatial statistical methods and making a spatial analysis. In addition, it aims to examine the fires that occurred over time with temporal pattern analysis. In the study, Global Moran's I, Getis-Ord Gi* Hot Spot Analysis, Anselin Local Moran's I Cluster and Outlier, and Emerging Hot Spot Analysis for Space-Time Pattern Analysis were performed on the dataset created with the fires that occurred in the European continent between 2000 and 2020. According to the analysis, the region that is exposed to the most intense fire and has the highest fire risk has been determined as the northern region of Portugal. The Balkans, the south of Italy, and the Sicilian peninsula are also dense and risky regions in terms of fires.

TI  - Cumulation as the organizing principle of Lev Rubinstein's "file cabinet" poetry
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the tendency of contemporary poets to use lists and catalogues in their works in an attempt to "restore" figurative language of cumula-tion, which has an existentially mythological status rather than a conditionally poetic one. Historical poetics define this language as a sequence of exter-nally dissimilar yet semantically identical phenom-ena stemming from archaic consciousness. Subject of the present research is the worldview specifics of Lev Rubinstein's conceptual "Poems on Library In-dex Cards", particularly, a complex ofmotives repre-sented by cumulative structures. The research asserts that, in the "file cabinet" poetry, which embodies the concept ofsequence with its very form, the only sig-nified of the cumulative chain is the text prioritizing the autometadescriptive principle. Focusing on the preconditions and consequences ofpoetic initiation, "mechanics" ofa creative act and text origins ofrea-lity, the author comes to a conclusion that a human's life functions only through "regular writing" and lasts as long as the "file cabinet" grows. As the events are played out (the majority of works has some kind of discrete though rather defined storyline), the inevi-tability of death becomes more and more apparent, however, the "return" (perceived as "resurrection" in another's consciousness) is predetermined by the possibility to reread the text as many times as one can. Thus, the way the non-classical poetry (includ-ing Rubinstein's works) is rooted in mythological semantics not only does not exclude it focusing on the modern problems but also serves as a tool oftheir artistic objectification.

TI  - GIS based landslide susceptibility mapping and assessment using weighted overlay method in Wayanad: A part of Western Ghats, Kerala
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of the study are to generate a landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) map of Wayanad for effective and efficient disaster management in the future and to determine the various parameters and usefulness of remote sensing and GIS in landslide susceptibility mapping. The topographical factors like slope, elevation, and aspects influencing landslides are derived from the digital elevation model (DEM). The rainfall data were collected from 2011 to 2019 from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and four sampling sites were identified through a field visit. We used Landsat8 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery with a resolution of 30 m to create land use and land cover (LULC) using the unsupervised classification method. It was divided into seven categories based on the annual precipitation of the study area using inverse distance weighting (IDW). The LSZ map was derived using the weighted overlay method by analysing the geographical and climatic factors. These factors helped produce the final LSZ map, which was divided into three zones from high to low. LSZ areas with steep slopes, high elevation, prolonged rainfall, and predominant land use changes. Study reveals that the north-east, south, and south-east regions of the study area are more vulnerable to landslides.

TI  - Contributions of African-Centered (Africentric) Psychology: A Call for Inclusion in APA-Accredited Graduate Psychology Program Curriculum
T2  - AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few years, there has been increased visibility of, and attention paid to, enduring issues such as racial discrimination toward Black Americans. Black psychologists have been called upon to explain various race-related mental health issues to the public, as well as their colleagues and students. Discussions about how to heal from persistent, intergenerational, oppressive attacks on the African psyche are important, but the theories and treatments in which most practitioners are trained and considered "best practices" are Eurocentric in nature. African-centered (or Africentric) psychology is a well-established school of thought, predating the philosophies often discussed in Western/American psychology's History and Systems curriculum, that provides an authentic understanding of the psychology of people of African descent from an African perspective. In this article, we present the historical contention about the lack of inclusion of an African perspective in conceptualizing and addressing the psychological needs of people of African descent, provide an overview of African-centered psychology including its underlying worldview and philosophy, development, and key contributors, and advocate for the inclusion of Africentric psychology in APA-accredited psychology graduate programs.Public Significance StatementWe propose that a psychological school of thought in which Black people are understood from a strength-based, healthy perspective should be included in the standard curriculum for APA-accredited graduate programs. We provide an overview of African-centered (or Africentric) psychology as a school of thought with distinguished Black scholars who have contributed to its theory, research, and praxis.

TI  - Multiple indicators of violence against female sex workers and its associated factors in Ghana: Evidence from the 2015 integrated bio-behavioral surveillance survey cross-sectional study
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and AimsViolence against female sex workers (FSWs) is a widespread phenomenon, especially in African nations like Ghana where sex work is outlawed primarily because of the pervasive worldview that sex work is a contravention of morality. Violence against FSWs deters them from accessing critical health services and heightens their risk of STIs including HIV infection. The study examined the prevalence and the associated factors of multiple indicators of violence against FSWs. MethodsThe study utilized a cross-sectional secondary data from the 2015 Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance Survey conducted among FSWs and their nonpaying partners by Ghana AIDS Commission. We analysed data on a total of 4279 participants. Bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify factors associated with physical and sexual violence against FSWs. Data were analysed using Stata version 15. ResultsOf the 4279 FSWs, 433 (10%) and 1059 (25%) suffered physical and sexual violence, respectively. The predictors of physical violence are being a seater (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36-0.74), aged >= 40 (aOR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.64), nonuse of drugs (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44-0.70), not using alcohol before sex (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.86) and petty business (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05-1.82). Sexual violence was predicted by those aged 31-40 (aOR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.94) and age >= 40 (aOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22-0.66), currently married (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27-0.67), having no living children (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.94), nonuse of drugs (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94), and not using alcohol before sex (aOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63-0.86). Region was associated with both physical and sexual violence. Both physical and sexual violence had negative consequences on consistency of condom use and condom failure among FSWs. ConclusionPhysical and sexual violence against FSWs is pervasive, and a critical public health issue in Ghana. The identified associated factors could be considered as part of an overall strategy aimed at addressing the menace.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of urban heat island effect over Tiruchirappalli city using geospatial techniques
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alterations made to the natural ground surface and the anthropogenic activity elevate the surface and air temperature in the urban areas compared with the surrounding rural areas, known as urban heat island effect. Thermal remote sensors measure the radiation emitted by ground objects, which can be used to estimate the land surface temperature and are beneficial for studying urban heat island effects. The present study investigates the spatial and temporal variations in the effects of urban heat island over Tiruchirappalli city in India during the summer and winter seasons. The study also identifies hot spots and cold spots within the study area. In this study, a significant land surface temperature difference was observed between the urban and rural areas, predominantly at night, indicating the presence of urban heat island at night. These diurnal land surface temperature fluctuations are also detected seasonally, with a relatively higher temperature intensity during the summer. The trend line analysis shows that the mean land surface temperature of the study area is increasing at a rate of 0.166 K/decade with p less than 0.01. By using the spatial autocorrelation method with the urban heat island index as the key parameter, hot spots with a 99 percent confidence level and a 95 percent confidence level were found within the urban area. A hot spot with 95 and 90 percent confidence level was identified outside the urban area. This spike in temperature for a particular region in the rural area is due to industry and the associated built-up area. The study also identified cold spots with a 90 percent confidence level within the rural area. However, cold spots with a 95 and 99 percent confidence level were not identified within the study area.

TI  - Transformative epistemologies for regenerative tourism: towards a decolonial paradigm in science and practice?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There is a growing scholarly interest in the potential of regenerative tourism approaches to address sustainability challenges. Drawing from an ecological worldview that interweaves Indigenous and Western knowledge systems, regenerative tourism approaches seek to increase the capacity of support systems for fulfilling net-positive social-ecological effects. We argue that Western scientific paradigms drive current tourism research methodologies and are sometimes insufficient and unfit to (advance) regenerative tourism research. The extent to which new research methodological approaches can align with the ecological worldview and regenerative paradigm is an underpinning premise. As part of a broader study of the emerging regenerative tourism concept, a scoping review of 84 peer-reviewed and 116 grey literature articles, supplemented by consultations with nine regenerative tourism practitioners, six Indigenous practitioners and one cultural knowledge holder, identified nine research gaps that explicate this mismatch. An analytical framework guided the gap analysis and the formulation of a future research agenda. Findings suggest that tourism scholarship is not keeping pace with the evolution of regenerative tourism, requiring additional and new approaches. A transformational decolonial, transdisciplinary research paradigm is proposed that fully embraces the regenerative tourism paradigm and thus enables knowledge production that facilitates plural regenerative tourism futures.

TI  - High-Resolution InSAR Reveals Localized Pre-Eruptive Deformation Inside the Crater of Agung Volcano, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - During a volcanic crisis, high-rate, localized deformation can indicate magma close to the surface, with important implications for eruption forecasting. However, only a few such examples have been reported, because frequent, dense monitoring is needed. High-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is capable of achieving <1 m spatial resolution and sub-weekly revisit times, but is under-used. Here we use high-resolution satellite SAR imagery from COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, and Sentinel-1 to detect intra-crater uplift preceding the November 2017 onset of eruptive activity at Agung, Indonesia. Processing the SAR imagery with an up-to-date, accurate, high-resolution digital elevation model was crucial for preventing aliasing of the deformation signal and for accurate georeferencing. We show that >15 cm of line-of-sight shortening occurred over a 400-by-400 m area on the crater floor in September-October 2017, accompanying a deep seismic swarm and flank dyke intrusion. We attribute the deformation to the pressurization of a shallow (<200 m deep) hydrothermal system by the injection of magmatic gases and fluids. We also observe a second pulse of intra-crater deformation of 3-5 cm within 4 days to 11 hr prior to the first phreatomagmatic eruption, which is consistent with interaction between the hydrothermal system and the ascending magma. This phreatomagmatic eruption created the central pathway used during the final stages of magma ascent. Our observations have important implications for understanding unrest and eruption forecasting, and demonstrate the potential of monitoring with high-resolution SAR.

TI  - Economic aspects of urban greenness along a dryland rainfall gradient: A time-series analysis
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies at the global scale show that urban greenness is not equally distributed across and within cities. Yet, quantification of urban greening trends in drylands is still lacking. We have modeled urban greenness dynamics and its determinants, using Landsat-based time-series analyses of NDVI and census data, of 23 localities along a dryland climatic gradient in southern Israel, between 1997 and 2019. NDVI trends and their associated temporal changes in local average wages, age of locality, and average annual rainfall were analyzed by exploiting a panel structure and model parameters estimation with fixed effects to control for unobserved differences between localities, and to strengthen causal interpretation. Results show positive NDVI trends in all localities-indicating that urban construction increases greenness in drylands. However, the localities varied greatly in the slopes of their respective linear NDVI trends (0.05 <alpha < 0.161). Specifically, we found that, ceteris paribus, the differences in average wages between localities is the most important factor in explaining spatio-temporal differences be-tween the respective NDVI of localities. Given the well-known high correlation between individuals' wages and other characteristic such as education and income (all important determinants of the Socio-Economic classifi-cation of local authorities), this leads us to conclude that residents' economic characteristics are an important predictor of the level of greenness. Harlin's Granger causality test for wages and NDVI panel data indicate that wage is a Granger cause of urban greenness (p < 0.001)-however, greenness was not found to be the driving force of wage.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine overall trends and center-level variation in utilization of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy for sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma.Summary Background Data: Based on recent clinical trials, management options for SLN-positive melanoma now include effective adjuvant systemic therapy and nodal observation instead of CLND. It is unknown how these findings have shaped practice or how these contemporaneous developments have influenced their respective utilization.Methods: We performed an international cohort study at 21 melanoma referral centers in Australia, Europe, and the United States that treated adults with SLN-positive melanoma and negative distant staging from July 2017 to June 2019. We used generalized linear and multinomial logistic regression models with random intercepts for each center to assess center-level variation in CLND and adjuvant systemic treatment, adjusting for patient and disease-specific characteristics.Results: Among 1109 patients, performance of CLND decreased from 28% to 8% and adjuvant systemic therapy use increased from 29 to 60%. For both CLND and adjuvant systemic treatment, the most influential factors were nodal tumor size, stage, and location of treating center. There was notable variation among treating centers in management of stage IIIA patients and use of CLND with adjuvant systemic therapy versus nodal observation alone for similar risk patients.Conclusions: There has been an overall decline in CLND and simultaneous adoption of adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with SLN-positive melanoma though wide variation in practice remains. Accounting for differences in patient mix, location of care contributed significantly to the observed variation.

TI  - Soil and vegetation water content identify the main terrestrial ecosystem changes.
T2  - National science review
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Environmental change is a consequence of many interrelated factors. How vegetation responds to natural and human activity still needs to be well established, quantified and understood. Recent satellite missions providing hydrologic and ecological indicators enable better monitoring of Earth system changes, yet there is no automatic way to address this issue directly from observations. Here, we develop an observation-based methodology to capture evidence of changes in global terrestrial ecosystems and attribute these changes to natural or anthropogenic activity. We use the longest time record of global microwave L-band soil moisture and vegetation optical depth as satellite data and build spatially explicit maps of change in soil and vegetation water content and biomass reflecting large ecosystem changes during the last decade, 2010-20. Regions of prominent trends (from [Formula: see text] to 9% per year) are observed, especially in humid and semi-arid climates. We further combine such trends with land cover change maps, vegetation greenness and precipitation variability to assess their relationship with major documented ecosystem changes. Several regions emerge from our results. They cluster changes according to human activity drivers, including deforestation (Amazon, Central Africa) and wildfires (East Australia), artificial reforestation (South-East China), abandonment of farm fields (Central Russia) and climate shifts related to changes in precipitation variability (East Africa, North America and Central Argentina). Using the high sensitivity of soil and vegetation water content to ecosystem changes, microwave satellite observations enable us to quantify and attribute global vegetation responses to climate or anthropogenic activities as a direct measure of environmental changes and the mechanisms driving them.

M3  - Article
AB  - Various combinations of neural network parameters and sets of input data for satellite image classification are considered in the article. The training set is completed with a NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and local binary patterns. Testing of classifiers created on a different number of epochs and samples is carried out. Values of the neural network hyperparameters are determined that allow a classification accuracy of 0.70 and an F-measure of 0.65 to be achieved. Separation into classes with similar spectral characteristics is shown to offer low classification quality at different parameters and input data sets. Additional information is required. For exam-ple, for forests to be divided into more detailed classes, one needs to employ classifiers that use images from different seasons and vegetation periods. In addition, the training set needs to be ex-tended to take into account various natural zones, soils, etc.

M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, philosophical reflection on the utopian has focused on the analysis of the way in which the future-possible and the radically unknown or "other" influence our present. Specifically, accelerationism and Object-oriented Ontology have identified horror and weird fiction in general, and H. P. Lovecraft in particular, as the privileged field from which to access a radically anti-humanist absolute exteriority (Outside) with the aim of developing a new anti-species worldview, one which Timothy Morton calls "Dark Ecology." This article analyzes the philosophical foundations of this worldview, showing the exclusive and proto-fascist character it harbors, which is why it should be clearly separated from other post-humanisms and/or new materialisms based on the hybridization and interconnection characteristic of relational ontologies.

T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the hydrological conditions under which flood events occur in the coastal plain of the Rio de la Plata in Punta Indio, Buenos Aires, Argentina by the analysis of water balances and satellite images with a methodological approach applicable to other flatlands. Landsat images for the period 2008 -2014 were analyzed to identify flood situations and base flow conditions. For the same period, daily soil water balances were performed to assess surpluses, deficits, and soil water storage. The results show that the response of the coastal plain in relation to the presence of flooding is large-ly conditioned by the previous existence of water surpluses and soil moisture at the time of precipitation.

TI  - Anthropocentrism v Ecocentrism in the Jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
T2  - DIRITTI UMANI E DIRITTO INTERNAZIONALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and environmental degradation represent the greatest threats to the future of human-ity. To date, the legal attempts to stop them have primarily been characterized by the adoption of an anthropocentric paradigm, typical of the Western legal tradition. However, in the last decade, we have gradually witnessed a change of perspective. Indeed, an alternative paradigm has emerged, es-pecially in Latin America, inspired by the indigenous worldview. It recognizes an intrinsic value to Nature, which is no longer considered an object and a resource to be exploited, but rather a subject of rights. This paper focuses on the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to verify whether an eco-centric approach is making its way into the interpretation of the American Convention of Human Rights. The analysis starts with a brief reconstruction of the cornerstones of the eco-centric approach. Subsequently, the paper analyzes the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court to ascertain the possible influence of this theory on its work and the consequences for the effective protection of Nature. From the judgments examined, we can notice an emerging interpre-tation of the Convention by the San Jose Court that marks a gradual evolution from anthropocentrism towards the acceptance, albeit partial and limited, of an eco-systemic conception of the rights pro-tected by the Convention.

TI  - A geographic information systems and remote sensing-based approach to assess urban micro-climate change and its impact on human health in Bartin, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing land surface temperature (LST) is one of the major urban climatology problems arising in urban development. In this paper, the impact of vegetation and built-up areas on the LST and impact of LST on human health are assessed using the Landsat thermal data in Bartin, Turkey. The results show that there is a constant change in the share of vegetation and built-up areas due to rapid urbanization in Bartin. Strong positive correlation has been found between NDBI and LST while strong negative correlation has been found between NDVI and LST, suggesting their strong impacts on land surface temperatures. Similarly, a strong positive correlation has been observed between LST, sleep deprivation, and heat stress. This study provides precise information on effects of urbanization and man-made activities, which cause major changes in micro-climate and human health in the city. This study can assist decision-makers or planners to plan future developments sustainably.

TI  - Trends and Variability of PM2.5 at Different Time Scales over Delhi: Long-term Analysis 2007-2021
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigated the long-term inter-annual, seasonal, and monthly trend analysis and variability of PM2.5 on different times scales over the national capital, Delhi, India, using high -resolution surface observations from six stations during 2007-2021. The non-parametric Mann -Kendall and Theil-Sen slope estimator were used to study the temporal variations. The long-term PM2.5concentration showed an overall small but statistically significant decreasing trend with an average decrease of -1.35 (95% CI: -2.3, -0.47) mu g m-3 year-1. Seasonal trends revealed a significant decreasing value of -3.05 mu g m-3 year-1(p < 0.1) for summer, an insignificant declining trend of -1.95 mu g m-3 year-1 for monsoon. Similarly no significant trend detected for the post the post monsoon and winter season. Except for December and January, all months displayed a decreasing trend for PM2.5 concentration. These findings indicate that particle pollution over the city is declining at a very slow rate. A rising trend was found for relative humidity and surface pressure, whereas a declining trend for wind speed and PBLH was observed. No trend was observed for temperature and rainfall. The Pearson linear correlation between PM2.5 and meteorological variables was studied using monthly mean data. Rainfall, air temperature, PBLH, and wind speed showed a negative correlation with PM2.5, whereas surface pressure had a positive correlation and relative humidity displayed an inverted U-shape relationship. The average concentration of PM2.5 in the study period of 15 years remained 125 +/- 86 mu g m-3 (ranging between 20 to 985 mu g m-3) and during winter, summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons it was 174 +/- 75, 101 +/- 48, 66 +/- 50, and 192 +/- 93 mu g m-3 respectively. Minimum of the monthly averaged PM2.5 concentration was observed in August, while maximum is November. Satellite data of fire events showed that the crop residue burning over the Punjab region had a significant contribution to the peak PM2.5levels in Delhi during the crop burning period. Government agencies need more strict action plans, especially during winter, to comply with air quality standards.

TI  - Trend relationship between mountain normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) across two decades: implication for water quality within the Lesotho Highlands, Drakensberg, South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are growing concerns on contribution of vegetation dynamics to atmospheric turbidity and quality of regional water towers. The study sought to determine the trends in the MODIS/TERRA-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) for Lesotho Highland over 2000-2020. The predictive relationship between the two variables was also examined using regression analysis. Irrespective of yearly AOD patterns, the AOD showed biphasic patterns peaking between mid-winter to early spring (July-October) (highest) and autumn (Feb-April) (next highest), and lowest in the summer (Nov-January). The monthly NDVI was largest in January-March (summer-early fall) with smaller values in winter and spring. This seasonality can be related to the peak of anthropogenic biomass combustion during the winter and strong winds during the spring and early summer. The AOD relationship with NDVI showed quadratic patterns peaking and plunging with changes in season. About 30-80% (R-2 = 0.3-0.8%) changes in annual AOD from 2000 to 2020 were explainable by the dynamics of NDVI indicating that increased NDVI contributes to about a 50% decrease in AOD in the Lesotho Highlands. However, an outlier trend was observed in 2007 (R-2 = 13%). Incidences of high AOD in months of high NDVI may be indicative of traveling aerosols, i.e., aerosols from non-local sources/activity. On the other hand, high AOD in months of low NDVI implicates local aerosol sources. Trend relationship studies on vegetation loss and AOD in mountain areas of other regions could improve knowledge of contaminant dynamics and risk implications for downstream populations.

TI  - Anatomic Study of the Integrity of the Breast Lymphatic Network With Indocyanine Green in Breast Implant Surgery Through the Axillary Approach
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe performance of a prosthetic breast augmentation through the axilla always makes the surgeon fear the possibility of damage to the breast lymphatic network. Indocyanine green is a fluorescent marker allowing the analysis of the lymphatic system. This anatomical work aims at demonstrating, thanks to the use of indocyanine green, whether the realization of a prosthetic breast augmentation by axillary way leads to lesions of the breast lymphatic network and also seeks to show the feasibility of detecting the axillary sentinel node after axillary breast augmentation.Material and MethodThis is an anatomical study. After injection of indocyanine green in the periareolar area, a prosthetic breast augmentation was performed through the axilla. At the end of the procedure, a change in the distribution of indocyanine green in the skin or its abnormal presence was sought: at the level of the skin incision, the prosthetic space, or in contact with the prosthesis itself. The presence of green in these situations was synonymous with a lesion of the lymphatic network. In the opposite case, we considered that the lymphatic system was respected. After sampling, an axillary lymph node we also looked for the presence of indocyanine green at its contact.ResultsWe performed 22 breast injections. The lymphatic network could be demonstrated in 15 of them. Among these 15 injections, 12 (80%) were in favor of a preservation of the lymphatic network, whereas 3 (20%) evoked a lesion of the lymphatic network. In all subjects (100%), an axillary lymph node was found with the presence of indocyanine green within it.ConclusionOur study is in favor of a preservation of the lymphatic network during a prosthetic breast augmentation by axillary way. Furthermore, with the collection of an axillary lymph node containing the dye from each subject, this work demonstrates the feasibility of axillary sentinel node detection with indocyanine green after axillary breast augmentation. Further work on live subjects and on a larger number of subjects would be necessary to confirm these results.

TI  - Implementation of the use of SPECT-portable for evaluation of surgical margins in breast cancer with indication of ROLL: First results
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Main objective: To compare the effectiveness for checking surgical margins between SPECT-portable and mammography of the piece (RxM). Secondary objective: To standardize a pre-operative protocol using SPECT-portable and to evaluate the time required in the use of this technique.Material and methods: Prospective longitudinal study with 36 patients (39 lesions) diagnosed with breast cancer (CM) with criteria for SNOLL/ROLL.A pre-surgical study of the tumor lesion was performed, after the eco-guided administration of 99mTc-nanocolloids of albumin/99mTc-macroaggregates of albumin, in the tumor lesion. Hybrid images (optical + SPECT) and 3D navigation images with gamma probe are obtained using freehandSPECT. In the operating room, 4-5 images are obtained with freehandSPECT, (I) on skin for tumor location, (II) after exposure of surgical bed for resection guide, (III) of the surgical bed after exeresis, (IV and V) the anterior-posterior and lateral surface of the surgical specimen. The three criteria to decide to extend the margins are: (a) residual activity (cps) at the edges of the surgical bed resection; (b) visual analysis of the uptake in the specimen; (c) a minimum distance of 10 mm from the edges of the specimen to the center of greatest uptake, plus the radius of the lesion.We study the concordance of: the depth measurement between ultrasound and freehandSPECT; the sur-gical margins between freehandSPECT vs. mammography of the specimen (RxM), considering anatomical pathology (AP) as the gold standard technique as reference; surgical time used with freehandSPECT and RxM.Results: Intraoperative localization was performed in all cases.False negative (FN: no detection margin affected) with freehandSPECT: 9 margins; with RxM: 8. True positive (TP: detection margin affected) with freehandSPECT: 5 margins, with RxM: 6. True negative (TN: consider free margin when healthy) with freehandSPECT: 213 margins; with RxM: 196. Negative predictive value (NPV: probability of negative margin on unaffected part) with freehandSPECT: 95.9%, with RxM: 96.07%. Specificity with freehandSPECT: 96.8%, with RxM: 97%.The concordance of surgical bed margins between freehandSPECT and RxM: 94.5%. Between freehandS-PECT and AP: 93.1%. Between RxM and PA: 93.5%, being all statistically significant (p-value <0.000), so we can affirm that both techniques are related or dependent on the reference technique, the PA. Degree of correlation between SPECT-portable and low PA (Kappa index: 0.34, 95% CI [0.22-0.47], and between RxM and moderate PA (Kappa index: 0.42, 95% CI [0.29-0.56], p-value <0.001. Comparison of the successes and failures of both techniques (SPECT-portable and RxM) and PA: Distribution & chi;2: 0.023 with degree of free-dom 1, with value <0.05, so we can affirm that both techniques are similar, since there are no significant statistical differences.Median total OR time: 60.25 min (30-145). Mean freehandSPECT OR time: 5 scans = 10 min. Conclusions: There are no statistically significant differences in the probability to rule out affective mar-gins that require a second surgery between both techniques (SPECT-portable and RxM) so, the technique performed with SPECT-Portable is a useful and effective procedure, which requires specific training with an optimized and multidisciplinary protocol. The time spent with SPECT-portable is feasible for daily practice.& COPY; 2022 Sociedad Espan & SIM;ola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular. Published by Elsevier Espan & SIM;a, S.L.U.

TI  - Improving asthma care through implementation of the SENTINEL programme: findings from the pilot site
T2  - ERJ OPEN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Short-acting ss 2-agonist (SABA) overuse adversely impacts asthma-related outcomes and the environment. The SABA rEductioN Through ImplemeNting Hull asthma guidELines (SENTINEL) programme aims to reduce SABA overuse through supported implementation of an adult asthma guideline, which advocates for a SABA-free maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)-preferred treatment where appropriate, across six primary care networks (PCNs) in the UK. We present findings on patient/disease characteristics, asthma prescribing patterns and exacerbation rates from the pilot PCN.Methods: Patients (aged.18 years, prescribed at least one inhaled therapy) and their prescribed asthma treatments were characterised using National Health Service data. Asthma treatments and exacerbations were analysed for three periods: 24.12 months pre-, 12 months pre- and 12 months post-SENTINEL implementation (November 2020.January 2021).Results: Of the 2571 registered asthma patients, 33.6% (n=864) underwent an asthma review, of whom 44.7% (n=386) were transitioned to MART. Fewer patients were prescribed three or more SABA canisters per year post-implementation in the overall asthma population (45.4% and 46.2% during 24.12 months and 12 months pre-implementation, respectively, and 23.9% 12 months post-implementation), and in the two subgroups: 1) those who had an asthma review (74.5% and 83.6% during 24.12 months and 12 months preimplementation, respectively, and 26.5% post-implementation); and 2) those transitioned to MART following a review (76.4% and 86.5% during 24.12 months and 12 months pre-implementation, respectively, and 16.3% post-implementation). A higher proportion of patients were exacerbation-free post-implementation in the overall asthma population and in the two subgroups. At least 71.5% of patients transitioned to MART were still prescribed MART 12 months post-implementation, of whom.86.7% were SABA-free.Conclusion: SENTINEL implementation led to reduced SABA prescribing, increased inhaled corticosteroid uptake and fewer asthma exacerbations. MART was considered appropriate for similar to 50% of reviewed patients, with improved prescribing patterns sustained post-implementation.

T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This editorial reflects on the history of the conservation movement, the strong continuing influence of its colonial past, and the counter-emergence of a more pluralistic and respectful worldview. Conservation Letters seeks to support and foster an ethical and inclusive discipline of conservation that discards elements of its colonial and racist history. This will involve broadening the disciplinary scope of "conservation" and paying greater attention to traditional ecological knowledge and nonwestern conservation approaches. We also see a particular need for theoretical advances that guide conservation practice by informing and connecting different kinds of expertise to understand social-ecological interactions and their implications for both people and ecosystems. Conservation can and should play a vital role in securing the joint future of ecosystems and people, but it will only achieve its full potential if it retains its social license and stays relevant to emerging concerns and values.

TI  - Complete Remission of BCG-Refractory High-grade Bladder CIS with Pharmacologic Ascorbate and Mistletoe
T2  - ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context center dot Bladder cancer is the fourth-most-common cancer in males in the U.S., who develop about 90% of the high-grade, carcinoma in situ (CIS) of non-muscle involved disease (NMIBC). Smoking and occupational carcinogens are well-known causes. For females without known risk factors, bladder cancer can be regarded as a sentinel environmental cancer. It's also one of the costliest to treat due to its high rate of recurrence. No treatment innovations have occurred in nearly two decades; intravesical instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an agent in short supply globally, or Mitomycin-C (MIT-C) is effective in about 60% of cases. Cases refractory to BCG and MIT-C often undergo cystectomy, a procedure with numerous impacts on life styles and potential complications. The recent completion of a small Phase I trial of mistletoe in cancer patients that have exhausted known treatments at Johns Hopkins provides corroboration of its safety, with 25 % showing no disease progression. Objective center dot The study examined the benefits of pharmacologic ascorbate (PA) and mistletoe for a nonsmoking female patient with an environmental history of NMIBC refractory to BCG, in a nonsmoking female with exposures in childhood and early adult life to several known carcinogens, including ultrafine particulate air pollution, benzene, toluene, and other organic solvents, aromatic amines and engine exhausts, and possibly arsenic in water. Design center dot The research team performed an integrative oncology case study on pharmacologic ascorbate (PA) and mistletoe, both agents shown to activate NK cells, enhance growth and maturation of T-cells, and induce dose-dependent pro-apoptotic cell death, suggesting shared and potentially synergistic mechanisms. Setting center dot The study began at the University of Ottawa Medical Center in Canada with treatment continuing over six years at St. Johns Hospital Center in Jackson, Wyoming, and George Washington University Medical Center for Integrative Medicine, with surgical, cytological, and pathological evaluations at University of California San Francisco Medical Center. Participant center dot The patient in the case study was a 76-year-old, well-nourished, athletic, nonsmoking female with high-grade CIS of the bladder. Her cancer was considered to be a sentinel environmental cancer. Intervention center dot Intravenous pharmacologic ascorbate (PA) and subcutaneous mistletoe (three times weekly) and intravenous and intravesical mistletoe (once weekly) were employed for an 8-week induction treatment, using a dose-escalation protocol as detailed below. Maintenance therapy was carried out with the same protocol for three weeks every three months for two years. Results center dot The patient has experienced a cancer-free outcome following 78 months of treatments that incorporated intravesical, intravenous, and subcutaneous mistletoe; intravenous PA; a program of selected nutraceuticals; exercise; and other supplementary treatments. Conclusions center dot This study is the first reported instance of combined treatments to achieve complete remission for highgrade NMIBC refractory to BCG and MIT-C, using intravesical, subcutaneous, and intravenous mistletoe and intravenous PA. It includes pharmacological information on possible mechanisms.In light of the global shortage of BCG, the high proportion of cases refractory to BCG and MIT-C, the unproven use of costly off-label pharmaceuticals, such as gemcitabine, and the relative cost-effectiveness of mistletoe and PA, clinicians should give serious consideration to employing these combined functional medicine treatments for BCG- and MIT-C-refractory NMIBC. Further research is needed with additional patients that can advance our understanding, including standardization of methods for systematically evaluating combined therapiesblinded and non-blinded, nomenclature regarding mistletoe preparation, doses, concentrations, regimes of administration, lengths of treatment, targeted cancer types, and other aspects.

TI  - Observational Constraints on the Submesoscale Sea Surface Height Variance of Balanced Motion
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of in situ and remotely sensed observations are used to constrain the imprint of submeso-scale turbulence in the sea surface height (SSH) field. The distribution of SSH variance across frequencies and wavenum-bers is estimated by comparing an empirical model spectrum to two sets of observations. First, submesoscale SSH variance is constrained using a pair of GPS buoys spaced at about 10 km. From these data, one can estimate frequency spectra not only of SSH variance but also of the variance in the SSH difference between the buoys. The ratio between these two spec-tral estimates is sensitive to how much SSH variance is present in the submesoscale range and thus constrains the spectral roll-off of SSH variance in wavenumber space. Second, a combination of moored current meters and nadir altimetry is used to obtain an independent constraint. This constraint is enabled by geostrophy and the nonseparability of the wave-number-frequency spectrum of SSH variance revealed by the GPS data. The frequency spectra of kinetic energy and SSH variance follow different power laws, and the difference constrains the spectral content in wavenumber space, allowing for a constraint without the need to actually resolve the submesoscales in space. In all four locations studied, spanning the midlatitude and subtropical ocean, these constraints indicate that the wavenumber spectral roll-off of submesoscale SSH variance is between about k24 and k25, where k is the wavenumber. These estimates are consistent with previous observa-tions, model results, and theoretical predictions. They provide for a strong prior for the interpretation of upcoming high-resolution satellite data.

TI  - Development of a linear-nonlinear hybrid special model to predict monthly runoff in a catchment area and evaluate its performance with novel machine learning methods
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecasting of runoff as an important hydrological variable is a key task for water resources planning and management. Given the importance of this variable, in the current study, a multivariate linear stochastic model (MLSM) is combined with a multilayer nonlinear machine learning model (MNMLM) to generate a hybrid model for the spatial and temporal simulation of runoff in the Quebec basin, Canada. Monthly hydrological data from 2001 to 2013, including precipitation and runoff data from nine stations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extraction of MODIS data, are applied as input to the proposed hybrid model. At the first step of the hybrid modeling, data normality and stationary were examined by performing various tests. In the second step, MLSM was developed by defining four different scenarios and as a result 15 sub-scenarios. The first and second scenarios were developed based on one exogenous variable (precipitation or NDVI). In contrast, the second and third scenarios were developed based on two additional variables. In the first and third scenarios, the data are modeled without preprocessing. In the second and fourth scenarios, a preprocessing step is performed on the data. Then, in the third step, various combinations based on different time delays from runoff data were applied for developing nonlinear model. The comparisons are made between observed and simulated time series at various stations and based on the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The efficiency of the proposed hybrid model is compared with a novel machine learning model that was introduced in 2021 by Sultani et al., and it was also compared with the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear models. In most stations, delays (t-1) and (t-24) are identified as the most effective delays in hybrid and nonlinear modeling of runoff. Also, in most stations, the use of climatic parameters and physiographic factors as exogenous variables along with runoff data improves the results compared to the use of one variable. Results showed that at all stations, proposed hybrid model generally leads to more accurate estimates of runoff compared with various linear and nonlinear models. More accurate estimates of peak runoff values at all stations were another excellence of proposed hybrid model than other models.

TI  - The climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies based on their cooling effect in Poyang and Dongting lake regions, China
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Most publications have focused on the cooling effect of urban inside water bodies. However, the climate adaptive characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies is seldom studied. In this paper, three types of water bodies, i.e., urban inside water bodies, urban outside discrete water bodies and large water bodies are identified according to their relative spatial relationships with built-up areas. The climate adaptive landscape characteristics of water bodies are analyzed based on water bodies' cooling effect (WCE) inside and outside cities in the Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake regions. Seventy-three Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images acquired from 1989 to 2019 are employed. Landscape scale characteristics of urban inside/outside water bodies are described by area, water depth, perimeter to area ratio (PARA) and distance-weighted area index (DWAI). Three temperature-related parameters are calculated to estimate the WCE in different conditions. Climate adaptive characteristics of water bodies inside/outside cities are determined by corre-lation and regression analysis. Results show that: 1) The long river shape, depth, orientation and fluidity of urban inside water bodies are benefit to enhance their cooling effect; 2) the distance of urban outside water bodies from built-up areas are positive correlated with their cooling effect; 3) the optimal acreage of large water bodies are >2500 km2 and 1111-1287.5 km2 for climate adaption of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, respectively. Simultaneously, the WCE of urban outside large water bodies is related with human activities and climate conditions. The results of our study provide a significant contribution to blue-space planning in cities, and provide insights into actionable climate adaption planning in inland large lake areas.

TI  - Study of geothermal and volcanic activity at Mount Awu, the deadliest active volcano in North Sulawesi Province, Indonesia using Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of the north part of Sangihe Island is the motivation for using the strengths of remote sensing methods to monitor the volcano activities and geothermal potential of Awu Volcano. We used the last 50 years of satellite image data composed by Landsat 1, Landsat 4, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, ASTER, and Landsat 8 to get the multi-temporal analysis and results. This study used the single-channel algorithm to derive land surface temperature (LST). We also used the band combination and ratio to understand the relationship between the Awu Volcano's geological condition and geothermal potential. The NDVI result as a component of the LST calculation shows that the vegetation is increasing when there is no eruption event. However, the amount of vegetation decreased after the 1994 and 2004 eruptions. The LST results show the 2004 eruption gave the highest surface temperature in the last 50 years, with a number of 318.69 degrees K as the mean value in the caldera. The multitemporal nature of LST explained the activity of Awu Volcano, including the increased status announced by the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) in 2016 and 2021. The accuracy of LST results is seen by the same pattern in the LST provided from the Landsat and ASTER data and the R2 of time and LST with the values of 0.1529 and 0.2436 in the volcano slope and caldera, respectively. The long gap between the phreatic eruption in 1994 and the previous eruption in 1964 revealed that there was a caldera lake formed in Awu Volcano, which was detected by the natural color band combination from 1972 to 1996. The geothermal potential is centralized in the volcano slope around the caldera, with a value of almost 10 degrees K and some areas in the slope with a value of >5 degrees K. The first area that contains high geothermal potential is located in the basaltic andesite, with the alteration detected by the combination of bands 7/4, 6/3, and 5/7. Mount Awu's multiple eruptions have shown that multi-source optical satellites could be used to keep an eye on volcanic activity and could also be used as a first step in figuring out geothermal potential.

TI  - Agricultural fallows are the main driver of natural forest regeneration in Tanzania
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates and drivers of natural forest regeneration are areas of uncertainty for policy, forest management and climate change mitigation. In this study, the rate of deforestation and the rate and drivers of natural regeneration are described for 56 million hectares of village land in Tanzania, a country undergoing rapid deforestation. To determine the regeneration and deforestation rates, remote sensing (RS) data for 500 randomly selected points were reviewed for a 34 year period from 1987 to 2021 using Google Earth Engine. Over this period, regeneration, involving a transition from forest to non-forest and back to forest was detected on 4.8% of village land (95% CI: 3.1%-7.1%), while 0.8% of land transitioned from non-forest to forest (95% CI: 0.2%-2.04%). 22% of village land was deforested (95% CI: 18.6%-26.1%), equivalent to a mean annual net loss of 0.35 million hectares of forest. Using a combination of RS data, field plots and structured interviews, the land cover change trajectories of 180 regenerating plots, in 10 sampling clusters, were assessed to identify regeneration drivers and assess biomass and tree species accumulation rates. Agricultural fallows are the regeneration driver in 47% of plots (95% CI: 39.8%-54.8%). Other common regeneration drivers include abandonment of cultivated areas for reasons apart from fallowing, conservation and post wood-extraction abandonment in 19% (95% CI: 13.9%-26%), 18.3% (95% CI: 13%-24.8%) and 12.8% (95% CI: 8.3%-18.6%) of plots, respectively. The mean carbon sequestration rate was 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1), equivalent to 4.3 Tg C y(-1) (95% CI: 3.9-4.7 Tg C y(-1)) across the 3.15 million hectares of regenerating village land forest. The mean species accumulation rate was 1.08 species y(-1) (95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Regeneration time, location and precipitation have the greatest influence on biomass and species richness. The study highlights the potential for natural regeneration to contribute to global and national climate and biodiversity goals and to sustainable, productive forest management. The importance of cooperation and policy-alignment between the forest, agriculture and land sectors are under-scored.

TI  - Adaptation in Modern Times Placide Tempels, Luba, and Bantu Philosophy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the beginning of Christian mission, adaptation to local cultures (later called acculturation or inculturation) has been the main factor in mission failure or success. Placide Tempels is considered a pioneer of adaptation in modern times. He was a Flemish Franciscan missionary in Congo from 1933 to 1962 (with two breaks) and is well known for his adaptation to the Bantu worldview. Referring to spiritual and intellectual adaptation, the paper will answer the following questions: Was the adaptation of Placide Tempels successful? If it was or was not, why and in what way? The analysis will be linked to William Biernatzki's theory of root paradigms and meanings. To conclude, a connection will be made to the process of adaptation in international mission organizations today.

TI  - Predictive lithology mapping using semisupervised learning: Practical insights using a case study from New South Wales, Australia
T2  - GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a comprehensive study involving three different types of machine learning (unsupervised, supervised, and semi -supervised, which we emphasize) for bedrock-lithology classifi-cation using a publicly available data set from New South Wales, Australia. The goal of this work is to demonstrate (1) the value each different type of machine learning can provide and (2) which machine learning type(s) may be preferable under different circumstances. Training data are characteristically limited for geoscience problems, which makes supervised techniques sus-ceptible to overfitting; we explore if semisupervised methods can perform better in these circumstances. Using the geophysical data and geologic map provided for the study area, we compare the performance of two supervised methods (the Light Gradient Boosting Machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) with one semisupervised algorithm (label propagation [LP]) in three sce-narios with varied limited a priori lithologic constraints (i.e., the training data). Hyperparameter tuning is an essential component of supervised and semisupervised techniques, and the default procedure is to choose the hyperparameter combination with the largest mean cross-validation score. However, we use a new hyperparameter selection strategy that simultaneously uses the mean and standard deviation scores, and we test this new tactic for supervised and semisupervised methods. The results indicate (1) that the new hyperparameter selection technique can slightly improve the performance for supervised and semisupervised methods by 1%-2% compared with the standard selection ap-proach and (2) that LP can outperform the two supervised meth-ods by up to 10%, but it depends on how the training data are distributed. As for the unsupervised analysis, the clusters indicate heterogeneous regions that correlate well with the high-entropy areas in the supervised and semisupervised results. The clustering provides complementary results to the other two types of machine learning and is a source of supporting evidence for suggesting where more in-depth field mapping may be needed.

TI  - Application of habitat association models across regions: Useful explanatory power retained in wetland bird case study
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Species often exhibit regionally specific habitat associations, so habitat association models developed in one region might not be accurate or even appropriate for other regions. Three programs to survey wetland-breeding birds covering (respectively) Great Lakes coastal wetlands, inland Great Lakes wetlands, and the Prairie Pothole Region offer an opportunity to test whether regionally specific models of habitat use by wetland-obligate breeding birds are transferrable across regions. We first developed independent, regional population density models for four species of wetland-obligate birds: Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), Sora (Porzana carolina), and American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). We then used adjusted pseudo-R-2 values to compare the amount of variation explained by each model when applied to data collected in each of the three regions. Although certain habitat characteristics, such as emergent vegetation and wetland area, were consistently important across regions, models for each species differed by region-both in variables selected for inclusion and often in the directionality of relationships for common variables-indicating that habitat associations for these species are regionally specific. When we applied a model developed in one region to data collected in another region, we found that explanatory power was reduced in most (71%) models. Therefore, we suggest that ecological analyses should emphasize regionally specific habitat association models whenever possible. Nonetheless, models created from inland Great Lakes wetland data had higher median explanatory power when applied to other regions, and the amount of explanatory power lost by other transferred models was relatively small. Thus, while regionally specific habitat association models are preferable, in the absence of reliable regional data, habitat association models developed in one region may be applied to another region, but the results need to be cautiously interpreted. Additionally, we found that median explanatory power was higher when local-scale habitat characteristics were included in the models, indicating that regionally specific models should ideally be based on a combination of local- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics. Conservation practitioners can leverage such regionally specific models and associated monitoring data to help prioritize areas for management activities that contribute to regional conservation efforts.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Dynamic Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Penile Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY FOCUS
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: A dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) is used for inguinal lymph node staging in patients presenting with primary penile cancer with clinically impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0). Further completion radical inguinal lymph node dissection (RLND) is offered to patients diagnosed with metastatic inguinal nodes following a DSNB. Objective: To identify the diagnostic accuracy of a DSNB and RLND to detect lymph node metastasis. Evidence acquisition: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed Medscape, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database for relevant studies between January 1, 2000 and April 30, 2022. Studies were included if a DSNB was offered to cN0 patients and if RLND was offered to patients with positive histology at the DSNB. Risk of bias and confounding assessments were performed. Diagnostic odds ratio, pooled sensitivity/specificity, and heterogeneity analyses were displayed. Evidence synthesis: Overall, 2893 patients in the 28 studies analysed underwent a DSNB. Twenty-one studies reported patients undergoing RLND for a positive DSNB. A DSNB showed pooled weighted sensitivity of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.91) and pooled log diagnostic odds ratio of 6.17 (95% CI: 5.47-6.87). A DSNB showed pooled weighted sensitivity of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.24-0.59), specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78-0.87), and a log diagnostic odds ratio of 1.18 (95% CI: 0.29-2.97) for detecting further positive lymph nodes at RLND. High heterogeneity, mostly caused by study design, characteristics of the included patients, DSNB technique used, surgical experience/centre case volumes, and follow-up schedule, represents the main limitation of this meta-analysis. Several sensitivity analyses to address these issues support our findings. Conclusions: A positive DSNB is poorly able to discriminate which patients will have further metastatic involvement at completion RLND. Better stratification of these patients would avoid unnecessary overtreatment and possible postoperative comorbidities. Patient summary: This analysis of the data from the published literature provides evidence that the diagnostic accuracy of a dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) requires further improvement. Moreover, a high proportion of patients with a positive DSNB undergo unnecessary radical lymph node dissection; better stratification of these patients might help determine avoidable overtreatment and postoperative comorbidities. & COPY; 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

AB  - Fernandez-Fernandez, J, Moreno-Perez, V, Cools, A, Nakamura, FY, Teixeira, AS, Ellenbecker, T, Johansson, F, and Sanz-Rivas, D. The effects of a compensatory training program adding an isoinertial device in the shoulder function on young tennis players. J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1096-1103, 2023-The aim of this study was to analyze whether a compensatory training program, including isoinertial flywheel training, could reduce shoulder imbalances in a group of asymptomatic young tennis players. After an initial evaluation, 26 young tennis players were assigned to either a supervised flywheel training group (FTG, n = 13) or a control group (CG, n = 13). Shoulder passive internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM) as well as shoulder IR and ER maximal isometric strength were measured before and after a 12-week training intervention, performed 3 times per week. After the intervention, results showed significant changes for IR (p < 0.001, effect size [ES] = 1.83) and ER (p < 0.001, ES = 1.77) on the dominant (D) side, and IR on the nondominant (ND) side (p < 0.001, ES = 2.24) in the FTG compared with the CG. Regarding the ROM values, results showed that the FTG achieved significantly greater increases for the IR ROM (p < 0.001, ES = 3.32) and total ROM (TROM) (p = 0.004, ES = 1.39) on the D and ND sides (IR ROM: p = 0.002, ES = 1.53; TROM: p < 0.001, ES = 2.35) than the CG. Moreover, the CG displayed larger decrements in ER ROM (p = 0.016, ES = 1.12) on the ND side after the training period than the FTG. The conducted compensatory training program was effective to increase the ER strength and IR mobility of the FTG players, which led to a reduction in the glenohumeral imbalances.

TI  - Increasing trends of cervical conization with lymph node evaluation for fertility-sparing surgery in early cervical cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To examine uptake, characteristics, and survival outcome of less-radical fertility-sparing surgery with cervical conization and lymph node evaluation (Cone-LN) in reproductive age patients with early cervical cancer.Methods. This retrospective cohort study examined the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiol-ogy, and End Results Program. The study population included 407 patients aged <50 years with stage IA-IB2 (<= 4 cm) cervical cancer who received fertility-sparing surgery from 2004 to 2019. The exposure was fertility-sparing surgery type: Cone-LN (n = 196) or trachelectomy with lymph node evaluation (Trach-LN, n = 211). The main co-outcomes were (i) temporal trends of surgery type, assessed with Cochran-Armitage test, and (ii) clinical and tumor characteristics, assessed with multivariable binary logistic regression model. The secondary outcome was overall survival, assessed with inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score.Results. The number of patients receiving Cone-LN increased from 43.5% in 2004-2007 to 58.4% in 2016-2019 (P-trend = 0.005). Patients receiving conization and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy alone increased from 0% to 14.4% (P-trend < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, patients in the Cone-LN group were more likely to undergo SLN biopsy (aOR 6.04) compared to those in the Trach-LN group whereas those with adenocarcinoma (aOR 0.49) and T1b tumors (aOR for <= 2 cm 0.21, and aOR for 2.1-4.0 cm 0.10) were less likely to receive Cone-LN. In a pro-pensity score-weighted model, the Cone-LN and Trach-LN groups had comparable overall survival (7-year rates, 98.9% vs 97.8%). Similar associations were observed for patients with squamous, adenocarcinoma / adenosquamous, T1a classification, and T1b(<= 2cm) classification.Conclusion. The current population-based analysis suggests that the performance of cervical conization with lymph node evaluation, particularly with SLN biopsy, is gradually increasing for early cervical cancer patients desiring future fertility.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma producing prominent basal lamina with neuroendocrine differentiation: A case report
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is a heterogeneous group of invasive breast carcinomas (IBCs) characterized by the differentiation of the neoplastic epithelium toward squamous cells and/or mesenchymal-appearing elements. The present study describes the case of a 42-year-old woman who underwent a mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for two tumors in their left breast. One of the resected tumors was diagnosed as MBC with neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation and the other was diagnosed as IBC of no special type. The MBC tumor contained a matrix composed of basal lamina with a focal area of myxoid matrix and squamoid differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report of MBC producing prominent basal lamina. The patient has remained alive and well for >10 years without recurrence, and has been treated with oral and injected anticancer drugs.

TI  - Heterogeneity and non-linearity of ecosystem responses to climate change in the Qilian Mountains National Park, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem responses to climate change, particularly in arid environments, is an understudied topic. This study conducted a spatial analysis of ecosystem responses to short-term variability in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation in the Qilian Mountains National Park, an arid mountainous region in Northwest China. We collected precipitation and temperature data from the National Science and Technology Infrastructure Platform, solar radiation data from the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset, and vegetation cover remote-sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. We used the vegetation sensitivity index to identify areas sensitive to climate change and to determine which climatic factors were significant in this regard. The findings revealed a high degree of heterogeneity and non-linearity of ecosystem responses to climate change. Four types of heterogeneity were identified: longitude, altitude, ecosystem, and climate disturbance. Furthermore, the characteristics of nonlinear ecosystem responses to climate change included: (1) inconsistency in the controlling climatic factors for the same ecosystems in different geographical settings; (2) the interaction between different climatic factors results in varying weights that affect ecosystem stability and makes them difficult to determine; and (3) the hysteresis effect of vegetation increases the uncertainty of ecosystem responses to climate change. The findings are significant because they highlight the complexity of ecosystem responses to climate change. Furthermore, the identification of areas that are particularly sensitive to climate change and the influencing factors has important implications for predicting and managing the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, which can help protect the stability of ecosystems in the Qilian Mountains National Park.

TI  - Global vegetation greenness interannual variability and its evolvement in recent decades
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interannual variability (IAV) of global vegetation greenness needs careful assessment as it relates to the stability of the climate, conservation of biodiversity, sustainable ecosystem services, and global food security. Here, we investigated the spatial feature and temporal evolvement of global vegetation greenness interannual variability from 1982 to 2015 using the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index third generation (NDVI3g) data. Generally, regions with herbaceous and short woody plants had larger IAV of vegetation greenness than those with tall woody biome types (7.9% versus 2.9%). On average, all the biomes displayed increasing IAV of vegetation greenness from 1982 to 2015, with notable increases over northern high latitudes (0.135%/year), Eastern Europe (0.037%//year), and Central Australia (0.231%/year). Croplands in China and India experienced decreasing IAV of vegetation greenness (-0.037%/year for China and -0.004%/year for India). The changing IAV of vegetation greenness had implications for climatic, environmental, and anthropogenic changes that influence vegetation dynamics. Some note-worthy factors include climate warming, the CO2 fertilization effect, agricultural practice improvement, cropland abandonment, and China's Grain-for-Green Program.

TI  - Handling unexpected inputs: incorporating source-wise out-of-distribution detection into SAR-optical data fusion for scene classification
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite data is widely used for deep learning based scene classification. Counter-intuitively such neural networks are still sensitive to changes in single data sources, which can lead to unexpected behavior and a significant drop in performance when individual sensors fail or when clouds obscure the optical image. In this paper we incorporate source-wise out-of-distribution (OOD) detection into the fusion process at test time in order to not consider unuseful or even harmful information for the prediction. As a result, we propose a modified training procedure together with an adaptive fusion approach that weights the extracted information based on the source-wise in-distribution probabilities. We evaluate the proposed approach on the BigEarthNet multilabel scene classification data set and several additional OOD test cases as missing or damaged data, clouds, unknown classes, and coverage by snow and ice. The results show a significant improvement in robustness to different types of OOD data affecting only individual data sources. At the same time the approach maintains the classification performance of the baseline approaches compared. The code for the experiments of this paper is available on GitHub:

TI  - Flood risk on arid alluvial fans: a case study in the Joghatay Mountains, Northeast Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the common hazards related to alluvial fans, flooding is one of the most important. Nonetheless, in populated alluvial fans, not only the natural processes are effective in floods, but the artificial structures and modifications can change the behavior of flooding and its potential risks. This study aims to indicate the flood-prone landforms in a set of populated alluvial fans in an arid region and investigate the role of anthropogenic activities in controlling/exacerbating flooding in alluvial fans. To achieve this goal, 15 Ground Range Detected in High resolution (GRDH) SAR Sentinel-1 images, covering a total of 24 alluvial fans, were acquired. Pre-processing and post-processing steps were applied to all images to identify flood-prone sections of the studied alluvial fans. The results showed that feeder channels, spreading sites, and wide interfluves are the most flood-prone landforms of alluvial fans. In terms of anthropogenic modifications to mitigate flooding, a rampart system is distributed in the study area. Ramparts are levee like structures formed from the fan material. They aim to mitigate flood hazard on residential areas, infrastructures, and agricultural lands of the study area. Results show that the rampart system can reduce the danger of floods, but it cannot be considered a long-term solution. Therefore, a comprehensive flood protection system distributed throughout the whole alluvial fan system is needed. Results also reveal that in regions where flood monitoring is challenging, SAR images can be used as a freely available data set to monitor and identify flooding hotspots.

T2  - MATRAGA-ESTUDOS LINGUISTICOS E LITERARIO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, how the concept ideology is conceptually constructed in the presidential speeches of Jair Bolsonaro's first year in office, in the light of Conceptual Metaphor Theory (LAKOFF; JONHSON, 1980; MUSOLFF, 2004, 2016; GOATLY, 2007; SARDINHA, 2007). For this end, Critical Metaphor Analysis and the moral models proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1999) and Lakoff (2002) are used to understand which worldview -ideology -motivates, in political discourse, the emergence of conceptual metaphors. To conduct such an investigation, speeches given by the president of the republic made available on the Palacio do Planalto website were collected to find excerpts in which the lexical items < left >, < socialism >, < communism >, < red > and < ideology > occurred. The results show the presence of the conceptual metaphors IDEOLOGY IS DIRT, IDEOLOGY IS INvADER, IDEOLOGY IS ROMANTIC pAIR and IDEOLOGY IS THIEF, which were motivated by the STRICT FATHER moral model.

TI  - The Sacred Trees: A Worldview in The Chthulucene
T2  - GRAGOATA-UFF
M3  - Article
AB  - the present paper proposes reflections upon the perspective of ecocritical thought based on the reading of the short stories "A palmeira de Nguezi" and "O embondeiro que sonhava passaros" by Mia Couto. By revealing the importance of the tree as a sacred symbol in the tales, the Mozambican writer presents connections of ancestry through a worldview that inseparably integrates the human and nature. The intergenerational legacy of diverse cultures belonging to traditional peoples around the world has been affected by negative interference in the environment dictated by colonizing processes. In this scenario, in which ancestral knowledge is included, we highlight the Chthulucene proposed by Donna Haraway in which "we are at stake to each other". We highlight the importance of the themes related to the geological times proposed by Paul Crutzen (Anthropocene), Jason Moore (Capitalocene), and Donna Haraway (Chthulucene), as well as issues of otherness when referencing the becoming-vegetable represented in the tales of Mia Couto as an inseparable human and nature relationship. In front of the perspective, we sought to bring to light the ecocritical discourse, anchored in the Chthulucene, the rescue of the Mozambican ancestry connected with "A palmeira de Nguezi" and "O embondeiro que sonhava passaros". Considering the transdisciplinarity in the literary and environmental context, the tales analyzed point to the intrinsic relationship between human and nature and awaken to a better understanding of human actions concerning otherness and decolonial reflections.

T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is an approach to artificial intelligence characterised by the use of algorithms that improve their own performance at a given task (e.g. classification or prediction) based on data and without being explicitly and fully instructed on how to achieve this. Surveillance systems for animal and zoonotic diseases depend upon effective com-pletion of a broad range of tasks, some of them amenable to ML algorithms. As in other fields, the use of ML in animal and veterinary public health surveillance has greatly expanded in recent years. Machine learning algorithms are being used to accomplish tasks that have become attainable only with the advent of large data sets, new methods for their analysis and increased computing capacity. Examples include the identification of an underlying structure in large volumes of data from an ongoing stream of abattoir condemnation records, the use of deep learning to identify lesions in digital images obtained during slaughtering, and the mining of free text in electronic health records from veterinary practices for the purpose of sentinel surveillance. However, ML is also being applied to tasks that previously relied on traditional statistical data analysis. Statistical models have been used extensively to infer relationships between pre-dictors and disease to inform risk-based surveillance, and increasingly, ML algorithms are being used for prediction and forecasting of animal diseases in support of more targeted and efficient surveillance. While ML and inferential sta-tistics can accomplish similar tasks, they have different strengths, making one or the other more or less appropriate in a given context.

TI  - Oilseed Rape Yield Estimation Based on the WOFOST Model and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving rapid and accurate crop yield estimation on a large regional scale is significant for China's food security, crop planting structure adjustment, and import and export trade. Oilseed rape is one such commodity in high demand for both national and global consumptions. The development of remote sensing technology has brought new innovations to agricultural yield estimation. Research on oilseed rape in Hubei province sought effective, practical use of limited ground observation data to estimate its yield in a large area. By combining remote sensing data and meteorological data, changes in leaf area index (LAI) during growth and key growth periods are simulated through WOFOST model. The results were used to build a large regional rape yield estimation algorithm based on GF-1 WFV data. The study found that the comprehensive LAI of rape bud moss stage and flowering stage can achieve early, accurate prediction of rape yield. In the bud moss stage, the SR vegetation index showed the best correlation with LAI whereas in the flowering stage, the visible light atmospheric impedance ( VARIgreen) vegetation index has the best correlation with LAI. The yield estimation algorithm was then tested in Yangxin county to verify its effectiveness and robustness. Results show the yield estimation error is <6% in contrast to the yield data in the statistical yearbook, indicating that the proposed algorithm has potential usability in large regional scale rape yield estimation.

TI  - A Cross-sectional Survey to Assess Awareness of Syndromic Surveillance by Clinicians Practicing Emergency Medicine: An Opportunity for Education and Collaboration
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Syndromic surveillance (SyS) is an important public health tool using de-identified healthcare discharge data from emergency department (ED) and urgent care settings to rapidly identify new health threats and provide insight into current community well-being. While SyS is directly fed by clinical documentation such as chief complaint or discharge diagnosis, the degree to which clinicians are aware their documentation directly influences public health investigations is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the degree to which clinicians practicing in Kansas EDs or urgent care settings were aware that certain de-identified aspects of their documentation are used in public health surveillance and to identify barriers to improved data representation.Methods: We distributed an anonymous survey August-November 2021 to clinicians practicing at least part time in emergency or urgent care settings in Kansas. We then compared responses from emergency medicine (EM)-trained physicians to non-EM trained physicians. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis.Results: A total of 189 respondents across 41 Kansas counties responded to the survey. Of those surveyed, 132 (83%) were unaware of SyS. Knowledge did not differ significantly by specialty, practice setting, urban region, age, nor by experience level. Respondents were unaware of which aspects of their documentation were visible to public health entities, or how quickly records were retrievable. When asked about improving documentation for SyS, lack of clinician awareness (71.5%) was perceived as a greater barrier than electronic health record platform usability or time available to document (61% and 59%, respectively).Conclusion: This survey suggests that most practitioners in EM have not heard of SyS and are unaware of the invaluable role certain aspects of their documentation play in public health. Critical information that would be captured and coded into a key syndrome is often missing, but clinicians are unaware of what types of information may be most useful in their documentation, and where to document that information. Lack of knowledge or awareness was identified by clinicians as the single greatest barrier to enhancing surveillance data quality. Increased awareness of this important tool may lead to enhanced utility for timely and impactful surveillance through improved data quality and collaboration between EM practitioners and public health.

AB  - - Palembang City is divided into two regions by the Musi river, and there are 114 tributaries streamed within Palembang City, with 31.58% located in the Seberang Ilir region and 68.42% in the Seberang Ulu region. In the lowland topography of Palembang City, with most of the region below 5 m above mean sea level, flooding becomes repetitive. This paper examines the flooded area within the Bendung river basin using multi-temporal composite remote sensing radar data from Sentinel 1. Flood events in November 2018 and December 2021 were selected. The flood extent and affected populations will be calculated using Information System (GIS) application. In this study, flood extent was delineated and compared for different digital elevation models. It is found that the threshold value, the DEM, and the availability of radar data in conjunction with the flood event will better delineate the affected area to the flood. The DEM contributed a 37.5% to 83% difference in the delineated area calculation. The script in the GEE is customizable for different areas of interest and can be applied to different areas with adjustments to the threshold value that should be a minimum of 1.0 or higher.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes methods for studying the nature and motives of religiosity of the population in the context of ideologically tinged academic science. The academic scientific approach to the studied branch, in this case, the religiosity of the population, ensured a large array of empirical material and the possibility to classify and structure it. This enriched the science of religion with new facts. The idea that religiosity could be overcome with the help of fundamental educational and scientific propaganda was refuted by data on the development of religiosity in the territory of Soviet Ukraine. The shortcoming of dominance of ideology in scientific research is revealed. The study of the phenomenon of religiosity led to false ideological conclusions about the backwardness of the religious worldview, and of the alleged spiritual poverty of a religious person in comparison with the bearer of an atheistic, scientific worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is of paramount importance for ecosystems, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The major aim of the current study is to monitor vegetation and land use changes, and run drought assessment using field and satellite data. The main precipitation proportions in the studied region are influenced by the Westerlies, meaning that any variations in these precipitation systems significantly impact the region. The utilized data entailed MODIS images for 16- and 8-day intervals between 2000 and 2013, TM and OLI sensor images recorded in 1985 and 2013, precipitation network data of TRMM satellite between 2000 and 2013, and synoptic data 32-year period. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to monitor temporal changes in meteorological station data in annual and seasonal scales. The results indicated that there was a downward trend in 50% of the meteorological stations in the annual scale. This falling trend was statistically significant at the level of 95%. At the end, drought was assessed using PCI, APCI, VSWI, and NVSWI. The results showed that vegetation, forest, pasture, and agriculture areas recorded the strongest correlations with initial precipitation at the beginning of the study. Based on interactions among various factors influencing vegetation indices, reduction in green vegetation, especially the area of oak forests in the studied period, is around 95,744 hectares, which is attributed to lower precipitation rate. Increasing of agricultural land and water zones during the studied years is the result of human management and depends on how surface and underground water resources are exploited.

In addition, it is crucial to update these inventories due to the highly dynamic characteristics of the wetlands. Remote sensing technologies capturing high-resolution and multi-temporal views of landscapes are incredibly beneficial in wetland mapping compared to traditional methods. Taking advantage of the Google Earth Engine's computational power and multi-source earth observation data from Sentinel-1 multi-spectral sensor and Sentinel-2 radar, we generated a 10 m nationwide wetlands inventory map for Iran. The whole country is mapped using an object-based image processing framework, containing SNIC superpixel segmentation and a Random Forest classifier that was performed for four different ecological zones of Iran separately. Reference data was provided by different sources and through both field and office-based methods. Almost 70% of this data was used for the training stage and the other 30% for evaluation. The whole map overall accuracy was 96.39% and the producer's accuracy for wetland classes ranged from nearly 65 to 99%. It is estimated that 22,384 km(2) of Iran are covered with water bodies and wetland classes, and emergent and shrub-dominated are the most common wetland classes in Iran. Considering the water crisis that has been started in Iran, the resulting ever-demanding map of Iranian wetland sites offers remarkable information about wetland boundaries and spatial distribution of wetland species, and therefore it is helpful for both governmental and commercial sectors.

TI  - The role of cannabis<i> (Cannabis</i><i> sativa)</i> cultivation growth as a driving force in and use and cover change (LUCC) in the upstream part of the Laou river catchment area (Northern Morocco)*
T2  - DOCUMENTS D ANALISI GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The population of the Rif mountains in Morocco depends mainly on the cultivation of cannabis for its livelihood. This study shows the role played by such cultivation in land-scape changes in the upstream part of the Laou river catchment area between 1985 and 2019. The analysis was developed using Landsat data. The results indicate that cannabis cultivation has contributed to accelerating the process of LUCC, given that most types of forests were largely transformed to cultivated areas. The increasing pressure on agricultural land, especially after agricultural innovations and the culture of new cannabis hybrids, has had serious consequences on the environment, economy and society. This has been dem-onstrated in the intensive exploitation of water, and as a result several areas are now denied access to drinking and irrigation water. To reduce the harm of these transformations, diversified and sustainable agricultural practices must be restored to their previous state.

TI  - Observations and interpretations of geomorphologic features in the Tianwen-1 landing area on Mars by using orbital imagery data
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's first Mars exploration mission, Tianwen-1, successfully landed in southern Utopia Planitia on Mars on May 15, 2021. This work presents a detailed investigation of the geologic context of the landing area surface for this mission based on orbital remote-sensing data. We constructed a geomorphologic map for the Tianwen-1 landing area. Results of our detailed geomorphologic map show several major landforms within the landing area, including rampart craters, mesas, troughs, cones, and ridges. Analysis of materials on the landing area surface indicates that most of the landing area is covered by Martian dust. Transverse aeolian ridges are widely distributed within the landing area, indicating the surface contexts were (and still are) modified by regional winds. In addition, a crater counting analysis indicates the landing area has an absolute model age of similar to 3.3 Ga and that a later resurfacing event occurred at similar to 1.6 Ga. Finally, we outline four formational scenarios to test the formation mechanisms for the geomorphologic features on the landing area surface. The most likely interpretation to explain the existence of the observed surface features can be summarized as follows: A thermal influence may have played an important role in the formation of the surface geomorphologic features; thus, igneous-related processes may have occurred in the landing area. Water ice may also have been involved in the construction of the primordial surface configuration. Subsequent resurfacing events and aeolian processes buried and modified the primordial surface.

TI  - Timing of seasonal influenza epidemics for 25 countries in Africa during 2010-19: a retrospective analysis
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Using country-specific surveillance data to describe influenza epidemic activity could inform decisions on the timing of influenza vaccination. We analysed surveillance data from African countries to characterise the timing of seasonal influenza epidemics to inform national vaccination strategies.Methods We used publicly available sentinel data from African countries reporting to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response FluNet platform that had 3-10 years of data collected during 2010-19. We calculated a 3-week moving proportion of samples positive for influenza virus and assessed epidemic timing using an aggregate average method. The start and end of each epidemic were defined as the first week when the proportion of positive samples exceeded or went below the annual mean, respectively, for at least 3 consecutive weeks. We categorised countries into five epidemic patterns: northern hemisphere-dominant, with epidemics occurring in October-March; southern hemisphere-dominant, with epidemics occurring in April-September; primarily northern hemisphere with some epidemic activity in southern hemisphere months; primarily southern hemisphere with some epidemic activity in northern hemisphere months; and year-round influenza transmission without a discernible northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere predominance (no clear pattern).Findings Of the 34 countries reporting data to FluNet, 25 had at least 3 years of data, representing 46% of the countries in Africa and 89% of Africa's population. Study countries reported RT-PCR respiratory virus results for a total of 503 609 specimens (median 12 971 [IQR 9607-20 960] per country-year), of which 74 001 (15%; median 2078 [IQR 1087-3008] per country-year) were positive for influenza viruses. 248 epidemics occurred across 236 country -years of data (median 10 [range 7-10] per country). Six (24%) countries had a northern hemisphere pattern (Algeria, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Morocco, Niger, and Tunisia). Eight (32%) had a primarily northern hemisphere pattern with some southern hemisphere epidemics (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Togo). Three (12%) had a primarily southern hemisphere pattern with some northern hemisphere epidemics (Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda). Three (12%) had a southern hemisphere pattern (Central African Republic, South Africa, and Zambia). Five (20%) had no clear pattern (Cote d'Ivoire, DR Congo, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Rwanda).Interpretation Most countries had identifiable influenza epidemic periods that could be used to inform authorities of non-seasonal and seasonal influenza activity, guide vaccine timing, and promote timely interventions.

TI  - Evaluation of an Emergency Department Visit Data Mental Health Dashboard
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context:Local health departments (LHDs) need timely county-level and subcounty-level data to monitor health-related trends, identify health disparities, and inform areas of highest need for interventions as part of their ongoing assessment responsibilities; yet, many health departments rely on secondary data that are not timely and cannot provide subcounty insights.Objective:We developed and evaluated a mental health dashboard in Tableau for an LHD audience featuring statewide syndromic surveillance emergency department (ED) data in North Carolina from the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT).Design:We developed a dashboard that provides counts, crude rates, and ED visit percentages at statewide and county levels, as well as breakdowns by zip code, sex, age group, race, ethnicity, and insurance coverage for 5 mental health conditions. We evaluated the dashboards through semistructured interviews and a Web-based survey that included the standardized usability questions from the System Usability Scale.Participants:Convenience sample of LHD public health epidemiologists, health educators, evaluators, and public health informaticians.Results:Six semistructured interview participants successfully navigated the dashboard but identified usability issues when asked to compare county-level trends displayed in different outputs (eg, tables vs graphs). Thirty respondents answered all questions on the System Usability Scale for the dashboard, which received an above average score of 86.Conclusions:The dashboards scored well on the System Usability Scale, but more research is needed to identify best practices in disseminating multiyear syndromic surveillance ED visit data on mental health conditions to LHDs.

TI  - Quantifying forest land-use changes using remote-sensing and CA-ANN model of Madhupur Sal Forests, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of forest cover due to anthropogenic activities is of great concern in the Madhupur Sal Forest in Bangladesh. This study explored the land use changes in the Sal Forest area from 1991 to 2020, with the prediction of 2030 and 2040. This study examined and analyzed the changes in five land use classes viz., waterbodies, settlement, Sal Forest, other vegetation, and bare land, and predict those classes using Cellular Automated Artificial Neural Network (CA -ANN) model. The Sankey diagram was employed to represent the change percentage of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). The LULC for 1991, 2000, 2010, and 2020 derived from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI images, were used to predict the periods of 2030 and 2040. During the last 30 years, the Sal Forest area decreased by 23.35%, whereas the settlement and bare land area increased by 107.19% and 160.89%. The greatest loss of the Sal Forest was observed from 1991 to 2000 by 46.20%. At the same period of time the settlements were increased by 92.68% indicating the encroachment of settlement in the Sal Forest area. The Sankey diagram revealed a major con-version was found between other vegetation and the Sal Forest area. There was a vis-`a-vis be-tween other vegetation and the Sal Forest area from 1991 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2010. Interestingly, there was no conversation of the Sal Forest area to other land use from 2010 to 2020, and the prediction showed that the Sal Forest area will be increased by 52.02% in 2040. The preservation and increment of the Sal Forest area suggested strong governmental policy implementation to preserve the forest.

TI  - Brazilian Indigenous Literature Facing Gaia: An Essay about the End
T2  - GRAGOATA-UFF
M3  - Article
AB  - The word ecology was coined by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834 - 1919) in 1869 to designate the scientific study of organisms in the context of their organic and/or inorganic environments. The word comes from the Greek terms oikos (house) and logos (study) and was created to name a new field in Western sciences. Indigenous peoples, in turn, did not establish any division between the concept of development of human life (civilization) and nature, fighting against the excessive exploitation of natural resources undertaken by the invaders since the beginning of the colonization. From the European perspective, this speech meant backwardness, being, therefore, refuted. However, global warming and successive environmental tragedies have been increasing the world interest on Native leaders' opinions about the theme. In Brazil, this change became remarkable during the 2020 pandemic, when Indigenous works about the Anthropocene became best-sellers. In this essay, I try to show how the mainstream is absorbing those ideas, linking Bruno Latour's (2020) worldview with Indigenous cosmogonies presented by several Brazilian authors, such as Ailton Krenak, Davi Kopenawa, Eliane Potiguara and Marcia Kambeba.

TI  - The Changes of Desertification and Its Driving Factors in the Gonghe Basin of North China over the Past 10 Years
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the most severe environmental and socioeconomic issues facing the world today. Gonghe Basin is located in the monsoon marginal zone of China, is a sensitive area of climate change in the northeastern of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, desertification issue has become very severe. Remote sensing monitoring provides an effective technical means for desertification control. In this study, we used Landsat images in 2010 and 2020 to extract desertification information to constructed the Albedo-NDVI feature space in the Gonghe Basin. And then analyzed temporal and spatial evolution of desertification and its driving factors using Geodetector in the Gonghe Basin from 2010 to 2020. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Albedo-NDVI feature space method can accurately classify desertification information with accuracy of more than 90%, which was benefit to quantitative analysis of desertification. (2) The desertification situation in the Gonghe Basin had improved from 2010 to 2020, especially in the west of the basin, desertification land area decreased by 827.46 km(2), and desertification intensity had been obviously reversed. (3) The changes of the desertification in the Gonghe Basin from 2010 to 2020 was affected by both natural and human factors, and the influence of human activities on desertification reversal had increased gradually. The results indicate that the desertification status in the Gonghe Basin had been effectively controlled, and can provide useful basis for the desertification combat in the Gonghe Basin.

TI  - Lateral Advection of Particulate Organic Matter in the Eastern Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Argo Abyssal Plain (AAP), south of Java and northwest of Australia in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean, is an oligotrophic region (low in chlorophyll and nutrients), downstream of the Indonesian throughflow. The processes that supply nitrogen to the AAP and support ecosystem production are unknown. Here we quantified lateral advection of particulate organic matter (POM) and the role of this advected POM in supplying new nitrogen (i.e., allochthonous nitrogen supply) to the mixed layer of the AAP using 14 yr of remotely sensed data, combined with sampling undertaken on a research cruise in February 2022. Our results indicate that the average net primary productivity of phytoplankton in this offshore oligotrophic region is 98.5 Gg C d(-1) and that lateral advection transports 1.21 Gg C d(-1) of particulate organic carbon (POC) into the region. We find that lateral advection of POM within the mixed layer supplies an annual average of 12% (95% C.I. = 5.2%-49%) of allochthonous "new" nitrogen supporting phytoplankton productivity, if regenerated to nutrients through microbial processes. Accounting for lateral transport in the deep euphotic zone, lateral transport supplies an average of 32% (10%->100%) of new nitrogen, although this calculation is less certain due to inability to constrain subsurface POM fields. Our data suggest that lateral advection is a quantitatively important but not dominant source of nitrogen supporting new production. Overall, approximately half of the lateral transport is driven by transient eddies (mostly during winter) highlighting the importance of mesoscale circulation.

TI  - Inland Flooding and Rainfall from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee (2011): Coupled Atmosphere-Wave-Ocean Model Simulations and Remote Sensing and In Situ Observations with a Machine Learning Tool
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland flooding from landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) is a major cause of death and damage to property and infrastructure worldwide. The mid-Atlantic region of the United States was devastated by Hurricane Irene and Tropi-cal Storm Lee during late August-early September 2011, when the two storms produced sequential heavy rainfall and record flooding. Many rivers and streams reached their all-time record discharge to date. This study aims at 1) better un-derstanding and predicting TC rainfall using various observed rainfall products and a high-resolution coupled atmosphere- wave-ocean model, namely, the Unified Wave Interface-Coupled Model (UWIN-CM), 2) characterizing inland flooding using streamflow data, and 3) improving prediction of TC-induced inland flooding using UWIN-CM and a machine learn-ing K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) model. The results show that there is a wide range of uncertainty in satellite and radar- gauge-observed rainfall products in terms of rain-rate distribution and cumulative rainfall over the mid-Atlantic region. UWIN-CM rainfall is closer to the radar-gauge data than satellite data over land. Streamflow in most large rivers (.500 cfs) peaked after Lee, which reflects the sequential rainfall contributions of the two storms. The rainfall-streamflow- discharge response times were dependent on the size of the stream and the peak rain rates. To better predict rainfall and flooding, UWIN-CM and observed rainfall are used with the machine learning KNN regression model for prediction of sever-ity of TC-induced inland flooding hazard. These results demonstrate the value of a stepped approach for rainfall and flood prediction toward a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-land/hydrology model in the future.

TI  - Long-range transport of sulfur dioxide emissions from external sources to Tehran
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the combustion of heavy fuel oils are deteri-orating the air quality in Tehran. Our analysis of the long-term SO2 emission data in Tehran showed that the magnitude of local SO2 emission sources is inadequate to reach current SO2 levels. Bivariate polar plots, k-mean cluster, pairwise polar correlation, and potential source contribution function analysis provided evidence of the impact of large-scale transport of SO2 emissions from external locations in the west/northwest, north/northeast, and south/south-western areas of Tehran. Further observations of these hotspots were observed in analyses con-ducted on TROPOMI satellite data confirming significant SO2 emissions from the consumption of heavy fuel oils in thermal power plants and oil/gas refineries. These results also strongly agreed with the NASA global SO2 emission source catalog showing the location of major SO2 emissions in the region. All approaches confirmed that Tehran is predominantly affected by regional transport of SO2 from external sources further away located in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and adjacent provinces neighboring Tehran. Approximately 80% of the total SO2 concentration in Tehran was observed to have impacts from the external hotspots outside of Tehran. While local emission sources only contribute around 20% of the total SO2 concentration.

TI  - Feasibility analysis of AERONET lunar AOD for nighttime particulate matter estimation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have attempted to estimate particulate matter (PM) concentrations using aerosol optical depth (AOD), based on AOD and PM relationships. Owing to the limited availability of nighttime AOD data, PM estimation studies using AOD have focused on daytime. Recently, the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) produced nighttime AOD, called lunar AOD, providing an opportunity to estimate nighttime PM. Nighttime AOD measurements are particularly important as they help fill gaps in our understanding of aerosol variability and its impact on the atmosphere, as there are significant variations in AOD between day and night. In this study, the relationship between lunar AOD and PM was investigated using data from AERONET station, meteorological station, and air pollution station in Seoul Metropolitan area from May 2016 to December 2019, and then PM estimation model was developed covering both daytime and nighttime using random forest machine learning techniques. We have found the differences in the importance of variables affecting the AOD-PM relationship between day and night from the random forest model. The AOD-PM relationship in the daytime was more affected by time-related variables, such as the day of the year among the variables. The new model was developed using additional lunar AOD data to estimate continuous PM concentrations. The results have shown that the model based on lunar AOD data estimated well PM10 and PM2.5 with similar performance of model using solar AOD. The results imply the possibility of seamless near-surface PM concentration data on a large scale once satellites produce nighttime AOD data.

TI  - A multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain based LULC change analysis and prediction using remote sensing data in Prayagraj district, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) mapping and temporal observations are indispensable drivers for sustainable development. This research showed the growth trends and land use transition for the Prayagraj district in the last three decades. Supervised classification of Landsat images was performed on 5-year temporal intervals using a maximum likelihood classifier. All satellite images were organized into six major LULC feature classes viz agriculture/open land, barren land, built-up, forest, sand, and water. The overall accuracy of LULC classification was achieved by more than 89% in all seven temporal points. Furthermore, the accuracy of the classified maps was estimated through area-based error matrix. The Land Change Modeler tool of TerrSet 2020 software was used to analyze the transition of classes and to incorporate the multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC) technique. The transition potentials were included in MLP-MC with the help of sensitive explanatory variables and significant transitions of classes. Furthermore, these transition potentials and the Markov chain transition matrix were used to predict the future LULC dynamics and vulnerability. The change analysis revealed that a significant portion of the agriculture/open land gradually decreased and got converted to built-up land. The results depicted that agriculture/open land was reduced by 8.03% in the last three decades while the built-up region was grown by 199.61%. Forest area was continuously decreasing while the sand area increased due to river meandering. Overall, more than 75% of accuracy was achieved in MLP. The prediction model was first validated with observed data, and then the LULC scenario of 2035 and 2050 was simulated. LULC of 2050 showed that the built-up area would likely reach 13.90% of district area whereas the forest area would remain only 0.79%. The prediction model has given the output in the form of future LULC map along with projected potential transition maps. This would be useful for sustainable urban planning to deal with the alarming rate of built-up growth and agriculture/open land shrinkage.

TI  - Block Adjustment of Satellite Images Supported by Spaceborne Photon Point Cloud
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The photon counting lidar earth observation means denoted by ICESat-2 have the features of small ground footprints, high repetition frequency, and multibeams. The plane accuracy and flight direction data density of acquired point cloud have been greatly improved. As a result, it can be applied as a novel three-dimensional control condition to enhance the precision of satellite image location. To address the application problem of photon point clouds without synchronous image recording plane position, the research suggests a technique to enhance the positional accuracy of satellite images supported by spaceborne photon counting laser point clouds. First, the three-dimensional terrain profile matching approach is used to achieve precise registration between photon point cloud data and digital surface model (DSM) for the automatic generation of satellite stereo images. Then, terrain feature points are retrieved from the photon profile point cloud based on slope change, and the common terrain feature control points are produced by combining several terrain features of DSM. Finally, the terrain feature points as planimetric and elevation control conditions are added into the satellite image block adjustment with additional parameters to further improve positioning accuracy. Experimental results on the ZY-3 satellite images and ATLAS ATL03 data in Shaanxi Province demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently improve the accuracy of the ZY-3 image plane and elevation positioning compared to completely uncontrolled positioning method and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) data-assisted positioning method. The proposed method's efficacy and viability are confirmed by the fact that the increasing rates of plane accuracy and elevation positioning accuracy over SRTM data can reach 60% and 34%, respectively.

AB  - Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the breast (LELC) is a rarely encountered form of breast carcinoma, and there is limited information treatment for this entity. We present a case of a 55-year-old postmenopausal female presenting with a left breast mass on screening mammogram with core needle biopsy showing lymphoepithelial carcinoma. The patient was treated with surgical resection of the mass and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Given the rarity of this type of breast carcinoma, our case study continues to add to the treatment considerations in the literature, specifically the role of sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Upstream Large-Scale Control of Subtropical Low-Cloud Climatology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the adjustment times of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on the control of low-cloud coverage (LCC) climatology by large-scale atmospheric conditions in the subtropics. Using monthly data, we calculate back-trajectories and use machine learning statistical models with feature selection capabilities to deter-mine the influence of local and upstream large-scale conditions on LCC for four physical cloud regimes: the stratocumulus (Sc) deck, the along-flow transition into the Sc deck ("Inflow"), the Sc-to-cumulus transition, and trade-cumulus clouds. All four regimes have unique local and upstream relationships with the large-scale meteorological variables within our pa-rameter space, with upstream controls of LCC being the dominant processes in Sc deck and Sc-to-cumulus transition re-gimes. The time scales associated with these upstream controls across all regimes are consistent with known adjustment time scales of the ABL, determined in both modeling and observational studies. We find that low-level thermodynamic stratification (estimated inversion strength) is not the most important large-scale variable for LCC prediction in transition and trade-cumulus regimes despite its ubiquitous use as a proxy for LCC throughout the subtropics. Including upstream control provides significant improvements to the skill of statistical models predicting monthly LCC, increasing explained variance on the order of 15% in the Inflow, Sc deck, and transition regimes, but provides no improvement in the trade-cumulus regime.

TI  - Impacts of human activities on morphological evolution in the Modaomen Estuary, China
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphology of the Modaomen Estuary (ME) has undergone drastic changes in recent decades, and quantifying the contribution of human activities and natural processes is crucial for estuary management. Using Landsat images, chart data, and hydrological and meteorological data, this study analyzed the evolution of the shoreline and subaqueous topography of the ME and attempted to quantify the extent of the contributions of human activities. The results show that local human activities dominated morphological evolution in some periods. From 1973 to 2003, the shoreline advanced rapidly seaward, resulting in approximately half of the water area being converted into land. Human activity is critical to this process, with the direct contribution of local land reclamation projects reaching more than 85%. After 2003, the shoreline remained relatively stable, probably due to a decrease in land reclamation projects. Regarding the evolution of subaqueous topography, the shoals in the estuary were heavily silted and gradually disappeared during 1983-2003, and the waterways narrowed and deepened. The average siltation rate decreased from 15.43 mm/a to -1.02 mm/a, indicating that the ME changed from sedimentation to slight erosion. By detecting variations of sediment load, we found that upstream human activities reduced river sediment, while downstream human activities significantly increased sediment input to the ME, leaving little change in the actual sediment input to the ME for a relatively long period. In addition, based on the empirical relationship between the sediment input and siltation rate, local human activities influenced the shift in the siltation state more than upstream and downstream human activities did. These findings suggest that more attention should be paid to local human activities to improve the estuarine management in the ME.

TI  - People Management (PM) policies and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): propositional relationship through integrative review
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO E SECRETARIADO-GESEC
M3  - Review
AB  - This research aims to develop arguments about the relationship between the area of People Management (PM) and the field of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through an integrative literature review. To this end, it follows a descriptive approach, through the selection of articles available in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo) and Scientific Periodicals Electronic Library (SPELL), from the last 5 years with data collection in November 2021. After 4 surveys with the descriptors 'management' and 'responsibility' 'people' or 'human resources', resulted in 47 articles in SPELL and 21 articles in Scielo. With content analysis, arguments were woven around the integration of the categories 'Human resources and social organizations', 'Social organizations and voluntary representation', 'Ethical dilemmas about information', 'Guardians of ethics', 'Support', 'Labor, capital and quality', 'Public servants', 'Humanizing conduct of processes', 'Human resource management in the public sector', 'Internal public, socially responsible posture', 'Negotiations', 'Creativity, ideas generation function', 'Performance evaluation and participation', 'Human resources, Laws and Telework', 'Inclusive and Sustainable Pro -business', 'Lack of cross-cultural model (East and West)', 'Speeches versus practice', 'Ecosystem, diversification of local economy', 'Gender equity, generational diversity, intersectionality -social, gender and skills differences', 'Hierarchies, excessive bureaucracies', 'Knowledge economy', 'Progressive worldview'. The arguments involve the urgency in the face of the emergence of studies focusing on thinking collectively about how to respond to society's needs, calling on people to design more collaborative, resilient, and responsive organizations.

TI  - A cloud optical and microphysical property product for the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager onboard China's Fengyun-4 satellites: The first version
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4 (FY-4), the latest collection of Chinese geostationary meteorological satellites, monitors the Eastern Hemisphere with high spatiotemporal resolutions. This study developed a cloud optical and microphysical property product for the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the FY-4 satellites. The product focuses on cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER) using a bi-spectral retrieval algorithm, and also includes cloud mask and phase using machine learning (ML) algorithms as prerequisites for COT and CER retrievals. The ML-based algorithm develops four independent models using Random Forest methods for cloud mask, liquid water, ice, and mixed-phase/multi-layer clouds, respectively. A two-habit ice and sphere water cloud model are employed to give their optical properties. Look-up tables of cloud reflectance in the COT and CER sensitive channels are built for efficient forward simulations, and the retrieval is performed by an optimal estimation algorithm. Compared with collocated active observations, the cloud mask and phase results give true positive rates of similar to 95% and similar to 85% and are more sensitive to mixed-phase clouds. Meanwhile, the AGRI-based COT and CER agree closely with those given by the collocated MODIS and AHI cloud products, and the correlation coefficients between MODIS and the AGRI results are 0.76 and 0.63 for COT and CER, respectively. The COT and CER retrievals will be persistently maintained and improved as the operational product for FY-4/AGRI.

TI  - Dynamically estimating deformations with wrapped InSAR based on sequential adjustment
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has been greatly improved in both scientific studies and engineering applications as more and more InSAR observations become available. However, the long-term and dynamic deformation analysis would be more challenging for ordinary users due to the so big volume of InSAR data. In this paper, we proposed a method, termed as SeaInSAR, which introduces the rationale of sequential adjustment (Sea) algorithm to dynamically estimate the surface deformations with wrapped interferometric phase. The proposed method focuses on the arcs of adjacent coherent points in the short-baseline interferograms to avoid the time-consuming and error-prone phase-unwrapping procedure. When dynamically monitoring the temporal deformations with respect to the area of interest, the Sea algorithm, based on the previous result together with newly observed data, can accelerate the procedure of estimating deformation parameters. Furthermore, by only involving the partial previous deformation time series result rather than all the result, the efficiency of the SeaInSAR method can be significantly improved without any compromise of the accuracy. The Sea algorithm is also used to realize the dynamic estimation of a fading signal in the multi-looked or filtered interferograms. This signal is induced by the temporally varying surface moisture and can bias the deformations when only short temporal-baseline interferograms are used. Its dynamic estimation benefits the high-accuracy and high-efficiency deformation monitoring in the era of big InSAR data. Simulated and real data experiments are conducted in this paper, demonstrating that the proposed SeaInSAR method can improve the computational efficiency by more than 20 times compared with the classical static method. With the availability of more and more SAR data as well as the increasing demand of InSAR engineering applications, the proposed SeaInSAR method has a great potential in the InSAR post-processing procedure.

TI  - Shallow Water Depth Inversed Using Multispectral Satellite Based on Machine Learning
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the Landsat-8 OLI multispectral satellite remote sensing images covering typical islands and collected water depth data, this study comprehensively invert the water depth of the target sea area using the traditional multiple linear regression model, back propagation neural network model and random forest model in machine learning. The inversion accuracy of the three methods is evaluated. The results show that compared with the multiple linear regression model, machine learning methods have higher water depth inversion accuracy. The water depth inversion accuracy of the random forest model is the highest with a mean absolute error of 1. 94 m and a mean absolute percentage error of 18. 29%, and the robustness of the model is better, and the overall accuracy is significantly improved compared with that of the multiple linear regression model. This study compares the performance of shallow water bathymetric models built using the three methods, providing reference value for subsequent research on obtaining high- precision shallow water bathymetric information more efficiently.

TI  - Changes over flood season in turbidity maximum zone in a mountainous macrotidal estuary from 1986 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of channel regulation projects, reservoirs, and other human activities have led to significant changes in channel geometry and hydrodynamic conditions in mountainous macrotidal estuaries. However, their impact on the long-term evolution of the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) in these estuaries is still unclear. Therefore, the Minjiang Estuary (ME) was selected as the study area and using the Gabor filter and surface suspended sediment concentration (SSSC) data retrieved from GF PMS/WFV and Landsat-TM/ETM+/OLI images in the flood season from 1986 to 2020, the flow direction of Chuanshi Waterway, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of TMZ in the ME, and the influence of human activities on these were analyzed. The results indicate that during flood tides in the past 35 years, the TMZ was mainly distributed in sections from the Changmen to the Chuanshi and Meihua waterways. The construction of the Shuikou Reservoir caused the SSSC to decrease by 65 mg/L at the Chuanshi Tidal Gauge Station in the ME. The TMZ in the ME waterway channel notably migrated toward the sea due to the waterway regulation project, with the landward and seaward boundaries moving by 2.5 km and 3 km seaward, respectively. The main distribution area moved from Jinpaimen to the section from Chuanshi Waterway to the mouth of the ME. These variation characteristics were basically consistent with the annual average TMZ in the flood season. Through the interactions between nature and human interventions, the flow regime of the ME tended to converge in the flood season. Therefore, human activities have significantly impacted the long-term evolution of the TMZ in the ME.

TI  - Rapid, repeatable landscape-scale mapping of tree, hedgerow, and woodland habitats (THaW), using airborne LiDAR and spaceborne SAR data
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the UK, tree, hedgerow, and woodland (THaW) habitats are key havens for biodiversity and support many related ecosystem services. The UK is entering a period of agricultural policy realignment with respect to natural capital and climate change, meaning that now is a critical time to evaluate the distribution, resilience, and dynamics of THaW habitats. The fine-grained nature of habitats like hedgerows necessitates mapping of these features at relatively fine spatial resolution-and freely available public archives of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) data at <2 m spatial resolution offer a means of doing so within UK settings. The high cost of LiDAR prohibits use for regular monitoring of THaW change, but space-borne sensors such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR at ca. 10 m resolution) can potentially meet this need once baseline distributions are established. We address two aims in this manuscript-(1) to rapidly quantify THaW across UK landscapes using LiDAR data and (2) to monitor canopy change intra- and inter-annually using SAR data. We show that workflows applied to airborne LiDAR data can deliver THaW baselines at 2 m resolution, with positional accuracy of >90%. It was also possible to combine LiDAR mapping data and Sentinel-1 SAR data to rapidly track canopy change through time (i.e., every 3 months) using, cloud-based processing via Google Earth Engine. The resultant toolkit is also provided as an open-access web app. The results highlight that whilst nearly 90% of the tallest trees (above 15 m) are captured within the National Forest Inventory (NFI) database only 50% of THaW with a canopy height range of 3-15 m are recorded. Current estimates of tree distribution neglect these finer-grained features (i.e., smaller or less contiguous THaW canopies), which we argue will account for a significant proportion of landscape THaW cover.

TI  - Global High-Resolution Random Forest Regression Maps of Ocean Heat Content Anomalies Using In Situ and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean, with its low albedo and vast thermal inertia, plays key roles in the climate system, including ab-sorbing massive amounts of heat as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations rise. While the Argo array of profiling floats has vastly improved sampling of ocean temperature in the upper half of the global ocean volume since the mid-2000s, they are not sufficient in number to resolve eddy scales in the oceans. However, satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) measurements do resolve these scales. Here we use random forest regressions to map ocean heat content anomalies (OHCA) using in situ training data from Argo and other sources on a 7-day 3 1/4 degrees 3 1/4 degrees grid with latitude, longitude, time, SSH, and SST as predictors. The maps display substantial patterns on eddy scales, resolving variations of ocean currents and fronts. During the well-sampled Argo period, global integrals of these maps reduce noise rela-tive to estimates based on objective mapping of in situ data alone by roughly a factor of 3 when compared to time series of CERES (satellite data) top-of-the-atmosphere energy flux measurements and improve correlations of anomalies with CERES on annual time scales. Prior to and early on in the Argo period, when in situ data were sparser, global integrals of these maps retain low variance, and do not relax back to a climatological mean, avoiding potential deficiencies of various methods for infilling data-sparse regions with objective maps by exploiting temporal and spatial patterns of OHCA and its correlations with SST and SSH. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We use a simple machine learning technique to improve maps of subsurface ocean warming by exploiting the relationships between subsurface ocean temperature both sea surface temperature and sea level. Mapping ocean warming is important because it contributes to sea level rise through thermal expansion; im-pacts marine life through marine heatwaves and changes in mixing, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels; increases energy available to tropical cyclones; and stores most of the energy building up in Earth's climate system owing to the accumulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our new estimates generally have lower noise en-ergy and higher correlations than other products when compared with global energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere measured by satellite.

TI  - The spatiotemporal scale effect on vegetation interannual trend estimates based on satellite products over Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The trend estimate of vegetation change is essential to understand the change rule of the ecosystem. Previous studies were mainly focused on quantifying trends or analyzing their spatial distribution characteristics. Nevertheless, the uncertainties of trend estimates caused by spatiotemporal scale effects have rarely been studied. In response to this challenge, this study aims to investigate spatiotemporal scale effects on trend estimates using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) products from 2001 to 2019 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Moreover, the possible influencing factors on spatiotemporal scale effect, including spatial heterogeneity, topography, and vegetation types, were explored. The results indicate that the spatial scale effect depends more on the dataset with a coarser spatial resolution, and temporal scale effects depend on the time span of datasets. Unexpectedly, the trend estimates on the 8-day and yearly scale are much closer than that on the monthly scale. In addition, in areas with low spatial heterogeneity, low topography variability, and sparse vegetation, the spatiotemporal scale effect can be ignored, and vice versa. The results in this study help deepen the consciousness and understanding of spatiotemporal scale effects on trend detection.

TI  - Right-Wing Populism and Political Instrumentalization of Religion The Italian Debate on Matteo Salvini's Use of Religious Symbols on Facebook
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION IN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the online debate sparked by the political instrumentalization of religious symbols by right-wing populist leaders, taking as a case study the campaign communication of Matteo Salvini-leader of the Italian "Lega" party-in the run-up to the 2018 and 2019 general and European elections. Against the backdrop of theories on populism, religious publicization and politicization in a social media context, the research analyzes over 2,000 Facebook posts referring to Salvini and religion by using a mixed computational and qualitative method including semi-automated frame anal-ysis and correspondence analysis. Results show that right-wing populism is capable of successfully appropriating religious symbols and setting the agenda for religious topics on social media, even challenging the authority of traditional religious authorities on their own ground. By attacking the Church, defending the religious sentiment of the people, and opposing Christian identity to Islam, religion is effectively integrated into the populist worldview.

TI  - Retrieving surface secondary subsidence in closed mines with time-series SAR interferometry combining persistent and distributed scatterers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The groundwater recovery in closed mines causes surface secondary subsidence or uplift, which threatens the safety of buildings around the mines. However, due to the long-lasting surface subsidence in closed mines, the coherence points selected by permanent scatterer (PS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are not enough to reflect the spatio-temporal evolution pattern of surface subsidence. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed scatterer (DS) InSAR method by integrating statistically homogeneous pixels selection and phase optimization into PSInSAR. To prove the effectiveness of DSInSAR, PSInSAR is employed synchronously to obtain the surface subsidence of closed mines in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, based on 88 scenes Sentinel-1A images from October 2016 to October 2019. The results show that the spatial heterogeneity of surface subsidence (- 35 mm/year to + 35 mm/year) in closed mines is obvious, the coherent point density of DSInSAR is 13.3 times that of PSInSAR, and DSInSAR retrieves three subsidence areas that PSInSAR missed. Moreover, the results of DSInSAR and PSInSAR are consistent, with a correlation of 0.92. Compared with the leveling data shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) of DSInSAR monitoring results is 3.81 mm, which is slightly higher than that of PSInSAR (RMSE: 3.84 mm). Finally, the difference between the surface subsidence of closed and mining mines was analyzed, which shows that the surface secondary subsidence of closed mines is complex, uneven, and diverse. Therefore, obtaining the long-term and complete surface subsidence of closed mines is of great significance to predict and prevent surface subsidence disasters.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of mining tailings in the fluvial-estuarine-coastal ocean continuum of the Lower Doce River Valley (Brazil)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity is a key parameter of aquatic ecosystems impacted by mining tailings. Tracking down tailings dispersion along the river basin requires a regional monitoring approach. The longitudinal fluvial connectivity, river-estuary-coastal ocean, and the lateral connectivity, river-floodplain-alluvial lakes are interconnected by hydrological flows, particularly during high fluvial discharge. The present study aims to track the dispersal of iron ore tailing spill, from the collapse of the Fundao dam (Mariana, MG, Brazil), on November 5, 2015, in the Lower Doce River Valley. A semi-empirical model of turbidity data, as a water clarity proxy, and multispectral remote sensing data (MSI Sentinel-2), based on different hydrological conditions and well-differentiated water types, yielded an accuracy of 92%. Five floods (> 3187m(3) s(-1)) and five droughts (< 231m(3) s(-1)) events occurred from 2013 to 2020. The flood of January 2016 occurred one month after the mining slurries reached the coast, intruding tailings on some alluvial and coastal plain lakes with highly turbid waters (> 400 NTU). A fluvial plume is formed in the inner shelf adjoining the river mouth on high flow. The dispersion of river plume was categorized as plume core (turbidity > 200 NTU), plume core and inner shelf waters (100-199 NTU), other shelf water (50-99 NTU), and offshore waters (< 50 NTU). Fluvial discharge and local winds are the main drivers for river plume dispersion and transport of terrigenous material along the coast. This work provides elements for evaluating the impact of mining tailings and an approach for remote sensing regional monitoring of surface water quality.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance Definitions for Fall- and Hip Fracture-Related Emergency Department Visits Among Adults Aged 65 Years and Older, United States 2017-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To develop syndromic surveillance definitions for unintentional fall- and hip fracture-related emergency department (ED) visits among older adults (aged >= 65 years) for use in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data and compare the percentage of ED visits captured using these new syndromes with ED visits from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (HCUP-NEDS), a nationally representative administrative data set.Design/Setting: Syndromic definitions were developed using chief complaint terms and discharge diagnosis codes in NSSP data. The percentages of ED visits among older adults related to falls and hip fractures in NSSP were compared with the percentages in HCUP-NEDS in 2017 and 2018.Measures: Prevalence ratios were calculated as the relative difference in the percentage of ED visits related to falls or hip fractures in NSSP compared with HCUP-NEDS. Counts and percentages calculated using HCUP-NEDS were weighted to produce nationally representative estimates. Data were analyzed overall and by sex and age group.Results: The percentage of ED visits among older adults related to falls in NSSP was 12% less in 2017 (10.81%) and 7% less in 2018 (11.42%) compared with HCUP-NEDS (2017: 12.30%; 2018: 12.26%). The percentage of ED visits among older adults related to hip fractures in NSSP was 41% less in 2017 (0.65%) and 30% less in 2018 (0.76%) compared with HCUP-NEDS (2017: 1.10%; 2018: 1.09%). In both 2017 and 2018, a higher percentage of ED visits among older women and adults aged 85 years or older were related to falls or hip fractures compared with older men and younger age groups across both data sets.Conclusion: A smaller percentage of older adults' ED visits met the falls and hip fracture definitions in NSSP compared with HCUP-NEDS in 2017 and 2018. However, demographic trends remained similar across both data sets.

TI  - Satellite-Based Monitoring of Eutrophication in the Earth's Largest Transboundary Lake
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's large lakes and their life-supporting services are rapidly threatened by eutrophication in the warming climate during the Anthropocene. Here, MODIS-Aqua level 3 chlorophyll-a data (2018-2021) were used to monitor trophic state in our planet's largest lake, that is, the Caspian Sea that accounts for approximately 40% of the total lacustrine waters on Earth. We also used the in situ measurements of chlorophyll-a data (2009-2019) to further verify the accuracy of the data derived from the MODIS-Aqua and to explore the deep chlorophyll-a maxima (DCMs) in the south Caspian Sea. Our findings show an acceptable agreement between the chlorophyll-a data derived from the MODIS-Aqua and those measured in situ in the coast of Iran (coefficient of determination = 0.71). The oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic states cover 66%, 20%, and 13% of the sea surface area, respectively. The DCMs are dominantly regulated by water transparency and they generally observe at depths of less than 20 and 30 m during the cold (autumn and winter) and warm (spring and summer) seasons, respectively. Our results suggest an ever-increasing chlorophyll-a in the shallow zones (i.e., coasts) and even in deep regions of the sea, mainly due to nutrient inputs from the Volga river delta. Alarming increase of chlorophyll-a in this transboundary lake can amplify eutrophication under the lens of global warming and further threaten the lake ecosystem's health, where almost all legal agreements have not yet been implemented to protect the lake environment and its rich resources.

TI  - Surface area change detection of snow/ice cover over Zemu Glacier of Sikkim Himalaya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the snow/ice surface area changes over the Zemu Glacier in the Eastern Himalayas. Zemu is considered to be the largest glacier in the Eastern Himalayas located in the Sikkim State of India. Change detection in the snow/ice surface areal extent of the Zemu Glacier was delineated from the year 1945 using US Army Map Service-Topographical Sheets and Landsat imageries available from 1987 to 2020. The results obtained solely focus on surface-change delineation using remote sensing satellite data and GIS software. Landsat imagery of the years 1987, 1997, 2009, 2018, and 2020 was used for snow and ice pixel extraction. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Snow Cover Index (S3), and new band ratio index were used to extract the pure snow and ice pixels, fresh snow, and debris-covered snow/ice area and pixels mixed with shadow to demarcate the surface area changes. Manual delineation was required and undertaken for better results. A slope raster image was generated from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data to delineate the slope and hill shade. The results illustrate that the snow/ice surface covering the glacier had an area of 113.5 km(2) in the year 1945 which was reduced to 78.31 km(2) in the year 2020 indicating a total snow/ice surface area loss of 31% in 75 years. A loss of 11.45% was observed from 1945 to 1987 in the areal extent, while from 1987 to 2009, a decadal loss of approximately 7% was observed. The surface area loss of 8.46% from 2009 to 2018 led to infer the maximum loss of snow and ice over the glacier body at a rate of 0.94% per year. Between the years 2018 and 2020, the glacier lost 1.08% of its surface area. The Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) considering the accumulation and ablation areas of the glacier indicated a gradual decline of the accumulation zone in the recent years. Global Land Ice Measurement from Space (GLIMS) program data with RGI version 6.0 was used as a reference to demarcate the areal extent of Zemu Glacier. The study gained above 80% of overall accuracy by generating a confusion matrix in ArcMap. The analysis of this seasonal snow/ice cover showed that there has been a drastic decline in the surface snow/ice cover area over the Zemu Glacier over the years 1987 to 2020 and NDSI; S3 analysis provided improved results to delineate snow/ice cover area over such steep terrain topography of Sikkim Himalaya.

TI  - Grassland cover declined in Southern Africa but increased in other African subcontinents in early twenty-first century
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The African continent has the most extensive grassland cover in the world, providing valuable ecosystem services. African grasslands, like other continental grasslands, are prone to various anthropogenic disturbances and climate, and require data-driven monitoring for efficient functioning and service delivery. Yet, knowledge of how the African grassland cover has changed in the past years is lacking, especially at the subcontinent level, due to lack of relevant long-term, Africa-wide observations and experiments. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) data spanning 2001 to 2017 to conduct land use land cover (LULC) change analyses and map grassland distribution in Africa. Specifically, we assessed the changes in grassland cover across and within African subcontinents over three periods (2001-2013, 2013-2017, and 2001-2017). We found that the African grassland cover was 16,777,765.5 km(2), 16,999,468.25 km(2), and 16,968,304.25 km(2) in 2001, 2013, and 2017, respectively. There were net gain (1.32%) and net loss (- 0.19%) during 2001-2013 and 2013-2017 periods, respectively, and the annual rate of change during these periods were 0.11% and - 0.05%, respectively. Generally, the African grassland cover increased by 1.14% (0.07% per annum) over the entire study period (2001-2017) at the expense of forestland, cropland, and built-up areas. The East and West African grassland cover reduced by 0.07% (- 0.02% per annum) and 1.35% (- 0.34% per annum), respectively from 2013 to 2017 but increased in other periods. On the other hand, the grassland cover in North and Central Africa increased throughout the three periods while that of Southern Africa decreased over the three periods. Overall, the net gains in the grassland cover of other African subcontinents offset the loss in Southern Africa and promoted the overall gain across Africa. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring of African grasslands and the causes of their changes for efficient delivery of ecosystem services.

M3  - Article
AB  - Coast is essential in providing wide range of ecosystem services. Shorelines change dynamically, and analysing shoreline changes can be conducted with Remote sensing and GIS technologies. This study aims to measure applicability of spectral indices of Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to distinguish land cover classes and determine coastline changes on west coast of Johor between 2000 and 2020. This study analysed satellite image data obtained from Landsat 7 ETM+ (2000) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2020) using ERDAS and ArcGIS software. Spectral index images were generated for shoreline determination through OTSU classification. Image overlays are created to determine shoreline changes. The use of spectral indices showed that the three spectral indexes could effectively distinguish water and land along west coast of Johor. MNDWI had an overall accuracy of 99.00% (2000) and 97.50% (2020) and highest Kappa value for both Landsat satellite images, 0.98 (2000) and 0.95 (2020). The NDVI and SAVI indices have the same accuracy of 95.00% (2000) and 96.50% (2020) and Kappa value of 0.90 (2000) and 0.93 (2020). The west coast of Johor has experienced a reduction of 583.48 hectares of coastline and accretion of 846.85 hectares. Higher reduction was observed along Batu Pahat and Pontian coasts, while the shoreline on the north shore of Pontian showed a very high amount of accretion. This study can benefit stakeholders by giving the status of the latest coastline changes in implementing effective coastal development and management measures.

TI  - Interplanetary Magnetic Field <i>B<sub>y</sub> </i>Controls the Magnetopause Location
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a statistical study of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) effects on the magnetopause location based on nearly 15,000 magnetopause crossings identified in the THEMIS A-E, Magion 4, Geotail, and Interball-1 satellite data. In order to exclude the dominant controlling role of the solar wind dynamic pressure, differences between observed and empirical model magnetopause distances are analyzed. We find that the magnetopause distance is significantly controlled by the IMF clock angle, not considered in the used empirical models. Furthermore, during very low Alfven Mach numbers (M-A < 4), IMF B-y component can induce a considerable dawn-dusk asymmetry of the magnetopause shape. The magnetopause distance is found to be larger in the direction of the IMF vector, that is, not only the magnitude but also the orientation of the IMF B-y component is eventually important. The obtained results are qualitatively consistent with a magnetohydrodynamic model run at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center.

TI  - THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PRACTICE OF THE ECTHR IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL SURROGACY
T2  - ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The article focuses on the analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights regarding gestational surrogate motherhood and the development of the bioethics issue in this area. It was established that the notion of "private life," regulated by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, guarantees everyone the ability to demand the establishment of their identity, providing for the possibility of establishing family relationships. It is highlighted that, despite the legal ban on the implementation of surrogate motherhood technology, to confirm the child's identity, there is a need for official recognition of this kind of family relationship as indicated by other relevant relationships. In particular, the peculiarities of establishing parent-child relationships in the case of individuals applying for gestational surrogacy to exercise their reproductive rights are disclosed. The problem of legal regulation unification in the technological application of gestational surrogate motherhood is considered. A conclusion set regards the need to create an international legislative and regulatory framework useful for national governments, particularly in gradually banning the use of surrogate motherhood technologies. Attention is placed on international efforts focused to create an international legislative and regulatory framework that will provide recommendations useful to national governments, particularly in the gradual prohibition of surrogacy. The authors believe that the corresponding international agreement will constitute a legal framework for ensuring individual rights, freedoms, and health, the limitation to gestational surrogate motherhood services, and the observance of a uniform policy in this area.Methods: The methodological framework of the study incorporated a range of philosophical, general, and legal methods. The worldview-dialectical method of cognition made it possible to investigate the problem's social content and legal form, then to conduct a systematic theoretical and legal analysis of the practice by applying the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The diversity of legal certainty of the surrogate motherhood system's legality in Europe, particularly in France, Italy, Iceland, Poland, and Norway, was investigated using the comparative method. With the help of a formal-legal approach, it analysed the content and peculiarities of applying the ECtHR practice.Results and Conclusions: We comprehensively considered the ECtHR legal positions on gestational surrogate motherhood and the bioethics development in this area. International efforts should be concentrated on establishing an international regulatory framework that will provide recommendations practical to national governments, particularly in the gradual prohibition of surrogacy.

TI  - THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PRACTICE OF THE ECTHR IN THE FIELD OF GESTATIONAL SURROGACY
T2  - ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The article focuses on the analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights regarding gestational surrogate motherhood and the development of the bioethics issue in this area. It was established that the notion of "private life," regulated by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, guarantees everyone the ability to demand the establishment of their identity, providing for the possibility of establishing family relationships. It is highlighted that, despite the legal ban on the implementation of surrogate motherhood technology, to confirm the child's identity, there is a need for official recognition of this kind of family relationship as indicated by other relevant relationships. In particular, the peculiarities of establishing parent -child relationships in the case of individuals applying for gestational surrogacy to exercise their reproductive rights are disclosed. The problem of legal regulation unification in the technological application of gestational surrogate motherhood is considered. A conclusion set regards the need to create an international legislative and regulatory framework useful for national governments, particularly in gradually banning the use of surrogate motherhood technologies. Attention is placed on international efforts focused to create an international legislative and regulatory framework that will provide recommendations useful to national governments, particularly in the gradual prohibition of surrogacy. The authors believe that the corresponding international agreement will constitute a legal framework for ensuring individual rights, freedoms, and health, the limitation to gestational surrogate motherhood services, and the observance of a uniform policy in this area.Methods: The methodological framework of the study incorporated a range of philosophical, general, and legal methods. The worldview-dialectical method of cognition made it possible to investigate the problem's social content and legal form, then to conduct a systematic theoretical and legal analysis of the practice by applying the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The diversity of legal certainty of the surrogate motherhood system's legality in Europe, particularly in France, Italy, Iceland, Poland, and Norway, was investigated using the comparative method. With the help of a formal-legal approach, it analysed the content and peculiarities of applying the ECtHR practice.Results and Conclusions: We comprehensively considered the ECtHR legal positions on gestational surrogate motherhood and the bioethics development in this area. International efforts should be concentrated on establishing an international regulatory framework that will provide recommendations practical to national governments, particularly in the gradual prohibition of surrogacy.

TI  - Monitoring persistent organic chemicals in Antarctica in support of global chemical policy: a horizon scan of priority actions and challenges
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global production and emission of chemicals exceeds societal capacities for assessment and monitoring. This situation calls for improved chemical regulatory policy frameworks and increased support for expedited decision making within existing frameworks. The polar regions of the Earth represent unique sentinel areas for the study of global chemical behaviour, and data arising from these areas can strengthen existing policy frameworks. However, chemical pollution research and monitoring in the Antarctic is underdeveloped, with geopolitical complexities and the absence of legal recognition of international chemical policy serving to neutralise progress made in other global regions. This Personal View represents a horizon scan by the action group Input Pathways of Persistent Organic Pollutants to Antarctica, of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research. Four priority research and research facilitation gaps are outlined, with recommendations for Antarctica Treaty parties for strategic action against these priorities.

TI  - SOCIAL OPTIMISM OF RUSSIANS IN A CRISIS: RESULTS OF A LONGITUDINAL STUDY
T2  - PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the main approaches to the study of social optimism as a socio-psychological phenomenon, highlights its theoretical structure and functions. The results of a longitudinal empirical study conducted among adult Russians (N = 664, six measurements) from March 3 to December 26, 2022 and aimed at identifying the socio-psychological antecedents of the stability of social optimism in the conditions of crisis are presented. It is shown that social optimism is directly related to personal characteristics that underlie the resilience: self-efficacy, perceived control, dispositional optimism, positive reframing and seeking emotional support in a critical situation. The study reveals that perceived control increases the stability of the individual's social optimism in a crisis. The higher the social well-being of the individual, the belief in his ability to contribute to the development of society, the more stable is social optimism. The hypothesis is confirmed that social optimism is enhanced by socio-psychological characteristics that facilitate the consolidation of efforts for a joint response to the challenges of the crisis: civic identity; perceived social support; empathy for others affected by the war; generalized trust; trust in civil society institutions; as well as political self-efficacy, that is, the belief in the ability to influence political decisions made in the country. On the contrary, social optimism is negatively associated with belief in a dangerous world, social cynicism, and a conspiracy worldview. The main contribution to the stability of social optimism is made by collective political self-efficacy, while social cynicism accelerates its decline. The results of the study made it possible to suggest the existence of two complementary mechanisms for maintaining social optimism: through strengthening civic identification and the importance of the collective future for the individual (this role is played by moral foundations of respect for authority, loyalty to one's group and sanctity) and through empathy and strengthening the importance of mutual assistance in a crisis (under the influence of "individualizing" moral foundations of caring for people and fairness).

TI  - Statistical diagnostics for sensing spatial residue cover
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information on within field soil quality spatial variability is pertinent for sustainable agroecosystem management. Although, plant residues constitute a critical input influencing soil quality dynamic, robust baseline residue maps to inform agricultural policy are nonexistent. Remote sensing-based indices can be used to generate maps that can provide timely information on within-field spatial distribution of residue cover. However, heavily used indices such as the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), Lignin Cellulose Absorption (LCA) index, or the Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) rely on data scanned within the 2000 to 2500 nm spectral wavelength window, thus are impractical for mapping because most freely accessible spaceborne sensors collect significant data within the 450 to 1750 nm wavelength range. Here, insitu line transect residue cover measurements were integrated with spectral reflectance data scanned by Cropscan handheld multispectral radiometer (MSR) and satellite sensors, to identify alternative indices within the 450 to 1750 nm wavelength range suitable for monitoring residue cover. The green band reflectance had the highest correlation with spatial variability in residue cover, followed closely by the blue band. Analyzed data shows that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(wide band) (NDVIw), preeminently mapped corn (Zea mays) residue cover, with an R-2 of 0.95 between residue mapped by satellite vis a vis in situ field measurements. The line transect residue measurements from field plots sampled at Aurora (48%) and Badger (57%) fell within the range estimated by satellite (30 to 60%), but this was not true for the Lennox site (72%).

TI  - Reducing CLABSIs in an Adult Cardiothoracic ICU
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local problem: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are associated with increased mortality and costs. In the cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU) of an academic medical center, nine CLABSIs occurred in fiscal year (FY) 2018.Purpose: The aim of this project was to reduce the CLABSI rate in the CTICU and sustain the results.Methods: Nurse residents on the CTICU initiated a quality improvement project with a single intervention and expanded it into an ongoing initiative with additional interventions by the unit-based performance improvement committee. Evidence-based interventions were identified and implemented, including education; rounding; auditing; and other unit-specific interventions, which included "Central Line Sunday," accountability emails, and a blood culture algorithm with a tip sheet.Results: CLABSI incidence was reduced from nine in FY 2018 to one in each of the subsequent FYs (2019 and 2020), which had similar totals of central line days, and two in FY 2021, which had a slightly higher number of central line days. The CTICU was able to achieve zero CLABSIs from August 2019 through November 2020, more than 365 days.Conclusions: Coupled with strong support from nursing leadership, nurses on the unit successfully reduced CLABSIs by adopting novel, evidence-based strategies; ongoing monitoring; and multiple interventions.

TI  - Nonvisualized sentinel node on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in primary cutaneous melanoma: an 11-year retrospective survey
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in cutaneous melanoma patients evaluates the regional draining basin for occult micrometastatic disease. Occasionally, nonidentification of SLN impairs the acquisition of this important prognostic factor.Objectives To investigate the outcomes of melanoma patients with negative lymphoscintigraphic findings and patients who underwent SLN biopsy from 2004 to 2015 (n = 1200) were retrospectively reviewed for tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes.Methods Patients with nonvisualized lymph nodes (NV group) who underwent only preoperative lymphoscintigraphy were separated and compared with a cohort drawn from all melanoma patients who completed the surgical procedure within the same period (V group).Results A negative lymphoscintigraphic scan was observed in 38 cases (3.2% of all patients). The NV group showed a significantly older age (median 66.0 vs. 48.3 years; P < 0.0001). Head and neck melanomas were more frequent in the NV group compared to the control group (25.1 vs. 7.8%; P = 0.009). Tumor characteristics such as ulceration and Breslow thickness do not influence the lymphoscintigraphy result. No differences were found in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between the groups.Conclusions The nonvisualization of regional lymph nodes by lymphoscintigraphy is more frequent in older patients with head and neck melanomas. From the clinical point of view, no specific recommendation emerged for patients' management because the nonvisualization of the SLN did not show a significant influence on DFS and OS rates. However, lack of knowledge of lymph node status suggests performing a tighter follow-up eventually by ultrasound evaluation of all potential lymph node drainage basins.

TI  - The Weight of New York City: Possible Contributions to Subsidence From Anthropogenic Sources
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - New York City faces accelerating inundation risk from sea level rise, subsidence, and increasing storm intensity from natural and anthropogenic causes. Here we calculate a previously unquantified contribution to subsidence from the cumulative mass and downward pressure exerted by the built environment of the city. We enforce that load distribution in a multiphysics finite element model to calculate expected subsidence. Complex surface geology requires multiple rheological soil models to be applied; clay rich soils and artificial fill are calculated to have the highest post-construction subsidence as compared with more elastic soils. Minimum and maximum calculated building subsidence ranges from 0 to 600 mm depending on soil/rock physical parameters and foundation modes. We compare modeled subsidence and surface geology to observed subsidence rates from satellite data (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Positioning System). The comparison is complicated because the urban load has accumulated across a much longer period than measured subsidence rates, and there are multiple causes of subsidence. Geodetic measurements show a mean subsidence rate of 1-2 mm/year across the city that is consistent with regional post-glacial deformation, though we find some areas of significantly greater subsidence rates. Some of this deformation is consistent with internal consolidation of artificial fill and other soft sediment that may be exacerbated by recent building loads, though there are many possible causes. New York is emblematic of growing coastal cities all over the world that are observed to be subsiding (Wu et al., 2022, ), meaning there is a shared global challenge of mitigation against a growing inundation hazard.Plain Language Summary As coastal cities grow globally, the combination of construction densification and sea level rise imply increasing inundation hazard. The point of the paper is to raise awareness that every additional high-rise building constructed at coastal, river, or lakefront settings could contribute to future flood risk, and that mitigation strategies may need to be included. The subsidence mapping concept helps to quantify the hazard and adds specificity to soil types and conditions. We present satellite data that show that the city is sinking 1-2 mm/tr with some areas subsiding much faster.

TI  - Low-parameter method for delineation of agricultural fields in satellite images based on multi-temporal MSAVI2 data
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers an issue of delineating agricultural fields in satellite images. In this task we follow a multi-temporal data approach. We show that on such data, good quality can be achieved using a simple low-parameter method. The method consists of a combination of a field detector and an edge detector. The field detection is based on an Otsu thresholding technique and for the edge detection we use a Canny detector. Facing a lack of available datasets and aiming to estimate the proposed algorithm, we prepared and published our dataset consisting of 18,859 ex-pertly annotated fields using Sentinel-2 data. We implement one of the state-of-the-art deep -learning approaches and compare it with the proposed method on our dataset. The experiment shows the proposed simple multi-temporal algorithm to outperform the state-of-the-art instant data approach. This result confirms the importance of using multi-temporal data and for the first time demonstrates that the delineation problem can be solved at a lower cost without loss of quality. Our approach requires a significantly less amount of training data when compared with the NN -based one. The dataset of agricultural fields used in the work and the proposed algorithm imple-mentation in Python are published in open access.

TI  - Which Potential Evapotranspiration Formula to Use in Hydrological Modeling World-Wide?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many potential evapotranspiration (PET) formulas are available, there is still a lack of knowledge on when and where to use them in catchment modeling world-wide. Here we experimented with three different formulas in a global hydrological model (the World-wide HYPE), using 15 years of observations from 5,338 streamflow gauges and global evapotranspiration from Earth-observations (MOD16). We tested model performance in a multi-process approach to select the best formula for catchments covering the global landmass. From comparing the results with land-cover, climate classification, water-energy limitations, we found that climate is the main driver behind the spatial patterns in model performance. Hargreaves was the best PET formula in 50% of the catchments, most of them located in the Amazonas, central Europe, and Oceania; Jensen-Haise was better for catchments in northern latitudes (36%). Finally, Priestley-Taylor was the best formula for India and latitudes above 65 degrees North. The selection of a PET formula seems to be more critical in tropical regions close to the equator, where the differences in performance are above 50%. This is also where PET is highest. We found a strong connection between the five main Koppen regions and the PET formulas, further supported by landcover analysis. Hence, the PET formulas differed in their capacity to provide useful input to the water balance modeling, with complex formulas only giving improved predictions in temperate and polar regions; however, for the rest of the globe simpler formulas were better. We thus recommend to apply different PET formulas based on climatic regions world-wide.

TI  - Quality Matters: Examining the Impact of Nurse Staffing Challenges on Clinical Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Goal:The purpose of this study was to examine nurse staffing while describing the relationships that exist in staffing and quality associated with nursing care during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significantly challenging time for nurse staffing. We examined the relationship between permanent registered nurse (RN) and travel RN staffing during the pandemic and the nursing-sensitive outcomes of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), falls, and hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) and length of stay and compared the cost of CAUTIs, CLABSIs, falls, and HAPIs in fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Methods:We used a descriptive, observational design to retrospectively examine permanent nurse staffing volume and CAUTI, CLABSI, HAPI, and fall counts from October 1, 2019, to February 28, 2022, and travel nurse volume for the most current 12 months, April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and statistical process control analyses were completed. Principal Findings:Pearson correlation showed a statistically significant, moderately strong negative correlation (r = -0.568, p = .001) between the active registered nurse full-time equivalents (RN FTEs) and average length of stay (ALOS), and a moderately strong positive correlation (r = 0.688, p = .013) between the travel RN FTEs and ALOS. Pearson correlations were not statistically significant, with low to moderate negative correlations for CAUTIs (r = -0.052, p = .786), CLABSIs (r = -0.207, p = .273), and falls (r = -0.056, p = .769). Pearson correlation for active RN and HAPI showed a moderately strong, statistically significant positive correlation (r = 0.499, p = .003). We observed common cause variation in CAUTIs and CLABSIs, with HAPIs and falls showing special cause variation via statistical process control.

T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands vegetation systems have high vulnerability due to hydrologic changes. The ob-jective of this study was to describe the spatiotemporal changes in the physiognomy of a wetland vegetation's by variations on its water streaming. For this purpose, a model was developed based on remote perception of a high-altitude Andean wetland vegetation's located southwest of the Michincha salt flat (Tarapaca Region, 4100 masl.). We used flo-ra-vegetatiom records, vegetation coverages was obtained from supervised classifica-tion of high and medium satellite images resolutions during the period 1985-2019 and trend analysis of the vegetational activity according to multiespectral Landsat's index NDVI and WETNESS. The results showed important physiognomic vegetation's changes on time, such us the replacement of a high Andean peatland vegetation's to a mixture of wet meadow and grassland at first, later, into areas with stubble and finally in units of wet meadow and grassland, remaining dead vegetation. The implemented model is based on multitemporal analysis of historical satellite images, validated with flora-vegetation observed records. These results allow us to understand the effect of hydric variations in high-altitude wetlands and guide measures according to its protection and conservation.

AB  - Drainage constraints in the southern lobe of the Llobregat Delta are aggravated during coastal storms due to higher marine water levels and river-mouth blockage. The aim of this article is to identify the areas on the right bank of the River Llobregat that are most exposed to flooding. Remote sensing methods are used to discriminate agricultural and wetland areas flooded during Storm Gloria (January 2020). The results reveal flooding without river overflow, compromising the economic viability and ecological functions of the remaining undeveloped areas of this metropolitan delta. This situation is exacerbated by an increase in the frequency of sea storms and the relative rise in sea-level induced by global warming.

TI  - Improving LandTrendr Forest Disturbance Mapping in China Using Multi-Season Observations and Multispectral Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance detection is of great significance for understanding forest dynamics. The Landsat-based detection of the Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm is widely used for forest disturbance mapping. However, there are still two limitations in LandTrendr: first, it only used for summer-composited observations, which may delay the detection of forest disturbances that occurred in autumn and winter by one year, and second, it detected all disturbance types simultaneously using a single spectral index, which may reduce the mapping accuracy for certain forest disturbance types. Here, we modified LandTrendr (mLandTrendr) for forest disturbance mapping in China by using multi-season observations and multispectral indices. Validations using the randomly selected 1957 reference forest disturbance samples across China showed that the overall accuracy (F1 score) of forest disturbance detection in China was improved by 21% with these two modifications. The mLandTrendr can quickly and accurately detect forest disturbance and can be extended to national and global forest disturbance mapping for various forest types.

TI  - The Limits of Antiatheist Prejudice Social Perception of Those Who Harm Animals
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - People tend to perceive atheists as being immoral. We tested whether this perception also applies to moral transgressions against animals. Study 1 (N = 288) and Study 2 (N = 306, pre-registered) utilized a conjunction fallacy paradigm to show that people attributed harming animals most frequently to criminals, then to God-believers, and least often to nonbelievers. Study 3 (N = 248, pre-registered) used a job-choice paradigm and found that people choose a God-believer over an atheist for a job involving animal harm because the God-believer was supposed to hold a more hierarchical view of the relationship between humans and animals than the atheist. Consequently, we discuss the limits of antiatheist prejudice in the domain of human-animal interactions.

TI  - Coastal cliff failures hazard along the Safi coastline (Morocco): a methodology for shoreline change assessment and its forecast along with examination of the causes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal cliffs of the Jurassico-Cretaceous formation, outcropping along the coastal area of Safi (Morocco), are particularly vulnerable. A wide variety of instabilities and slope failure, impacts such slopes, inducing serious structural and human security risks and accelerating the retreat. This paper presents results of research conducted on shoreline change assessment and forecast and inspecting causes that produce and/or accelerate coastline change to propose optimal management and protection solutions. Net Shoreline Movement, Linear Regression Rate, and End Point Rate analysis were computed to examine shoreline change rate (2002-2020) using Landsat 7 ETM + and LOI data and Digital Shoreline Analysis System. The Kalman filter model is used to predict shoreline change (2030 and 2040). The estimated erosion and accretion rates between - 7.87 and 2.23 m/year highlight the main erosional trend, and reveal the feedbacks between the proportional advance (set-forwards or accretion) and the active landslides, high accretion rates are recorded in the landsliding segment. An attempt was made to identify the relationships between causal factors; to this end, a methodological development through field investigation and laboratory tests of the brown clay involved in all slope failures. Results of physicochemical and mineralogical tests showed that all clay samples had medium to high plasticity, and similar mineral compositions, mainly illite, vermiculite, mixed-layer illite-vermiculite of expandable phases, and permit to point out the strong relationship existing between landslide occurrence, cliff dynamic, and geotechnical and mineralogical properties of Brown clay.

TI  - Genomic analysis of 1710 surveillance- based<i> Neisseria</i><i> gonorrhoeae</i> isolates from the USA in 2019 identifies predominant strain types and chromosomal antimicrobial- resistance determinants
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterized high-quality whole-genome sequences of a sentinel, surveillance -based collection of 1710 Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) isolates from 2019 collected in the USA as part of the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP). It aims to provide a detailed report of strain diversity, phylogenetic relationships and resistance determinant profiles associated with reduced susceptibilities to antibiotics of concern. The 1710 isolates represented 164 multilocus sequence types and 21 predominant phylogenetic clades. Common genomic determinants defined most strains' phenotypic, reduced susceptibility to current and historic antibiotics (e.g. blaTEM plasmid for penicillin, tetM plasmid for tetracycline, gyrA for ciprofloxacin, 23S rRNA and/or mosaic mtr operon for azithromycin, and mosaic penA for cefixime and ceftriaxone). The most predominant phylogenetic clade accounted for 21 % of the isolates, included a majority of the isolates with low -level elevated MICs to azithromycin (2.0 & mu;g ml-1), carried a mosaic mtr operon and variants in PorB, and showed expansion with respect to data previously reported from 2018. The second largest clade predominantly carried the GyrA S91F variant, was largely ciprofloxacin resistant (MIC & GE;1.0 & mu;g ml-1), and showed significant expansion with respect to 2018. Overall, a low proportion of isolates had medium-to high -level elevated MIC to azithromycin ((& GE;4.0 & mu;g ml-1), based on C2611T or A2059G 23S rRNA variants). One isolate carried the penA 60.001 allele resulting in elevated MICs to cefixime and ceftriaxone of 1.0 & mu;g ml-1. This high-resolution snapshot of genetic profiles of 1710 GC sequences, through a comparison with 2018 data (1479 GC sequences) within the sentinel system, highlights change in proportions and expansion of select GC strains and the associated genetic mechanisms of resistance. The knowledge gained through molecular surveillance may support rapid identification of outbreaks of concern. Continued monitoring may inform public health responses to limit the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea.

TI  - Extraction of Pddy Rice Planting Area Based on Multi -Temporal FY-3 MERSI Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate monitoring of paddy rice planting areas distribution plays an important role in formulating regional agricultural production policies and protecting regional food security. With the successful launch of FY series satellites, domestic satellite data have been increasingly used in crop information monitoring, but there are few studies on the extraction of paddy rice planting distribution information based on FY data. In order to quickly and accurately obtain paddy rice planting distribution information and explore the application potential of FY remote sensing data in monitoring paddy rice planting distribution, the study was conducted to extract paddy rice planting distribution based on FY-3 MERSI data in Panjin county, Liaoning Province. Five images of FY MERSI data during the growth period of paddy rice in 2019 were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) and NDWI NDVI. The temporal sequence analysis of these vegetation indices was carried out on the interest areas of six land cover types in Panjin county, including paddy rice, building land, water body, natural vegetation, natural wetland and dry land. The optimal recognition mode and threshold were determined using NDVI, NDWI, RVI and NDWI-NDVI time series curves, and the remote sensing extraction model of paddy rice planting distribution was established. First, the paddy rice planting distribution was roughly extracted according to NDWI-NDVI>-O. 14 at the transplanting stage and NDWI NDVI<-0. 4 at the heading stage. Then, other land cover types were masked based on the difference of NDVI, NDWI and RVI curve characteristics between paddy rice and other land cover types, and the spatial distribution of paddy rice planting in the study area in 2019 was obtained. Based on field survey data, the accuracy of paddy rice planting distribution in the study area was verified, and the overall accuracy was 75%. Accuracy verification was also conducted based on remote sensing visual interpretation data, the overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, paddy rice mapping accuracy and user accuracy were 80. 80%, 0. 61, 80. 00% and 86. 96%, respectively. The paddy rice planting area in the study area in 2019 was 116 618. 75 hm(2), consistent with the data published in the 2019 Panjin Statistical Yearbook. The study shows that extracting paddy rice planting distribution based on FY-3 MERSI remote sensing image can satisfy the requirements of remote sensing monitoring of regional crop planting distribution. FY-3 MERSI has great application potential in extracting crop planting distribution information. The study enriches the remote sensing data sources for crop planting distribution monitoring and provides a theoretical basis for promoting the practical application of FY data.

TI  - Non-Subsampling Shearlet Transform Remote Sensing Image Fusion with Improved Dual-channel Adaptive Pulse Coupled Neural Network
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion, an effective method that integrates information contained in multispectral and panchromatic images, has become a powerful application technology in fields such as territorial spatial planning and disaster detection. A new method of remote sensing image fusion in non- subsampling shearlet transform ( NSST) domain is proposed on the basis of research on fusion strategy in the NSST domain. First, the source image is NSST decomposed into low-frequency coefficients and multi-directional high-frequency subbands. Subsequently, to solve the problems of energy conservation and detail extraction, an image feature weighting mechanism based on the mean spectral radius weights the energy attribute and the improved Laplacian energy sum and applies these to low-frequency coefficient fusion. Next, an improved dual- channel pulse coupled neural network is developed to fuse the high- frequency subbands by combining the weighted adaptive method with the direction information to determine the weight. Finally, the fused lowfrequency coefficients and high-frequency subbands are used for reconstruction to obtain the fused image. The effectiveness of this method is verified by 48 sets of satellite images with three different resolutions, namely, GF-2, GeoEye, and WorldView-3. The comparison experiment with five fusion methods shows this new method can achieve good results in visual perception and quantitative evaluation indicators.

TI  - Suspected Nonfatal Cocaine-Involved Overdoses Overall and With Co-involvement of Opioids
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a syndrome definition for detection of suspected nonfatal cocaine-involved overdoses. The definition can be used to monitor trends and detect anomalies in emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance data at the national, state, and local levels.Objective:This study describes the development of the nonfatal, unintentional/undetermined intent cocaine-involved overdose (UUCOD) definition and analysis of trends over time.Design/Setting:CDC developed the UUCOD definition to query ED data in CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). Data between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed from 29 states sharing data access in the Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology (DOSE) System via NSSP. Using Joinpoint regression, trends were analyzed for UUCOD overall, by sex and age group, and for UUCOD co-involving opioids.Measures:Time trends between 2018 and 2021 were analyzed by examining average monthly percentage change. Individual trend segments and trend inflection points were analyzed by examining monthly percentage change.Results:During 2018-2021, a total of 27 240 UUCOD visits were identified by the syndrome definition. Analyses identified different patterns in trends for males and females, with largely similar trends for persons aged 15 to 44 years and 45 years or older. Analyses also identified seasonal patterns with increases in spring/summer months in UUCOD overall and UUCOD co-involving opioids and declines for both in fall/winter months.Conclusion:This UUCOD syndrome definition will be useful for ongoing monitoring of suspected nonfatal overdoses involving cocaine and co-involving cocaine and opioids. Ongoing assessment of cocaine-involved overdose trends might identify anomalies requiring further investigation and inform deployment of resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - In connection with the 90th anniversary of A.V. Brushlinsky, the article presents the results of a scientifc study of his life path and creative activity. The key role of S.L. Rubinstein in the formation of the scientifc and psychological worldview of A.V. Brushlinsky and the methods of its theoretical and experimental implementation on the material of the study of thinking by means of a procedural-activity approach is substantiated. Various directions of A.V. Brushlinsky's cognitive searches in the study of the nature of the psyche, the processes of thinking and communication, personality types and forms of her consciousness, types of interaction of social representations and communications from the standpoint of the principle of unity of consciousness and activity are characterized. The interaction of the process-activity approach with the principle of subjectivity of the psyche in the school of S.L. Rubinstein is shown, which led A.V. Brushlinsky to develop the subject-activity paradigm, which has become one of the leading in various felds of modern psychology.

TI  - Congenital rubella syndrome surveillance in India, 2016-21: Analysis of five years surveillance data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In India, facility-based surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) was initiated in 2016 to estimate the burden and monitor the progress made in rubella control. We analyzed the surveillance data for 2016-2021 from 14 sentinel sites to describe the epidemiology of CRS.Method: We analyzed the surveillance data to describe the distribution of suspected and labora-tory confirmed CRS patients by time, place and person characteristics. We compared clinical signs of laboratory confirmed CRS and discarded case-patients to find independent predictors of CRS using logistic regression analysis and developed a risk prediction model.Results: During 2016-21, surveillance sites enrolled 3940 suspected CRS case-patients (Age 3.5 months, SD: 3.5). About one-fifth (n = 813, 20.6%) were enrolled during newborn examination. Of the suspected CRS patients, 493 (12.5%) had laboratory evidence of rubella infection. The proportion of laboratory confirmed CRS cases declined from 26% in 2017 to 8.7% in 2021. Laboratory confirmed patients had higher odds of having hearing impairment (Odds ratio [OR] = 9.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.6-16.2), cataract (OR = 7.8, 95% CI: 5.4-11.2), pigmentary retinopathy (OR = 6.7, 95 CI: 3.3-13.6), structural heart defect with hearing impairment (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.2-12.2) and glaucoma (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.2-8.1). Nomogram, along with a web version, was developed.Conclusions: Rubella continues to be a significant public health issue in India. The declining trend of test positivity among suspected CRS case-patients needs to be monitored through continued surveillance in these sentinel sites.

TI  - Regional thermal environments (RTEs) and driving forces in six urban agglomerations of China and America
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China and America have several large urban agglomerations that are important for global urbanisation, but both face serious regional thermal environment (RTE) problems. This study compares the RTE of six urban agglomerations in China and America in summer in terms of the thermal landscape and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) distributions using Terra MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and analyses the impacts of land development intensity (LDI), the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, wind speed, and surface albedo on the RTE. The results show that the RTE problem of aggregated high or sub-high LST zones in large areas across city boundaries is widespread in Chinese urban agglomerations. However, the RTE problem of high SUHII values is more obvious in American urban agglomerations. The LDI and LST have a strong spatial correlation that shows a clear upward trend in Chinese urban agglomerations. The oLDI and oNDVI have significant impacts on the SUHII of urban agglomerations in China and America. The impacts of precipitation, wind speed, and albedo on the SUHII vary greatly between China and America. By further examining the spatial structure of the LDI, gross domestic product (GDP), and population in urban agglomerations, this study suggests that constructing a decentralised, multicentre network spatial structure in urban agglomerations, improving urban vegetation coverage and ventilation, and selecting appropriate building materials may be important paths to improving the RTE and promoting the sustainable development of urban agglomerations.

TI  - Climate and aridity measures relationships with spectral vegetation indices across desert fringe shrublands in the South-Eastern Mediterranean Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean regions are hot spots of climate change, where the expected decrease in water resources threatens the sustainability of shrublands at their arid margins. Studying spectral vegetation indices' relationships with rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) changes across Mediterranean to arid transition zones is instrumental for developing methods for mapping and monitoring the effects of climate change on desert fringe shrublands. Here we examined relationships between 17 spectral vegetation indices (VIs) and four climate and aridity measures, i.e., rainfall, PET, aridity index (AI), and water deficit (WD), calculated at accumulation lags between 1 and 6 months. For this purpose, VIs for 38 sites (100 x 100 m each) representing less disturbed areas were extracted from Sentinel 2A images for 3 years with high (2016), low (2017), and average (2018) annual rainfall. Most of the VIs had shown the highest correlation with the four climate and aridity measures at 2-month accumulation interval. While NDVI relationships with climate measures gained the widest use, our data suggest that indices combining NIR and SWIR bands better correlate with climate parameters. AI is one of the leading annual measures of dryness worldwide; when calculating it monthly, WD was found to represent better the balance between precipitation and PET across the climate transition zone and to be better correlated with VIs. Relationships between NIR and SWIR VIs and water deficit may thus facilitate improvements in monitoring and mapping desert fringe shrublands' responses to climate change if supported by similar results from other areas.

TI  - Glacier changes and their impacts on the melt runoff in high and moderate elevation ranges of Himalayan Upper Ganges Basin
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise in temperatures over the Himalayan regions due to climate change have shown profound effects on the seasonality and long-term availability of snow melt runoff and glacier melt runoff. As per the sixth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Himalayan glaciers are retreating and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is altering. This study analyses the effect of snow-glacier changes on the melt runoff (1986-2020) over the Upper Ganga river basin (up to Rishikesh) using a fully distributed model namely, Spatial Process in Hydrology (SPHY), which governs by Temperature Index Model approach with varying degree-day factors. This study performs the two-step calibration approach for model parameterization and to evaluate the snow and glacier melt runoff utilizing the observed discharge and real time satellite datasets. The SPHY derived snow cover was compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived snow covers. Results show that the SPHY modelled fractional snow covers found comparable to MODIS derived snow covers (similar to 70%-90% correlation). The R-2 based comparison of SPHY modelled runoff (Q) and observed Q at two gauges namely, Maneri (similar to 0.85) and Rishikesh (similar to 0.80) found reasonable. For the assessment of glacier changes and corresponding melt runoff, temporal glacier maps (i.e., for years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) were prepared utilizing the Landsat imageries. Results showed a noticeable reduction in the glacier areas (similar to 5% mass reduction in 30 years) and an increase in glacier melt runoff at different stations (e.g., at Bhojwasa similar to 3%-4% and at Rishikesh similar to 1%-2%). Similarly, a decrease in snow melt runoff (similar to 3%-4%) and an increase in rainfall runoff (similar to 3%) were computed. A month wise percent of change analysis has shown significant fluctuations in the magnitude and seasonality of all runoff components (i.e., snow Q, glacier Q, base Q and rainfall induced Q) in the Himalayan Upper Ganga basin.

TI  - Multimodal laparoscopic coincidence gamma imaging system for near-infrared fluorescence guided surgery: a preclinical study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Minimally invasive surgery has advantages in terms of quality of life and patient outcomes. Recently, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence guided surgery has widely used for preclinical and clinical trials. However, NIR fluorescence has a maximum penetration capability of 10 mm. Radiographic imaging can be a solution to overcome the depth issue of NIR fluorescence. For this reason, the performance of the multimodal imaging system, which integrates annihilation gamma (511 keV) rays, NIR fluorescence, and color images, was evaluated.Approach: The multimodal imaging system consisted of a laparoscopic module, containing an internal detector for annihilation gamma events and cameras for optical imaging, and a flat module for coincidence detection with the internal detector. The acquired images were integrated by an algorithm with post image processing and registration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multimodal imaging system, the images of a resolution target, a square bar target filled with a fluorescence dye, and a sodium-22 point source were analyzed. A preclinical test for axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with a rat model was conducted.Results: The spatial resolution of color images was equivalent to 4 lp/mm. The modulation transfer function of NIR fluorescence at 1 lp/mm was 0.83. The 511 keV gamma sensitivity and spatial resolution of the point source were 0.54 cps/kBq and 2.1 mm, respectively. The image of 511 keV gamma rays showed almost the same intensity regardless of the thickness of the tissue phantom. In the preclinical test, an integrated image of the SLN sample of the rat model was obtained with the proposed multimodal imaging system.Conclusions: With the proposed laparoscopic system, a merged image of the sample was obtained with the rat model. The annihilation gamma rays showed penetration capability with the tissue-mimicking phantom superior to that of NIR fluorescence.

TI  - Stepping Into an Equatorial Plasma Bubble With a Swarm Overfly
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA's Swarm constellation entered in a "overfly" configuration in the period between September and October 2021, when the longitudinal distance between the lower pair and the upper satellite was at its minimum since the launch of the spacecrafts. In addition, the local time of the nighttime tracks was favorable to detect and study the morphology of post-sunset equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). In this study, we focus on the Swarm overfly occurring between 00:41 UT and 00:59 UT on 30 September 2021, which covered one of the most densely instrumented regions for the study of the ionospheric irregularities embedded in the EPBs: the South American sector. By exploiting the use of ground-based receivers of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals in combination with the Swarm plasma density measurements, we study the irregularities in the EPB formed at similar to 60 degrees W and investigate the different scales of the irregularities and the cascading processes along the magnetic flux tubes. We also highlight how diffusion along the magnetic field lines occurs simultaneously with the plasma uplift, contributing then to the correct interpretation of the EPB evolution and decay process. The precious overfly conditions also allow the introduction of ionosphere-related quantities, evaluated across the tracks at satellite altitudes enlarging the possibilities given by the same quantities already available along the tracks. Such opportunity envisages the possibility to proxy the impact of EPBs on GNSS signals with Low-Earth Orbit satellite data provided by future missions specifically dedicated to the characterization of the near-Earth environment and ionospheric studies.Plain Language Summary Ionospheric Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) are the most dangerous threat to radio-wave propagation in the frequencies from HF, used for telecommunications, to L-band, emitted by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such bubbles form in the post-sunset hours at equatorial latitudes and their occurrence is still a challenge for the scientific community, in terms of capability to model their triggering mechanisms, formation, growth and decay. On 30 September 2021, a precious occasion occurred. The 3 satellites constituting the ESA's Swarm constellation-a set of three satellites, two orbiting at 440 km and flying in pairs and one at 510 km-entered in a "overfly" configuration over Brazil. In other words, the lower pair and the upper satellite flew in a narrow longitudinal band and in one of the most densely instrumented regions in terms of ground-based GNSS receiver. This translated into the possibility to step into a single EPB. We exploited this configuration and the ground-based measurements to provide an unprecedented reconstruction of a plasma bubble and to introduce new measurements that can be used by future satellite missions to provide insights on the most dangerous natural hazard to radio waves.

TI  - Exploring Forest Transformation by Analyzing Spatial-temporal Attributes of Vegetation using Vegetation Indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - world's ecosystem and environment are rapidly deteriorating with an increase in the depletion of forest conditions due to forest fires. In recent past years, wildfire incidents in Sikkim have increased due to severe climatic changes such as turbulent rainfall, untimely summers, extreme droughts in winters, and a reduction in the percentage of yearly rainfall. Forest fires are one of the numerous kinds of disasters that impose disastrous changes on the entire environment and disrupt the complex correspondence of the flora and fauna. The research's goal is to examine the vegetation indices based on different climates to know why forest vegetation is decreasing day by day from 2000 to 2023. The frequent changes in forest vegetation are extensively studied by using satellite images. This data has been collected by three satellites Landsat-5, Landsat-8, and Landsat-9 on different vegetation indices NDVI, EVI, and NDWI. East Sikkim area is chosen to compute forest vegetation indices based on the heap's landmass this region is unexplored yet and also studied about the forest changes by using different spatial temporal indices in the range of the entire district in the future. The authors of this paper have used Landsat multi-spectral data to assess changes in the area of vegetation in a sub-tropical region like a dense forest region in east Sikkim. The analysis depicts space images, computes vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NDWI), and accomplishes mathematical computation of findings. The proposed method will be helpful to discuss the variance of vegetation in the entire East Sikkim region at the time span of 2000-2023. In the analysis, we find that mean and standard deviation values change over the years in all indices. Later, we also calculated changes by using a classification model and find a total 10% change in forest areas in approximately 22 years.

TI  - The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on global influenza surveillance: Insights from 18 National Influenza Centers based on a survey conducted between November 2021 and March 2022
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNational Influenza Centers (NICs) have played a crucial role in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. The FluCov project, covering 22 countries, was initiated to monitor the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on influenza activity. MethodsThis project consisted of an epidemiological bulletin and NIC survey. The survey, designed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the influenza surveillance system, was shared with 36 NICs located across 22 countries. NICs were invited to reply between November 2021 and March 2022. ResultsWe received 18 responses from NICs in 14 countries. Most NICs (76%) indicated that the number of samples tested for influenza decreased. Yet, many NICs (60%) were able to increase their laboratory testing capacity and the "robustness" (e.g., number of sentinel sites) (59%) of their surveillance systems. In addition, sample sources (e.g., hospital or outpatient setting) shifted. All NICs reported a higher burden of work following the onset of the pandemic, with some NICs hiring additional staff or partial outsourcing to other institutes or departments. Many NICs anticipate the future integration of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance into the existing respiratory surveillance system. DiscussionThe survey shows the profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 on national influenza surveillance in the first 27 months of the pandemic. Surveillance activities were temporarily disrupted, whilst priority was given to SARS-CoV-2. However, most NICs have shown rapid adaptive capacity underlining the importance of strong national influenza surveillance systems. These developments have the potential to benefit global respiratory surveillance in the years to come; however, questions about sustainability remain.

TI  - Reducing the Use of Frozen Section for Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Carcinoma: Feasibility and Outcome
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard practice for staging the axilla in breast was used but was time-consuming and often provided falsenegative results. Delayed permanent section (PS) analysis is currently performed; FS-SLNB is maintained for selected highrisk cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. Patients and Methods: All patients with breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes undergoing SLNB at our institution from 2004 to 2020 were analyzed, comparing operative time, re-operation rate and clinical outcome in terms of regional lymphatic recurrence-free and overall survival by type of SLNB (FS vs. PS). Results: FSSLNB comprised 100% of the procedures in 2004 and 18.2% at the end of the study period. The use of PS-SLNB instead of FS-SLNB was associated with a significantly reduced rate of axillary dissection (AD): 4.4% vs. 27.2, respectively (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in re-operation rate for AD: 3.9% vs. 6.9%, respectively (p=0.20). The use of PS-SLNB significantly reduced the operative time (mean=51 minutes) (p<0.001). After a mean follow-up of 70.9 months (range=16180 months) there were no differences in regional lymphatic recurrence free or overall survival. Conclusion: The reduced use of FS-SLNB resulted in a significantly lower rate of AD, and significant operative time and costs savings, without any increase in the reoperation rate and lymphatic recurrences. Therefore, this approach is feasible, safe and beneficial, both for patients and healthcare services.

TI  - Primary angiosarcoma of the breast: Two case reports and brief review of the literature.
T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Angiosarcoma is a rare but very aggressive tumor. It occurs in all organs of the body, and approximately 8% of all angiosarcomas arise in the breast. We reported 2 cases of primary breast angiosarcomas in young women. The 2 patients showed similar clinical features, but were quite different in dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. The 2 patients were treated with mastectomy and axillary sentinel lymph node dissection and confirmed by post-operative pathological test. We suggested that dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging was the most helpful imaging tool in the diagnosis and pre-operative evaluation of the breast angiosarcoma.

TI  - Association of farmers' wellbeing in a drought-prone area, Thailand: applications of SPI and VCI indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has majorconsequences for agricultural activity, economy, and the environment. For improved drought management, it is necessary to assess drought severity, frequency, and the potential of drought occurrence. The purpose of this study is to use drought indices, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and vegetation condition index (VCI) to characterize the severity of drought and investigate the association between drought severity and subjective well-being among local farmers. The SPI was used to quantify precipitation deficits at various time scales, while the VCI was utilized to monitor crop and vegetation drought conditions. Throughout the period 2000-2017, satellite data were incorporated, as well as a household survey of rice farmers in the dry zone research region in northeastern Thailand. The findings suggest that extreme droughts occur more frequently in the central part of the northeastern region of Thailand than in the rest of the region. The influence of drought on farmers' wellbeing was evaluated at various drought severity levels. Drought and overall wellbeing are strongly linked at the household level. Thai farmers in drought-prone areas are dissatisfied with their livelihoods more than farmers in less-affected area. It is intriguing that farmers who live in drought-prone areas are more content with their lives, their communities, and their occupations than farmers who live in less drought-prone areas. In this context, using proper drought indices could potentially improve the utility of governmental interventions and community-based programs targeted at assisting drought-affected people.

TI  - Global digital elevation models for terrain morphology analysis in mountain environments: insights on Copernicus GLO-30 and ALOS AW3D30 for a large Alpine area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the quality evaluation of two of the best 1 arc-second public global digital elevation models (DEMs), Copernicus GLO-30 DEM and ALOS AW3D30 DSM, from the perspective of their capability to represent the terrain fine-scale morphology of a complex alpine landscape, located in the Italian Trentino Province. The analysis is performed on an area of 6210 km(2), considering a reference DEM derived from a high resolution and accurate airborne Lidar survey. The quality assessment goes beyond a conventional approach based on elevation differences statistics, computed on a pixels-by-pixel basis. An ad hoc approach for evaluating the capability to represent fine-scale morphology, including surface roughness, is adopted. Moreover, the quality analysis is performed considering the influence of local morphology and of the different land covers. The findings show that although the two global DEMs have comparable overall quality, their relative performances change according to local landscape characteristics. Copernicus DEM performance is on average better than ALOS in correspondence of urbanized areas as well as in areas without vegetation cover, with gentle slopes and relatively low short-range roughness. Meanwhile, ALOS DEM performance is slightly better than Copernicus in rougher terrain and steeper slopes. In general, both DEMs have poor performances in steep slopes, with a limited capability to describe fine-scale morphology. The adoption of these global DEMs for terrain analysis and modelling of earth surface processes should be performed carefully, considering the impact of different land covers and of local morphology, including surface roughness.

TI  - Potential of DESIS and PRISMA hyperspectral remote sensing data in rock classification and mineral identification:a case study for Banswara in Rajasthan, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing datasets and methods are suitable for mapping and managing the natural resources like minerals, clean water, and energy and also govern their sustainability nowadays. Hyperspectral (HS) imaging has immense potential for rock type classification, mineral mapping, and identification. This work demonstrates the potential of feature extraction techniques and unsupervised machine learning methods for the space-borne hyperspectral remote sensing data in characterizing and identifying mineral and classifying rock type in Banswara, Rajasthan, India. Feature extraction techniques can reveal variations within the data, which can help identify geological areas, reduce noise, and check the dimensionality of the data. Singular value decomposition (SVD)-based principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA (KPCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and independent component analysis (ICA) were tested for lithological mapping using recently launched DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer Hyperspectral (DESIS) and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) data in order to map geologically significant areas. Unsupervised machine learning methods, such as Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) and K-means, were also employed. Vertex component analysis (VCA) was utilized to check for similarity and identify various spectral features. Our work demonstrates the advantages of using feature extraction algorithms such as PCA and KPCA over MNF and ICA in geological mapping and interpretability. We recommend K-means as the preferred method for lithological classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data. Our work highlights the potential of advanced feature extraction algorithms for mineral mapping using hyperspectral data, providing different ways to identify minerals and ultimately leading to better mineral resource management.

TI  - Momentum Sources in Multifluid MHD and Their Relation to the Geopauses
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Trung et al. (2019b, ), we compared the geopause, a surface where the ionospheric plasma and solar wind plasma has equal parameters (by mass density, number density, or pressure), to the magnetopause to show that there was a transition in physics governing the motion of the plasmas between the different boundaries. In this study, we use multifluid magnetohydrodynamics simulation data to examine the relation of the source terms in the momentum equation and to the geopauses. We find that the geopauses do represent a transition in the physics governing the motion of the plasmas. While friction does not play a dominant role in the motion of the heliospheric and ionospheric plasmas, we find that friction shows indirectly that the ionospheric plasma can travel faster than the heliospheric plasma. Further satellite data is needed to verify the possibility of ionospheric plasma reaching speeds exceeding the solar wind.

TI  - PM2.5 Estimation using Machine Learning Models and Satellite Data: A Literature Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - researchers are beginning to appreciate the use of remote sensing satellites to assess PM2.5 levels and use machine learning algorithms to automate the collection, make sense of remote sensing data, and extract previously unseen data patterns. This study reviews delicate particulate matter (PM2.5) predictions from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and machine learning. Specifically, we review the characteristics and gap-filling methods of satellite-based AOD products, sources and components of PM2.5, observable AOD products, data mining, and the application of machine learning algorithms in publications of the past two years. The study also included functional considerations and recommendations in covariate selection, addressing the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the PM2.5-AOD relationship, and the use of cross-validation, to aid in determining the final model. A total of 79 articles were included out of 112 retrieved records consisting of articles published in 2022 totaling 43 articles, as of 2023 (until February) totaling 19 articles, and other years totaling 18 articles. Finally, the latest method works well for monthly PM2.5 estimates, while daily PM(2.5 )and hourly PM2.5 can also be achieved. This is due to the increased availability and computing power of large datasets and increased awareness of the potential benefits of predictors working together to achieve higher estimation accuracy. Some key findings are also presented in the conclusion section of this article.

TI  - Geographic distribution of<i> Microtus</i><i> arvalis</i> and Microtus rossiaemeridionalis in Eastern Europe
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF THERIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied a sample of occurrence localities of two sibling species: the common Microtus arvalis and the East-European vole M. rossiaemeridionalis, identified genetically or cytogenetically, by species distribu-tion modelling (MaxEnt) methods for the territory of Eastern Europe. Climate data and remote sensing data were used as predictors. Despite of some difference in modern distribution of the species, we did not find any significant difference between ecological preferences of the common and East-European voles. Thus, we have tried to explain modern differences in distribution without ecological arguments. Such difference can be caused by historical rea-sons, when one of the species holds the territory on the basis of the founder principle or density-dependent spatial structuring. Another possibility is a segregating based on the behavioral or physiological peculiarities of the vole species. The low AUC values of our spatial models can be explained taking into account the dynamic change of landscapes of the Russian Plain, where the zone of sympatry of the sibling species is located, as well as by poor knowledge of species distribution details.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and correlation factors of species habitat appropriateness in China from a satellite-based perspective
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - For development planning and biodiversity management in China, it is crucial to understand the past and present patterns of biodiversity. Using satellite data has proven to be an effective means of characterizing the spatial distribution of species based on the species energy hypothesis, thereby supporting the conservation of biodiversity. This study's specific purposes included assessing different surrogates for annual species richness in China using MODIS as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) and analyzing the trend and triggers of variation in DHI from 2003 to 2018. We evaluated the linear relationships between the species richness and different DHIs (containing DHI Cum, cumulative productivity; DHI Min, minimum productivity; DHI Var, intra-annual variation of productivity) in China. Further, we conducted a least squares linear regression analysis to investigate the longterm trend of the best performed DHI, as well as an analysis of correlation factors. Our results demonstrated that both DHI Cum and DHI Min had strong explanatory power for estimating species richness, while DHI Var had a poor performance. Among all individual DHIs, GPP-DHI Cum performed the best. The trend analysis showed that the species habitat appropriateness in the areas with high species habitat appropriateness tended to decrease over time, while that in the areas with low species habitat appropriateness tended to increase over time. We also found that the correlation factors for the variation of biodiversity varied spatially. The decrease of biodiversity in the south and eastern coast of China was associated with the decrease of the solar radiation, the increases of the temperature and precipitation, and the expansion of human footprint. By comparison, the increase of biodiversity in the Tibetan Plateau was associated with the increases of the temperature while that in the Loess Plateau was associated with the increases of the precipitation. In addition to climatic factors, the implementations of ecological restoration projects have also driven increased diversity. Besides an improved understanding of biodiversity dynamics, these findings may help to promote biodiversity conservation and policy making.

TI  - Revealing spatial variability of groundwater level in typical ecosystems of the Tarim Basin through ensemble algorithms and limited observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the lack of hydrological monitoring stations and groundwater observations, particularly for natural habitats, the distribution of groundwater along the Mountainous (alluvial fan)-Oasis-Desert System (MODS) in the middle reaches of the Tarim River has not yet been systematically investigated. The performance of ensemble algorithms with multi-source/multi-scale (30 m, 90 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) remote sensing data to predict the groundwater levels of the MODS of the Tarim Basin should be investigated. To improve the current knowledge on the spatial distribution of groundwater in this region, we conducted a study on the applicability of ensemble learning algorithms for groundwater assessments in typical regions of dryland, namely the Oasis-Taklimakan Desert (OTD), Nature land in Oasis system (NLOS), Irrigation area (IA), and Oasis system (OS). The results showed that the R-2 values of the groundwater level prediction accuracy for the four ecosystems were 0.92, 0.96, 0.86, and 0.50, respectively, and their corresponding optimal ensemble algorithms were AR_GRBFN, AR_RF, RotationForest_MLP, and AR_ GRBFN. The scales corresponding to the optimal prediction accuracy of OTD, NLOS, IA, and OS were 250 m, 30 m, 250 m, and 90 m, respectively, and the effect of the scale on their respective groundwater level prediction accuracies (maximum value compared to minimum value) were 11.48%, 21.63%, 26.73%, and 10.59%. Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive Regression improved the pre-diction accuracy of the base learning method by 76%, 72%, and 64%, respectively, followed by Bagging, whereas Dagging greatly increased prediction errors. Rotation Forest and Random Subspace showed stable performances and guaranteed relatively low prediction errors. Among all ensemble algorithms, Additive Regression helped the base learners obtain relatively optimal prediction accuracies with high probabilities. Except for the OS system, groundwater level could be predicted with much greater accuracy at depths of >8 m than at <8 m. The contribution analysis showed that topography and land-use patterns controlled the spatial distribution of groundwater across MODS. The ensemble learning algorithm showed good performance using multi-source and multi-scale data.

TI  - Towards the use of satellite-based tropical forest disturbance alerts to assess selective logging intensities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Illegal logging is an important driver of tropical forest loss. A wide range of organizations and interested parties wish to track selective logging activities and verify logging intensities as reported by timber companies. Recently, free availability of 10 m scale optical and radar Sentinel data has resulted in several satellite-based alert systems that can detect increasingly small-scale forest disturbances in near-real time. This paper provides insight in the usability of satellite-based forest disturbance alerts to track selective logging in tropical forests. We derive the area of tree cover loss from expert interpretations of monthly PlanetScope mosaics and assess the relationship with the RAdar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) alerts across 50 logging sites in the Congo Basin. We do this separately for various aggregation levels, and for tree cover loss from felling and skidding, and logging roads. A strong linear relationship between the alerts and visually identified tree cover loss indicates that with dense time series satellite data at 10 m scale, the area of tree cover loss in logging concessions can be accurately estimated. We demonstrate how the observed relationship can be used to improve near-real time tree cover loss estimates based on the RADD alerts. However, users should be aware that the reliability of estimations is relatively low in areas with few disturbances. In addition, a trade-off between aggregation level and accuracy requires careful consideration. An important challenge regarding remote verification of logging activities remains: as opposed to tree cover loss area, logging volumes cannot yet be directly observed by satellites. We discuss ways forward towards satellite-based assessment of logging volumes at high spatial and temporal detail, which would allow for better remote sensing based verification of reported logging intensities and tracking of illegal activities.

TI  - Epidemiology and in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents against multidrug-resistant isolates of Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in Latin America as part of the ATLAS surveillance program in 2015-2020
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The incidence of antimicrobial resistance is increasing in many parts of the world. The focus of this report is to examine changes in antimicrobial resistance epidemiology among clinical isolates of Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in six Latin American countries as part of the Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance (ATLAS) program from 2015 to 2020, with a focus on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) isolates. Methods: Non-duplicate, clinical isolates of Enterobacterales (n = 15,215) and P. aeruginosa (n = 4,614) collected by 40 laboratories in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, from 2015 to 2020, underwent centralized Clinical Lab Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution susceptibility testing. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were interpreted using 2022 CLSI breakpoints. An MDR phenotype was defined by resistance to & GE; 3 of seven sentinel agents. Results: In total, 23.3% of Enterobacterales and 25.1% of P. aeruginosa isolates were MDR. Annual percent MDR values for Enterobacterales were stable from 2015 to 2018 (21.3% to 23.7% year) but markedly increased in 2019 (31.5%) and 2020 (32.4%). Annual percent MDR values for P. aeruginosa were stable from 2015 to 2020 (23.0% to 27.6% year). Isolates were divided into two 3-year time-periods, 2015-2017 and 2018-2020, for additional analyses. For Enterobacterales, 99.3% of all isolates and 97.1% of MDR isolates from 2015-2017 were ceftazidime-avibactam-susceptible compared to 97.2% and 89.3% of isolates, respectively, from 2018-2020. For P. aeruginosa, 86.6% of all isolates and 53.9% of MDR isolates from 2015-2017 were ceftazidime avibactam-susceptible compared to 85.3% and 45.3% of isolates, respectively, from 2018-2020. Among individual countries, Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa collected in Venezuela showed the greatest reductions in ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility over time. Conclusion: MDR Enterobacterales increased in Latin America from 22% in 2015 to 32% in 2020 while MDR P. aeruginosa remained constant at 25%. Ceftazidime-avibactam remains highly active against all clinical isolates of both Enterobacterales (97.2% susceptible, 20182020) and P. aeruginosa (85.3%), and inhibited more MDR isolates (Enterobacterales, 89.3% susceptible, 2018-2020; P. aeruginosa, 45.3%) than carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. & COPY; 2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

TI  - A geo-spatial assessment of drought impacts on forest cover in yabello forest, in the semi-arid region of Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a key challenge for third-world countries whose economies are based on agriculture. Also, lack of rainfall plays a major role in accelerating climate change. Drought is resulting in a decline in vegetation greenness and plant mortality specifically in the semi-arid region. In this study, satellite-based drought assessment was used to characterize drought and its impact on forests in the semi-arid regions of Ethiopia. Drought severity and forest cover change were detected over the period between 2014 and 2022 Using geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques. Vegetation condition index (VCI) and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to detect drought severity in the present study. Results of this study showed that 2017, 2015, 2022 and 2019 were the most drought years. The forest resource is significantly decreased during severe drought years. The Minimum dense forest was observed in 2017 and 2015 over a spatial extent of 193 ha and 217 ha respectively during drought years. To evaluate how precipitation deficit affects forest function, simple linear regression is performed. Results of this linear regression "R-2 = 0.49 and P = 0.05" indicated that nearly 50% of forest greenness is influenced by precipitation deficit. This study suggested that remote sensing indices are very crucial to characterize drought patterns at a small "scale", particularly in the assessment of drought impact on forest resources.

TI  - Coastal bathymetry inversion using SAR-based altimetric gravity data: A case study over the South Sandwich Island
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global bathymetry models are usually of low accuracy over the coastline of polar areas due to the harsh climatic environment and the complex topography. Satellite altimetric gravity data can be a supplement and plays a key role in bathymetry modeling over these regions. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeters in the missions like CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A/3B can relieve waveform contamination that existed in conventional altimeters and provide data with improved accuracy and spatial resolution. In this study, we investigate the potential application of SAR altimetric gravity data in enhancing coastal bathymetry, where the effects on local bathymetry modeling introduced from SAR altimetry data are quantified and evaluated. Furthermore, we study the effects on bathymetry modeling by using different scale factor calculation approaches, where a partition-wise scheme is implemented. The numerical experiment over the South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica suggests that using SARbased altimetric gravity data improves local coastal bathymetry modeling, compared with the model calculated without SAR altimetry data by a magnitude of 3:55 m within 10 km of offshore areas. Moreover, by using the partition-wise scheme for scale factor calculation, the quality of the coastal bathymetry model is improved by 7.34 m compared with the result derived from the traditional method. These results indicate the superiority of using SAR altimetry data in coastal bathymetry inversion.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

TI  - Assimilation of data from the MWHS-II onboard the first early morning satellite FY-3E into the CMA global 4D-Var system
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiance data from satellite microwave radiometers are becoming increasingly important in the assimilation of numerical prediction systems. FengYun-3E (FY-3E), which was launched in July 2021, as the first early morning orbital satellite among FY-3 polar-orbiting meteorological satellite series, can greatly enhance the atmospheric sounding capacity in three orbits compared with the two-orbit system that is distributed in morning or afternoon orbit. Focusing on MicroWave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-II) onboard it, the schemes for thinning, quality control, bias correction and observational error calculation are developed. The scan-position-dependent biases are assessed in each channel and increasing biases near the edges of scanline are found in several temperature-sounding channels. The data quality is compared with four analogous instruments used in Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System-Global Forecast System (CMA_GFS), and the performance improvements are confirmed relative to the previous FY-3C/D MWHS-II. Three batch experiments were implemented in CMA_GFS with four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) system-assimilating only the humidity-sounding channels, the temperature-sounding channels and the combined channels-to reveal the impact of assimilation by different channel groupings. Analysis results conclude that FY-3E MWHS-II radiances are beneficial to the humidity and temperature analysis fields. These results emphasize the advantage of simultaneously assimilating the humidity/temperature-sounding channels, in which the former dominates the improvement above 700 hPa while the latter have a positive impact below 700 hPa. The forecast results also show that assimilating both the 183- and 118-GHz channels further improves the forecast skills, especially short- to medium-term forecasts in both hemispheres. FY-3E MWHS-II also improves the short-term prediction of heavy rain, which is always weakly predicted in global forecast systems. This study shows that a three polar orbits system that FY-3E began can produce marked effects in the numerical prediction system. This study also shines light on the application potential of the distinctive 118-GHz channels of MWHS-II.

TI  - Study on Shadow Detection of World View-II Remote Sensing Image Based on Band Standardization
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a valid shadow detection method subjected to WorldView-II remote images combining band standardization with principal component transformation algorithm. Eight bands among The WorldView-II image, each band indicates a specified range of values. Firstly, each band is standardized to the same scale, then utilizing three optimal bands forms a new single band. According to the characteristics of principal component, if the gray value of dark material is positive, just take it for granted, which will be used in next operation. Once the gray value is negative, it will be inverted comparing with the former. In this study, selecting the above adaption builds up an advanced shadow index. Experimental results show that the shadow index can distinguish the shadow from other objects effectively, such as water in high brightness, vegetation, roads, buildings. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference between the water in low brightness and high when using the shadow index. To cope with this problem, we propose an advanced water index based on the normalized differential water index, which is constructed to eliminate the interference of water in low brightness. Results indicate that the indexes can accurately distinguish shadow regions in the WorldView-II image data.

TI  - Comparison of quantitative volumetric analysis and linear measurement for predicting the survival of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 0-and A stage hepatocellular carcinoma after radiofrequency ablation
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The prognostic role of the tumor volume in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0 and A stages remains unclear. This study aims to compare the volumetric measurement with linear measurement in early HCC burden profile and clarify the optimal cut-off value of the tumor volume.METHODS The consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC who underwent initial and curative-intent radiofre-quency ablation (RFA) were included retrospectively. The segmentation was performed semi -auto-matically, and enhanced tumor volume (ETV) as well as total tumor volume (TTV) were obtained. The patients were categorized into high-and low-tumor burden groups according to various cut-off values derived from commonly used diameter values, X-tile software, and decision-tree analysis. The inter-and intra-reviewer agreements were measured using the intra-class correlation coeffi-cient. Univariate and multivariate time-to-event Cox regression analyses were performed to identi-fy the prognostic factors of overall survival.RESULTS A total of 73 patients with 81 lesions were analyzed in the whole cohort with a median follow-up of 31.0 (interquartile range: 16.0-36.3). In tumor segmentation, excellent consistency was observed in intra-and inter-reviewer assessments. There was a strong correlation between diameter-derived spherical volume and ETV as well as ETV and TTV. As opposed to all linear candidates and 4,188 mm3 (sphere equivalent to 2 cm in diameter), ETV >14,137 mm3 (sphere equivalent to 3 cm in diameter) or 23,000 mm3 (sphere equivalent to 3.5 cm in diameter) was identified as an independent risk factor of survival. Considering the value of hazard ratio and convenience to use, when ETV was at 23,000 mm3, it was regarded as the optimal volumetric cut-off value in differentiating survival risk.CONCLUSION The volumetric measurement outperforms linear measurement on tumor burden evaluation for survival stratification in patients at BCLC 0 and A stages HCC after RFA.

AB  - Ultra-intense laser-driven fast electron beam propagation in a silicon target is studied by three-dimensional hybrid particle-in-cell-fluid simulations. It is found that the transverse spatial profile of the fast electron beam has a significant influence on the propagation of the fast electrons. In the case of a steep spatial profile (e.g., a super-Gaussian profile), a tight fast electron beam is produced, and this excites more intense resistive magnetic fields, which pinch the electron beam strongly, leading to strong filamentation of the beam. By contrast, as the gradient of the spatial profile becomes more gentle (e.g., in the case of a Lorentzian profile), the resistive magnetic field and filamentation become weaker. This indicates that fast electron propagation in a solid target can be controlled by modulating the spatial gradient of the laser pulse edge.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Characteristics of Carbon Use Efficiency in a Virgin Forest Area of Southeast Tibet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sequestration of carbon in forests plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change and achieving carbon neutrality goals. Carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an essential metric used to evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of Vegetation. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of assessing CUE at specific regions and times to better understand its spatiotemporal variations. The southeastern region of Tibet in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is recognized as one of the most biodiverse areas in China and globally, characterized by diverse vegetation types ranging from subtropical to temperate. In this study, we focused on Nyingchi, which is the largest virgin forest area in southeast Tibet, to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic characteristics of regional CUE based on MODIS remote sensing products. The following results were obtained: (1) On a monthly scale, regional CUE exhibits significant seasonal variations, with varying patterns among different vegetation types. Specifically, the fluctuation of CUE is the lowest in high-altitude forest areas and the greatest in grasslands and barrens. On an annual scale, forests exhibit higher fluctuations than areas with sparse vegetation and the overall volatility of CUE increased over the past 11 years. (2) There are regional differences in the trend of CUE changes, with a substantial downward trend in the Himalayan region and a significant upward trend in the residual branches of the Gangdise Mountains. More than 75% of the regions exhibit no persistent trend in CUE changes. (3) Vegetation type is the main determinant of the range and characteristics of vegetation CUE changes, while the geographical location and climatic conditions affect the variation pattern. CUE in the southern and northern regions of Nyingchi at 28.5 degrees N exhibits different responses to temperature and precipitation changes, with temperature having a more significant impact on CUE.

TI  - Chronic LCMV infection regulates the effector T cell response by inducing the generation of less immunogenic dendritic cells
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Virus infection: Chronic infection weakens immune cell responsePersistent virus infections impair the ability of the immune system's dendritic cells to orchestrate a proper anti-pathogen defense, a finding that could lead to new treatments for chronic viral illnesses. Seungbo Yoo, Yun Hee Jeong, and Sang-Jun Ha of Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, and colleagues studied mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a virus carried by rodents that can cause neurological disease in humans. They showed that the virus localizes inside the bone-marrow of the animals, where it changes the way that dendritic cells form. These immunological sentinel cells normally present pieces of the viral intruder to virus-fighting T cells for them to then mount an attack. In LCMV-infected mice, the dendritic cells expressed fewer immune-stimulatory molecules and more inhibitory molecules, leading to weaker immune responses that allow for long-term viral persistence.Chronic viral infection impairs systemic immunity in the host; however, the mechanism underlying the dysfunction of immune cells in chronic viral infection is incompletely understood. In this study, we studied the lineage differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during chronic viral infection to elucidate the changes in dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and subsequent impact on T cell functionality using a chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model. We first investigated the lineage differentiation of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) to elucidate the modulation of immune cell differentiation and found that the populations highly restrained in their differentiation were common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and common dendritic cell progenitors (CDPs). Of interest, the main immune cells infected with LCMV Clone 13 (CL13) in the BM were CD11b/c(+) myeloid DCs. We next characterized CD11b(+) DCs that differentiated during chronic LCMV infection. These DCs displayed a less immunogenic phenotype than DCs in naive or acutely infected mice, showing low expression of CD80 but high expression of PD-L1, B7-H4, IDO, TGF-beta, and IL-10. Consequently, these CD11b(+) DCs induced less effective CD8(+) T cells and more Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, CD11b(+) DCs generated during CL13 infection could not induce effective CD8(+) T cells specific to the antigens of newly invading pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that DCs generated from the BM during chronic viral infection cannot activate fully functional effector CD8(+) T cells specific to newly incoming antigens as well as persistent antigens themselves, suggesting a potential cause of the functional alterations in the T cell immune response during chronic viral infection.

TI  - Seawater intrusion on the west coast of Shenzhen during 1980-2020 due to the influence of anthropogenic activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are considered key factors to affect the evolution of seawater intrusion (SWI) status. Understanding the relationships between anthropogenic factors and SWI development is crucial to formulate strategies that are used to mitigate groundwater salinization in coastal areas. In this study, we analyzed changes in land use on the west coast of Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, over the recent four decades based on remote sensing data, and evaluated the SWI degrees in three historical stages during 1980-2020 based on the hydrochemistry data. Then, combining the timelines of groundwater exploitation, land use, land reclamation, and groundwater salinization, we presented the evolution of SWI affected by anthropogenic activities on the west coast of Shenzhen. It is found that the SWI can be divided into three stages: 1988-1999, a fully developing period; 2000-2009, a partly degrading period; and 2018-2020, a fully degrading period. The interface of saline and fresh groundwater paralleling with the coastline advanced 2 km inland in 20 years and took the next 20 years to retreat about 1 km. The interface advancing and retreating correspond to the excess and the prohibition of groundwater exploitation, respectively. Meanwhile, the construction and demolishment of high-position saltwater aquaculture areas, respectively, corresponded to the increase and decrease of Cl- concentrations in these areas. Besides, the correlation between seawater mixing index (SMI) values and Na+ concentrations became much lower during the desalination of groundwater, which can be considered direct evidence for the SWI retreat.

TI  - Nowcast for cloud top height from Himawari-8 data based on deep learning algorithms
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height (CTH) indicates the vertical development of clouds. Intensely vertically developing clouds are usually accompanied by extreme weather systems and pose a threat to aviation safety. Therefore, nowcast for CTH is necessary and meaningful to guide aviation flights. In this study, we researched the nowcast for CTH (mainly within 0-2 h) based on deep learning algorithms. With Sichuan Province as the study area, we collected CTH data of Himawari-8 satellite from 2018 to 2020. Convolutional-long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) and trajectory-gated-recurrent-unit (TrajGRU) were used to build nowcast models in the encoder-forecaster framework. The optical flow model and persistence were used as benchmarks. The results showed that the deep learning models did not have significant advantages over the benchmarks in the first 20 min. However, with increasing nowcast time, the nowcast skills of the deep learning models were gradually exhibited. For all four seasons, the TrajGRU-based model showed superior performance over the ConvLSTM-based model and the benchmarks. In spring, autumn and winter, the results yielded by the ConvLSTM-based model were second only to those of the TrajGRU-based model. However, in summer, the ConvLSTM-based model did not outperform the persistence. The results of the optical flow model worsened significantly with increasing nowcast time. In contrast to the persistence, the optical flow model had almost no nowcast skills after 40 min.

TI  - Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Vegetation Restoration in Typical Grasslands of China
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands, as one of the key ecosystems relevant to the terrestrial ecosystem carbon and water cycles as well as the ecological security in China, are very sensitive to climate change and human activities. However, the relative contributions of climate change and human activities on the vegetation restoration in those regions are still controversial. Using ecosystem net primary production (NPP) as an ecological indicator, this study quantified the relative roles of climate change and human activities on vegetation restoration in Chinese typical grasslands (northern temperate grasslands and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine grasslands) by comparing the trends of actual NPP derived from MODIS and potential NPP estimated by the Thornthwaite Memorial model during 2000-2020. Results show that about 93% of the grasslands in the study area experience a recovering tendency, with an average increase of NPP (carbon) by 2.12 g. (m(2).a)(-1) (P < 0.01). Therein, nearly half of the vegetation-restored areas are jointly-dominated by climate change and human activities, while about 36% and 10% of the restored areas are controlled individually by climate change and human activities, respectively. In addition, the share of climate-change dominated areas differ greatly by grassland types, characterized by a much larger area percentage in the alpine grasslands than the temperate grasslands, and an increasing area share with a drying background climate. This study suggests that human activities are not mainly responsible for the vegetation restoration in northern temperate grasslands and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine grasslands, but they can decrease and even cancel the possible vegetation degeneration caused by worsening climate in few regions. Long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics and a multi-method comparison are needed in future studies.

TI  - Monitoring Soil Salinity Using Machine Learning and the Polarimetric Scattering Features of PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the major problems affecting arid regions, restricting the sustainable development of agriculture and ecological protection in the Keriya Oasis in Xinjiang, China. This study aims to capture the distribution of soil salinity with polarimetric parameters and various classification methods based on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2(ALOS-2) with the Phased Array Type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) and Landsat-8 OLI (OLI) images of the Keriya Oasis. Eleven polarization target decomposition methods were employed to extract the polarimetric scattering features. Furthermore, the features with the highest signal-to-noise ratio value were used and combined with the OLI optimal components to form a comprehensive dataset named OLI + PALSAR2. Next, two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, were applied to classify the surface characteristics. The results showed that better outcomes were achieved with the SVM classifier for OLI + PALSAR2 data, with the overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and F1 scores being 91.57%, 0.89, and 0.94, respectively. The results indicate the potential of using PALSAR-2 data coupled with the classification in machine learning to monitor different degrees of soil salinity in the Keriya Oasis.

TI  - Demonstrating the Potential Impacts of Assimilating <i>FY-4A</i> Visible Radiances on Forecasts of Cloud and Precipitation with a Localized Particle Filter
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on board the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite provides visible radiances that contain critical information on clouds and precipitation. In this study, the impact of assimilating FY-4A/AGRI all-sky visible radiances on the simulation of a convective system was evaluated with an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) using a localized particle filter (PF). The localized PF was implemented into the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The results of a 2-day data as-similation (DA) experiment generated encouraging outcome at a synoptic scale. Assimilating FY-4A/AGRI visible radiances with the localized PF significantly improved the analysis and forecast of cloud water path (CWP), cloud coverage, rain rate, and rainfall areas. In addition, some positive impacts were produced on the temperature and water vapor mixing ratio in the vicinity of cloudy regions. Sensitivity studies indicated that the best results were achieved by the localized PF configured with a localization distance that is equivalent to the model grid spacing (20 km) and with an adequately short cycling interval (30 min). However, the localized PF could not improve cloud vertical structures and cloud phases due to a lack of related information in the visible radiances. Moreover, the localized PF was compared with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and it was indicated that the localized PF outperformed EAKF even when the number of ensemble members was doubled for the latter, indicating a great potential of the localized PF in assimilating visible radiances.

TI  - Philosophy of mass culture and consumer society: worldview emphasis
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of new realities of mass culture and consumer society led to a number of crisis phenomena of an ontological and worldview nature. The purpose of the article is to analyze the worldview accents of modernity from the philosophical point of view of mass culture and consumer society, to outline social transformations inherent in social categories of thinking. General scientific methods of analysis of synthesis, deduction, and induction were used to write the article. The results highlighted the main characteristics of mass culture, it was established that it has a specific influence on worldview aspects. Mass production replicated mass things, chimeras of characters, values, etc., which became obsessive in society. Consumer society has turned consumption into the meaning of life. Consumption received leading roles in creating a new type of relations in society, transforming them according to its own development scheme. Consumption has become the dominant socio-cultural aspect in people's consciousness, which has pushed the economic effect into the background. This has led to the formation of a crisis of identities throughout the world, as traditional national ways of demarcation are replaced by social. The conclusions suggest turning to the ideas of the Post-Enlightenment, which contain elements of consumerism.

TI  - Helical Tomotherapy of Lymph Node-negative Early-stage Breast Cancer After Breast-conserving Surgery: Long-term Results
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Adjuvant radiotherapy is an integral part of the interdisciplinary curative treatment of breast cancer. We aimed to examine the long-term clinical results of helical tomotherapy in female patients with local restricted, lymph node negative breast cancer after breast -conserving surgery. Patients and Methods: In this single -centre analysis, 219 female patients with early-stage breast cancer (T1/2) and no lymph node metastasis (N0) following breast-conserving surgery and sentinel-node biopsy were treated with adjuvant fractionated whole breast radiation therapy using helical tomotherapy. When boost irradiation was indicated, it was administered sequentially or using the simultaneous-integrated boost technique. Local control (LC), metastasis and survival rates, acute toxicity, late toxicity, and secondary malignancy rates were analysed retrospectively. Results: The mean follow-up time was 71 months. The 5-and 8-year overall survival (OS) rates were 97.7% and 92.1%, respectively. The 5-and 8-year LC rates were 99.5% and 98.2%, while the 5-and 8-year metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates of 97.4% and 94.3%, respectively. Patients with G3 grading or negative hormone receptor status did not show significantly different results. Acute erythema occurred in 79% (grade 0-2) and 21% (grade 3) of the patients. Lymphedema of the ipsilateral arm and pneumonitis occurred in 6.4% and 1.8% of the treated patients. None of the patients developed >grade 3 toxicities during follow-up, while 1.8% developed a secondary malignancy during follow-up. Conclusion: Helical tomotherapy showed excellent long-term results and low toxicity rates. The incidence rates of secondary malignancy were relatively low and correlated with pre-existing data on radiotherapy, suggesting wider implementation of helical tomotherapy in adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer patients.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Pan-Sharpening Algorithms on Different Land Cover Types in GeoEye-1 Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the demand for very high geometric resolution satellite images has increased significantly. The pan-sharpening techniques, which are part of the data fusion techniques, enable the increase in the geometric resolution of multispectral images using panchromatic imagery of the same scene. However, it is not trivial to choose a suitable pan-sharpening algorithm: there are several, but none of these is universally recognized as the best for any type of sensor, in addition to the fact that they can provide different results with regard to the investigated scene. This article focuses on the latter aspect: analyzing pan-sharpening algorithms in relation to different land covers. A dataset of GeoEye-1 images is selected from which four study areas (frames) are extracted: one natural, one rural, one urban and one semi-urban. The type of study area is determined considering the quantity of vegetation included in it based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Nine pan-sharpening methods are applied to each frame and the resulting pan-sharpened images are compared by means of spectral and spatial quality indicators. Multicriteria analysis permits to define the best performing method related to each specific area as well as the most suitable one, considering the co-presence of different land covers in the analyzed scene. Brovey transformation fast supplies the best results among the methods analyzed in this study.

TI  - Variation in the hydrological response within the Quebrada Seca watershed in Costa Rica resulting from an increase of urban land cover
T2  - URBAN WATER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon which has provoked severe disruptions in hydrological cycles, resulting in flooding problems. While detailed studies exist for the world's temperate zones, they are few for tropical zones where most of future urbanization may occur and where flooding is already a problem. A tropical watershed in Costa Rica was used to analyze the urban development and the associated hydrological response between 1945 and 2019, based on remotely sensed data and a numerical model. Using a detailed spatial-temporal approach, we found that the watershed's overall urbanization over the timespan (+64%-points urban-areas) had led to major hydrological challenges (+80% runoff-volume, +220% peak-flow-rate and maximum-specific-discharge, and -25 min time-to-peak). These challenges were then placed in the context of historically reported flood events, providing a basis for spatially-differentiated flood mitigation actions and for guiding future urbanization. The study also provides valuable insights for other tropical regions with the same situation.

TI  - Comparison of Simulated Multispectral Reflectance among Four Sensors in Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral images accessible free of charge have increased significantly from the acquisitions by the wide-field-of-view (WFV) sensors onboard Gaofen-1/-6 (GF-1/-6), the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 (L8), and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 (S2). These images with medium spatial resolutions are beneficial for land-cover mapping to monitor local to global surface dynamics. Comparative analyses of the four sensors in classification were made under different scenarios with five classifiers, mainly based on the simulated multispectral reflectance from well-processed hyperspectral data. With channel reflectance, differences in classification between the L8 OLI and the S2 MSI were generally dependent on the classifier considered, although the two sensors performed similarly. Meanwhile, without channels over the shortwave infrared region, the GF-1/-6 WFVs showed inferior performances. With channel reflectance, the support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel generally outperformed other classifiers. With the SVM, on average, the GF-1/-6 WFVs and the L8 OLI had great increases (more than 15%) in overall accuracy relative to using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), whereas the overall accuracy improvement was about 13% for the S2 MSI. Both SVM and random forest (RF) had greater overall accuracy, which partially solved the problems of imperfect channel settings. However, under the scenario with a small number of training samples, for the GF-1/-6 WFVs, the MLC showed approximate or even better performance compared to RF. Since several factors possibly influence a classifier's performance, attention should be paid to a comparison and selection of methods. These findings were based on the simulated multispectral reflectance with focusing on spectral channel (i.e., number of channels, spectral range of the channel, and spectral response function), whereas spatial resolution and radiometric quantization were not considered. Furthermore, a limitation of this paper was largely associated with the limited spatial coverage. More case studies should be carried out with real images over areas with different geographical and environmental backgrounds. To improve the comparability in classification among different sensors, further investigations are definitely required.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Changes in Land Use and Their Driving Forces in the Circum-Bohai Coastal Zone of China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, the location and morphology of the coastline, as well as the land use/land cover (LULC) in the Circum-Bohai region in China, have undergone significant changes due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Analyzing the temporal and spatial variation in coastal lines and LULC can provide a meaningful basis for the rational allocation of land resources. Using Landsat TM/OLI series dates from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, this study applied the Linear Superposition Water Index (LSWI) and the Otsu threshold method (OTSU) algorithm to extract and analyze the coastline of the Circum-Bohai region. Additionally, the Random Forests (RF) method was employed to extract LULC information in the coastal zone. Using the geographical detector, we further explored the influence of social and economic factors, as well as natural factors, on spatial differentiation mechanisms of LULC change in the Circum-Bohai. Our results show that between 2000 and 2020, the Circum-Bohai coastline generally expanded towards the ocean by a total of 1062.99 km. The highest rate of change occurred during 2010 to 2015, and human activities were the primary cause of most of the changes, with the exception of the Yellow River Delta, where natural factors were dominant. The main types of LULC in the study area from 2000 to 2020 were farmland and construction land. The area of farmland proportion decreased by 1.75%, while the area of construction land proportion increased from 16.73% to 29.54%. Our findings indicate that the degree of land use in the Circum-Bohai is deepening. Based on our factor detection analysis, the added value of the secondary industry was the most critical influencing factor on LULC. Furthermore, the combined effect of the added value of the secondary industry and gross domestic product (GDP) has a significant driving impact on LULC. These findings can provide reference and data support for the sustainable development and comprehensive management of land resources. The relevant departments can use these results to prompt corresponding policies for the rational allocation of land resources.

TI  - Enhancing perspectives on lake impairments using satellite observations: A case study on High Rock Lake, North Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Stakeholders developing water quality improvement plans for lakes and reservoirs are challenged by the sparsity of in-situ data and the uncertainty ingrained in management decisions. This study explores how satellite images can fill gaps in water quality databases and provide more holistic assessments of impairments. The study site is an impaired water body that is serving as a pilot for improving state-wide nutrient management planning processes. An existing in-situ database was used to calibrate semi-analytical models that relate satellite reflectance values to turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS). Landsat-7 images from 1999 to 2020 that overpass High Rock Lake, North Carolina were downloaded and processed, providing 42 turbidity and 39 TSS satellite and in-situ match-ups for model calibration and validation. Model r-squared values for the fitted turbidity and TSS models are 0.72 and 0.74, and the mean absolute errors are 14.6 NTU and 3.2 mg/L. The satellite estimates were compared to the in-situ data and simulated TSS values produced by a calibrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic model. The process-based model is considered less accurate than the satellite model based on statistical performance metrics. Comparisons between data sources are illustrated with time series plots, frequency curves, and aggregate decision metrics to highlight the dependence of lake impairment assessments on the spatial and temporal frequency of available data and model accuracy.

TI  - Bible teachers cultivate social awareness of otherness
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article discusses Israeli Bible teachers' perceptions of the 'otherness' and their actions in a reality in which teachers are required to balance the tension between being experts in the field of knowledge, coping with a state curriculum that promotes a faith-religious worldview, and acting as educators in promoting discourse dealing with social issues of inclusion, respect, and tolerance for the 'other'. The research is qualitative-interpretive, based on interviews with 13 teachers. It focuses on describing and explaining Bible teachers' perceptions and interpreting their actions. Findings point to two main perceptions: (1) A perception that transcends the boundaries of biblical academic discourse and fosters a moral dialogue of integration, tolerance, openness, and awareness of the 'other' as part of the Bible teacher's role. (2) A perception focused only on biblical discourse and refrains from dealing with issues of 'otherness' in the lesson. This research offers new tools and courses of action to implement these perceptions. Its conclusions may encourage teachers to develop pedagogical flexibility and an ability to navigate through issues of 'otherness' while responding to social, value, and moral issues that arise spontaneously in the multicultural dialogue in Bible lessons.

TI  - Assessment of Temperature, Precipitation, and Snow Cover at Different Altitudes of the Varzob River Basin in Tajikistan
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of precipitation, snow cover, and temperature based on measured data is important for many applications in hydrology, meteorology, climatology, disaster management, and human activities. In this study, we used long-term historical datasets from the Varzob River Basin (VRB) in Tajikistan to evaluate the trend and magnitudinal changes in temperature, precipitation, and snow cover area in the Anzob (upstream), Maykhura (midstream), and Hushyori (downstream) regions of the VRB using the original Mann-Kendall test, modified Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope test, and Pettitt test. The results revealed a decreasing trend in the mean monthly air temperature at Anzob station in the upstream region for all months except January, February, and December between 1960 and 2018 and 1991 to 2018. In each of the three regions, the mean annual temperature indicated a clear upward trend. Seasonal precipitation indicated a large increasing trend in January and February at the Anzob station from 1960 to 2018, but a significant downward trend in April in the upstream, midstream, and downstream regions between 1960 and 1990 and from 1991 to and 2018. In the VRB, almost all stations exhibited a downward trend in annual precipitation across all periods, whereas the upstream region showed a non-significant upward trend between 1960 and 1990. The monthly analysis of snow cover in the VRB based on ground data showed that the maximum increase in snow cover occurs in April at the Anzob station (178 cm) and in March at Maykhura (138 cm) and Hushyori stations (54 cm). The Mann-Kendall test, based on MODIS data, revealed that the monthly snow cover in the VRB increased in April and July while a decrease was recorded in February, September, November, and December from 2001 to 2022. The trend's stable pattern was observed in March, May, August, and October.

TI  - Rapid Rice Yield Estimation Using Integrated Remote Sensing and Meteorological Data and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a rapid rice yield estimation workflow and customized yield prediction model by integrating remote sensing and meteorological data with machine learning (ML). Several issues need to be addressed while developing a crop yield estimation model, including data quality issues, data processing issues, selecting a suitable machine learning model that can learn from few available time-series data, and understanding the non-linear relationship between historical crop yield and remote sensing and meteorological factors. This study applied a series of data processing techniques and a customized ML model to improve the accuracy of crop yield estimation at the district level in Nepal. It was found that remote sensing-derived NDVI product alone was not sufficient for accurate estimation of crop yield. After incorporating other meteorological variables into the ML models, estimation accuracy improved dramatically. Along with NDVI, the meteorological variables of rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration also exhibited a strong association with rice yield. This study also found that stacking multiple tree-based regression models together could achieve better accuracy than benchmark linear regression or standalone ML models. Due to the unique and distinct physio-geographical setting of each district, a variation in estimation accuracy from district to district could be observed. Our data processing and ML model workflow achieved an average of 92% accuracy of yield estimation with RMSE 328.06 kg/ha and MAE 317.21 kg/ha. This methodological workflow can be replicated in other study areas and the results can help the local authorities and stakeholders understand the factors affecting crop yields as well as estimating crop yield before harvesting season to ensure food security and sustainability.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping in conjunctival and eyelid malignancies: a mini-review
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose and backgroundSentinel node biopsy (SNB) is routinely performed in patients with melanoma, breast cancer, gynaecological malignancies and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, but not for eyelid and conjunctival tumours. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the procedure, therefore this mini-review aimed to analyse the current knowledge about radioguided SNB in eyelid and conjunctival tumours.MethodsWe identified the most relevant clinical studies on SNB performed with radiotracers in eyelid and conjunctival tumours, providing technical and methodological information.ResultsWe included a total of nine studies, employing Tc-99m-sulphur colloid or albumin nanocolloids. In three studies, SPECT/CT was performed, which was helpful in defining the number and sites of the sentinel nodes and their relationship with adjacent anatomical structures. The sentinel node was identified in most studies (imaging detection rate from 82 to 100%). The positive rate for metastases ranged from 0 to 100%, leading to a change in management in case of positivity.ConclusionRadioguided SNB can be considered a feasible and safe procedure for conjunctival and eyelid malignancies, which could provide prognostic information for the treatment choice. Further confirmation in larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods is required to establish and validate this role. Finally, standardisation of the procedure would be useful.

TI  - On Surface Waves Generated by Extra-Tropical Cyclones-Part II: Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the previous companion study, satellite data were used to describe peculiar characteristics of ocean surface wave fields, generated by two extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs) rapidly propagating in the North Atlantic. Based on a 2D parametric wave model, further details are now provided to analyse and interpret the spatio-temporal evolution of very intense ETC-generated waves. Significant wave height and wavelength values are shown to reach extreme values, 18 m and 500 m, respectively. Resulting energetic swell systems waves then radiate in the whole eastern part of the North Atlantic, and more particularly in the Norwegian sea region. Moving to higher latitudes, wind forcing characteristics of ETCs evolve, with the shape of the wind field changing from quasi-cyclonic to "air jets/Icelandic lows". In this paper, the resulting swell generation and propagation, after the deformation of an individual ETC, were studied, as well. Confirmed with comparisons with multi-satellite observations, the application of the parametric-2D wave-ray model was demonstrated to provide robust and highly detailed information on wave generation under very complex wind regime changes.

TI  - Seasonal and Long-Term Phytoplankton Dynamics in the Middle Caspian According to Satellite Data and In Situ Observations in the First Decades of the 21st Century
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal and long-term variability of phytoplankton in the Middle Caspian was studied based on remote sensing data of the sea by SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua scanners in 1998-2021 and the results of field observations in 2004-2021. The seasonal variability of chlorophyll "a" (CHL) calculated from satellite data using a regional algorithm indicated that the autumn and winter seasons were the main phytoplankton production periods of the year. In summer, a period of stagnation was observed in phytoplankton growth in the surface layer. However, according to satellite data in the first months of each year, winter blooms were observed recurrently in the Middle Caspian Sea, as confirmed by the results of field observations in 2004-2021. The phytoplankton biomass during the winter vegetation period reached 4.5-5.0 g/m(3). In the first decade of the century (2004-2006), winter blooms were almost entirely (as much as 96%) formed through the mass growth of the alien diatom Cerataulina pelagica. In the modern period (2021), the winter bloom was formed both by three endemic diatom species Thalassionema nitzschioides, Cyclotella comta and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus and by two alien species Pseudo-nitzschia seriata and Cerataulina pelagica. In spring, the diatom Cyclotella caspia and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans, both endemics, dominated. In summer, the phytoplankton biomass was composed of the mass growth of small flagellates and dinoflagellates in the seasonal thermocline layer, which current remote sensing methods cannot record. The diatoms' contribution to the community's total biomass in summer did not exceed 3%. In the autumn phytoplankton, the main role was played by a diatom component represented by alien species, mainly Chaetoceros peruvianus.

TI  - The Impacts of the Application of the Ensemble Optimal Interpolation Method in Global Ocean Wave Data Assimilation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ensemble optimal interpolation method was used in this study to conduct an examination of the assimilations of significant wave height (SWH) data from HY-2A satellite altimeter based on the WAVEWATCH III global ocean wave model. The results suggested that the ensemble optimal interpolation method using HY-2A SWH data played a positive role in enhancing the accuracy of the global ocean wave simulations and could effectively improve the deviations of SWH in the simulation processes. The root mean square errors of the NDBC buoy inspections were improved by 7 to 44% after the assimilation, and those of China's offshore buoy inspections were improved by 3 to 11% after the assimilation. It was observed that the farther the buoys were from the shore, the better the effects of the assimilation improvements. The root mean square errors of the Jason-2 satellite data validations were improved by 17% after the assimilation, with monthly improvements of 8-25%. The improvements occurred in most of the global oceans, particularly in the Southern Ocean, the Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. The results obtained in this research can be used as a reference for the operational applications of China's ocean satellite data in ocean wave data assimilation and prediction.

TI  - Fitting profile water depth to improve the accuracy of lake depth inversion without bathymetric data based on ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to study how to obtain precise bathymetric and mapping in inland lakes only from satellite data. In this study, the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) photon point cloud was first denoised by combining the manual interaction (MI) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm in QiXiang Co (QXC) and Caiduochaka (CK) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Second, we proposed to fit the complete profile depth of the along-track profile and the constructed free profile by using a mathematical function. Finally, the random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) models were used to obtain bathymetric maps, and bathymetric performance and the benefits of free profile for improving accuracy were verified with the measured depth. The results indicated that the combination of the MI and DBSCAN algorithm could obtain signal photons, and the mean absolute error (MAE) between the fitted free profile water depth and the measured profile water depth was less than 0.90 m. Compared with the original tracks (gt1l, gt2l, and gt3l) in QXC (0-28 m), the MAE of the RF and LR models decreased by 0.35 m and 0.46 m for the validation dataset after adding the free profile. Similarly, the MAE of the RF and LR models decreased by 0.11-0.33 m and 0.13-0.15 m in CK, respectively. This study suggested that this method could be used to obtain the bathymetric map and improve accuracy by fitting profile depth based on ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data in shallow water.

TI  - Digital elevation model for flood hazards analysis in complex terrain: Case study from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) have been increasingly used to assess the risk of flooding worldwide. However, their effectiveness and the performance of flood risk models in areas with complex terrain, such as Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have not been comprehensively studied. This study aims to compare the performance of five distinct Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) - 30-m SRTM, 30-m ASTER, 90-m MERIT, 10 m Sentinel-1 DEM, and 12.5 m ALOSPALSAR - in estimating the inundation extent and depth of the Jeddah watershed, including three dams. Both hydrological and hydraulic modeling approaches were utilized to achieve this objective. The study findings revealed that all Global Digital Elevation Models (GDEMs) produced similar watershed boundaries in the mountain area (Wadi Qaws), except for ALOS-PALSAR, which generated a different watershed boundary from previous reports and studies. However, all GDEMs failed to accurately delineate the drainage area of one of the dams, except for SRTM and ALOS-PALSAR. Moreover, ASTER and SRTM products provided the closest estimates to ground observations, producing peak discharges of 114.1 m3/s and 110 m3/s, respectively. For the entire watershed, encompassing mountain, urban, and coastal areas, GDEMs demonstrated significant differences in the watershed boundary, streams, outlet location, and peak discharge at the watershed outlet. In addition, each GDEM's flood inundation map was significantly distinct. Overall, the results suggest that SRTM outperformed all other GDEMs in the mountain area.

TI  - Transfer learning approach based on satellite image time series for the crop classification problem
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a transfer learning approach to the crop classification problem based on time series of images from the Sentinel-2 dataset labeled for two regions: Brittany (France) and Vojvodina (Serbia). During preprocessing, cloudy images are removed from the input data, the time series are interpolated over the time dimension, and additional remote sensing indices are calculated. We chose TransformerEncoder as the base model for knowledge transfer from source to target domain with French and Serbian data, respectively. Even more, the accuracy of the base model with the preprocessing step is improved by 2% when trained and evaluated on the French dataset. The transfer learning approach with fine-tuning of the pre-trained weights on the French dataset outperformed all other methods in terms of overall accuracy 0.94 and mean class recall 0.907 on the Serbian dataset. Our partially fine-tuned model improved recall of crop types that were poorly classified by the base model. In the case of sugar beet, class recall is improved by 85.71%.

TI  - Wind Retrieval from Constellations of Small SAR Satellites: Potential for Offshore Wind Resource Assessment
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The planning of offshore wind energy projects requires wind observations over long periods for the establishment of wind speed distributions. In the marine environment, high-quality in situ observations are sparse and restricted to point locations. Numerical modeling is typically used to determine the spatial variability of the wind resource. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from satellites can be used for retrieval of wind fields over the ocean at a high spatial resolution. The recent launch of constellations of small SAR satellites by private companies will improve the sampling of SAR scenes significantly over the coming years compared with the current sampling rates offered by multi-purpose SAR missions operated by public space agencies. For the first time, wind fields are retrieved from a series of StriX SAR scenes delivered by Synspective (Japan) and also from Sentinel-1 scenes delivered by the European Space Agency. The satellite winds are compared with wind speed observations from the FINO3 mast in the North Sea. This leads to root-mean-square errors of 1.4-1.8 m s(-1) and negative biases of -0.4 m s(-1) and -1.0 m s(-1), respectively. Although the Geophysical Model Functions (GMF) applied for wind retrievals have not yet been tuned for StriX SAR observations, the wind speed accuracy is satisfactory. Through conditional sampling, we estimate the wind resource from current and future SAR sampling scenarios where the number of SAR satellites in orbit is increasing over time. We find that hourly samples are needed to fully capture the diurnal wind speed variability at the site investigated. A combination of SAR samples from current missions with samples from clusters of small SAR satellites can yield the necessary number of wind speed samples for accurate wind resource estimation. This is particularly important for sites with pronounced diurnal wind speed variability. An additional benefit of small SAR satellites is that wind speed variability can be mapped at the sub-km scale. The very high spatial resolution is valuable for characterizing the wind conditions in the vicinity of existing offshore wind farms.

TI  - Risk factors for seroma formation after axillary lymph node dissection with special focus on the impact of early shoulder exercise
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundShoulder and arm dysfunction such as reduced range of motion (ROM) and seroma formation, are common complications following axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). There are conflicting results on the effect of early postoperative exercise on the risk of seroma. This study aims to present incidence of symptomatic seroma formation in a large, population-based cohort, and assesses whether early shoulder mobilization, and other common patient and treatment-related factors are predictors of seroma.MethodsThis observational cohort study at the Surgical clinic at Lund University Hospital in Sweden, included 217 consecutive patients who underwent ALND due to breast cancer, cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), or carcinoma of unknown primary. A shoulder exercise program was introduced on the first postoperative day and data were collected at routine follow-up 4-6 weeks postsurgery. Main outcome was the strength of the associations between postsurgery exercise and seroma incidence based on logistic regression analyses, supported by data on seroma volume and number of aspirations.ResultsTwo hundred patients completed the study. The overall seroma incidence was 67.5% and the odds of seroma were lower for patients practicing ROM exercise two times/day versus 0-1 time/day (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.96, p = .038). ROM exercise greater than two times/day did not increase the volume, neither did the arm cycling exercise. ALND combined with mastectomy and CMM surgery were associated with larger seroma volumes (1116 +/- 1068ml, p = .006) and (1318 +/- 920 ml, p < .001), respectively, compared to the breast conserving surgery (537 +/- 478ml) while neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed no influence. The effect of age, patients >= 60 years compared to younger, or BMI >= 30.0 were weaker (p = .08).ConclusionsExtensive surgical treatments for breast cancer and malignant melanoma produces more seroma, and higher age and obesity may also influence the risk. ROM exercises twice daily predict a lower incidence of seroma following ALND, and more frequent shoulder exercise do not increase the volumes.

TI  - 'The Goddess Technology is a polyglot': a critical review of Eric Schatzberg, <i>Technology: critical history of a concept</i>
T2  - HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The modern concept of technology, we argue, is not the product of an exclusively Western and intellectual genealogy, as proposed by Eric Schatzberg in Technology: Critical History of a Concept. Instead its emergence must be understood as the product of a worldwide ferment, polyglot dialogue and heterogenous conceptual traditions, a global assemblage whose local manifestations took shape concurrently in multiple centers. The forms taken by this new philosophy of the nature of material action cannot be understood separately from the geopolitics of industrialization, imperialism and modern nation-building. As a concept or worldview, technology is a way of thinking inseparable from praxis. An intellectual history of the idea divorced from the politics and potency of technological action on the ground conveys a false innocence about who and what counts in history of technology, and lends itself to misleadingly simple models of knowledge transfer. Here we analyze the cases of technocracy in imperial and post-war Japan, and the evolution of technology concepts in China from late imperial to Maoist times, to suggest more inclusive approaches to tracing the history of this modern keyword.

TI  - Mapping Pluvial Flood-Induced Damages with Multi-Sensor Optical Remote Sensing: A Transferable Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pluvial floods caused by extreme overland flow inland account for half of all flood damage claims each year along with fluvial floods. In order to increase confidence in pluvial flood susceptibility mapping, overland flow models need to be intensively evaluated using observations from past events. However, most remote-sensing-based flood detection techniques only focus on the identification of degradations and/or water pixels in the close vicinity of overflowing streams after heavy rainfall. Many occurrences of pluvial-flood-induced damages such as soil erosion, gullies, landslides and mudflows located further away from the stream are thus often unrevealed. To fill this gap, a transferable remote sensing fusion method called FuSVIPR, for Fusion of Sentinel-2 & Very high resolution Imagery for Pluvial Runoff, is developed to produce damage-detection maps. Based on very high spatial resolution optical imagery (from Pleiades satellites or airborne sensors) combined with 10 m change images from Sentinel-2 satellites, the Random Forest and U-net machine/deep learning techniques are separately trained and compared to locate pluvial flood footprints on the ground at 0.5 m spatial resolution following heavy weather events. In this work, three flash flood events in the Aude and Alpes-Maritimes departments in the South of France are investigated, covering over more than 160 km(2) of rural and periurban areas between 2018 and 2020. Pluvial-flood-detection accuracies hover around 75% (with a minimum area detection ratio for annotated ground truths of 25%), and false-positive rates mostly below 2% are achieved on all three distinct events using a cross-site validation framework. FuSVIPR is then further evaluated on the latest devastating flash floods of April 2022 in the Durban area (South Africa), without additional training. Very good agreement with the impact maps produced in the context of the International Charter "Space and Major Disasters" are reached with similar performance figures. These results emphasize the high generalization capability of this method to locate pluvial floods at any time of the year and over diverse regions worldwide using a very high spatial resolution visible product and two Sentinel-2 images. The resulting impact maps have high potential for helping thorough evaluation and improvement of surface water inundation models and boosting extreme precipitation downscaling at a very high spatial resolution.

TI  - Using Satellite Images and Deep Learning to Measure Health and Living Standards in India
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using deep learning with satellite images enhances our understanding of human development at a granular spatial and temporal level. Most studies have focused on Africa and on a narrow set of asset-based indicators. This article leverages georeferenced village-level census data from across 40% of the population of India to train deep models that predicts 16 indicators of human well-being from Landsat 7 imagery. Based on the principles of transfer learning, the census-based model is used as a feature extractor to train another model that predicts an even larger set of developmental variables-over 90 variables-included in two rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS). The census-based-feature-extractor model outperforms the current standard in the literature for most of these NFHS variables. Overall, the results show that combining satellite data with Indian Census data unlocks rich information for training deep models that track human development at an unprecedented geographical and temporal resolution.

TI  - Adjuvant treatment decisions among adults aged 65 years and older with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer seen in a simple multidisciplinary clinic versus standard consultation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Randomized studies support de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a target population of older adults >= 65 years with stage I, estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. We sought to evaluate the impact of a simplified multidisciplinary clinic (s-MDC) in this population by comparing treatment patterns and patient perceptions of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) between patients seen in s-MDC vs. standard consultations.Materials and Methods: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients in the above target population who underwent surgery between August 2020 and May 2022 at our institution. Two cohorts were included: (1) patients seen in s-MDC, and (2) patients seen in standard clinic separately by medical and radiation oncology (non-s-MDC cohort). The non-s-MDC patients declined, could not attend, and/or were not referred to the s-MDC. Patients in the s-MDC cohort were prospectively administered validated questionnaires to evaluate patient re-ported data including the Decision Autonomy Preference Scale (DAPS), e-Prognosis, and Medical Maximizing -Minimizing Scale (MMS). Chi square, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents compared demographics, and lo-gistic regression evaluated RT and HT use and survey score outcomes between cohorts.Results: A total of 127 patients met inclusion criteria, with 33 s-MDC and 94 non-s-MDC patients. There was no difference between the cohorts in age, margin status, histology, grade, or focality. In the s-MDC cohort there were significantly more patients without sentinel lymph node biopsy (71.3% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) and mean tumor size was smaller (0.69 vs. 0.96 cm, p < 0.003), and Charlson comborbidity index (CCI) was higher (5.21 vs 4.96, p = 0.038). There was no significant difference in receipt of RT (65% s-MDC vs 77% standard; odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, p = 0.189), HT (78% ss-MDC vs 72% standard; OR = 1.36, p = 0.513), or both (50% s-MDC vs 59% standard; OR = 0.7, p = 0.429). The s-MDC cohort was significantly more likely to undergo accelerated (vs. standard hypofractionated) RT (70% vs 39%; OR = 3.59, p = 0.020). In s-MDC patients with completed ques-tionnaires (n = 33), all whose selected "mostly patient (n=6)" based decision making by DAPS chose RT while all "mostly doctor (n=1)" chose no RT. Based on e-Prognosis, there were lower odds of RT for increasing Schonberg score/ higher 10 yr mortality risk (OR 0.600, p = 0.048). MMS score >= 40 ("maximizer") was strongly linked with the use of RT (OR 18.57, p = 0.011).Discussion: For adults >= 65 years with early stage, ER positive breast cancer, s-MDC participation was not significantly associated with lower use of adjuvant RT or HT versus standard consultation but was significantly associated with shorter RT courses. DAPS and MMS results indicate that patient treatment preference may be predictable, highlighting an opportunity to tailor consultation discussions and recommendations based on intrinsic patient preferences and individual goals.

TI  - Building Change Detection with Deep Learning by Fusing Spectral and Texture Features of Multisource Remote Sensing Images: A GF-1 and Sentinel 2B Data Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building change detection is an important task in the remote sensing field, and the powerful feature extraction ability of the deep neural network model shows strong advantages in this task. However, the datasets used for this study are mostly three-band high-resolution remote sensing images from a single data source, and few spectral features limit the development of building change detection from multisource remote sensing images. To investigate the influence of spectral and texture features on the effect of building change detection based on deep learning, a multisource building change detection dataset (MS-HS BCD dataset) is produced in this paper using GF-1 high-resolution remote sensing images and Sentinel-2B multispectral remote sensing images. According to the different resolutions of each Sentinel-2B band, eight different multisource spectral data combinations are designed, and six advanced network models are selected for the experiments. After adding multisource spectral and texture feature data, the results show that the detection effects of the six networks improve to different degrees. Taking the MSF-Net network as an example, the F1-score and IOU improved by 0.67% and 1.09%, respectively, compared with high-resolution images, and by 7.57% and 6.21% compared with multispectral images.

TI  - Influential Spanish Politicians' Discourse of Climate Change on Twitter: A Corpus-Assisted Discourse Study
T2  - CORPUS PRAGMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This piece of research explores language use in a sample of unprecedentedly studied discourse which is that of climate change communication by influential Spanish politicians via Twitter. For that purpose, we created a specialized corpus composed of tweets tackling climate change that were posted by influential Spanish politicians during the past decade. Our aim was to reveal prominent linguistic patterns that are susceptible of conveying a specific worldview (i.e.: the wording of reality) of climate change to Twitter users. Our analysis started with keywords analysis in order to gather quantitative data about the lexical choices deployed in our corpus, then by means of qualitative analysis based on semantic classification of keywords and the examination of their concordances we were able to point out distinctive features of our corpus' discourse. Our results have revealed the prevalence of specific linguistic patterns, metaphors and frames that contribute to create a narrative of climate change as a villain and the human race, specifically political leaders, as the saviour.

TI  - Benchmark for Building Segmentation on Up-Scaled Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, we can solve a wide range of tasks using computer vision algorithms, which reduce manual labor and enable rapid analysis of the environment. The remote sensing domain provides vast amounts of satellite data, but it also poses challenges associated with processing this data. Baseline solutions with intermediate results are available for various tasks, such as forest species classification, infrastructure recognition, and emergency situation analysis using satellite data. Despite these advances, two major issues with high-performing artificial intelligence algorithms remain in the current decade. The first issue relates to the availability of data. To train a robust algorithm, a reasonable amount of well-annotated training data is required. The second issue is the availability of satellite data, which is another concern. Even though there are a number of data providers, high-resolution and up-to-date imagery is extremely expensive. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing an effective pipeline for building segmentation that utilizes freely available Sentinel-2 data with 10 m spatial resolution. The approach we use combines a super-resolution (SR) component with a semantic segmentation component. As a result, we simultaneously consider and analyze SR and building segmentation tasks to improve the quality of the infrastructure analysis through medium-resolution satellite data. Additionally, we collected and made available a unique dataset for the Russian Federation covering area of 1091.2 square kilometers. The dataset provides Sentinel-2 imagery adjusted to the spatial resolution of 2.5 m and is accompanied by semantic segmentation masks. The building footprints were created using OpenStreetMap data that was manually checked and verified. Several experiments were conducted for the SR task, using advanced image SR methods such as the diffusion-based SR3 model, RCAN, SRGAN, and MCGR. The MCGR network produced the best result, with a PSNR of 27.54 and SSIM of 0.79. The obtained SR images were then used to tackle the building segmentation task with different neural network models, including DeepLabV3 with different encoders, SWIN, and Twins transformers. The SWIN transformer achieved the best results, with an F1-score of 79.60.

TI  - Evaluation of River Water Quality Index Using Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To restrict the entry of polluting components into water bodies, particularly rivers, it is critical to undertake timely monitoring and make rapid choices. Traditional techniques of assessing water quality are typically costly and time-consuming. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and the availability of high-resolution satellite images in recent years, a significant opportunity for water quality monitoring has arisen. In this study, the water quality index (WQI) for the Hudson River has been estimated using Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images and four Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as M5 Model Tree (MT), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). In this way, 13 water quality parameters (WQPs) (i.e., Turbidity, Sulfate, Sodium, Potassium, Hardness, Fluoride, Dissolved Oxygen, Chloride, Arsenic, Alkalinity, pH, Nitrate, and Magnesium) were measured between 14 March 2021 and 16 June 2021 at a site near Poughkeepsie, New York. First, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were created between these WQPs parameters and the spectral indices of Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS images, and then, the most correlated spectral indices were selected as input variables of AI models. With reference to the measured values of WQPs, the WQI was determined according to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines. After that, AI models were developed through the training and testing stages, and then estimated values of WQI were compared to the actual values. The results of the AI models' performance showed that the MARS model had the best performance among the other AI models for monitoring WQI. The results demonstrated the high effectiveness and power of estimating WQI utilizing a combination of satellite images and artificial intelligence models.

TI  - Assessing Coastal Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Dynamics Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial techniques can be used to assess the dynamic conditions of coastal land use and land cover in order to make informed decisions about future management strategies for sustainable development through a combination of remote sensing data with field observations of shoreline characteristics along coastlines worldwide. Geospatial techniques offer an invaluable method for analyzing complex coastal systems at multiple scales. The coastal land use and land cover from the Subarnarekha (Orissa) to the Rasulpur estuaries (West Bengal) along the Bay of Bengal are dynamically modified by a complex interaction between land and sea. This is due to various dominating factors of physical and anthropogenic activities, which cause changes in the landscape. The main objective of this study was to identify the periodical transformation and changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) features by the USGS-LULC classification method using a maximum-likelihood classifier (MLC) algorithm and satellite images for the period 1975-2018. The entire study area was divided into three 'littoral zones' (LZs). This will help in understanding how LULC has changed over time, as well as providing insight into human activities impacting on coastal environments. This study focused on five features selected for LULC classification, namely, built-up, vegetation, soil, sand and shallow-water areas. The purpose of this study was to investigate human encroachment near shore areas as well as the transformation of soil and sand into built-up areas over a 43-year period from 1975 to 2018 using geospatial techniques. To estimate the changes in the areas, a geodatabase was prepared for each LULC feature. Finally, statistical analysis was performed on all available datasets, which allowed the researchers to identify trends in land-cover change from 1975-2018 within each category, such as increasing deforestation and urbanization rates due to increased population growth. The results of the study show the expansion of shallow-water areas, which is one of the major factors influencing coastal erosion. Maximum shallow-water-level enhancement was observed in LZ I and LZ II. In LZ I, shallow water increased from 1 km(2) to 4.55 km(2). In LZ II, the initial 1.7 km(2) shallow-water area increased to 13.56 km(2), meaning an increase of 11.86 km(2) in shallow-water zones. A positive change was noticed in vegetation area, which increased from 2.82% (4.13 km(2)) to 15.46% (22.07 km(2)). Accuracy assessment was applied for all classified images, and more than 85% accuracy was considered for the overall accuracy assessment. Finally, Kappa coefficient statistics were adopted to complete the accuracy analysis, and 80% or more than 80% accuracy was obtained for all classified images. This information can also help inform policy makers about potential environmental impacts associated with certain activities, such as coastal development and agricultural expansion, so that appropriate steps can be taken towards mitigating these impacts before it is too late.

TI  - Risk Assessment of Rising Temperatures Using Landsat 4-9 LST Time Series and Meta® Population Dataset: An Application in Aosta Valley, NW Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data have assumed a key role in environmental monitoring, as well as in risk assessment. Rising temperatures and consequently heat waves due to ongoing climate change represent an important risk considering the population, as well as animals, exposed. This study was focused on the Aosta Valley Region in NW Italy. To assess population exposure to these patterns, the following datasets have been considered: (1) HDX Meta population dataset refined and updated in order to map population distribution and its features; (2) Landsat collection (missions 4 to 9) from 1984 to 2022 obtained and calibrated in Google Earth Engine to model LST trends. A pixel-based analysis was performed considering Aosta Valley settlements and relative population distribution according to the Meta population dataset. From Landsat data, LST trends were modelled. The LST gains computed were used to produce risk exposure maps considering the population distribution and structure (such as ages, gender, etc.). To check the consistency and quality of the HDX population dataset, MAE was computed considering the ISTAT population dataset at the municipality level. Exposure-risk maps were finally realized adopting two different approaches. The first one considers only LST gain maximum by performing an ISODATA unsupervised classification clustering in which the separability of each class obtained and was checked by computing the Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distances. The second one was to map the rising temperature exposure by developing and performing a risk geo-analysis. In this last case the input parameters considered were defined after performing a multivariate regression in which LST maximum was correlated and tested considering (a) Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), (b) Quote, (c) Slope, (d) Aspect, (e) Potential Incoming Solar Radiation (mean sunlight duration in the meteorological summer season), and (f) LST gain mean. Results show a steeper increase in LST maximum trend, especially in the bottom valley municipalities, and especially in new built-up areas, where more than 60% of the Aosta Valley population and domestic animals live and where a high exposure has been detected and mapped with both approaches performed. Maps produced may help the local planners and the civil protection services to face global warming from a One Health perspective.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Supply of water is one of the most significant determinants of regional crop production and human food security. To promote sustainable management of agricultural water, the crop water requirement assessment (CropWRA) model was introduced as a tool for the assessment of satisfied degree of crop water requirements (CWR). Crop combination, water availability for agricultural production, water accessibility, and other indices were calculated considering the DEM, hydrological and climatic data, and crop properties for measuring the agricultural water requirement and satisfied degree in Bansloi River basin using the CropWRA model. Advanced machine learning model random forest was used to calculate the soil moisture considering the atmospheric variable, Landsat indices, and energy balance components for calculating the crop water satisfied degree and water requirement. The average crop water demand is 1.92 m, and it ranges from 1.58 to 2.26 m. The demand of crop water is more in the western part of the basin than the eastern part. The CropWSD (crop water satisfied degree) ranges from 17 to 116% due to variation in topography, river system, crop combination, land use, water uses, etc. The average crop water satisfied degree is 59%. About 71% of the total area is under 40% to 60% CropWSD level. CropWRA model can be applied for the sustainable water resource management, irrigation infrastructure development, and use of other modern technologies.

TI  - Forage Biomass Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Imagery at High Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forages are the most important kind of crops at high latitudes and are the main feeding source for ruminant-based dairy industries. Maximizing the economic and ecological performances of farms and, to some extent, of the meat and dairy sectors require adequate and timely supportive field-specific information such as available biomass. Sentinel-2 satellites provide open access imagery that can monitor vegetation frequently. These spectral data were used to estimate the dry matter yield (DMY) of harvested forage fields in northern Sweden. Field measurements were conducted over two years at four sites with contrasting soil and climate conditions. Univariate regression and multivariate regression, including partial least square, support vector machine and random forest, were tested for their capability to accurately and robustly estimate in-season DMY using reflectance values and vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 spectral bands. Models were built using an iterative (300 times) calibration and validation approach (75% and 25% for calibration and validation, respectively), and their performances were formally evaluated using an independent dataset. Among these algorithms, random forest regression (RFR) produced the most stable and robust results, with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) values (average +/- standard deviation) for the calibration, validation and evaluation of 0.92 +/- 0.01, 0.55 +/- 0.22 and 0.86 +/- 0.04, respectively. Although relatively promising, these results call for larger and more comprehensive datasets as performances vary largely between calibration, validation and evaluation datasets. Moreover, RFR, as any machine learning algorithm regression, requires a very large dataset to become stable in terms of performance.

TI  - Monitoring of tectonic deformation in the seismic gap of the Mentawai Islands using ALOS-1 and ALOS-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ever since the last occurrence of a significant earthquake in the Mentawai megathrust zone in 2000, no significant earthquake events have been recorded, which, according to the earthquake repetition cycle, suggests that the zone is a potential epicenter of future earthquakes. The south-ern and northern parts of the zone have been struck by a significant earthquake with magnitude M > 8.0; however, in the potential location of the Mentawai Islands, earthquake energy has not been released. This research shows the tectonic activity, velocity, and shift that occurred owing to the thrust of the plate. The information is a vital reference for estimating the epicenter of the earthquake whose energy has not yet been released. We analyzed the tectonic characteristics ac-cording to the synthetic aperture radar data and geodetic global positioning system observations. The results show that the Pagai Islands are experiencing consistent tectonic deformations. The northern region of North Pagai and the Northern region of South Pagai are experiencing signifi-cant subsidence, while the southwest (SW) region of North Pagai and the south segment of South Pagai are experiencing significant uplift. The government and local authorities can use this infor-mation as a guide for developing strategies for disaster preparation.

TI  - Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) in <i>Nature's Way-Our Way</i>: braiding physical literacy and risky play through Indigenous games, activities, cultural connections, and traditional teachings
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing philosophical and empirical evidence shows that physical literacy and risky play enriches movement opportunities, while also fostering increased physical activity, wholistic health, and wellness across the lifespan. However, physical literacy and risky play have typically been theorized and practiced from a western worldview. In response, Nature's Way-Our Way is an initiative designed to ground physical literacy and risky play in Indigenous games, activities, cultural connections, and traditional teachings, as enacted in Early Childhood Education Centres across Saskatchewan, Canada. This article explores Nature's Way-Our Way's theoretical underpinnings of Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing), adopted to braid together the strengths of Indigenous Knowledges with western knowledge through practices of Indigenous metissage (land and story-based approaches to curriculum informed by relationality). Providing examples of culturally rooted resources, this article shows how the Nature's Way-Our Way initiative supports Indigenous self-determination and sovereignty to foster increased physical activity, wholistic health, and wellness across the lifespan.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing-based Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Study of Vanishing Dry Fluvial Channels in Parts of Foothills of North-Western Himalayas and Indo-Gangatic Flood Plains, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a workflow to quantify and map long-term (1990-2020) changing land cover, especially of the fluvial systems, in parts of the foothills of north-western Himalayas, mainly between the Satluj and Ghagghar River flood plains in north-west India. The workflow begins with principal component analysis of seven Landsat annual median images, followed by change vector analysis of spectral indices and hybrid image classification. The analysis identified a significant amount of disappeared dry fluvial channels (59.6 km(2) area; 1215 km length). Other changes included appearance of new water bodies (6.3 km(2) of reservoir/lake area), including 1.9 km(2) of five major lakes due to dam construction in the upstream, conversion of 226.4 km(2) area from non-built-up to built-up, and an increase in vegetation intensity. Vanishing fluvial channels being replaced by other land use/land cover (LULC) classes (vegetation (42.4%) and built-up (12%)) may eventually cause urban floods, requiring policy measures. The integrated semi-automatic workflow proposed in this study, implemented primarily in Google Earth Engine, was well suited for this analysis.

TI  - Uncertainties and controversies in axillary management of patients with breast cancer
T2  - CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The aims of this Oncoplastic Breast Consortium and European Breast Cancer Research Association of Surgical Trialists initiative were to identify uncertainties and controversies in axillary management of early breast cancer and to recommend appropriate strategies to address them. By use of Delphi methods, 15 questions were prior-itized by more than 250 breast surgeons, patient advocates and radiation oncologists from 60 countries. Sub-sequently, a global virtual consensus panel considered available data, ongoing studies and resource utilization. It agreed that research should no longer be prioritized for standardization of axillary imaging, de-escalation of axillary surgery in node-positive cancer and risk evaluation of modern surgery and radiotherapy. Instead, expert consensus recommendations for clinical practice should be based on current evidence and updated once results from ongoing studies become available. Research on de-escalation of radiotherapy and identification of the most relevant endpoints in axillary management should encompass a meta-analysis to identify knowledge gaps, fol-lowed by a Delphi process to prioritize and a consensus conference to refine recommendations for specific trial designs. Finally, treatment of residual nodal disease after surgery was recommended to be assessed in a pro-spective register.

TI  - How is the performance of satellite-based product suites in monitoring long-term dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis over global mountainous areas?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the mountain vegetation photosynthesis is essential to understanding global climate change. Currently, several long-term satellite-based product suites have generated various variables associated with photosynthesis, while little is known about the consistency and accuracy of multiple variables in the same product suite. Here, the performances of three typical product suites during 2000-2018, namely Moderateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS), and Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), were assessed over global mountainous areas. Considering the limited in situ measurements over mountainous areas, high-quality solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrievals were adopted innovatively to evaluate multiple variables from different suites, and the consistencies of multiple variables in the same product suite were also assessed by investigating their concurrent extremes. Results illustrated that the combination of multiple variables from GLASS and MODIS tracked the dynamics of mountain vegetation photosynthesis well, with the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 41% and 44%, respectively. The concurrent extremes of GLASS matched better with the existing conclusions than those of MODIS, suggesting a better consistency of GLASS over mountainous areas. GLASS and MODIS presented a better ability (1) over flat areas than over mountainous areas (with a lower rRMSE of similar to 5%) and (2) in vegetation types with obvious leaf phenology. Results also showed that GLASS leaf area index (LAI) had a better ability to track the dynamics of photosynthesis than GIMMS LAI. This work can provide essential references in modeling mountain vegetation photosynthesis based on satellite-based product suites.

TI  - Applying Time-Expended Sampling to Ensemble Assimilation of Remote-Sensing Data for Short-Term Predictions of Thunderstorms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By sampling perturbed state vectors from each ensemble forecast at additional time levels shifted by +/- t (where t is a selected time interval) from the analysis time, time-expanded sampling (TES) can not only sample timing errors (or phase errors) but also triple the analysis ensemble size for covariance construction without increasing the forecast ensemble size. In this study, TES was applied to the convection-allowing ensemble-based warn-on-forecast system (WoFS), for four severe storm events, to reduce the computational costs that constrain real-time applications in the assimilation of remote-sensing data from radars and the geostationary satellite GOES-16. For each event, TES was implemented against a 36-member control experiment (E36) by reducing the forecast ensemble size to 12 but tripling the analysis ensemble size to 12 x 3 = 36 with t = 2.5 min, 5 min and 7.5 min in three TES experiments, named E12x3t2.5, E12x3t5 and E12x3t7.5, respectively. A 0-6-h forecast was created hourly after the second hour during the assimilation in each experiment. The assimilation statistics were evaluated for each experiment applied to each event and were found to be little affected by the TES, while reducing the computational cost. The forecasts produced in each experiment were verified against multi-sensor observed/estimated rainfall, reported tornadoes and damaging winds for each event. The verifications indicated that the forecasts produced in the three TES experiments had about the same capability and quality as that in the E36 for predicting hourly rainfall and the probabilities of tornadoes and damaging winds; in addition, the predictive capability and quality were not sensitive to t, although they were slightly enhanced by selecting t = 7.5 min. These results suggest that TES is attractive and useful for cost-saving real-time applications of WoFS in the assimilation of remote-sensing data and the generation of short-term severe-weather forecasts.

TI  - Evaluating Atmospheric Correction Methods for Sentinel-2 in Low-to-High-Turbidity Chinese Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inaccuracies in the atmospheric correction (AC) of data on coastal waters significantly limit the ability to quantify the parameters of water quality. Many studies have compared the effects of the atmospheric correction of data provided by the Sentinel-2 satellites, but few have investigated this issue for coastal waters in China owing to a limited amount of in situ spectral data. The authors of this study compared four processors for the atmospheric correction of data provided by Sentinel-2-the Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite'(ACOLITE), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), Polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (POLYMER), and Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC)-to identify the most suitable one for water bodies with different turbidities along the coast of China. We tested the algorithms used in these processors for turbid waters and compared the resulting inversion of the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) using in situ reflectance data from three stations with varying levels of coastal turbidity (HTYZ, DONG'OU, and MUPING). All processors significantly underestimated the results on data from the HTYZ station, which is located along waters with high turbidity, with the SeaDAS delivering the best performance, with an average band RMSE of 0.0146 and an average MAPE of 29.80%. It was followed by ACOLITE, with an average band RMSE of 0.0213 and an average MAPE of 43.43%. The performance of two AC algorithms used in ACOLITE, dark spectrum fitting (DSF) and exponential extrapolation (EXP), was also evaluated by comparing their results with in situ measurements at the HTYZ site. The ACOLITE-EXP algorithm delivered a slight improvement in results for the blue band compared with the DSF algorithm in highly turbid water, but led to no significant improvement in the green and red bands. C2RCC delivered the best performance on data from the DONG'OU station, which is located along water with medium turbidity, and from the MUPING station (water with low turbidity), with values of the MAPE of 18.58% and 28.41%, respectively.

TI  - Analysis of the Triggering and Maintenance Mechanisms of a Record-Breaking Warm-Sector Extreme-Rainfall Process in Front of an Upper-Level Trough in Tianjin, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A short-time rainstorm exceeding the extreme historical rainfall occurred in the Jinnan District of Tianjin, China, on 3 July 2022. Due to the concentrated time period of precipitation, it caused serious water accumulation in the Jinnan District. The purpose of this paper is to study the weather mechanism of this extreme rainstorm in the Jinan District of Tianjin. By analyzing the fine observation facts, we can obtain the mesoscale weather characteristics and environmental conditions of the process. The results provide a reference for similar weather forecasting and warning in the future. Based on the 1 min interval precipitation observation data, the ERA5 reanalysis data, the CINRAD-SA radar reflectivity data of Tanggu, the cloud-top brightness temperature data of the Fengyun-4A satellite, and the Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System data, we comprehensively analyzed a record-breaking extreme rainfall process in Tianjin on 3 July 2022. The results show that the extreme rainfall process presents prominent mesoscale weather characteristics, with high precipitation intensity in a short-term period. This process is influenced by multi-scale weather systems, including the 500 hPa upper-level trough and the long-distance water vapor transport by Typhoon Chaba. The rainstorm event is caused by the combined actions of cold pool outflow produced by the upstream precipitation, the easterly disturbance in the boundary layer, the mesoscale temperature front, and the ground convergence line. Specifically, the ground convergence line is formed by the northerly wind of the cold pool outflow and the warm and moist southerly airflow from the ocean, and the temperature front is caused by the horizontal thermal difference of the underlying surface. Both the ground convergence line and temperature front contribute considerably to the triggering of mesoscale convection. The mesoscale secondary circulation is formed in the meridional direction by the meso-?-scale convergence and its interaction with strong velocity in front of the trough, contributing to the development and maintenance of vertical motion in the Jinnan region of Tianjin and thereby leading to the occurrence and development of this extreme heavy rainfall process.

TI  - Subways and CO2 emissions: A global analysis with satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper estimates a global CO2 emissions model using satellite data at 25 km resolution. The model incorporates industrial sources (including power, steel, cement, and refineries), fires, and non-industrial population-related factors associated with household incomes and energy requirements. It also tests the impact of subways in the 192 cities where they operate. We find highly significant effects with the expected signs for all model variables, including subways. In a counterfactual exercise estimating CO2 emissions with and without subways, we find they have reduced population-related CO2 emissions by about 50 % for the 192 cities and about 11 % globally. Extending the analysis to future subways for other cities, we estimate the magnitude and social value of CO2 emissions reductions with conservative assumptions about population and income growth and a range of values for the social cost of carbon and investment costs. Even under pessimistic assumptions for these costs, we find that hundreds of cities realize a significant climate co-benefit, along with benefits from reduced traffic congestion and local air pollution, which have traditionally motivated subway construction. Under more moderate assumptions, we find that, on climate grounds alone, hundreds of cities realize high enough social rates of return to warrant subway construction.

TI  - Shaping the security-development nexus in Brazil: the military as a modernising and nation-building actor?
T2  - CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the end of the Cold War, the topic of military role expansion has become commonplace in the literature. Military deployments in humanitarian crises, disaster relief, border patrol, policing, counterterrorism, stability operations, and state-building played a key role in new doctrine and organisational changes. Yet, this global trend towards role expansion met a very distinct context in Brazil. Despite transitioning from an authoritarian military rule, reducing military prerogatives in government, and rethinking military roles in society, this trend reinforced an embedded idea that the armed forces have a central and all-encompassing role in the state's political, economic, and social development. This worldview derives from a Brazilian historical process of merging security and development that rose far before the discussions on the security-development nexus in the literature by the late 2000s. That said, the aim of this article is to discuss how historical political and military practices built a security-development nexus avant la lettre, in which the military played a key role. We intend to demonstrate how Brazil placed the military as a key development actor and how this process, over time, led to consequences for civil-military relations, public policies, and democracy

TI  - Generation and comprehensive validation of 30 m conterminous United States Landsat percent tree cover and forest cover loss annual products
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the generation and comprehensive validation of 30 m Landsat-based annual percent tree cover and forest cover loss products for the conter-minous United States (CONUS). The products define (i) forest status with respect to three thematic classes: stable forest, stable non-forest, forest cover loss, (ii) percent tree cover (PTC, 0-100%), (iii) percent tree cover decrease (& UDelta;PTC), and (iv) the Landsat acquisition dates bounding mapped forest cover loss occurrence. Forest was defined, based on the U.S. federal government forested land definition, as 30 m pixels with mapped PTC >10%. Annual products were derived using temporally overlapping 9-year periods (mapping within each central 5-year period) of USGS Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) with reconciliation of the results between periods. The products for 2013 are presented and were validated rigorously by comparison with 1910 30 m independent reference data interpreted from bi-temporal <1 m resolution aerial imagery selected using a Stage 3 CONUS stratified random sampling design. The stable forest, stable non-forest, and forest cover loss results were validated using standard accuracy metrics derived from the confusion matrix. The overall accuracy was high (0.92), and class-specific user's accuracy (UA) and producer's accuracy (PA) metrics were also high for the stable forest (UA = 0.94, PA = 0.84) and stable non-forest (UA = 0.90, PA = 0.97) classes. The forest cover loss class had similarly high UA (0.89) but significantly lower PA (0.61) indicating non-negligible omission errors. All standard errors were <5%. The total area of stable forest over CONUS for year 2013 was estimated as 3,049,380 & PLUSMN; 114,392 km2 and the total area of forest cover loss was estimated as 31,382 & PLUSMN; 4751 km2, with 95% confidence interval. The PTC and & UDelta;PTC products were validated by linear regression with the reference data, indicating good PTC precision reflected by a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.79), and accuracy with a regression slope close to unity (0.86) and small intercept (3.48). The regression between mapped & UDelta;PTC and the reference data had a high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.74) but a regression slope further away from unity (0.78) and small intercept (1.68) consistent with the forest cover loss omission errors revealed by the confusion matrix. State-level comparison of the stable forest mapped area with forest land area statistics published by the U.S. federal government for the 48 CONUS states indicated reasonable correspondence (R2 = 0.97) but with a 1.15 regression line slope indicating relative over estimation of the mapped stable forest area, likely related to forest land reporting differences.

TI  - Metal mixture exposures and multiplexed autoantibody screening in Navajo communities exposed to uranium mine wastes
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL AUTOIMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Environmental exposures to metals in uranium mining wastes and drinking water were documented in more than half of the 1304 Navajo community members of the Dine ' Network for Environmental Health (DiNEH) Project, the first comprehensive assessment of exposures to these metals and community health on the Navajo Nation.Objective: Evaluate environmental exposures among participants who provided blood and urine samples using multiplexed autoantibody positivity as an early effect biomarker.Methods: Survey and geospatial location data, well water quality, and metals biomonitoring were used to assess exposures to mixed-metal wastes from 100 abandoned uranium waste sites.Results: We observed that the prevalence of multiplexed autoantibody positivity in 239 participants was more than double that reported for the U.S. population (27.2% v. 13.8%) even though the national prevalence was generated using a different assay, the HEp-2 cell-based antinuclear antibody test. Increased risk of multiplexed autoantibody screening positivity (OR = 3.07,95%CI 1.15-8.22) was found among DiNEH study people who lived close to uranium mine and milling wastes and consumed metals in drinking water. Associations for females were even stronger when they lived closed to contaminated uranium mining and milling sites. Anti-U1-RNP antibodies were associated with water consumption of nickel.Conclusion: Proximity to waste sites and consumption of metals in water even below current drinking water standards were associated with perturbations of immune tolerance. These findings are consistent with previous studies of autoimmunity in the local population and demonstrate that multiplexed autoantibody screening method has a potential as sentinel indicator of exposures to environmental metals.Impact statement: This is the first, community-engaged environmental health study in exposed Navajo communities that applied clinical multiplexed testing in risk assessment of environmental metals associated with abandoned, unremediated uranium mining and milling waste sites. Routine clinical autoimmunity measures could be used as early effect biomarkers of environmental metal exposures.

TI  - Use of machine learning with two-dimensional synthetic mammography for axillary lymph node metastasis prediction in breast cancer: a preliminary study
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: As of 2020, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The non-invasive prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis using two-dimensional synthetic mammography (SM) generated from digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) could help mitigate complications related to sentinel lymph node biopsy or dissection. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the possibility of predicting ALN metastasis using radiomic analysis of SM images. Methods: Seventy-seven patients diagnosed with breast cancer using full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and DBT were included in the study. Radiomic features were calculated using segmented mass lesions. The ALN prediction models were constructed based on a logistic regression model. Parameters such as the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.Results: The FFDM model yielded an AUC value of 0.738 (95% CI: 0.608-0.867), with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.826, 0.630, 0.488, and 0.894, respectively. The SM model yielded an AUC value of 0.742 (95% CI: 0.613-0.871), with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.783, 0.630, 0.474, and 0.871, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the two models.Conclusions: The ALN prediction model using radiomic features extracted from SM images demonstrated the possibility of enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic imaging when utilised together with traditional imaging techniques.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Preparation for Recognition and Classification of Building Roofs
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings are among the most significant urban infrastructure that directly affects citizens' livelihood. Knowledge about their rooftops is essential not only for implementing different Levels of Detail (LoD) in 3D city models but also for performing urban analyses related to usage potential (solar, green, social), construction assessment, maintenance, etc. At the same time, the more detailed information we have about the urban environment, the more adequate urban digital twins we can create. This paper proposes an approach for dataset preparation using an orthophoto with a resolution of 10 cm. The goal is to obtain roof images into separate GeoTIFFs categorised by type (flat, pitched, complex) in a way suitable for feeding rooftop classification models. Although the dataset is initially elaborated for rooftop classification, it can be applied to developing other deep-learning models related to roof recognition, segmentation, and usage potential estimation. The dataset consists of 3617 roofs covering the Lozenets district of Sofia, Bulgaria. During its preparation, the local-specific context is considered.

TI  - River Bars and Vegetation Dynamics in Response to Upstream Damming: A Case Study of the Middle Yangtze River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating river bars and their vegetation dynamics in response to upstream damming is important for riverine flood management and ecological assessment. However, our mechanical understanding of the damming-induced changes in river bar and vegetation, such as bar area, morphology, and leaf area index (LAI), remains limited for large river systems. Leveraging satellite images and in situ observed hydrogeomorphic data from, we improve a machine learning-based LAI inversion model to quantify variations in river bar morphology, vegetation distribution, and LAI in the Middle Yangtze River (MYR) following the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Then we analyze the mechanisms controlling the bar and vegetation dynamics based on high-resolution river cross-sectional profiles as well as daily discharge, water levels, and sediment in both the pre- and post-TGD periods. Our results indicate that the river bar area decreased by approximately 10% from 2003 to 2020, while the vegetation area and average LAI of these bars increased by >50% and >20%, respectively. Moreover, the plant community on most river bars tended to expand from the bar tail to the bar head and from the edge to the center. The main factor driving vegetation expansion in the MYR after the TGD's operation was the reduction in bar submergence frequency (by 55%), along with a slight bar erosion. Further analysis revealed that the standard deviation of annual discharge decreased by approximately 37%, and the frequency of vegetation-erosive flow decreased by approximately 74%. Our data highlight the potential impact of large dams downstream flow regimes and vegetation encroachement. Such findings further the understanding of the biogeomorphological impacts of large dams on the river bar vegetation and have important implications for riverine plant flux estimatin, flood management and ecological restoration in dammed river systems.

TI  - Downscaling of the Land Surface Temperature Data Obtained at four Different Dates in a Year Using the GWR Model: A Case Study in Antakya, Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a major factor that affects many biophysical processes in the land-atmosphere relationship. This factor is obtained from satellite images having different temporal and spatial resolutions. This study applied the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for four different dates representing each season a year to improve the LST images obtained in coarse resolution. In this study, MODIS LST images that are available having fine temporal but coarse spatial resolution were modeled using NDBI and NDVI indices, and their spatial resolution is improved. In addition, LANDSAT 8 images were used as reference images to evaluate the accuracy of the images obtained from the models. Results of the GWR model have been evaluated by comparing it statistically with TsHARP and DisTradother commonly used methods. As a result of the comparison by using the average of four dates outputs, the GWR model (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.78) was more successful than the TsHARP (R-2 = 0.56, RMSE = 1.00) and DisTrad (R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 1.09) methods. The most successful downscaling performance in the GWR model was obtained in the spring season (RSR = 0.48). According to these findings, the GWR model can be used for downscaling LST images in urban areas. However, before applying this algorithm to scenarios outside of urban areas, it is recommended to use the required parameters and optimize their combinations.

TI  - Synoptic-to-intraseasonal atmospheric modulation of phytoplankton biomass in the inner sea of Chiloe, Northwest Patagonia (42.5°-43.5°S, 72.5°-74°W), Chile
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Inner Sea of Chiloe (ISC) in northwestern Patagonia has experienced large harmful algal blooms in the past decade, impacting human health and affecting the large aquaculture industry of the region. Thus, the investigation of factors favouring regional phytoplankton growth are of particular interest. Analysing the synoptic-to-intraseasonal variability, we explore changes in phytoplankton biomass in southern ISC (S-ISC, 42.5 degrees-43.5 degrees S, 72.5 degrees-74 degrees W) and their concurrent mesoscale and large-scale meteorological and oceanographic conditions. We use high-resolution satellite normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) and chlorophyll-a (CHL-A) from the MODIS-Aqua sensor as proxies for phytoplankton biomass, besides oceanic and atmospheric variables derived from various remote-sensing sources and atmospheric fields from the ERA5 reanalysis. Specifically, we focus on high phytoplankton biomass events HBEs, which are defined as those cases when intraseasonal nFLH anomaly (nFLH') exceeds the 95th percentile threshold. Each event was characterised by its first date of occurrence (called day 0). We detected 16 HBE between 2003 and 2019 in S-ISC. HBEs tend to occur under the influence of a mid-latitude migratory anticyclone that induce persistent cloudless conditions preceding day 0, leading to enhanced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) starting around day -8, and positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies between days -4 and +4. We hypothesise that HBEs are mainly modulated by i) mixing and advection that could contribute to a greater availability of nutrients in the upper sea layers before the onset of the anticyclonic anomalies; and ii) increased thermal stratification related to positive PAR and SST anomalies that would promote phytoplankton growth during the anticyclonic regime. Furthermore, we show that the Madden-Julian Oscillation modulates the frequency of nFLH' and thus of HBEs, a result that suggests an enhanced predictability of these cases.

TI  - Inter-Comparison of Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 during On-Orbit Initialization and Verification (OIV) Using Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (EPICS): Advanced Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three advanced methodologies were performed during Landsat-9 on orbit and initialization and verification (OIV): Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites Absolute Calibration Model Double Ratio (ExPAC Double Ratio) and Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Sites (EPICS)-based cross-calibration utilizing stable regions in Northern African desert sites (EPICS-NA) and a global scale (EPICS-Global). The development of these three techniques was described using uncertainties analysis. The ExPAC Double Ratio was derived based on the ratio between ExPAC model prediction and satellite measurements for Landsat-8 and Landsat-9. The ExPAC Double Ratio can be performed to determine differences between sensors ranging from visible, red edge, near-infrared, to short-wave infrared wavelengths. The ExPAC Double Ratio and EPICS-based inter-comparison ratio uncertainties were determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation. It was found that the uncertainty levels of 1-2% can be achieved. The EPICS-based cross-calibration results were derived using two targets: EPICS-NA and EPICS-Global, with uncertainties of 1-2.2% for all spectral bands. The inter-comparison results between Landsat-9 and Landsat-8 during the OIV period using the three advanced methods were well within 0.5% for all spectral bands except for the green band, which showed sub 1% agreement.

TI  - Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms for Soil Salinity Mapping Using Topographic Factors and Sentinel-1/2 Data: A Case Study in the Yellow River Delta of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a critical and global environmental problem. Effectively mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution of soil salinity is essential. The main aim of this work was to map soil salinity in Shandong Province located on the Yellow River Delta of China using Sentinel-1/2 remote sensing data and digital elevation model (DEM) data, coupled with soil sampling data, and combined with four regression models: support vector regression (SVR), stepwise multi-regression (SMR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest regression (RFR). For these purposes, 60 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 9 to 14 October 2019, corresponding to the Sentinel-1/2 and DEM data. Then we established a soil salinity and feature dataset based on the sampled data and the features extracted from Sentinel-1/2 and DEM data. This study adopted the feature importance of the RF model to screen all features. The results showed that the CRSI index made the greatest contribution in retrieving soil salinity in this region. In this paper, 18 sampling points were used to validate and compare the performance of the four models. The results reveal that, compared with the other regression models, the PLSR model has the best performance (R-2 = 0.66, and RMSE = 1.30). Finally, the PLSR method was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta. We concluded that the model can be used effectively for the quantitative estimation of soil salinity and provides a useful tool for ecological construction.

TI  - The Response of Auroral-Oval Waves to CIR-Driven Recurrent Storms: FY-3E/ACMag Observations
T2  - UNIVERSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alfven-branch waves provide an efficient means for transporting energy into the auroral oval. Here, we report observations of these waves obtained by the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E)/ACMag instruments, which are designed to detect three-dimensional AC magnetic fields in the 0.05-25 Hz band. The observations suggest that broadband waves are a permanent feature of the auroral oval, although their amplitude and locations vary with the global state of the magnetosphere. We primarily focus on the data obtained from 10 July 2021 to 26 August 2021, during which a series of recurrent storms driven by solar wind corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occurred. Analysis of the observations shows that the auroral-oval waves grow in amplitude (1-3 orders of magnitude) and shift to lower latitude (similar to 10 degrees C) immediately following the decrease in the SYM-H index in each storm. Further investigation reveals the response of the auroral-oval waves has a time scale equal to or less than FY-3E's effective revisiting time, which is about 45 min. The observations presented in this paper confirm that the FY-3E/ACMag instruments provide a high-resolution monitor of the auroral-oval waves and could further our understanding of auroral physics.

TI  - Lithology classification in semi-arid area combining multi-source remote sensing images using support vector machine optimized by improved particle swarm algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of multi-source remote sensing technologies is helpful for geologists to obtain more compre-hensive and complete lithological maps. In recent years, establishing automatic classification models based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has become an important approach to identify various lithologies supported by remote sensing data. Aiming at the specific geological and geographical conditions in a semi-arid area, Duolun County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, this paper integrated GaoFen-2 (GF-2), Sentinel-2A, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and GaoFen-3 (GF-3) remote sensing data, and used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the basis of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to carry out the lithology classification. Firstly, on the basis of removing the interference of vegetation information from the acquired remote sensing data, a 63-dimensional candidate feature sequence was con-structed by extracting spectral, backscattering, polarization and texture features. Secondly, an improved PSO algorithm with the Inertia Factor changing with the S-curve Decreasing function (SDIF-PSO) was proposed, and on this basis, a feature selection and lithology classification algorithm using SVM classifier based on two-layer SDIF-PSO was designed. Finally, the iterative optimization process of multiple optimization algorithms for SVM model parameters and the lithology classification accuracy before and after feature selection were compared. The experimental results showed that the proposed SDIF-PSO algorithm had the best optimization capability, with the highest cross-validation accuracy of 90.90%, which was improved by 3.85% than that of Grid-Search Optimization (GSO) algorithm, and 0.15% than that of the improved PSO algorithm with the Inertia Factor changing with the Linear Decreasing function (LDIF-PSO) and the improved PSO algorithm with the Inertia Factor Decreasing with the Concave function (CDIF-PSO). The dimension of the best feature combination was reduced to 35 through feature selection, and the convergence cross-validation accuracy reaches 92.14%, which was improved by 1.24% than that of all 63-dimensional candidate features in the same optimization process using SDIF-PSO algorithm.

TI  - Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Regional Settlements under the Background of Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study in Sishui County, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China's urbanization has achieved rapid development in the past 20 years, with towns expanding in size and the population increasing, while rural society has also undergone dramatic changes. An in-depth study on the evolution process of rural settlements in the context of rapid urbanization is beneficial to the rational planning of villages and the promotion of green and sustainable urban development. Located in East China, Sishui County is in the transition area between three types of landforms: hills, plains, and mountains. The spatial distribution of rural settlements in the urbanization process shows obvious regional differences. To our best knowledge, research on the spatio-temporal evolution of regional settlements in Sishui County is rare. In this study, we chose Sishui County as the study area, utilized Landsat5 (TM) and Landsat8 (OLI) satellite data as remote sensing data sources, and applied Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis methods, central place theory, and core-periphery theory to explore the evolution process for the pattern, scale, and structure of rural settlements in this region from 2000 to 2021 and to investigate the influencing factors. The results show that: (1) in terms of the evolution of the rural settlement pattern, its distribution shows a gradual increase in the degree of dispersion, which indicates an overall development trend in the region of Sishui County in recent years and that the trend is gradually increasing; (2) in terms of scale evolution, the degree and speed of expansion in rural settlements of Sishui County have gradually decreased, and the scale grade has gradually increased; (3) in terms of structural evolution, the hierarchy system in rural settlements of Sishui County is constantly being improved and optimized from a simple to a complex core-periphery structure. These results will provide data support for the rational planning of villages and sustainable, high-quality urban development. They will also help local governments take appropriate measures to achieve coordinated and sustainable socio-economic and environmental development in the region.

TI  - Machine learning-based detection and mapping of riverine litter utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the substantial impact of rivers on the global marine litter problem, riverine litter has been accorded inadequate consideration. Therefore, our objective was to detect riverine litter by utilizing middle-scale multispectral satellite images and machine learning (ML), with the Tisza River (Hungary) as a study area. The Very High Resolution (VHR) images obtained from the Google Earth database were employed to recognize some riverine litter spots (a blend of anthropogenic and natural substances). These litter spots served as the basis for training and validating five supervised machine-learning algorithms based on Sentinel-2 images [Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bays (NB) and Decision Tree (DT)]. To evaluate the generalization capability of the developed models, they were tested on larger unseen data under varying hydrological conditions and with different litter sizes. Besides the best-performing model was used to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of riverine litter in the Middel Tisza. According to the results, almost all the developed models showed favorable metrics based on the validation dataset (e.g., F1-score; SVC: 0.94, ANN: 0.93, RF: 0.91, DT: 0.90, and NB: 0.83); however, during the testing process, they showed medium (e.g., F1-score; RF:0.69, SVC: 0.62; ANN: 0.62) to poor performance (e.g., F1-score; NB: 0.48; DT: 0.45). The capability of all models to detect litter was bounded to the pixel size of the Sentinel-2 images. Based on the spatio-temporal investigation, hydraulic structures (e.g., Kiskore Dam) are the greatest litter accumulation spots. Although the highest transport rate of litter occurs during floods, the largest litter spot area upstream of the Kiskore Dam was observed at low stages in summer. This study represents a preliminary step in the automatic detection of riverine litter; therefore, additional research incorporating a larger dataset with more representative small litter spots, as well as finer spatial resolution images is necessary.

TI  - A New Method to Combine Coastal Sea Surface Height Estimates from Multiple Retrackers by Using the Dijkstra Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase data availability and accuracy in the coastal zone, especially in the last 5 km to the coast, we present a SCMR (Seamless Combination of Multiple Retrackers) processing strategy to combine sea surface height (SSH) estimates from waveform retrackers of SGDR MLE4, ALES, WLS3 and MB4 for Jason-3 and Saral missions, and of SAMOSA and SAMOSA+ for Sentinel-3A mission in the Australian coastal zone. The SCMR does not require the waveform classification result. It includes two steps: (1) estimating and removing the SSH bias due mainly to the significant wave height (SWH) difference-dependent height differences, and (2) determining the optimal along-track SSH profile by using the Dijkstra algorithm. In the study region, the results show that the SCMR increases the data availability by up to 15% in the last 5 km to the coast and reduces the noise level by 28-34% at the spatial scales < 2.5 km. The validation results against tide gauges show that SCMR-derived SSH estimates achieve a better accuracy than that from any single retracker, with the improvement percentage of 6.26% and 4.94% over 0-10 km and 20-100 km distance bands, respectively.

TI  - A SREBF2-dependent gene program drives an immunotolerant dendritic cell population during cancer progression.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Dendritic cells (cDCs) are essential mediators of anti-tumor immunity. Cancers have developed mechanisms to render DCs dysfunctional within the tumor microenvironment. Utilizing CD63 as a unique surface marker, we demonstrate that mature regulatory DCs (mregDCs) suppress DC antigen cross-presentation while driving T H 2 and regulatory T cell differentiation within tumor-draining lymph node tissues. Transcriptional and metabolic studies show that mregDC functionality is dependent upon the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway and the master transcription factor, SREBP2. Melanoma-derived lactate activates DC SREBP2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and drives mregDC development from conventional DCs. DC-specific genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of SREBP2 promotes anti-tumor CD8 + T cell activation and suppresses melanoma progression. CD63 + mregDCs reside within the sentinel lymph nodes of melanoma patients. Collectively, this work describes a tumor-driven SREBP2-dependent program that promotes CD63 + mregDC development and function while serving as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming immune tolerance in the TME.One Sentence Summary: The metabolic transcription factor, SREBF2, regulates the development and tolerogenic function of the mregDC population within the tumor microenvironment.

TI  - Radiopharmaceuticals for sentinel lymph node identification in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is still one of the substantial malignancies with high mortalities which early and accurate diagnosis is very decisive in providing long survival. Nuclear medicine lately introduced a novel way for evaluation of breast cancer in early and advanced stages. This method is based on sentinel lymph node scintigraphy which is more preferable over axillary lymphadenectomy, since it results in less postoperative morbidity. For this aim radiocolloids have superlative impress for detection of metastatic lymph nodes. In this short review we will try to introduce radiopharmaceuticals which play an important role in clinical application of BC lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - A 1 km Global Carbon Flux Dataset Using In Situ Measurements and Deep Learning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global carbon fluxes describe the carbon exchange between land and atmosphere. However, already available global carbon fluxes datasets have not been adjusted by the available site data and deep learning tools. In this work, a global carbon fluxes dataset (named as GCFD) of gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (RECO), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) has been developed via a deep learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km at three time steps per month from January 1999 to June 2020. Flux measurements were used as a training target while remote sensing of vegetation conditions and meteorological data were used as predictors. The results showed that CNN could outperform other commonly used machine learning methods such as random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) by leading to satisfactory performance with R-2 values of the validation stage as 0.82, 0.72 and 0.62 for GPP, RECO, and NEE modelling, respectively. Thus, CNN trained using reanalysis meteorological data and remote sensing data was chosen to produce the global dataset. GCFD showed higher accuracy and more spatial details than some other global carbon flux datasets with reasonable spatial pattern and temporal variation. GCFD is also in accordance with vegetation conditions detected by remote sensing. Owing to the obtained results, GCFD can be a useful reference for various meteorological and ecological analyses and modelling, especially when high resolution carbon flux maps are required.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Based on yours suggestion, we have shortened the abstract below 250 words and is mentioned as follows, "Internet of things (IoT) is the most advanced version of the internet to maintain a number of applications that combines different intelligent devices used by management or individuals, such as remote sensing data processing, smart health with environmental monitoring, and other related fields. IoT devices interact and interfere with one another, posing a variety of security risks. Prior industrial IoT blockchain data transmission methods suffer from lower security, higher management costs for trading centres, and significant supervision challenges. To deal with this issue, Theil-Sen Regressive Miyaguchi-Preneel-based Cryptographic Hash Blockchain approach is proposed in this manuscript for securing data transmission utilizing remote sensing data in IoT (TSR-MPCHB-SDT-RSD). To enhance data transfer security, TSR-MPCHB is proposed. Remote sensing data are gathered using IoT devices. Miyaguchi-Preneel cryptographic function generates every data confusing value. It aids to enhance data privacy with an integrity ratio. The simulation of the proposed approach is done in Java. The performance metrics, namely data privacy ratio, data dependability ratio, process time average delay, average power consumption, and blockchain data transfer efficacy, is examined. The proposed approach attains higher data confidentiality rate of 31.06%, 12.24%, 15.64%, and 11.66% compared to existing such as Blockchain-Envisioned Secure Data Delivery along Collection Mode for 5G-Base IoT-Enabled Internet of Drones Context (BESDDC-IOD-RSD), BIoTHR: Electronic Health Record Service System in IoT-Blockchain Ecosystem (BIoTHR-SDT-RSD), Blockchain- LamportMerkle Digital Signature: Authentication tool in IoT healthcare (LMDSG-SDT-RSD), and Privacy Protection Blockchain Attain Safe and Dependable Sharing of IoT Data (ACOMKSVM-SDT-RSD).

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution and influence mechanism of the carbon footprint of energy consumption at county level in the Yellow River Basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementing emission reduction policies at county level is important to realize high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin and achieve national "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality" goals. Based on remote-sensing data of night light, net primary productivity, and land use, the present study utilized the light-carbon conversion and carbon footprint measurement models to quantify the carbon footprint of energy consumption. An exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis method was implemented to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution path. Panel quantile regression and spatiotemporal transition-nested models were used to reveal the influence mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of the carbon footprint. The following results were obtained. (1) The carbon footprint of counties increased from 2001 to 2020. Counties with high-carbon footprint diffused around the "one center and two axes". Carbon-deficit counties exhibited a diffused trend towards the west. In 2020, 506 counties exhibited carbon deficits, and the carbon balance of the ecosystem was severely unbalanced. (2) The carbon footprint showed evident path dependence and Matthew effect. The high-carbon footprint lock-in area comprising 177 counties is a challenging zone for governance. The 86 counties that exhibit carbon footprint changes are the key zones to drive the carbon footprint changes in the Basin. The change direction of the county's carbon footprint type, with evident spatial correlation characteristics, is in accordance with adjacent counties. (3) The carbon footprint spatiotemporal transition types and influence mechanisms in counties exhibited significant differences, with the coexistence of low-carbon footprint driving, low-carbon footprint restriction, high-carbon footprint driving and high-carbon footprint restriction modes. As the influence mechanisms of different modes and the paths to achieve "dual carbon" goals are different, the governance of different modes should focus on optimizing and strengthening restriction factors or controlling and improving of driving factors.

TI  - Random Forest Modeling of Soil Properties in Saline Semi-Arid Areas
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of salinization/spreading of saline soils is becoming more urgent in many regions of the world, especially in context of climate change. The monitoring of salt-affected soils' properties is a necessary procedure in land management and irrigation planning and is aimed to obtain high crop harvest and reduce degradation processes. In this work, a machine learning method was applied for modeling of the spatial distribution of topsoil (0-20 cm) properties-in particular: soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, and salt content (dry residue). A random forest (RF) machine learning approach was used in combination with environmental variables to predict soil properties in a semi-arid area (Trans-Ural steppe zone). Soil, salinity, and texture maps; topography attributes; and remote sensing data (RSD) were used as predictors. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used to estimate the performance of the RF model. The cross-validation result showed that the RF model achieved an R-2 of 0.59 and an RMSE of 0.68 for SOM; 0.36 and 0.65, respectively, for soil pH; and 0.78 and 1.21, respectively for dry residue prediction. The SOC content ranged from 0.8 to 2.8%, with an average value of 1.9%; soil pH ranged from 5.9 to 8.4, with an average of 7.2; dry residue varied greatly from 0.04 to 16.8%, with an average value of 1.3%. A variable importance analysis indicated that remote sensing variables (salinity indices and NDVI) were dominant in the spatial prediction of soil parameters. The importance of RSD for evaluating saline soils and their properties is explained by their absorption characteristics/reflectivity in the visible and near-infrared spectra. Solonchak soils are distinguished by a salt crust on the land surface and, as a result, reduced SOC contents and vegetation biomass. However, the change in saline and non-saline soils over a short distance with mosaic structure of soil cover requires high-resolution RSD or aerial images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle/drones for successful digital mapping of soil parameters. The presented results provide an effective method to estimate soil properties in saline landscapes for further land management/reclamation planning of degraded soils in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Spectral discrimination of invasive<i> Lantana</i><i> camara</i> L. From co-occurring species
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lantana Camara L. (LC) invasive species has not been successfully mapped due to inadequate spectral information. This study aimed at assessing the performance of leaf-level in-situ hyperspectral data and derived indices in discriminating LC among co-occurring species during the dry and wet seasons. In addition, the performance of simulated Sentinel-2 bands, Sentinel-2 derived indices and machine learning algorithms in discriminating it was explored. Spectrally distinct features for species discrimination were selected using the guided regularized random forest (GRRF) and their separability quantified with Jeffries-Matusita distance method. We found that ratio-based and difference indices constructed with first and second-order derivative hyperspectral reflectance wavelengths perfectly separated LC from co-occurring species in the dry and wet seasons with >= 97% of separability accuracy. Similarly, a set of derived ratio-based and difference Sentinel-2 indices yielded > 95% and < 80% of LC separability accuracy in wet and dry seasons respectively. The SVM with radial basis function algorithm fitted with selected continuum removed derivative reflectance (band depth) narrow-bands yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 84% and a Kappa of 0.75 for the dry season while the same algorithm fitted with selected first derivative narrow-bands yielded an OA of 82% and Kappa of 0.66 for the wet season. Conversely, the regularized logistic regression yielded the highest performance (OA of 77% and Kappa of 0.62) when fitted with combined selected Sentinel-2 variables for the dry season while the gradient boosting machine (GBM) fitted with combined Sentinel-2 variables had the highest performance (OA of 75% and Kappa of 0.51) for the wet season. These findings have important implications on the upscaling of LC's derived leaf-level indices to canopylevel and subsequent LC classification with hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 imagery datasets over heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Estimating river bathymetry from multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River bathymetry is a key variable in estimating river discharge by remote sensing. However, traditional methods of mapping river bathymetry are expensive and time-consuming, which hinders the estimation of river discharge. In this study, we propose and test a method for estimating river bathymetry by combining remotely sensed observations of water level (z) and river width (w) with a nonlinear z-w relationship derived from a generalized channel cross-sectional shape. The results from five reaches of the upper Yangtze River show that the absolute relative error for the estimate is between 1.25% and 6.18%, indicating the ability of this method to provide accurate estimates. The channel exposure (e) is the main limitation of the proposed method, and the river ba-thymetry estimates improve significantly with increasing e. For the upper Yangtze River, averaging reaches over an appropriate length can reduce variability in river bathymetry estimate, especially when data are reach-averaged over a length of 10 km. Considering that a priori bathymetric information is not required and its computational process is relatively simple, the proposed method could open up the possibility of bathymetry modeling of global rivers.

TI  - Estimation of aerosol and cloud radiative effects on terrestrial net primary productivity over northeast Qinghai-Tibet plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Processes of plant growth are affected by solar radiation reaching the surface, which is regulated by atmospheric components such as aerosols and clouds. However, there are still large uncertainties in evaluating the impact of aerosol radiative effects (ARE) and cloud radiative effects (CRE) on ecosystems. This study estimated the ARE and CRE on vegetation productivity from 2001 to 2020 over the Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) based on MODIS satellite data coupled with the validated Radiative Transfer model (RTM) libRadtran and CASA (Car-negie-Ames-Stanford Approach)model. The results showed that both ARE and CRE have restrained vegetation growth in the last 20 years. The net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation attenuation by ARE was strongest in summer with an increase of temperature and humidity which caused enhanced air particle transformation and hygroscopic growth, followed by spring and autumn, which were extremely affected by dust, and NPP attenu-ation by ARE was weakest in winter, accounting for 5.2% of the annual NPP. CRE plays an attenuating role on NPP with increasing cloudiness. The ARE reduced NPP by 18.8 g C/m2/yr, and CRE reduced NPP by 406.9 g C/ m2/yr. NPP attenuation by CRE was more than ten times that of NPP attenuation by ARE, which indicated that the CRE has a much stronger weakening of NPP than ARE. The area where the trend of NPP at all-sky conditions increases/decreases had a good match with the areas where the trend of NPP by CRE increases/decreases with R2 being 0.89, indicating that CRE plays a dominant role in attenuating NPP. The increase in NPP is mainly attributed to the decrease in NPP attenuation by CRE over the past two decades. The study results could help to comprehensively understand the ARE and CRE on the terrestrial carbon cycle, and to further access and analyze vegetation ecosystem conditions.

TI  - Long-Term Change of Coastline Length along Selected Coastal Countries of Eurasia and African Continents
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of dynamic coastline change at fine spatial and temporal resolution is essential for enhancing sustainable coastal economic development and coastal environmental conservation. Port construction, land reclamation, urban development, and sediment deposition have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the coastlines along the 56 coastal countries in 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were delineated and classified into six categories using Landsat time-series images. Five relevant indices, i.e., the length, length ratio, length change rate, index of coastline utilization degree (ICUD), and fractal dimension (FD), were calculated to analyze and explore the spatiotemporal pattern of the coastlines. The results indicate that: (1) The overall length of the coastlines has increased from 3.45 x 10(5) km to 3.48 x 10(5) km in the past 30 years, with a net increase of nearly 3904 km. Between 1990 and 2020, the length of the artificial coastline increased by about 13,835 km (4.9 similar to 8.8%), while the length of the natural coastline decreased by 9932 km (95.1 similar to 91.2%). The increase in artificial coastline is concentrated in Southeast Asia and South Asia. (2) The coastline fractal dimensions (FDs) of countries and continents show that the average FD values of countries in South Asia (1.3 similar to 1.4) and Southeast Asia (1.2 similar to 1.3) were higher than other countries in the study regions, meaning that the coastlines in South Asia and Southeast Asia are more complex and curved. (3) The value of the ICUD index increased consistently between 1990 and 2015 (177.7 similar to 186.6) but decreased sharply between 2015 and 2020 (186.6 similar to 162.4), implying that the impact of human activities on the coastline continued to increase until 2015 and began to decrease after 2015. Our study examined the changes in various types of coastlines, which could be significant for sustainable development and environmental protection in coastal areas.

TI  - Forest Fire Mapping Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Chongqing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the most severe natural disasters facing global ecosystems, as they have a significant impact on ecological security and social development. As remote sensing technology has developed, burned areas can now be quickly extracted to support fire monitoring and post-disaster recovery. This study focused on monitoring forest fires that occurred in Chongqing, China, in August 2022. The burned area was identified using various satellite images, including Sentinel-2, Landsat8, Environmental Mitigation II A (HJ2A), and Gaofen-6 (GF-6). The burned area was extracted using visual interpretation, differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), and differenced Normalized Burnup Ratio (dNBR). The results showed that: (1) The results of the three monitoring methods were very consistent, with a coefficient of determination R-2 > 0.96. (2) A threshold method based on the dNBR-extracted burned area was used to analyze fire severity, with moderate-severity fires making up the majority (58.05%) of the fires. (3) Different topographic factors had some influence on the severity of the forest fires. High elevation, steep slopes and the northwestern aspect had the largest percentage of burned area.

TI  - Rural Atheists in the United States: A Critical Grounded Theory Investigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence and impact of antiatheist stigma appear to differ based on the geography and religiousness of the communities in which atheists live (Frazer et al., 2020; Frost et al., 2022). However, few studies have examined the potentially unique experiences of atheists living in parts of the United States (U.S.) designated as rural. Using a critical, grounded theory approach, the present study interviewed 18 rural-residing atheists about their experiences including antiatheist discrimination, outness, and their psychological well-being. Qualitative interviews resulted in five core categories of responses: (a) Harm to Atheists Living in Rural Communities; (b) Anti-Atheist Stigma Complicates Relationships in Rural Communities; (c) Hiding Atheism as a Primary Strategy for Safety in Rural Communities, (d) Personal Advantages that Promote Health and Safety, and (e) Atheism as a Part of a Healthy and Tolerant Worldview. Participants described a heightened danger to their physical safety, a preference for identity concealment, and barriers to access to health-promoting resources like non-religion-affirming health care and community, particularly in the rural Southern United States. However, conversely, participants also described the health benefits of their nonreligious worldview in the context of the challenges of living as an atheist in a rural community. Implications for future research and recommendations for clinical practice are provided.

TI  - Changing farming practices as integral to sustenance and cropland-use loss in the context of urban expansion: The case of Jimma City, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization can cause changes in farming practices, which in turn bring cropland-use loss. However, this issue is an under-researched topic. This study examines changing farming practices from cropland-use to woodland (Eucalyptus and clay brick production) using panel and cross-sectional data. Landsat imageries were used as longitudinal panel data to assess cropland-use changes from 2001 to 2021. A cross-sectional survey was designed to collect data from randomly selected 300 farmers in the peri-urban areas of Jimma City. A questionnaire was conducted with farmers to identify factors and reasons leading to changes in farming practices, while interviews and group discussions were organized with key informants to gather their experiences of changing farming practices. A two-way cross-matrix was used to estimate the cropland-use change from 2001 to 2021. A spatial regression model was used to determine significant factors of changing farming practices, while the qualitative data was described along with the model results. The results show that woodland increased by 44% from 2013 to 2021 due to changing farming practices from cropland-use to woodland. Cropland and pastureland were converted to built-up areas at 4.4% and 2.8% per year, respectively, while woodland has been converted at 1.5%, implying that it is more resistant to built-up area expansion. The spatial regression model reveals that access to markets, income, institutional barriers, farm size, and family size were the most significant determinants of changing farming practices. Farmers used Eucalyptus as a coping strategy to minimize pressure on natural forests, secure land for lifestyle purposes, and alleviate poverty in the face of rapid urbanization and cropland-use loss. The results of this study indicate that the government should enhance farmers' perceptions; educate them to adopt more environmentally friendly Eucalyptus tree species instead of discouraging Eucalyptus expansion on cropland and establish structures that facilitate farmers' access to inputs to improve cropland productivity.

AB  - Digital maps prepared by using geographic information systems are more diverse and common each day. Nevertheless, the lack of accessible files such as maps created in widely used but complex/expensive software is responsible for a limited number of users. With time, geographic visors have helped to overcome this 'inaccessibility' through more user-friendly platforms such as a free multi-temporal remote sensing data such as the Google Earth Engine. The updated GMSA was overlapped on this geospatial platform. As more people visualize maps, recent discoveries can be communicated with greater efficiency. Within the framework of the Vice-presidency for the GMSA and the Commission for the Geological Map of the World, the GMSA was launched in 2019 and, since 2021, has been available on Google Earth. This paper summarizes how the GMSA in Google Earth was implemented. It is expected this publication helps other map producers to create similar products.

TI  - DEFORESTATION DYNAMICS IN BIOSPHERE RESERVE OF MANGROVES: EVALUATION AND FUTURE SCENARIO
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mangroves provide various ecosystem services to society but are affected by deforestation, resource exploitation and land use. This study analyses the dynamics of deforestation of mangroves in Chocohuital, Chiapas, Mexico from 2000 to 2019 and provides a future scenario using Landsat imagery (5TM and 8 OLI) and the Markov Chain model. Results indicate a loss of 51 ha of mangroves from 2000 to 2019. The deforestation rates were-0.11% for mangroves,-0.37% for pastureland and-21.44% for the jungle, from 2000 to 2019. The transitions indicate gains in the surface of new settlements and more pastureland, while the losses were for mangroves, forests, and bodies of water. Future scenarios indicate 0.11 probability of transitioning from mangrove areas to agriculture and 0.5 to pastureland. Therefore, it is imperative to analyse alternative future scenarios of mangroves to optimize their conservation and development through proactive policy planning, especially in protected natural area.

TI  - Local environmental context drives heterogeneity of early succession dynamics in alpine glacier forefields
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier forefields have long provided ecologists with a model to study patterns of plant succession following glacier retreat. While plant-survey-based approaches applied along chronosequences provide invaluable information on plant communities, the "space-for-time" approach assumesenvironmental uniformity and equal ecological potential across sites and does not account for spatial variability in initial site conditions. Remotesensing provides a promising avenue for assessing plant colonization dynamics using a so-called "real-time" approach. Here, we combined 36 yearsof Landsat imagery with extensive field sampling along chronosequences of deglaciation for eight glacier forefields in the southwestern EuropeanAlps to investigate the heterogeneity of early plant succession dynamics. Based on the two complementary and independent approaches, we found strongvariability in the time lag between deglaciation and colonization by plants and in subsequent growth rates and in the composition of early plantsuccession. All three parameters were highly dependent on the local environmental context, i.e., neighboring vegetation cover and energyavailability linked to temperature and snowmelt gradients. Potential geomorphological disturbance did not emerge as a strong predictor of successionparameters, which is perhaps due to insufficient spatial resolution of predictor variables. Notably, the identity of pioneer plant species was highlyvariable, and initial plant community composition had a much stronger influence on plant assemblages than elapsed time since deglaciation. Overall,both approaches converged towards the conclusion that early plant succession is not stochastic as previous authors have suggested but ratherdetermined by local ecological context. We discuss the importance of scale in deciphering the complexity of plant succession in glacier forefieldsand provide recommendations for improving botanical field surveys and using Landsat time series in glacier forefield systems. Our work demonstratescomplementarity between remote sensing and field-based approaches for both understanding and predicting future patterns of plant succession inglacier forefields.

TI  - A remote-sensing-based dataset to characterize the ecosystem functioning and functional diversity in the Biosphere Reserve of the Sierra Nevada (southeastern Spain)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Conservation biology faces the challenge of safeguarding the ecosystem functions and ecological processes (the water cycle, nutrients, energy flow, and community dynamics) that sustain the multiple facets of biodiversity. Characterization and evaluation of these processes and functions can be carried out through functional attributes or traits related to the exchanges of matter and energy between vegetation and the atmosphere. Based on this principle, satellite imagery can provide integrative spatiotemporal characterizations of ecosystem functions at local to global scales. Here, we provide a multitemporal dataset at protected-area level that characterizes the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of ecosystem functioning in the Biosphere Reserve of the Sierra Nevada (Spain), captured through the spectral Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI, using product MOD13Q1.006 from the MODIS sensor) from 2001 to 2018. The database contains, at the annual scale, a synthetic map of Ecosystem Functional Type (EFT) classes from three Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs): (i) descriptors of annual primary production, (ii) seasonality, and (iii) phenology of carbon gains. It also includes two ecosystem functional-diversity indices derived from the above datasets: (i) EFT richness and (ii) EFT rarity. Finally, it provides interannual summaries for all previously mentioned variables, i.e., their long-term means and interannual variability. The datasets are available at two open-source sites (PANGAEA: ; Cazorla et al., 2020a; interannual summaries at http://obsnev.es/apps/efts_SN.html, last access: 17 April 2023). This dataset provides scientists, environmental managers, and the public in general with valuable information on the first characterization of ecosystem functional diversity based on primary production developed in the Sierra Nevada, a biodiversity hotspot in the Mediterranean basin and an exceptional natural laboratory for ecological research within the Long-Term Social-Ecological Research (LTER) network.

TI  - Individual Tree Species Identification Based on a Combination of Deep Learning and Traditional Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of individual tree species (ITS) is crucial to forest management. However, current ITS identification methods are mainly based on traditional image features or deep learning. Traditional image features are more interpretative, but the generalization and robustness of such methods are inferior. In contrast, deep learning based approaches are more generalizable, but the extracted features are not interpreted; moreover, the methods can hardly be applied to limited sample sets. In this study, to further improve ITS identification, typical spectral and texture image features were weighted to assist deep learning models for ITS identification. To validate the hybrid models, two experiments were conducted; one on the dense forests of the Huangshan Mountains, Anhui Province and one on the Gaofeng forest farm, Guangxi Province, China. The experimental results demonstrated that with the addition of image features, different deep learning ITS identification models, such as DenseNet, AlexNet, U-Net, and LeNet, with different limited sample sizes (480, 420, 360), were all enhanced in both study areas. For example, the accuracy of DenseNet model with a sample size of 480 were improved to 87.67% from 85.41% in Huangshan. This hybrid model can effectively improve ITS identification accuracy, especially for UAV aerial imagery or limited sample sets, providing the possibility to classify ITS accurately in sample-poor areas.

TI  - Characterizing aboveground biomass and tree cover of regrowing forests in Brazil using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Characterization of regrowing forests is vital for understanding forest dynamics to assess the impacts on carbon stocks and to support sustainable forest management. Although remote sensing is a key tool for understanding and monitoring forest dynamics, the use of exclusively remotely sensed data to explore the effects of different variables on regrowing forests across all biomes in Brazil has rarely been investigated. Here, we analyzed how environmental and human factors affect regrowing forests. Based on Brazil's secondary forest age map, 3060 locations disturbed between 1984 and 2018 were sampled, interpreted and analyzed in different biomes. We interpreted the time since disturbance for the sampled pixels in Google Earth Engine. Elevation, slope, climatic water deficit (CWD), the total Nitrogen of soil, cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements and fire frequency were analyzed in their importance for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree cover derived from global forest aboveground biomass map and tree cover map, respectively. Results show that time since disturbance interpreted from satellite time series is the most important predictor for characterizing AGB and tree cover of regrowing forests. AGB increased with increasing time since disturbance, surrounding tree cover, soil total N, slope, distance to roads, distance to settlements and decreased with larger fire frequency, CWD and CEC of soil. Tree cover increased with larger time since disturbance, soil total N, surrounding tree cover, distance to roads, distance to settlements, slope and decreased with increasing elevation and CWD. These results emphasize the importance of remotely sensing products as key opportunities to improve the characterization of forest regrowth and to reduce data gaps and uncertainties related to forest carbon sink estimation. Our results provide a better understanding of regional forest dynamics, toward developing and assessing effective forest-related restoration and climatic mitigation strategies.

TI  - Vehicle-Mounted Solar Occultation Flux Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and Its Remote Sensing Application
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the demand of rapid monitoring of pollution gas disorganized emissions in industrial parks, this paper studies the solar fast tracker system of vehicle-mounted SOF-FTIR (Solar Occultation Flux Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) system, where the spectrometer directly measures the broadband absorption spectrum of solar radiation light. A fast portable solar tracking system based on PSD (position sensitive detector) is designed, the mathematical model of solar spot position on the PSD surface source is established, and the optimal optical design parameters are simulated using the model. The dead-zone integral separation PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) control algorithm is used to track the trajectory of the solar, and the light spot position model is used to nonlinearly compensate the output of PID control so that the PID controller has the same control precision and response speed in different error areas. Experimental analysis of the solar tracking performance of the vehicle-mounted SOF-FTIR under static and dynamic conditions, as well as the spectral effects on the measurements under static vehicle, constant speed, and turning driving conditions. The remote sensing application experiment of vehicle-mounted SOF-FTIR pollution gas emission flux was carried out in a tire factory in Hefei City, Anhui Province. A vehicle-mounted SOF-FTIR system realized the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the pollution gas at the boundary of the tire plant and calculated the flux of each component pollution gas. The emission flux of pollution gas was highly consistent with the actual pollution distribution of the tire plant. The results show that the positioning accuracy of PSD in the vehicle tracking experiment can also meet SOF-FTIR requirements for solar tracking. The remote sensing system will be useful in the field of atmospheric environment monitoring, and the mobile monitoring of regional pollutant gases based on solar infrared spectroscopy has application value.

TI  - Advances in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - PurposeBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) represents a lifelong risk for breast cancer survivors and once acquired becomes a lifelong burden. This review summarizes current BCRL prevention and treatment strategies.FindingsRisk factors for BCRL have been extensively studied and their identification has affected breast cancer treatment practice, with sentinel lymph node removal now standard of care for patients with early stage breast cancer without sentinel lymph node metastases. Early surveillance and timely management aim to reduce BCRL incidence and progression, and are further facilitated by patient education, which many breast cancer survivors report not having adequately received. Surgical approaches to BCRL prevention include axillary reverse mapping, lymphatic microsurgical preventative healing (LYMPHA) and Simplified LYMPHA (SLYMPHA). Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) remains the standard of care for patients with BCRL. Among CDT components, facilitating manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) using indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography has been proposed. Intermittent pneumatic compression, nonpneumatic active compression devices, and low-level laser therapy appear promising in lymphedema management. Reconstructive microsurgical techniques such as lymphovenous anastomosis and vascular lymph node transfer are growing surgical considerations for patients as well as liposuction-based procedures for addressing fatty fibrosis formation from chronic lymphedema. Long-term self-management adherence remains problematic, and lack of diagnosis and measurement consensus precludes a comparison of outcomes. Currently, no pharmacological approaches have proven successful.ConclusionProgress in prevention and treatment of BCRL continues, requiring advances in early diagnosis, patient education, expert consensus and novel treatments designed for lymphatic rehabilitation following insults.

TI  - Drought-induced vulnerability and resilience of different land use types using time series of MODIS-based indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a creeping and complex phenomenon that significantly impacts terrestrial ecosystem services by reducing the ecosystem's performance and upsetting the balance of the terrestrial carbon cycle. This study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to quantify the effects of drought on the vulnerability and resilience of land use and land cover (LULC) types in the Karkheh basin, Iran's food basket and the third-largest basin in southwest Iran. Using MODIS data, we first extracted the vegetation health index (VHI) for drought monitoring during 2000-2020, and as a result, 2008 was designated as the drought year. Then, water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated for all LULC types during drought. In general, all LULC types experienced an increase in WUE, with the highest increase seen in the forest , which indicates the forest's high resistance to drought. To evaluate the ecosystems' resilience to drought, we computed the drought recovery period using the gross primary production (GPP). The results showed that recovery times varied among different LULC types, with the forest recovering in the shortest time, further indicating a higher resilience and greater importance for the absorption and stabilization of terrestrial carbon. Conversely, rainfed farming had the longest recovery time, indicating a higher vulnerability and, consequently, a greater need for the adoption of appropriate adaptive measures. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the response of different LULC types and their resilience to drought and can assist ecosystem conservation and LULC management.

TI  - Validation of Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor Sentinel-2 fraction of canopy cover, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index products over North American forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy biophysical variables such as the fraction of canopy cover (fCOVER), fraction of absorbed photosyn-thetically active radiation (fAPAR), and leaf area index (LAI) are widely used for ecosystem modelling and monitoring. The Sentinel-2 mission was designed for systematic global mapping of these variables at 20 m resolution using imagery from the MultiSpectral Instrument. The Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) is available as a baseline mapping solution. Previous validation over limited sites indicates that SL2P generally satisfies user requirements for all three variables over crops, but underestimates LAI over forests. In this study, Sentinel-2 fAPAR, fCOVER, and LAI products, from SL2P, were validated over 281 sites representative of most North American forest ecozones and also compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) products. In addition to meeting the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Stage 3 validation requirements for these areas, our study also explores the relationship between bias in SL2P products and canopy clumping and provides empirical bias correction functions for each variable.SL2P was implemented within the Landscape Evolution and Forecasting Toolbox in Google Earth Engine both for efficiency and due to bugs in the Sentinel Application Platform implementation. SL2P was found to under-estimate LAI by 20% to 50% over forests with LAI > 2; in agreement with other studies and with comparisons to MODIS and CGLS products. SL2P bias for fCOVER and fAPAR transitions from similar to 0.1 at low values to similar to -0.1 at high values. Precision error, at one standard deviation, was similar to 0.5 for LAI and slightly less than similar to 0.1 for fCOVER and fAPAR. Total uncertainty was dominated by bias for LAI and was slightly greater than precision error for fCOVER and fAPAR. Target user requirements were satisfied for 51% of LAI, 37% of fCOVER and 31% of fAPAR comparisons to in-situ measurements. For all variables, accuracy exhibited weak to moderate linear relationships to clumping (r2 <= 0.52), but scatter plots indicated larger negative LAI biases over northern latitude sites where canopies exhibited greater clumping. With the exception of evergreen broadleaf forests, empirical bias correction using in-situ data reduced accuracy error by 40% for fCOVER, 57% for fAPAR and, 92% for LAI and increased the agreement rate with uncertainty requirements by up to 8%. Users of SL2P LAI over forests are recommended to apply bias correction or consider recalibrating SL2P with spatially heterogenous radiative transfer model simulations.

TI  - Digital mapping of the soil available water capacity: tool for the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil available water capacity (AWC) is a key function for human survival and well-being. However, its direct measure-ment is laborious and spatial interpretation is complex. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques emerge as an alterna-tive to spatial modeling of soil properties. DSM techniques commonly apply machine learning (ML) models, with a high level of complexity. In this context, we aimed to perform a digital mapping of soil AWC and interpret the results of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and, in a case study, to show that digital AWC maps can support agricultural plan-ning in response to the local effects of climate change. To do so, we divided this research into two approaches: In the first approach, we showed a DSM using 1857 sample points in a southeastern region of Brazil with laboratory -determined soil attributes, together with a pedotransfer function (PTF), remote sensing and DSM techniques. In the second approach, the constructed AWC digital soil map and weather station data were used to calculate climatological soil water balances for the periods between 1917-1946 and 1991-2020. The result showed the selection of covariates using Shapley values as a criterion contributed to the parsimony of the model, obtaining goodness-of -fit metrics of R2 0.72, RMSE 16.72 mm m-1, CCC 0.83, and Bias of 0.53 over the validation set. The highest contributing covariates for soil AWC prediction were the Landsat multitemporal images with bare soil pixels, mean diurnal, and annual temper-ature range. Under the current climate conditions, soil available water content (AW) increased during the dry period (April to August). May had the highest increase in AW (similar to 17 mm m-1) and decrease in September (similar to 14 mm m-1). The used methodology provides support for AWC modeling at 30 m resolution, as well as insight into the adaptation of crop growth periods to the effects of climate change.

TI  - Assimilating Sentinel-3 All-Sky PWV Retrievals to Improve the WRF Forecasting Performance Over the South China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is a key driver for the evolution of weather system. To investigate the impact of assimilating Sentinel-3 precipitable water vapor (PWV) on weather forecasting, Sentinel-3 PWV retrievals over the South China with two different assimilation schemes are assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In the first assimilation scheme, only Sentinel-3 clear-sky PWV are assimilated, while Sentinel-3 all-sky PWV are assimilated for the second assimilation scheme. For both data assimilation schemes, we totally conduct 28 WRF data assimilation runs and forecasts for 28 selected days over two periods, that is, 14 days in March 2020 and 14 days in June 2020. The weather condition in June 2020 is much wetter than March 2020. Generally, assimilating Sentinel-3 PWV improves the WRF forecasting performance, particularly for June 2020. Assimilation of all-sky PWV outperforms assimilation of clear-sky PWV. The comparison results with radiosonde profiles show that assimilating Sentinel-3 PWV appreciably corrects the bias of WRF water vapor mixing ratio forecasting results for June 2020. The rainfall validation results show that both assimilation schemes show a positive impact in June 2020, but a neutral impact in March 2020. For June 2020, assimilating Sentinel-3 all-sky PWV improves rainfall forecast skill score by 2.4%, while the rainfall forecast score is improved by 1.0% after assimilating clear-sky PWV. Additionally, assimilation of Sentinel-3 PWV can modify the WRF moisture field, which further improves the rainfall spatial pattern.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest contributor to global carbon emissions (CEs), construction industry (CI) is regarded as one of the most significant sources in China. Previous studies on carbon emission (CE) of CI, however, are often limited to the quantitative level and provincial or local administrative unit scales, lacking relevant studies at the spatial raster resolution scale, due to data limits. Here, using the energy consumption, social economic data, and a series of remote sensing data from EU EDGAR, this study explored the spatial-temporal distribution and changing characteristics of CEs from CI in typical years of 2007, 2010, and 2012. This study found, from 2007 to 2010, then 2012, in addition to subtle differences, that the direct, indirect, and total CEs of CI all showed an increasing trend overall. In all provincial units except Tianjin and Guangdong, indirect CEs took up more than 50% of the total CEs, which can clearly indicate the "dominant low carbon, recessive high carbon" characteristics of CI. The direct, indirect, and total CEs of the CI in 2007, 2010, and 2012 all showed a positive spatial clustering. Specifically, hot spots were mainly distributed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta, and cold spots were mainly focused in the west and northeast of China, presenting a similar distribution pattern with population-economy characteristics. These findings can provide references for the policy formulation of regional differentiated emission reduction.

TI  - Exploiting High-Density Zonal-Sampling of HIRDLS Profiles Near 60°S to Investigate Missing Drag in Chemistry-Climate Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study exploits the high-density zonal sampling at the turnaround latitude of the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) in the Southern Hemisphere to investigate the missing drag in chemistry-climate models near 60 degrees S. Gravity wave (GW) properties including amplitude, zonal wavenumber, vertical wavelength, and momentum flux are estimated with a wave analysis method based on the S-transform. Monthly means of GW properties compare well with estimates from previous studies. We further investigate the contribution to GW momentum flux above orographic and nonorographic regions and find that while fluxes are much larger locally over orographic regions, the contribution to the zonal mean is roughly 3 times smaller than the contribution over nonorographic regions. We also investigate the relationship with the zonal wind and find that GW momentum flux is highly correlated with the near surface winds over orographic regions. In addition to momentum flux, we also provide estimates of the zonal drag and use these estimates to evaluate the current GW parameterizations and resolved wave forcing in models participating in phase 1 of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1). The HIRDLS zonal drag estimates suggest that the CCMI-1 models have insufficient zonal drag, especially in June, July, and August, and that the majority of the missing drag is over nonorographic regions. Our discussion includes implications for the Brewer-Dobson Circulation and ozone hole.

TI  - Spatial Distribution Analysis of Landslide Deformations and Land-Use Changes in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area by Using Interferometric and Polarimetric SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are geological events that frequently cause major disasters. Research on landslides is essential, but current studies mostly use historical landslide data and do not reflect dynamic, real-time research results. In this study, landslide deformations and land-use changes were used to analyze the landslide distribution in Fengjie County and Wushan County in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) by using interferometric and polarimetric SAR. In this study, the mean annual rate of landslide deformations was obtained using the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) for the ALOS-2 (2014-2019) data. Land-use changes were based on the 2007 and 2017 land-use results from dual-polarization ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 data, respectively. To address the problem of classification accuracy reduction caused by geometric distortion in mountainous areas, we first used texture maps and pseudocolor maps synthesized with dual-polarization intensity maps to perform classification with random forest (RF), and then we used coherence and slope maps to run the K-Means algorithm (KMA). We named this the secondary classification method. It is an improvement on the single classification method, exhibiting a 94% classification accuracy, especially in rugged areas. Combined with land-use changes, GIS spatial analysis was used to analyze the spatial distribution of landslides, and it was found that the landslide rate was significantly correlated with the type after change, with a correlation coefficient of 0.7. In addition, land-use types associated with human activities, such as cultivated vegetation, were more likely to cause landslide deformation, which can be used to guide local land-use planning.

TI  - Research Progress, Hotspots, and Evolution of Nighttime Light Pollution: Analysis Based on WOS Database and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the rapid development of the global economy, the over-expansion of outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities has led to increasingly severe light pollution worldwide. More and more studies have paid attention to the problem of light pollution, but there is still a lack of systematic literature review on nighttime light pollution in terms of research progress, hotspots, and its evolutions. For this purpose, this study firstly analyzed current research actuality and trends about nighttime light pollution via a comprehensive retrospect of pertinent literature and summarized the adverse effects and monitoring technologies of light pollution by VOSviewer-based keyword co-occurrence technique. Additionally, the study explored the variation tendency of nighttime light pollution in typical countries from 2013 to 2021 based on remote-sensing data and further proposed management suggestions to protect the nighttime environment. The results indicate that the research popularity of nighttime light pollution has been increasing recently, especially after the opening of diversified remote-sensing data in 2012; the main research topics are dominated by adverse effects and monitoring technologies, where the latter is represented by ground survey and remote-sensing observation; the total levels of ALAN intensity are relatively high in most developed countries, but the mean and per capita values are decreasing, and the above phenomenon in developing countries show the opposite trend. This study expects to integrate the literature analysis method and remote-sensing data to demonstrate the research status and variation trends of nighttime light pollution systematically so as to provide scientific references for the assessment and management of the nighttime light environment.

TI  - Thermal Discharge Temperature Retrieval and Monitoring of NPPs Based on SDGSAT-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval near nuclear power plants (NPPs) is one of the most significant indicators for evaluating marine ecological environment quality, monitoring the real-time situation of thermal discharge, and supporting planning decisions. However, complex computations, the inaccessible real-time vertical profile of the atmosphere, and the uncertainty of atmospheric profile data increase the error of SST retrieval. Additionally, influenced by their low spatial resolution, the widely used AVHRR/MODIS remote sensing images (RSIs) are unable to retrieve the detailed distribution of SST in small scale regions such as coastal NPPs. In this paper, we propose a simplified split-window-based temperature retrieval method (the SW method) suitable for SDGSAT-1 30 m thermal infrared spectrometer (TIS) RSIs. Specially, this method only needs atmospheric transmittance and surface emissivity by counteracting the average atmospheric temperature to monitor the thermal discharge of offshore NPPs. First, the geometric and radiometric calibrated thermal infrared and multi-spectral cloudless data of the target regions are selected to obtain the corresponding apparent radiance of the RSIs. Second, in accordance with the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands of multi-spectral RSIs, the surface emissivity is calculated to distinguish water from land. Next, we determine the atmospheric profile parameters from the weather conditions of the target region at the imaging time. Finally, according to the theory of surface-atmosphere radiative transfer, the SST of target regions is retrieved with the proposed SW method, and the results are compared with those of the conventional radiative transfer equation (RTE), mono-window (MW), and the nonlinear sea surface temperature (NLSST) algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the SST retrieved from the split-window algorithms (i.e., SW and NLSST) are generally higher than those of the single-channel algorithms (i.e., RTE and MW). The SST difference between the SW algorithm and the NLSST algorithm is within 0.5 degrees C. In addition, SDGSAT-1 can monitor the seasonal detailed variation of the thermal discharge near coastal NPPs. This article is the first to attempt to quantitative small-scale SST retrieval based on thermal infrared and multi-spectral images obtained from the SDGSAT-1 TIS and a multispectral imager (MII), and therefore, provide an effective reference for marine environment monitoring.

TI  - Topographic evolution of tidal flats based on remote sensing: an example in Jiangsu coast, Southern Yellow Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The topographic evolution of tidal flats is critical for local ecological conservation, coastal zone management, and physical oceanographic studies. However, obtaining this knowledge is often challenging due to the lack of frequently updated topographic data over large areas. With the explosion of remotely sensed data, the waterline method has become the most operational method for tidal flat topography acquisition. In this study, digital elevation models (DEMs) of the tidal flats around Tongzhou Bay on the Jiangsu coast were constructed using the waterline method for three periods (2013, 2015, and 2017) before and after the construction of phase I of the reclamation project. Furthermore, the topographic evolution characteristics were analyzed from four aspects: contours, area changes, erosion-deposition distribution, and typical cross-sections. The results showed that: 1) During the 5 years from 2013 to 2017, the overall tidal flat area (500 km(2)) of Tongzhou Bay on the Jiangsu coast had been in a state of deposition, with a total siltation thickness of 0.19 m. 2) The reclamation activities affected the topography of the tidal flats quickly, but the recovery was also rapid. During the implementation of the project (in 2015), the area of the tidal flats above the -2-m contour was rapidly reduced by 20 km(2) but rapidly recovered to the pre-project level after the completion of the project (in 2017). 3) The reclamation project directly affected the distribution of erosion and siltation. Outside the seawall on the east side of the Yaosha sand ridge, the 0-m contour expanded rapidly to the outer sea, reaching more than 250 m/year. 4) The sandbars in Tongzhou Bay on the Jiangsu coast generally had a southward-moving trend. Over the past 40 years, the Yaosha sand ridge had shifted southward by 2,500 m and the Lengjiasha sand ridge by more than 5,000 m. This study provides a remote sensing solution for the topographic evolution of large tidal flats under the influence of human reclamation activities.

TI  - Using a Vegetation Index as a Proxy for Reliability in Surface Reflectance Time Series Reconstruction (RTSR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of optical remote sensing data are instrumental for monitoring vegetation dynamics, but are hampered by missing or noisy observations due to varying atmospheric conditions. Reconstruction methods have been proposed, most of which focus on time series of a single vegetation index. Under the assumption that relatively high vegetation index values can be considered as trustworthy, a successful approach is to adjust the smoothed value to the upper envelope of the time series. However, this assumption does not hold for surface reflectance in general. Clouds and cloud shadows result in, respectively, high and low values in the visible and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A novel spectral Reflectance Time Series Reconstruction (RTSR) method is proposed. Smoothed values of surface reflectance values are adjusted to approach the trustworthy observations, using a vegetation index as a proxy for reliability. The Savitzky-Golay filter was used as the smoothing algorithm here, but different filters can be used as well. The RTSR was evaluated on 100 sites in Europe, with a focus on agriculture fields. Its potential was shown using different criteria, including smoothness and the ability to retain trustworthy observations in the original time series with RMSE values in the order of 0.01 to 0.03 in terms of surface reflectance.

TI  - Radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - GYNAKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is favored over adjuvant chemotherapy in many situations for patients with breast cancer. Treatment response is an important prognostic factor and is increasingly used for individualization of (post-neo)adjuvant treatment.Objective: This article aims to give an overview of current changes and controversies regarding adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with breast cancer who have received NACT.Materials and methods: A semi-structured literature review was performed.Results: Treatment response to NACT is not only associated with disease-free and overall survival, but also with the risk of locoregional recurrence. After breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant whole-breast radiotherapy is recommended, partial-breast irradiation should not be performed. Regarding regional nodal irradiation and post-mastectomy radiotherapy, first prospective data show that target volumes may be adapted according to nodal treatment response for patients with cT1-2 cN1 breast cancer. In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, radiotherapy should be performed based on clinical staging before NACT, regardless of treatment response.Conclusion: Adjuvant radiotherapy remains the standard of care for most patients after NACT. Both the clinical stage as well as the pathological stage after NACT should inform the clinical decision-making. For patients with pathological complete response, there is potential for de-escalation of radiotherapy target volumes; however, results from randomized controlled trials such as NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 are still pending and will not be available for several years.

TI  - Progress and Hotspots of Research on Land-Use Carbon Emissions: A Global Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Carbon emissions from land use change are the leading causes of the greenhouse effect. Exploration of the progress and hotspots of research on land-use carbon emissions (LUCE) is crucial for mitigating global climate warming. However, a comprehensive and systematic review of LUCE research from a global perspective is still lacking. We used the WoS Core Collection Database to analyze the current status of research on LUCE from a global perspective with the aid of a bibliometrix tool, aiming to reveal research hotspots and future development trends. We found that (1) the process of LUCE research has gone through a nascent exploration stage (1992-2001), a problem-focused stage (2002-2011), and a prosperous development stage (2012-2022) under different policy orientations. European and North American countries prioritize LUCE research more than others. (2) Overseas research hotspots mainly focus on the climate effects of land-use change, the impact of deforestation and fire on carbon stocks, the impact of soil organic carbon stocks on climate change and biodiversity, and agricultural carbon emissions. Research hotspots in China mainly focus on the study of the influencing factors of land-use carbon emissions, the path to achieving the dual carbon goal, and the transition to a low carbon economy. (3) Research frontiers show that China mainly researches low-carbon land use intensification in the context of a "dual carbon" strategy; carbon emission reduction based on energy transition; and the multi-dimensional, dynamic, and accurate tracking and monitoring of land-use carbon emission systems using remote sensing satellite data. Other countries have shifted from measuring historical land-use carbon emissions, deforestation, degradation and fire carbon emissions to biomass combustion and global warming mitigation research. This study enhances the depth and breadth of LUCE research, which can provide a theoretical foundation and scientific reference for subsequent research on LUCE.

TI  - Radiation, Lymph Node Dissection, or Both: Management of Lymph Node Micrometastases from Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundRegional lymph node micrometastases from Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) can be treated with completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and/or radiation therapy (RT). It is unclear how these options compare in terms of survival benefits for patients.Patients and MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from years 2012-2019 of the National Cancer Database. Patients with MCC and clinically negative, but pathologically positive, lymph node metastases who received RT to and/or CLND of the regional lymph node basin were included. Inverse probability weight balancing was performed using covariates followed by Cox proportional hazards modeling for survival analysis.ResultsA total of 962 patients were included [median (interquartile range) age, 74 (67-80) years, 662 (68.8%) male patients, 926 (96.3%) white patients]. The majority (63%, n = 606) had a CLND only, while 18% (n = 173) had RT only, and 19% (n = 183) had both CLND and RT. From 2016 to 2019, usage of RT only increased from 10% to 31.8%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that treatment modality was not associated with survival [RT versus CLND, hazard ratio (HR) 0.842, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.621-1.142, p = 0.269, RT+CLND versus CLND, HR 1.029, 95% CI 0.775-1.367, p = 0.844]. This persisted after balancing weights (RT versus CLND, HR 0.837, 95% CI 0.614-1.142, p = 0.262, RT+CLND versus CLND, HR 1.085, 95% CI 0.801-1.470, p = 0.599).ConclusionsThe usage of RT for nodal micrometastasis in MCC is increasing as compared with CLND. This strategy appears to be safe, with no significant difference in survival outcomes.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Soil Salinity in Weigan River-Kuqa River Delta Oasis Based on Two-Dimensional Feature Space
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a serious resource and ecological problem globally. The Weigan River-Kuqa River Delta Oasis is a key region in the arid and semi-arid regions of China with prominent soil salinization. The saline soils in the oasis are widely distributed over a large area, causing great harm to agricultural development and the environment. Remote sensing monitoring can provide a reference method for the management of regional salinization. We extracted the spectral indices and performed a correlation analysis using soil measurement data and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. Then, two-dimensional feature space inversion models for soil salinity were constructed based on the preferred spectral indices, namely, the canopy response salinity index (CRSI), composite spectral response index (COSRI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and green atmospherically resistant vegetation index (GARI). The soil salinity in a typical saline zone in the Weigan River-Kuqa River Delta Oasis was monitored and analyzed. We found that the inversion of the CRSI-COSRI model was optimal (R-2 of 0.669), followed by the CRSI-NDWI (0.656) and CRSI-GARI (0.604) models. Therefore, a model based on the CRSI-COSRI feature space can effectively extract the soil salinization information for the study area. This is of great significance to understanding the salinization situation in the Weigan River-Kuqa River Delta Oasis, enriching salinization remote sensing monitoring methods, and solving the soil salinization problem in China.

TI  - A Landsat-based atlas of monthly burned area for Portugal, 1984-2021
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Portugal is the most fire-prone country in Southern Europe. Time series of satellite imagery have great potential to improve fire mapping and explore the spatiotemporal trends of burned areas. Thus, the objectives of this work were to disaggregate the Portuguese Annual Fire Atlas burned area patches into individual events according to their date of occurrence estimated from Landsat temporal series, and to assign them the closest date (day and month) of the detected change. From the resulting Monthly Fire Atlas, we assessed intra-annual fire variability in Portugal. Our analysis was performed from 1984 to 2021 for the entire mainland Portugal. We selected the closest fire date based on the index of the lowest Delta NBR in the time series. Historically, most of the large fires were concentrated in the summer season. However, when daily mean areas are analyzed, peaks can be identified due to fire events that occurred at a time of the year when burned areas are typically much lower. The results were validated using MODIS and VIIRS active fires. Accuracies of individual years fluctuated according to the satellite and cloudiness of each year. For the entire 37 analyzed years, when considering 16 and 32 days of time gap, the Monthly Fire Atlas achieved 84% and 91% of accuracy, respectively.

TI  - Use of indocyanine green near-infrared lymphography to detect sentinel lymph nodes in a dog with a malignant insulinoma: a case report
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant insulinoma is the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor found in the pancreas of dogs. Canine insulinoma displays malignant behavior with a high rate of metastasis. The most common sites of metastases are the draining lymph nodes, which are also the primary location sites for the recurrence of functional disease. However, identifying metastatic nodes can often be complicated, as the pancreas is drained by numerous lymphatic centers, and clinical enlargement or structural changes may not always be present in metastatic nodes. Additionally, unaltered nodes are frequently small (a few millimeters) and can be hard to distinguish from the surrounding tissues. Therefore, lymphadenectomy is generally recommended for affected dogs. Unlike in human medicine, there are currently no established strategies for lymph node resection in dogs with malignant insulinoma. This report presents a technique for identifying and removing sentinel nodes using indocyanine green and near-infrared lymphography (NIRFL) during surgery. A total of six sentinel nodes were detected and resected with this method. This technique could provide a more structured approach for lymph node resection in affected dogs and potentially in humans in the future. However, its therapeutic benefits must be evaluated in a larger cohort of cases.

TI  - Understanding the Spatial-Temporal Patterns of Floating Islands Impacting the Major Dams of the White Nile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floating islands in Lake Victoria, the world's second-largest fresh water lake, disrupt transportation, fisheries, irrigation, and water quality. Despite their impact, the dynamics of these islands remain unexplored. This study investigates island dynamics within the Nalubaale, Kiira, and Bujagali dams in Uganda, exploring the causes of their formation and the subsequent impact on hydropower production. The study collects data of Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020, CHIRPS precipitation, and Lake Victoria's water level datasets from 2004, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2020. The results reveal a strong correlation between precipitation, fluctuating water levels, and floating island formation, with nutrient-rich runoff from municipal waste and agriculture promoting island growth. In addition, rising water levels lead to the dislodging of rocks and soil, contributing to floating island formation, which may manifest with a lag time of up to one month. The analysis shows higher correlations between precipitation, water levels, and floating islands during the long (March-May) and short (September-November) rainy seasons as opposed to drier periods (June-August, December-February). The findings indicate that southeast monsoon winds, which transport floating vegetation, also are essential in influencing island dynamics. Consequently, the major drivers of floating islands in Lake Victoria are identified as precipitation, water level fluctuations and wind variations. Finally, a negative correlation between floating island eutrophication and power production at Kiira and Nalubaale stations suggests that the increased eutrophication caused by the presence of floating islands leads to reduced power output at both Kiira and Nalubaale power stations.

TI  - The relationship between spectral and plant diversity: Disentangling the influence of metrics and habitat types at the landscape scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for ecosystem conservation, but ground data collection is limited by cost, time, and scale. Remote sensing is a convenient approach providing frequent, near-real-time information with fine resolution over wide areas. According to the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), spectral diversity (SD) is an effective proxy of environmental heterogeneity, which ultimately relates to plant diversity. So far, studies testing the relationship between SD and biodiversity have reported contradictory findings, calling for a thorough investigation of the key factors (i.e., metrics applied, habitat type, scale, and temporal effects) and conditions under which such a relationship exists. This study investigates the applicability of the SVH for monitoring plant diversity at the landscape scale by comparing the performance of three types of SD metrics. Species richness and functional diversity were calculated for >2000 grid cells of 5 ' x 3 ' covering the Czech Republic. Within each cell, we quantified SD using a Landsat-8 "greenest pixel" composite by applying (i) the standard deviation of NDVI, (ii) Rao's Q entropy index and (iii) the richness of "spectral communities". Habitat type (i.e., land cover) was included in the models of the relationship between SD and ground biodiversity. Both species richness and functional diversity showed positive and significant relationships with each SD metric tested. However, SD alone accounted for a small fraction of the deviance explained by the models. Furthermore, the strength of the relationship depended significantly on habitat type and was highest in natural areas with transitional bushy and herbaceous vegetation. Our results underline that despite the stability of the significance of the relationship between SD and plant diversity at this scale, the applicability of SD for biodiversity monitoring is contextdependent and the factors mediating such a relationship must be carefully considered to avoid misleading conclusions.

TI  - Investigating the Use of Sentinel-1 for Improved Mapping of Small Peatland Water Bodies: Towards Wildfire Susceptibility Monitoring in Canada's Boreal Forest
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands provide vital ecosystem and carbon services, and Canada is home to a significant peatland carbon stock. Global climate warming trends are expected to lead to increased carbon release from peatlands, as a consequence of drought and wildfire. Monitoring hydrologic regimes is a key in understanding the impacts of warming, including monitoring changes in small and temporally variable water bodies in peatlands. Global surface water mapping has been implemented, but the spatial and temporal scales of the resulting data products prevent the effective monitoring of peatland water bodies, which are small and prone to rapid hydrologic changes. One hurdle in the quest to improve remote-sensing-derived global surface water map quality is the omission of small and temporally variable water bodies. This research investigated the reasons for small peatland water body omission as a preparatory step for surface water mapping, using Sentinel-1 SAR data and image classification methods. It was found that Sentinel-1 backscatter signatures for small peatland water bodies differ from large water bodies, due in part to differing physical characteristics such as waves and emergent vegetation, and limitations in detectable feature sizes as a result of SAR image processing and resolution. The characterization of small peatland water body backscatter provides a theoretical basis for the development of SAR-based surface water mapping methods with high accuracy for our purposes of wildfire susceptibility monitoring in peatlands. This study discusses the implications of small peatland water body omission from surface water maps on carbon, climate, and hydrologic models.

TI  - Topological Generality and Spectral Dimensionality in the Earth Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) Using Joint Characterization and the Spectral Mixture Residual
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission seeks to use spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral imaging) to map the mineralogy of arid dust source regions. Here we apply recent developments in Joint Characterization (JC) and the spectral Mixture Residual (MR) to explore the information content of data from this novel mission. Specifically, for a mosaic of 20 spectrally diverse scenes, we find: (1) a generalized three-endmember (Substrate, Vegetation, Dark; SVD) spectral mixture model is capable of capturing the preponderance (99% in three dimensions) of spectral variance with low misfit (99% pixels with <3.7% RMSE); (2) manifold learning (UMAP) is capable of identifying spatially coherent, physically interpretable clustering relationships in the spectral feature space; (3) UMAP yields results that are at least as informative when applied to the MR as when applied to raw reflectance; (4) SVD fraction information usefully contextualizes UMAP clustering relationships, and vice-versa (JC); and (5) when EMIT data are convolved to spectral response functions of multispectral instruments (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/9, Planet SuperDove), SVD fractions correlate strongly across sensors, but UMAP clustering relationships for the EMIT hyperspectral feature space are far more informative than for simulated multispectral sensors. Implications are discussed for both the utility of EMIT data in the near-term and for the potential of high signal-to-noise (SNR) spaceborne imaging spectroscopy more generally, to transform the future of optical remote sensing in the years and decades to come.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat) is an open source package that implements a general data analysis workflow for arbitrary data sets, providing a consistent manner for obtaining, managing, analysing, and processing data, including modelled and observational ground and space-based data sets for the space sciences. Pysat enables systematic and individual treatment of data as well as simplifies rigorous data access and use, allowing larger-scale scientific efforts including machine learning, data assimilation, and constellation instrumentation processing. Since the start of its development pysat has evolved into an ecosystem, separating general file and data handling functionality from both individual data set support and generalized data analysis. This design choice ensures that the core pysat package has only the necessary functionality required to provide data management services for the wider development community. The shift of data and analysis support to ecosystem packages makes it easier for the community to contribute to, as well as use, the full array of features and data sources enabled by pysat. Pysat's ease of use, and generality, supports adoption outside of professional science to include industry, citizen science, and education.

TI  - Environment monitoring of mining area with comprehensive mining ecological index (CMEI): a case study in Xilinhot of Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and evaluation of environmental and ecological status in mining area is critical for effective mineral management guidance, and remote sensing is a cost-effective solution for covering a wide spatial area with high temporal frequency. However, the diverse landscape in mining areas presents a challenge for finding a suitable monitoring method. To address this challenge, this study proposes a remote sensing-based comprehensive mining ecological index (CMEI), which integrates vegetation greenness, soil wetness, urban heat, air quality and water quality indicators obtained from Landsat images and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The integration is achieved through a principal component analysis (PCA) to encapsulate various aspects of the environment in opencast mining areas. The proposed CMEI was then applied to assess the performance of an ecological restoration project carried out in the Xilinhot coalfield in Inner Mongolia, China, over the past two decades. Our findings show that the overall ecological environment in the dumping sites and backfilling sites of Xilinhot coalfield has improved from a score of 0.15 in 2005 to 0.33 in 2020, according to the CMEI. Nevertheless, our study also highlights that some newly established dumping sites require further strengthening of management and maintenance measures. The CMEI presents a novel and effective approach for monitoring and evaluating the ecological environment in mining areas, and it can potentially be applied to assess the ecological environment of opencast mining areas globally.

TI  - Deep Learning Models for the Classification of Crops in Aerial Imagery: A Review
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, the use of remote sensing data obtained from satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery has grown in popularity for crop classification tasks such as yield prediction, soil classification or crop mapping. The ready availability of information, with improved temporal, radiometric, and spatial resolution, has resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of data. Meeting the demands of analysing this data requires innovative solutions, and artificial intelligence techniques offer the necessary support. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for crop classification using remote sensing data from aerial imagery. The reviewed papers focus on a variety of deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks, transformers, and hybrid CNN-recurrent neural network models, and incorporate techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and multimodal fusion to improve model performance. The review analyses the use of these techniques to boost crop classification accuracy by developing new deep learning architectures or by combining various types of remote sensing data. Additionally, it assesses the impact of factors like spatial and spectral resolution, image annotation, and sample quality on crop classification. Ensembling models or integrating multiple data sources tends to enhance the classification accuracy of deep learning models. Satellite imagery is the most commonly used data source due to its accessibility and typically free availability. The study highlights the requirement for large amounts of training data and the incorporation of non-crop classes to enhance accuracy and provide valuable insights into the current state of deep learning models and datasets for crop classification tasks.

TI  - Polarimetric L-Band ALOS2-PALSAR2 for Discontinuous Permafrost Mapping in Peatland Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, it has been shown that the long penetrating polarimetric L-band ALOS is very promising for boreal and subarctic peatland mapping and monitoring. The unique information provided by the Touzi decomposition, and the dominant-scattering-type phase in particular, on peatland subsurface water flow permits an enhanced discrimination of bogs from fens, two peatland classes that can hardly be discriminated using conventional optical remote sensing sensors and C-band polarimetric SAR. In this study, the dominant and medium-scattering phases generated by the Touzi decomposition are investigated for discontinuous permafrost mapping in peatland regions. Polarimetric ALOS2, LiDAR, and field data were collected in the middle of August 2014, at the maximum permafrost thaw conditions, over discontinuous permafrost distributed within wooded palsa bogs and peat plateaus near the Namur Lake (Northern Alberta). The ALOS2 image, which was miscellaneously calibrated with antenna cross talk (-33 dB) much higher than the actual ones, was recalibrated. This led to a reduction of the residual calibration error (down to -43 dB) and permitted a significant improvement of the dominant and medium-scattering-type phase (20 degrees to -30 degrees) over peatlands underlain by discontinuous permafrost. The Touzi decomposition, Cloude-Pottier a-H incoherent target scattering decomposition, and the HH-VV phase difference were investigated, in addition to the conventional multipolarization (HH, HV, and VV) channels, for discontinuous permafrost mapping using the recalibrated ALOS2 image. A LiDAR-based permafrost classification developed by the Alberta Geological Survey (AGS) was used in conjunction with the field data collected during the ALOS2 image acquisition for the validation of the results. It is shown that the dominant- and scattering-type phases are the only polarimetric parameters which can detect peatland subsurface discontinuous permafrost. The medium-scattering-type phase, f(s2), performs better than the dominant-scattering-type phase, f(s1), and permits a better detection of subsurface discontinuous permafrost in peatland regions. f(s2) also allows for a better discrimination of areas underlain by permafrost from the nonpermafrost areas. The medium Huynen maximum polarization return (m(2)) and the minimum degree of polarization (DoP), pmin, can be used to remove the scattering-type phase ambiguities that might occur in areas with deep permafrost (more than 50 cm in depth). The excellent performance of polarimetric PALSAR2 in term of NESZ (-37 dB) permits the demonstration of the very promising L-band long-penetration SAR capabilities for enhanced detection and mapping of relatively deep (up to 50 cm) discontinuous permafrost in peatland regions.

TI  - A practical method for angular normalization of global MODIS land surface temperature over vegetated surfaces
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential physical quantity in surface energy balance and a good indicator of exchange of heat and water between the land and atmosphere at regional and global scales. However, the thermal-infrared remotely sensed LST from large swath-width polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite sensors is usually subject to the angular anisotropy, bringing great uncertainties in the application of LST products in many fields such as evapotranspiration estimation, urban thermal environment monitoring, and climate change study. In this study, a practical angular normalization method was developed for the first time for correcting global MODIS off-nadir LST to nadir over vegetated surfaces, using MODIS (Terra + Aqua) products from 2000 to 2020, simultaneous and collocated observations at 213 sites worldwide from the AmeriFlux, FLUXNET, and National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (TPDC), and ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets. Results showed that the angular normalization method could well correct the angular anisotropy of MODIS LST products. Validated against datasets at 213 sites, the angular normalization model showed root mean square errors (RMSE) of 1.57 K, mean bias errors (MBE) of 0 K, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.99. In the cross-validation of nadir LST by correcting global MODIS/Terra off-nadir LST products against Sentinel-3A nadir LST products over four typical days in 2020 (February 26, June 1, August 12 and November 16), the angular normalization model presented the RMSE of 2.26 K and the MBE of -1.20 K, in contrast to the RMSE of 3.01 K and the MBE of -2.15 K when MODIS off-nadir LST was compared to the Sentinel-3A nadir LST. The angular anisotropy of global MODIS/ Terra LST over vegetated surfaces for the four days of interest ranged between -1.79 to -1.30 K (1% quantile) and 3.64 to 4.37 K (99% quantile), with a median of 0.33 to 0.74 K, and a mean of 0.46 to 0.89 K. The developed angular normalization model is a promising approach to operationally correcting all time-series of global MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua LST products with high accuracies, which is significant to provide a benchmark of angle-consistent MODIS LST product for its further application.

TI  - A Deep-Learning-Facilitated, Detection-First Strategy for Operationally Monitoring Localized Deformation with Large-Scale InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR interferometry (InSAR) has emerged in the big-data era, particularly benefitting from the acquisition capability and open-data policy of ESA's Sentinel-1 SAR mission. A large number of Sentinel-1 SAR images have been acquired and archived, allowing for the generation of thousands of interferograms, covering millions of square kilometers. In such a large-scale interferometry scenario, many applications actually aim at monitoring localized deformation sparsely distributed in the interferogram. Thus, it is not effective to apply the time-series InSAR analysis to the whole image and identify the deformed targets from the derived velocity map. Here, we present a strategy facilitated by the deep learning networks to firstly detect the localized deformation and then carry out the time-series analysis on small interferogram patches with deformation signals. Specifically, we report following-up studies of our proposed deep learning networks for masking decorrelation areas, detecting local deformation, and unwrapping high-gradient phases. In the applications of mining-induced subsidence monitoring and slow-moving landslide detection, the presented strategy not only reduces the computation time, but also avoids the influence of large-scale tropospheric delays and unwrapping errors. The presented detection-first strategy introduces deep learning to the time-series InSAR processing chain and makes the mission of operationally monitoring localized deformation feasible and efficient for the large-scale InSAR.

TI  - Drought in Shanxi Province Based on Remote Sensing Drought Index Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variation Characteristics
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a natural disaster with long duration and which causes great harm. Studying the characteristics of drought evolution in Shanxi Province can grasp the regularity of drought occurrence and provide a basis for drought prevention and resistance. This study utilizes MODIS products to analyze and quantify the extent of drought in a specific area. The study calculates several indices, including the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI), and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), using variables such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Evapotranspiration (ET), and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET). Additionally, three drought indices are analyzed for correlation with the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI), and the most suitable drought index is selected through validation with typical drought events. Finally, the selected indices are used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in the study area from 2001 to 2020. The results show: (1) CWSI and sc-PDSI have a strong correlation both in terms of time and spatial analysis. Furthermore, CWSI has been shown to be more effective in monitoring significant drought events. (2) The multi-year mean values of CWSI range from 0.71 to 0.85, with a significant degree of spatial heterogeneity. In the study area, the percentage of the area affected by different levels of drought is in the following order: moderate drought > severe drought > mild drought > no drought. (3) The trend of CWSI changes shows that the drought situation in Shanxi Province has been alleviated from 2001 to 2020, and the overall spatial distribution indicates that the degree of drought alleviation in the southern region is greater than that in the northern region. The turning point from drought to wetness in the study area was in 2011, showing the overall characteristic of "dry in the north and wet in the south".

TI  - Estimation of Pb and Cd Content in Soil Using Sentinel-2A Multispectral Images Based on Ensemble Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing economic growth in developing nations, soil heavy metal pollution has become a growing concern. Monitoring the heavy metal concentration in soil through remote sensing is crucial for safeguarding the ecological environment. However, the current indoor spectral measurement method has limitations, such as the discrete soil sampling space and weak spectral characteristics of soil heavy metals, leading to a poor robustness of remote sensing inversion models. This study presents a novel approach to address these challenges by incorporating a spatial feature of pollution sources and sinks to evaluate the spatial factors affecting pollutant diffusion and concentration. An integrated learning model, combining spatial and spectral information, is developed to estimate heavy metal content in soil using Sentinel-2A satellite data. A total of 235 soil samples were collected in Jiyuan, China, and the effective spectral transformation characteristics of Sentinel-2A data were screened. The impact of spectral characteristics, topographic characteristics, and spatial characteristics on retrieving soil heavy metal lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) content were analyzed. The optimal inversion method was determined through various integrated learning models, and the spatial distribution of heavy metals Pb and Cd was mapped. The results indicate that the accuracy of the inversion model was significantly improved by incorporating terrain features and spatial features of pollution sources. The Blending integrated learning method showed a 65.9% and 73.2% reduction in the RMSE of Pb and Cd, respectively, compared to other regression models. With R-2 values of 0.9486 and 0.9489 for Pb and Cd, respectively, and a MAPE less than 0.2, the Blending model demonstrated high prediction accuracy.

TI  - Environmental condition, cultural worldview, and environmental perceptions in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding public debates on environmental problems is critical for enhancing the effectiveness and social acceptance of environmental policies. This article aims to understand how factual environmental condition and culture influence the perceived severity of environmental problems in China. Relying on Cultural Theory and Cultural Cognitive Theory, we measure grid with an egalitarianism-hierarchy scale and group with an individualism-communitarianism scale. We use a large scale nationwide representative survey data--the Chinese General Social Survey--to identify Chinese political subcultures and find that environmental condition alone rarely play a role in Chinese environmental perceptions, and that as hypothesized, moving from egalitarianism to hierarchy, people perceive six of eight environmental problems to be less severe, whereas moving from individualism to communitarianism, people perceive five of eight environmental problems to be more severe. Meanwhile, the effect of environmental condition on the relationship between cultural worldview and perceived severity is very limited. This study has implications for environmental communication.

TI  - Permafrost Stability Mapping on the Tibetan Plateau by Integrating Time-Series InSAR and the Random Forest Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground deformation rate is an important index for evaluating the stability and degradation of permafrost. Due to limited accessibility, in-situ measurement of the ground deformation of permafrost areas on the Tibetan Plateau is a challenge. Thus, the technique of time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is often adopted for measuring the ground deformation rate of the permafrost area, the effectiveness of which is, however, degraded in areas with geometric distortions in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this study, a method that integrates InSAR and the random forest method is proposed for an improved permafrost stability mapping on the Tibetan Plateau; to demonstrate the application of the proposed method, the permafrost stability mapping in a small area located in the central region of the Tibetan Plateau is studied. First, the ground deformation rate in the concerned area is studied with InSAR, in which 67 Sentinel-1 scenes taken in the period from 2014 to 2020 are collected and analyzed. Second, the relationship between the environmental factors (i.e., topography, land cover, land surface temperature, and distance to road) and the permafrost stability is mapped with the random forest method based on the high-quality data extracted from the initial InSAR analysis. Third, the permafrost stability in the whole study area is mapped with the trained random forest model, and the issue of data scarcity in areas where the terrain visibility of SAR images is poor or InSAR results are not available in permafrost stability mapping can be overcome. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the integration of the InSAR and the random forest method yields a more effective permafrost stability mapping compared with the sole application of InSAR analysis.

TI  - Exploration of symptom clusters during hemodialysis and symptom network analysis of older maintenance hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC NEPHROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Symptom networks can provide empirical evidence for the development of personalized and precise symptom management strategies. However, few studies have established networks of symptoms experienced by older patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Our goal was to examine the type of symptom clusters of older maintenance hemodialysis patients during dialysis and construct a symptom network to understand the symptom characteristics of this population.Methods The modified Dialysis Symptom Index was used for a cross-sectional survey. Network analysis was used to analyze the symptom network and node characteristics, and factor analysis was used to examine symptom clusters.Results A total of 167 participants were included in this study. The participants included 111 men and 56 women with a mean age of 70.05 +/- 7.40. The symptom burdens with the highest scores were dry skin, dry mouth, itching, and trouble staying asleep. Five symptom clusters were obtained from exploratory factor analysis, of which the clusters with the most severe symptom burdens were the gastrointestinal discomfort symptom cluster, sleep disorder symptom cluster, skin discomfort symptom cluster, and mood symptom cluster. Based on centrality markers, it could be seen that feeling nervous and trouble staying asleep had the highest strength, and feeling nervous and feeling irritable had the highest closeness and betweenness.Conclusions Hemodialysis patients have a severe symptom burden and multiple symptom clusters. Dry skin, itching, and dry mouth are sentinel symptoms in the network model; feeling nervous and trouble staying asleep are core symptoms of patients; feeling nervous and feeling irritable are bridge symptoms in this symptom network model. Clinical staff can formulate precise and efficient symptom management protocols for patients by using the synergistic effects of symptoms in the symptom clusters based on sentinel symptoms, core symptoms, and bridge symptoms.

TI  - BYO Bees: Managing wild bee biodiversity in urban greenspaces.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - As cities become more populated and the density of urban development increases, local biodiversity is threatened. Urban greenspaces have the capacity to preserve pollinator biodiversity, but the quality of support they provide depends on greenspace landscape attributes, including the availability of pollinator habitat and foraging resources. Wild native bees provide important pollination services to urban ecosystems, yet relatively little is known about how urban landscape management influences pollinator community composition and diversity. Our study explores how wild bee communities are affected by greenspace and landscape-level features like pollinator management practices, in urban greenspaces in and around Appleton Wisconsin: a mid-sized urban community spanning more than 100 sq. km. We sampled and identified native bees periodically between late-May 2017 and mid-September of 2018 using standardized arrays of pan traps at 15 sites around the city. We classified greenspaces based on their level of development (urban or suburban) and whether they were managed or unmanaged for increasing wild pollinator diversity. We quantified floral species diversity, floral color diversity, tree species diversity, and proximity of sites to open water for each site and used remotely sensed satellite data from both the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). All variables were tested as potential correlates of wild bee abundance and species richness. Active pollinator management sites supported higher levels of bee abundance and richness. Notably, active greenspace management (e.g. planting native wildflowers) was a stronger correlate of bee abundance and richness than greenspace size and other landscape-level attributes. Within-greenspace attributes such as floral diversity, tree diversity, and proximity to open water contributed positively to both bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, we suggest that urban greenspaces may be managed more efficiently and cost-effectively by focusing resources on active management by planting wildflowers, removing invasive species, creating nesting habitat, and providing water resources, rather than simply expanding in area.

TI  - Urbanization effects on the groundwater potential recharge of the aquifers in the Southern part of the Basin of Mexico
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Collection, processing, and analysis of GIS and satellite data were performed in this work to estimate temporal groundwater recharge changes, which are needed as input in numerical groundwater -flow models. Layers of geological alignments, land use, drainage network, lithology, topography, and precipitation were collected. This information was spatialized, and then layer importance was calculated using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on infiltration capacity to define potential recharge (PR) regions. A water budget equation was used to calculate PR volumes. The analysis was done every 5 years from 1970 to 2019, considering average urban area changes. For all study periods, an increase in urban area was calculated from 16 to 28% of the total study area, while potential recharge decreased from 23 to 19% of the mean precipitation values for each 5-year period. The most significant urban expansion was from 1980 to 1994 and 2010 to 2019, which match periods of potential recharge decrease. However, a slight increase in PR from 2000 to 2009, unrelated to urban area change, may be due to temperature variations. The results account for the spatial and temporal dynamics of the recharge in the study area and can be used as input data to calibrate the actual recharge in a groundwater numerical model.

TI  - Comparative performance of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data in canopy cover prediction using Random Forest model: Comparing model performance and tuning parameters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying canopy cover using Random Forest (RF) model's appropriate tuning parameters value and sensor based predictor variables is always challenging, especially in fragmented dry deciduous forests. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the performances of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 based models using the RF model for predicting canopy cover with assessing variables' relative importance and correlation. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 based bands and spectral indices were used as predictor variables. We compared different mtry, ntree and bag fraction values of the RF model. R-square (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used for comparing the model performance. The results showed that the lowest RMSE value was associated with the default value (predictors/3) or more than the default value of mtry, with bag fraction 0.3-0.7 for Sentinel-2 and 0.3-0.4 for Landsat-8. Model accuracy has increased and stabilized with increase of ntree, and received the lowest RMSE to ntree of more than 1000. Except for SWIR indices based model of Landsat-8, all other Landsat-8 based model's accuracy was lesser compared to Sentinel-2 based models. Model accuracy of Sentinel-2 based full model (except red edge indices) was marginally better (R-2 = 0.899, RMSE = 6.883 %) than Landsat-8 based full model (R-2 = 0.886, RMSE = 7.089 %). But with the incorporation of red edge indices, full model RMSE had decreased further from 6.883 % to 6.747 %, and R-2 had increased from 0.899 to 0.918. The full model of Sentinel-2 tended to spread variable importance among more variables, but the full model of Landsat-8 slightly tends to concentrate variable importance with fewer variables. However, SWIR bands and indices were the most important predictor variables and highly correlated with canopy cover. These findings can solve the parameter value choice of RF model, and the use of the Sentinel-2 based model will be superior to Landsat-8 based model. (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Simultaneous multi-crop land suitability prediction from remote sensing data using semi-supervised learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land suitability models for Canada are currently based on single-crop inventories and expert opinion. We present a data-driven multi-layer perceptron that simultaneously predicts the land suitability of several crops in Canada, including barley, peas, spring wheat, canola, oats, and soy. Available crop yields from 2013-2020 are downscaled to the farm level by masking the district level crop yield data to focus only on areas where crops are cultivated and leveraging soil-climate-landscape variables obtained from Google Earth Engine for crop yield prediction. This new semi-supervised learning approach can accommodate data from different spatial resolutions and enables training with unlabelled data. The incorporation of a crop indicator function further allows for the training of a multi-crop model that can capture the interdependences and correlations between various crops, thereby leading to more accurate predictions. Through k-fold cross-validation, we show that compared to the single crop models, our multi-crop model could produce up to a 2.82 fold reduction in mean absolute error for any particular crop. We found that barley, oats, and mixed grains were more tolerant to soil-climate-landscape variations and could be grown in many regions of Canada, while non-grain crops were more sensitive to environmental factors. Predicted crop suitability was associated with a region's growing season length, which supports climate change projections that regions of northern Canada will become more suitable for agricultural use. The proposed multi-crop model could facilitate assessment of the suitability of northern lands for crop cultivation and be incorporated into cost-benefit analyses.

TI  - Estimation of Rubber Yield Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber is a perennial plant grown to produce natural rubber. It is a raw material for industrial and non-industrial products important to the world economy. The sustainability of natural rubber production is, therefore, critical for smallholder livelihoods and economic development. To maintain price stability, it is important to estimate the yields in advance. Remote sensing technology can effectively provide large-scale spatial data; however, productivity estimates need to be processed from high spatial resolution data generated from satellites with high accuracy and reliability, especially for smallholder livelihood areas where smaller plots contrast with large farms. This study used reflectance data from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery acquired for the 12 months between December 2020 and November 2021. The imagery included 213 plots where data on rubber production in smallholder agriculture were collected. Six vegetation indices (Vis), namely Green Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GSAVI), Modified Simple Ratio (MSR), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Green (NR), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) were used to estimate the rubber yield. The study found that the red edge spectral band (band 5) provided the best prediction with R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 29.63 kg/ha, outperforming all other spectral bands and VIs. The MSR index provided the highest coefficient of determination, with R-2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 39.25 kg/ha. When the red edge reflectance was combined with the best VI, MSR, the prediction model only slightly improved, with a coefficient determination of (R-2) of 0.80 and an RMSE of 29.42 kg/ha. The results demonstrated that the Sentinel-2 data are suitable for rubber yield prediction for smallholder farmers. The findings of this study can be used as a guideline to apply in other countries or areas. Future studies will require the use of reflectance and vegetation indices derived from satellite data in combination with meteorological data, as well as the application of complex models, such as machine learning and deep learning.

TI  - Political bias indicators and perceptions of news
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionRecently, a variety of political bias indicators for social and news media have come to market to alert news consumers to the credibility and political bias of their sources. However, the effects of political bias indicators on how people consume news is unknown. Creators of bias indicators assume people will use the apps and extensions to become less biased news-consumers; however, it is also possible that people would use bias indicators to confirm their previous worldview and become more biased in their perceptions of news. MethodsAcross two studies, we tested how political bias indicators influence perceptions of news articles without partisan bias (Study 1, N = 394) and articles with partisan bias (Study 2, N = 616). Participants read news articles with or without political bias indicators present and rated the articles on their perceived political bias and credibility. ResultsOverall, we found no consistent evidence that bias indicators influence perceptions of credibility or bias in news. However, in Study 2, there was some evidence that participants planned to use bias indicators in the future to become more biased in their future news article selection. DiscussionThese data shed light on the (in) effectiveness of interventions against blindly consuming biased news and media.

TI  - Impacts of the All-Sky Assimilation of FY-3C and FY-3D MWHS-2 Radiances on Analyses and Forecasts of Typhoon Hagupit
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2)/Fengyun (FY)-3D in operation, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of a joint assimilation of MWHS-2 radiances under all-sky conditions from both the FY-3C and FY-3D satellites on typhoon forecasting within regional areas. In this study, Typhoon Hagupit in 2020 was chosen to investigate the impacts of assimilating MWHS-2 radiances; the forecasting performances of the joint assimilation method were slightly better than the experiments assimilating MWHS-2 observations from FY-3C or FY-3D only, and the results of the latter two experiments were comparable, especially in terms of the landfall location of Hagupit. With additional assimilated cloud- and precipitation-affected MWHS-2 observations, improved typhoon track and intensity forecasts as well as forecasts of the precipitation caused by Hagupit were achieved due to the improved analyses of relative humidity, temperature and wind fields around Hagupit compared to the clear-sky assimilation experiments. In addition, the channel-selection scheme evidently affected the forecasting performance; that is, the radiances from the MWHS-2 118 GHz and 183 GHz channels provided opposite results in terms of the Hagupit track, and this finding needs further investigation in the future.

TI  - Shifted Global Vegetation Phenology in Response to Climate Changes and Its Feedback on Vegetation Carbon Uptake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Green vegetation plays a vital role in energy flows and matter cycles in terrestrial ecosystems, and vegetation phenology may not only be influenced by, but also impose active feedback on, climate changes. The phenological events of vegetation such as the start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), and length of season (LOS) can respond to climate changes and affect gross primary productivity (GPP). Here, we coupled satellite remote sensing imagery with FLUXNET observations to systematically map the shift of SOS, EOS, and LOS in global vegetated area, and explored their response to climate fluctuations and feedback on GPP during the last two decades. The results indicated that 11.5% of the global vegetated area showed a significantly advanced trend in SOS, and that only 5.2% of the area presented significantly delayed EOS during the past two decades, resulting in significantly prolonged LOS in 12.6% of the vegetated area. The climate factors, including seasonal temperature and precipitation, attributed to the shifts in vegetation phenology, but with high spatial and temporal difference. LOS was positively and significantly correlated with GPP in 20.2% of the total area, highlighting that longer LOS is likely to promote vegetation productivity. The feedback on GPP from the shifted vegetation phenology may serve as an adaptation mechanism for terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate global warming through improved carbon uptake from the atmosphere.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this paper, we discuss the co-optimized performance of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle-terrestrial network (IS-UAV-TN), where the multiple vehicle users are applied to the network under consideration. The performance optimization of IS-UAV-TNs faces two major challenges: one is the obstacles in the transmission path and the other is the highly dynamic communication environment caused by the UAV movement for the multiple ground vehicle users. To tackle these above issues efficiently, we will install RIS on the UAV for the purpose of reshaping the wireless transmission path. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are considered as a new paradigm to address spectrum shortage and enhance connection quality. Considering the UAV energy consumption, the satellite transmission beamforming matrix and RIS phase shift configuration, a multi-objective optimization problem is proposed to maximize the system achievable rate and minimize the UAV energy consumption during a specific mission. On this foundation, to facilitate the online decision problem, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is utilized to achieve real-time interaction with the communication environment. A multi-objective deep deterministic policy gradient (MO-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to search for sub-optimal solutions about the learning problem of multi-objective control policies in IS-UAV-TNs. Experimental results show that the method can simultaneously consider three optimization objectives and effectively adjust the optimal update policy according to the settings of different weight parameters.

TI  - A remote sensing based method for assessing the impact of O<sub>3</sub> on the net primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - O-3 pollution in China has been increasing in recent years, but the process of O-3 impact on net primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems remains unclear. We attempts to explore a remote sensing-based method to assess the impact of O-3 on NPP of China's terrestrial ecosystems by combining MODIS NPP and the latest ground observation data of O-3 concentration. By comparing the NPP data of MODIS image pixels with the 6-year average AOT40 data of corresponding pixels, we extracted the signal data that highlighted the effects of O-3 on NPP and established the response relationships between AOT40 and NPP. It was found that NPP was significantly negatively correlated with AOT40 in farmland and grassland ecosystems in China (farmland: r = 0.8674, p < 0.003, grassland: r = 0.7181, p < 0.03). Then the response relationships were adopted to evaluate the effect in China in 2014. The results showed that the estimated percentage of O-3-induced NPP decline was in the range of 5%-35%. Among them, the most significant declines were found in farmland ecosystems, with the vast majority of declines in 10%-35%. The decrease rate of evergreen coniferous forests ranked second, mostly in the range of 15%-20%. The grassland ecosystems declined at a lower rate, almost between 5% and 15%. And the evergreen broad-leaved forests has the lowest decline rate, most distributed in 0%-5%. The highest percentage decreases were mainly found in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Shandong Province. And the decline rate of farmland ecosystems was significantly higher than other ecosystem types.

TI  - Assessment of Heat Mitigation Services Provided by Blue and Green Spaces: An Application of the InVEST Urban Cooling Model with Scenario Analysis in Wuhan, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural infrastructure is essential in reducing thermal discomfort caused by the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Optimizing and planning green and blue spaces can help establish nature-based urban heat mitigation strategies that benefit sustainable urban development. Most current studies on urban heat mitigation have focused on the single heat reduction effect of green space or blue space, while there has been a lack of research on the combined cooling effects of blue and green spaces. Moreover, existing heat mitigation models and methods cannot directly guide the optimization of blue-green spatial patterns at the urban scale. This has led to an unclear relationship between heat mitigation effects and blue-green spatial patterns. Based on land use data, meteorological data, and biophysical information as inputs, this paper utilized the InVEST urban cooling model (UCM) and scenario analysis method to simulate urban heat mitigation patterns by setting up different blue-green space configuration scenarios. The relative contribution of blue-green space changes to the variation of heat mitigation benefits was quantitatively estimated using the difference comparison method, and the relationship between heat reduction effects and urban blue-green spatial patterns was elucidated using spatial analysis methods. The results show that the InVEST UCM captured some of the variability in the surface thermal response of Wuhan and can be applied to the modeling of urban heat mitigation patterns. Furthermore, they show that consideration of the cooling effect of water evaporation can improve the simulation accuracy to some extent. In Wuhan, there were regional differences in heat mitigation patterns and the heat mitigation effect was significantly higher in the suburbs than in the city. Additionally, urban parks, lakes, and mountains with surface or block distribution had noticeable cooling benefits. Finally, the scenario simulation results demonstrate that green space was more efficient at mitigating heat, while blue space was more critical for the geographical partitioning of the UHI. These findings can provide a reference for the planning and optimal management of urban blue and green spaces, as well as for the design of heat reduction policies.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Rapid Siltation and Erosion Caused Coastline Evolution in the Coastal Mudflat Areas of Jiangsu
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Muddy coast due to natural and human-induced factors can be variable over a wide range of different spatiotemporal scales. Our limited capability to understand and especially predict this variability can lead to misinterpretation of muddy coastal change information, which hampers informed decision-making and subsequent design and implementation of engineering interventions. Therefore, the research on the evolution of the historical coastline is particularly important. In this study, annual mean coastlines and causes for the variability and possible evolutions are analyzed in a manner that avoids these effects by averaging the instantaneous coastline positions registered during the same year. A set of coastlines is obtained from Landsat MSS/TM/OLI series of remote sensing images taken between 1985 and 2020 in the Google Earth Engine at Jiangsu muddy coast of China Yellow Sea. The coastline is extracted based on the water body index and the Otsu method, and is classified by fractal dimension, annual rate of change, area calculation, center of gravity shift, and artificial index to calculate the temporal and spatial changes in the coastline. The results showed that most of the coastline advanced seaward due to rapid siltation and coastal development in the past 35 years with only a small portion receding landward. The entire coast experienced segmental changes and different evolutionary characteristics and the coastline shifted from rapid erosion to siltation. The silted banks were mainly distributed in the middle section of the coastline in the radial sandbank. The annual change rate in the coast section was 82.21 m/a and the average annual area increased by 18.07 km(2). The artificial coastline increased substantially, while the natural coastline gradually decreased due to rapid erosion. From 1985 to 2020, the proportion of artificial coastline in Jiangsu rose from 14% to 77%. The coastline became more curved and the center of gravity of the coastline moved 5.13 km to the northwest by 61 degrees. Before 2000, the driving force affecting the coastline variability was mainly rapid siltation, while the impact of rapid erosion and human activities gradually increased after 2000 with the natural coastline being continuously cut and straightened. Overall, Jiangsu's muddy coast was the site with the highest anthropogenic pressure and highest vulnerability. However, it is difficult to generalize the results under other conditions, especially on decadal time scales. Scientific and engineering improvements still require more quantitative insight into the physical mechanisms behind the natural and forced shore behavior responsible for the variability to better explain the change process of the coastline and provide a basis for coastal management and sustainable development.

TI  - An Overview of the Special Issue "Remote Sensing Applications in Vegetation Classification"
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - One of the ideas behind vegetation monitoring is the ability to identify different vegetation units, such as species, communities, habitats, or vegetation types. Remote sensing data allow for obtaining such information remotely, which is especially valuable in areas that are difficult to explore (such as mountains or wetlands). At the same time, such techniques allow for limiting field research, which is particularly important in this context. Remote sensing has been utilized for vegetation inventories for many decades, using airborne and spaceborne platforms. Developing newer tools, algorithms and sensors is conducive to more new applications in the vegetation identification field. The Special Issue "Remote Sensing Applications in Vegetation Classification" is an overview of the applications of remote sensing data with different resolutions for the identification of vegetation at different levels of detail. In 14 research papers, the most frequent different types of crops were analysed. In three cases, the authors recognised different types of grasslands, whereas trees were the object of the studies in two papers. The most commonly used sensors were Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; however, to a lesser extent, MODIS, airborne hyperspectral and multispectral data, as well as LiDAR products, were also utilised. There were articles that tested and compared different combinations of datasets, different terms of data acquisition, or different classifiers in order to achieve the highest classification accuracy. These accuracies were assessed quite satisfactorily in each publication; the overall accuracy (OA) for the best result varied from 72% to 98%. In all of the research papers, at least one of the two commonly used machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM), was applied. Additionally, one paper presented software ARTMO's machine-learning classification algorithms toolbox, which allows for the testing of 13 different classifiers. The studies published in this Special Issue can be used by the vegetation research teams and practitioners to conduct deeper analysis via the utilization of the proposed solutions.

TI  - Evaluation of the one-step nucleic acid amplification method for rapid detection of lymph node metastases in endometrial cancer: prospective, multicenter, comparative study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) method for the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in women with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer compared with standard ultrastaging. MethodsProspective, multicentric, interventional study. Patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer who underwent primary surgical staging with SLN mapping were included. SLNs were serially sectioned with 2 mm slices perpendicular to the longest axis of the node: the odd slices were submitted to ultrastaging, whereas the even slices were submitted to the OSNA analysis. Diagnostic performance was calculated taking ultrastaging as referral standard. ResultsThree-hundred and sixteen patients with 668 SLNs were included. OSNA assay detected 22 (3.3%) positive SLNs, of which 17 (2.5%) were micrometastases and 5 (0.7%) macrometastases, whereas ultrastaging detected 24 (3.6%) positive SLNs, of which 15 (2.2%) were micrometastases and 9 (1.3%) macrometastases (p=0.48). Regarding negative SLNs, OSNA detected 646 (96.7%) negative nodes, including 8 (1.2%) isolated tumor cells, while ultrastaging detected 644 (96.4%) negative nodes with 26 (3.9%) isolated tumor cells. Specificity of OSNA was 98.4% (95% CI 97.5 to 99.4), accuracy was 96.7% (95% CI 95.4 to 98.1), sensitivity was 50% (95% CI 30.0 to 70.0), while negative predictive value was 98.1% (95% CI 97.1 to 99.2). Discordant results were found in 22 SLNs (3.3%) corresponding to 20 patients (6.3%). These were 10 (1.5%) false-positive SLNs (all micrometastases): one (0.1%) of these was a benign epithelial inclusion at ultrastaging. There were 12 (1.8%) false-negative SLNs of OSNA, of which 9 (1.3%) were micrometastases and 3 (0.5%) macrometastases. Overall, 17/668 (2.5%) benign epithelial inclusions were detected at ultrastaging. ConclusionThe OSNA method had high specificity and high accuracy in detecting SLN metastasis in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. The advantage of the OSNA method could be represented as the possibility to analyze the entire lymph node thus eliminating sampling bias.

TI  - Increasing temperature regulates the advance of peak photosynthesis timing in the boreal ecosystem
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The shift in vegetation phenology is an essential indicator of global climate change. Numerous researches based on reflectance-based vegetation index data have explored the changes in the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of vegetation life events at long time scales, while a huge discrepancy existed between the phenological metrics of vegetation struc-ture and function. The peak photosynthesis timing (PPT), which is crucial in regulating terrestrial ecosystem carbon balance, has not received much attention. Using two global reconstructed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data (CSIF and GOSIF) directly associated with vegetation photosynthesis, the spatio-temporal dynamics in PPT as well as the key environmental controls across the boreal ecosystem during 2001-2019 were systematically explored. Multi-year mean pattern showed that PPT mainly appeared in the first half of July. Compared to the northern Eurasia, later PPT appeared in the northern North America continent for about 4-5 days. Meanwhile, spatial trend in PPT ex-hibited an advanced trend during the last two decades. Especially, shrubland and grassland were obvious among all biomes. Spatial partial correlation analysis revealed that preseason temperature was the dominant environmental driver of PPT trends, occupying 81.32% and 78.04% of the total pixels of PPTCSIF and PPTGOSIF, respectively. Attribu-tion analysis by ridge regression again emphasized the largest contribution of temperature to PPT dynamics in the bo -real ecosystem by 52.22% (PPTCSIF) and 46.59% (PPTGOSIF), followed by radiation (PPTCSIF: 24.44%; PPTGOSIF: 28.66%) and precipitation (PPTCSIF: 23.34%; PPTGOSIF: 24.75%). These results have significant implications for deep-ening our understanding between vegetation photosynthetic phenology and carbon cycling with respect to future cli-mate change in the boreal ecosystem.

TI  - Distinguishing <i>Ulva prolifera</i> and <i>Sargassum horneri</i> by using multi-feature-based ResUnet algorithm
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, two types of macroalgae, namely, Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri, have appeared occasionally together in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Remote sensing enables timely and cost-effective observation of macroalgae across large areas. In the available studies, the recognition and classification of the two macroalgae are primarily based on spectral difference analysis. In this study, the spectral features, indices and textural feature parameters of the macroalgae targets were extracted and a preliminary multi-feature dataset was constructed based on Sentinel-2 images. Feature selection was performed using SHAP-based importance analysis and Bhattacharyya distance. From this, a multi-feature dataset was created and used as an input to a deep semantic segmentation network of improved ResUnet. The experiments of intelligent recognition and classification of U. prolifera and S. horneri were carried out using the proposed multi-feature-based ResUnet algorithm, with specific F1-scores of 96.7% and 96.8%, respectively. The proposed multi-feature-based ResUnet algorithm can obtain efficient and high-accuracy results for the recognition and classification of marine floating macroalgae. It achieves accurate remote sensing monitoring of the two types of marine floating macroalgae and has significant theoretical research significance and practical application value.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node (LN) metastases are a significant concern in urological malignancies. However, current imaging techniques do not reliably detect micrometastases; thus, lymph node dissection (LND) remains the gold standard. Nevertheless, there is no established ideal LND template, leading to unnecessary invasive staging and the possibility of missing LN metastases located outside the standard template. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept has been proposed to address this issue, but its application in uro-oncology is still mostly experimental. Nevertheless, new techniques may improve its potential. This review aims to discuss the current and future role of the SLN procedure in managing urological malignancies.Lymph node (LN) metastases have a significant negative impact on the prognosis of urological malignancies. Unfortunately, current imaging modalities are insufficient when it comes to detecting micrometastases; thus, surgical LN removal is commonly used. However, there is still no established ideal lymph node dissection (LND) template, leading to unnecessary invasive staging and the possibility of missing LN metastases located outside the standard template. To address this issue, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept has been proposed. This technique involves identifying and removing the first group of draining LNs, which can accurately stage cancer. While successful in breast cancer and melanoma, the SLN technique in urologic oncology is still considered experimental due to high false-negative rates and lack of data in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. Nevertheless, the development of new tracers, imaging modalities, and surgical techniques may improve the potential of the SLN procedures in urological oncology. In this review, we aim to discuss the current knowledge and future contributions of the SLN procedure in the management of urological malignancies.

TI  - High Spatial and Temporal Soil Moisture Retrieval in Agricultural Areas Using Multi-Orbit and Vegetation Adapted Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of soil moisture information with spatially and temporally high resolution from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations is still a challenge. By using multi-orbit Sentinel-1 C-band time series, we present a novel approach for estimating volumetric soil moisture content for agricultural areas with a temporal resolution of one to two days, based on a short-term change detection method. By applying an incidence angle normalization and a Fourier Series transformation, the effect of varying incidence angles on the backscattering signal could be reduced. As the C-band co-polarized backscattering signal is prone to vegetational changes, it is used in this study for the vegetational correction of its related backscatter ratios. The retrieving algorithm was implemented in a cloud-processing environment, enabling a potential global and scalable application. Validated against eight in-situ cosmic ray neutron probe stations across the Rur catchment (Germany) as well as six capacitance stations at the Apulian Tavoliere (Italy) site for the years 2018 to 2020, the method achieves a correlation coefficient of R of 0.63 with an unbiased Root Mean Square Error of 0.063 m(3)/m(3).

TI  - The NOMS approach to metastatic tumors: Integrating new technologies to improve outcomes.
T2  - Revista espanola de cirugia ortopedica y traumatologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Treatment paradigms for patients with spine metastases have evolved significantly over the past two decades. The most transformative change to these paradigms has been the integration of spinal stereotactic radiosurgery (sSRS). sSRS allows for the delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of nearby organs at risk, particularly the spinal cord. Evidence supports the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery as it currently offers durable local tumor control with low complication rates even for tumors previously considered radioresistant to conventional external beam radiation therapy. The role for surgical intervention remains consistent, but a trend has been observed toward less aggressive, often minimally invasive techniques. Using modern technologies and improved instrumentation, surgical outcomes continue to improve with reduced morbidity. Additionally, targeted agents such as biologics and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care by improving both local control and patient survival. These advances have brought forth a need for new prognostication tools and a more critical review of long-term outcomes. The complex nature of current treatment schemes necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventionalists and pain specialists. This review recapitulates the current state-of-the-art, evidence-based data on the treatment of spinal metastases and integrates these data into a decision framework, NOMS, which is based on four sentinel pillars of decision making in metastatic spine tumors: Neurological status, Oncologic tumor behavior, Mechanical stability, and Systemic disease burden and medical co-morbidities.

M3  - Article
AB  - Areas of high ice water content (HIWC) within cloud systems may cause power loss events and engine damage in jet aircraft due to ice crystal icing (ICI). The Algorithm for Prediction of HIWC Areas (ALPHA) was developed to identify these regions and enable provision of guidance to airlines. ALPHA combines numerical weather prediction model data, satellite data, and radar data (where available), and applies fuzzy logic to identify the likely presence of HIWC. In a collaboration between the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, and Australian airlines, a trial of ALPHA was conducted for an area across Indonesia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and northern Australia, a region with frequent deep convection and a relatively high incidence of ICI events. ALPHA was adapted to ingest data from the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator model and the Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary meteorological satellite. Radar data was not used. The HIWC product was made available to stakeholder groups for evaluation. Independent validation of the HIWC product was undertaken by comparing it with retrieved profiles of ice water content (IWC) from the cloud profiling radar on the NASA polar-orbiting CloudSat satellite. Conduct of the ALPHA trial and results from validation of the HIWC product provides confidence in the potential utility for flight planning, maintaining situational awareness, and flight monitoring.

TI  - Applying climate change refugia to forest management and old-growth restoration
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies highlight the potential of climate change refugia (CCR) to support the persistence of biodiversity in regions that may otherwise become unsuitable with climate change. However, a key challenge in using CCR for climate resilient management lies in how CCR may intersect with existing forest management strategies, and subsequently influence how landscapes buffer species from negative impacts of warming climate. We address this challenge in temperate coastal forests of the Pacific Northwestern United States, where declines in the extent of late-successional forests have prompted efforts to restore old-growth forest structure. One common approach for doing so involves selectively thinning forest stands to enhance structural complexity. However, dense canopy is a key forest feature moderating understory microclimate and potentially buffering organisms from climate change impacts, raising the possibility that approaches for managing forests for old-growth structure may reduce the extent and number of CCR. We used remotely sensed vegetation indices to identify CCR in an experimental forest with control and thinned (restoration) treatments, and explored the influence of biophysical variables on buffering capacity. We found that remotely sensed vegetation indices commonly used to identify CCR were associated with understory temperature and plant community composition, and thus captured aspects of landscape buffering that might instill climate resilience and be of interest to management. We then examined the interaction between current restoration strategies and CCR, and found that selective thinning for promoting old-growth structure had only very minor, if any, effects on climatic buffering. In all, our study demonstrates that forest management approaches aimed at restoring old-growth structure through targeted thinning do not greatly decrease buffering capacity, despite a known link between dense canopy and CCR. More broadly, this study illustrates the value of using remote sensing approaches to identify CCR, facilitating the integration of climate change adaptation with other forest management approaches.

TI  - A novel GIS-based multicriteria analysis approach for ascertaining the catchment-scale degradation of a Himalayan wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland degradation through a diverse spectrum of anthropogenic stressors worldwide has taken a heavy toll on the health of wetlands. This study examined the health of a semi-urban wetland Bodsar, located in the Kashmir Himalaya using multicriteria analysis approach assimilating data on land use land cover (LULC), landscape fragmentation, soil loss, and demography. Wetland and catchment-scale land system changes from 1980 to 2022 were assessed using high-resolution imagery. Fragmentation of the natural landscape was assessed using the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT) and soil loss was assessed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). In addition, the water quality was examined at 12 sites distributed across the wetland using standard methods. Satellite data revealed 12 categories of land use with areas under exposed rock, orchards, built-up and sparse forest having increased by 1005%, 623%, 274%, and 37% respectively. LFT indicated that the core (>500 acres) and core (<250 acres) zones decreased by approximately 16% and 64%, respectively, whereas the areas under the perforated, edge and patch classes increased significantly. RUSLE estimates show a similar to 77% increase in soil erosion from 116.26 Mg a(-1) in 1980 to 205.68 Mg a(-1) in 2022, mostly due to changes in LULC. Total phosphorus (0.195-2.04 mg L-1), nitrate nitrogen (0.306-2.79 mg L-1), and total dissolved solids (543-774 mg L-1) indicated nutrient enrichment of the wetland influenced by anthropogenically-driven land system changes. The wetland degradation index revealed that 21% of the wetland experienced high-to-severe degradation, 62% experienced moderate degradation, and 17% did not face any significant degradation pressure. The novel GIS-based approach adopted in this study can act as a prototype for ascertaining the catchment-scale degradation of wetlands worldwide.

TI  - New perspective on the geothermal potential of Wikki Warm Spring, Northeastern Nigeria, from remote sensing and radiometric data
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Wikki Warm Spring is one of the promising locations for the development of geothermal projects in Nigeria. Radiometric and remote sensing data were interpreted to enhance the understanding of the factors controlling the geothermal energy sources in the Wikki Warm Spring. Thus, mapping locations of concealed heat sources offer concentration areas for follow-up geothermal exploration. Landsat-8 imagery was used to produce the land surface temperature (LST) map, which reveals surface temperature variation that ranges from 50 to 95 degrees C. In comparison, the radiogenic heat map of the region generated from the radiometric data of the study area shows radiogenic heat production rate, which ranged from less than 0.69 to above 3.91 mu Wm(-3). The radiogenic heat and LST maps show similar features, indicating that Basement Complex terrain exhibits high radiogenic and surface temperature than the Benue Trough. Monte Carlo simulation reveals statistical values that suggest that the most likely radiogenic heat value is 1.95 mu Wm(-3) around the warm spring, the highest possible (best case scenario) heat value is 2.23 mu Wm(-3), and the least possible value (worst case scenario) is 1.69 mu Wm(-3). The Basement Complex terrain northwest of the warm spring produced high radiogenic heat, generating values above 3.91 mu Wm(-3). The outcome of this investigation is very important for explorationists to institute sustainable geothermal energy mitigation plans and produce a clean and renewable energy in Wikki Warm Spring.

TI  - Characterization of landslide displacements in an active fault zone in Northwest China
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides can be caused by natural forcing and anthropogenic activities. Zhouqu County (China) on the eastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is set within the active Pingding-Huama fault zone with evident fractures on the land surface. Frequent landslides and debris flows have occurred in this region due to river erosion, rainfall and deforestation. Here we quantified the slope movements using time-series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 satellite images acquired between October 2014 and August 2020. We observed distinct displacements in the highly fractured fault zone. The eastward and vertical displacement time series between February 2017 and July 2020 were constrained by the common-day ascending and descending acquisitions. The eastward rates (461 mm/year) were greater than those in the vertical direction (-185 mm/year). We also note displacement discontinuities across the thrust faults beneath the Suoertou and Zhongpai landslides. Seasonal variations in the displacement time series suggest that the cyclic rainfall is the primary driver for the mass wasting processes rather than the tectonic loading. As a complement to in situ observations, our results demonstrate that InSAR is an effective tool to characterize the spatio-temporal nature of landslide displacements in complicated geological environments. Plain Language SummaryZhouqu County in the Pingding-Huama fault zone in the eastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is identified as a high priority site to research on clusters of landslides and debris flows in a mixed geodynamic setting of active tectonics, seasonal rainfall, river erosion and anthropogenic activities. However, our knowledge about landslide kinematics in this complicated region is still limited. We relied on remote sensing images from one ascending and one descending Sentinel-1 satellite tracks to constrain the spatial-temporal displacement dynamics of active landslides from 2014 to 2020. The spatial patterns of displacements are determined by thrust faulting, river erosion, and anthropogenic activities. The temporal variations of landslide speed are mainly controlled by the seasonal rainfall rather than the tectonic loading.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of a rare disease
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE DERMATOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare skin cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation. The risk factors include sun exposure, advanced age, immunosuppression (such as transplant recipients, patients with lymphoproliferative neoplasms, or patients with HIV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus infection. Clinically, Merkel cell carcinoma appears as a cutaneous or subcutaneous plaque or nodule, but this tumor diagnosis is rarely made clinically. Therefore, histopathology and immunohistochemistry are usually necessary. Primary tumors without evidence of metastases are treated with complete surgical excision and appropriate surgical margins. The presence of occult metastasis in a lymph node is frequent and a sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy increases local tumor control. Recently, agents that block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have shown objective and durable tumor regression in patients with advanced solid malignancies. The first anti-PD-L1 antibody used in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma was avelumab, but pembrolizumab and nivolumab have also shown efficacy. This article describes the current state of knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and staging of Merkel cell carcinoma, as well as new strategies for its systemic treatment.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics associated with a wildfire event is essential for projecting a clear profile of its potential ecological influences.Aims. To develop a reliable framework to extract fire footprints from MODIS-based burn products to facilitate the understanding of fire event evolution.Methods. This study integrated the Jenks natural breaks classification method and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to extract the fire footprints in Daxing'anling region of China between 2001 and 2006 from MCD64A1 burned area data.Key results. The results showed that the fire footprints extracted by the model gained an overall accuracy of 80% in spatial and temporal domains after an intensive validation by using the historical fire records provided by the local agency. The agreement of burned area between the extracted fire patches and the historical fire records for those matched fire points was characterised by an overall determination coefficient R2 at 0.91.Conclusions. The proposed framework serves as an efficient and convenient wildfire management tool for areas requiring large-scale and long-term wildfire monitoring.Implications. The current framework can be used to create a reliable large-scale fire event database by providing an important alternative for the improvement of field investigation.

TI  - Solar wind H plus fluxes at 1 AU for solar cycles 23 and 24
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar wind consists of electrons and ion species having kinetic energy K 10 keVs. Ion stream is mainly composed of protons. Their flux magnitude is especially important for radiation hardness assurance scientists who qualify materials for future space missions. Materials irreversibly degrade as soon as are exposed to solar radiation. Hence, proton differential and integral flux spectra play a crucial role in properly estimating radiation loads deposited within satellite functional components. Up to now, the wind fluxes were read out, e.g., from figures made for specific periods of a solar cycle. This method is not effective and is a source of a flux, and further on, a fluence uncertainty. The objective of this work was to calculate and tabulate the solar wind differential and integral proton fluxes, which can be used further on to evaluatespace mission proton fluence spectra. Solar wind proton bulk velocity and number density from four space solar observatories (SOHO, ACE, WIND, and DSCOVR) were numerically processed to achieve that goal. Fluxes were tabulated and represented in calendar year periods.Now, the radiation hardness assurance community can quickly access, compute and compare SW proton fluxes from different energy ranges, calendar years, and satellite data sources. Proton fluxes presented here indicate magnitude variations along with the solar cycle period. A correlation between the number of sunspots and the proton average flux was found, i.e., the larger the number of spots, the larger the flux magnitude. More importantly, it was discovered that proton fluxes indicate huge variations in magnitude for a selected year based on different satellite data sources. For some years, the difference reaches 240%. This value is reported for the first time and shows that to have a complete picture of the SW proton stream population, one must compare data from all four satellites. Also, it is reported that satellites, for a given calendar year, record different ranges of proton velocity and number density values. This finding, even stronger, suggests a necessity of comparing SW data from as many solar observatories as pos-sible. The spread in the proton flux magnitude (240%) has a direct implication for planning and executing satellite material on-ground radiation test campaigns. Not carefully choosing aproton flux may result in a false impression of how examined material would degrade under an interplanetary space radiation environment.In this article, recommendations for selecting proper proton spectra are given.(c) 2023 COSPAR.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term spatial pattern analysis becomes an important and effective way of monitoring the interactions be-tween land covers and associated evolutions over time, which removes disturbance and uncertainty and has considerable benefits for dynamic, cyclical geographical processes. The time series images with time-space continuity hold unique advantages for tracing spatial pattern evolution and discovering the evolutionary regu-lations and mechanisms underlying in history archive. However, current research is inadequate in characterizing spatial patterns with spatial relations and is limited in change types mining from evolving spatial patterns. This study hence proposed a novel algorithm for detecting multi-type changes in spatial patterns (MTCD) with graph change analysis. Specially, 1) we designed a frequent graph cell extraction method to construct the spatial pattern evolution graph (SPEG) based on time-series land cover images; 2) a graph coding method was developed to represent SPEG digitally and convert it into the graph-encoded time series; 3) a graph change mining method was proposed to detect the changing types of graph-encoded time series for stable, cyclic, and dominant change. The Landsat land cover time series of Datong, Shanxi Province, China, was adopted to validate the MTCD al-gorithm. Results show our algorithm's effectiveness in simultaneously capturing three typical types of spatial pattern change at different spatial scales. The MTCD provides an essential step toward analyzing changing geographical patterns and graph structure.

TI  - Did the Covid-19 restrictions influence land surface temperatures in Southeast Asia? A study from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been a prolonged lockdown period and reduction in human activities in most of the major cities in the world during the Covid-19 pandemic period between the early 2020 and the late 2021. Such a reduction in human activities was believed to have influenced pollution levels and land surface temperatures (LST) in urban areas. This paper describes the variations in LSTs before, during and after the Covid-19 lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam, which is the economic hub of the country. For this purpose, Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS images acquired between 2015 and 2022 were used. It is observed that there was a significant reduction of 1 to 1.8 degrees C in LST in open areas, excepting impervious surfaces and built-up areas, during the strict lockdown period in Ho Chi Minh City, and an increase in LST since then. The observed reduction in LST during the lockdown period in Ho Chi Minh City is in agreement with the reduction in greenhouses gases during the same period in recent studies. Human mobility and industrial activities have been restored in November 2021 in the study area which would explain the regain in LST in the post-lockdown period.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Daytime Sea Fog Based on Supervised Classification Techniques for FY-3D Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar-orbiting satellites have been widely used for detecting sea fog because of their wide coverage and high spatial and spectral resolution. FengYun-3D (FY-3D) is a Chinese satellite that provides global sea fog observation. From January 2021 to October 2022, the backscatter and virtual file manager products from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) were used to label samples of different atmospheric conditions in FY-3D images, including clear sky, sea fog, low stratus, fog below low stratus, mid-high-level clouds, and fog below the mid-high-level clouds. A 13-dimensional feature matrix was constructed after extracting and analyzing the spectral and texture features of these samples. In order to detect daytime sea fog using a 13-dimensional feature matrix and CALIPSO sample labels, four supervised classification models were developed, including Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Network. The accuracy of each model was evaluated and compared using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The study found that the SVM, KNN, and Neural Network performed equally well in identifying low stratus, with 85% to 86% probability of detection (POD). As well as identifying the basic components of sea fog, the SVM model demonstrated the highest POD (93.8%), while the KNN had the lowest POD (92.4%). The study concludes that the SVM, KNN, and Neural Network can effectively distinguish sea fog from low stratus. The models, however, were less effective at detecting sub-cloud fog, with only 11.6% POD for fog below low stratus, and 57.4% POD for fog below mid-high-level clouds. In light of this, future research should focus on improving sub-cloud fog detection by considering cloud layers.

TI  - Mapping Alpine Grassland Fraction Coverage Using Zhuhai-1 OHS Imagery in the Three River Headwaters Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widely spread alpine grassland ecosystem in the Three River Headwaters Region (TRHR) plays an essential ecological role in carbon sequestration and soil and water conservation. In this study, we test the latest high spatial resolution hyperspectral (Zhuhai-1 OHS) remote sensing imagery to examine different alpine grassland coverage levels using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). Our results suggest that the 3-endmember (3-EM) MESMA model can provide the highest image pixel unmixing percentage, with a percentage exceeding 97% and 96% for pixel scale and landscape scale, respectively. The overall accuracy shows that Zhuhai-1 OHS imagery obtained the highest overall accuracy (83.7%, k = 0.77) in the landscape scale, but in the pixel scale, it is not as good as Landsat 8 OLI imagery. Overall, we can conclude that the hyperspectral imagery combined 3-EM MESMA model performs better in both pixel scale and landscape scale alpine grassland coverage mapping, while the multispectral imagery with the 3-EM MESMA model can satisfy requirements of alpine grassland coverage mapping at the pixel scale. The approaches and workflow to mapping alpine grassland in this study can help monitor alpine grassland degradation; not only in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), but also in other grassland ecosystems.

TI  - A Transformer-based method to reduce cloud shadow interference in automatic lake water surface extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake extraction from remote sensing images is an important approach to monitoring water resources. It provides guidance for aiding in maintaining natural ecological balance through the artificial adjustment of lake water resources. Cloud shadows are common interference factors in lake extraction from optical images. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning network based on a novel Transformer architecture to extract lakes from Sentinel-2 imagery. To determine how training datasets affect misclassifications of cloud shadows, we produced five training datasets that contained different proportions of cloud shadows to train the network; the highest pro-portion of cloud shadows among them was 4%. We found that, when the training dataset contained 4% cloud shadows, the obtained model could effectively reduce the misclassification of cloud shadows and improve the accuracy of lake extraction, and with this model, the evaluation results over the validation dataset achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9954 and a Kappa of 0.9568. In addition, the Transformer-based network was applied in the endorheic basin of Tibetan Plateau to further evaluate the generalization ability of the network over a large area. The Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset from the European Commission Joint Research Centre was used as a reference to validate our results in this area. Our experiment and results demonstrated the underlying potential of the Transformer-based network for improving image classification of optical imagery by reducing cloud shadow inferences.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Ecological Quality Spatial Patterns and Influencing Factors Based on Remote Sensing Ecological Indices and Multi-Scale Geographically Weighted Regression
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, problems such as urban ecological environment quality have become increasingly prominent. How to scientifically analyze and evaluate the spatial pattern of urban ecological environment changes and influential variables is a prerequisite for achieving green development and ecological priority new in urban planning. Our study was conducted on Pingtan Island, located in Fujian Province, China. First, we selected Landsat 8 OLI images in 2013, 2017, and 2021. Second, we extracted the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) from these images and created RSEI maps to assess the spatial-temporal variations and spatial autocorrelation of the ecological environment condition in Pingtan Island. Third, the proportion of land-use types, road, and population density were selected as independent variable factors, RSEI as the dependent variable, least squares regression (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) were used to establish global and local regression models. According to the regression coefficients of the model and its spatial distribution, the spatial heterogeneity between the ecological environment and the influencing factors was assessed. The results indicated that: (1) the mean value of the RSEI increased from 0.422 to 0.504 during 2013-2021, indicating that the overall ecological environment improved. (2) Based on the global Moran's I value, the distribution of ecological environment quality was positively correlated. The local Moran's I cluster map showed that the high-high cluster gradually extended to the northwest high-altitude region. Low-low clustering gradually extended to the more populous areas in the southeast. (3) The Radj2 of the MGWR model was 0.866, which was better than the results of the OLS model and GWR model, indicating that MGWR had obvious advantages in revealing the spatial heterogeneity between the ecological environment and the influencing factors. Importantly, the results indicate that population density, road density, and the proportion of cropland land and impervious surface in land-use types have varying degrees of negative effects on the urban ecological environment, with the impervious surface being more severe, followed by population density, while forest land in land-use types shows significant positive effects.

TI  - Trends in post-1950 riparian vegetation recovery in coastal catchments of NSW Australia: Implications for remote sensing analysis, forecasting and river management
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive riparian vegetation clearance occurred in many rivers of southeastern Australia throughout the 19th and 20th century, post colonisation. With improvements in river management practices, coincident with a period of minimal flooding, vegetation recovery of riparian corridors has been occurring since the 1980s in all coastal catchments of New South Wales (NSW). However, the catchment-by-catchment spatial pattern and temporal trends, trajectories and rates of vegetative recovery remain unknown. We reconstruct a 70-year time series of change in riparian vegetation coverage for all rivers in coastal catchments of NSW, utilising historical aerial imagery, Landsat and Sentinel data and a manual digitisation and machine learning method. We quantify and statistically analyse decadal trends in woody and non-woody vegetation coverage along 19 485 km of stream length in 20 catchments. Across the region, there has been, on average, a 40% increase in vegetation coverage along riparian corridors since the 1950s, with some catchments increasing towards a current day coverage of between 60% and 80%. However, the trends vary by subregion and by catchment. An early logarithmic increase occurred up to 2004 on the North coast, and a recent and accelerated exponential increase since 1995 has occurred on the South coast. After a steep initial increase, riparian corridor vegetation coverage has fluctuated on the Central coast since about 1995. We used these linear, exponential and logarithmic regressions to undertake preliminary forecasts of possible future timeframes of riparian vegetation change, based on several climate, management and natural disaster disturbance scenarios. If the current trend continues, riparian vegetation coverage can reach 70% across the region by 2055. However, if management practices change or catastrophic disturbance events such as fire and flood occur, increases in riparian vegetation coverage could be set back by up to 30 to 40 years.

The launch of the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard the NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) enables canopy vertical structure measurement at a global scale. However, with a photon-counting laser system, ICESat-2 contains high uncertainties in the estimated canopy heights, requiring appropriate quality control before being applied to canopy height modelling.We adopted a multivariate quality control approach (i.e. the Cook's distance) to improve the quality of ICESat-2 samples. The controlled ICESat-2 data were then input as the response variable for predicting boreal forest heights based on spatially continuous satellite data and machine learning (ML) regression models. The examined ML regressors include artificial neural networks (ANN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR).The proposed quality control effectively removes low-quality ICESat-2 samples and enhances the correlations between ICESat-2 and airborne laser scanning (ALS) observations. Moreover, the controlled ICESat-2 samples help achieve a trade-off between sample quality and quantity for all ML regressors, generating close canopy heights to ALS-derived counterparts. Overall, RF and GBM make better canopy height predictions than ANN and SVR. Of all explanatory variables, the normalized difference vegetation index calculated based on the first red edge band of Sentinel-2 (NDVIredEdge1) is considered the most important.The proposed quality control on ICESat-2 sample selection and canopy height model (CHM) development workflow will greatly benefit forest structure investigations in the Arctic community.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy and Consistency of Six Fine-Resolution Global Land Cover Products Using a Novel Stratified Random Sampling Validation Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, benefiting from the development of computing capacity and the free access to Landsat and Sentinel imagery, several fine-resolution global land cover (GLC) products (with a resolution of 10 m or 30 m) have been developed (GlobeLand30, FROM-GLC30, GLC_FCS30, FROM-GLC10, European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover and ESRI Land Cover). However, there is still a lack of consistency analysis or comprehensive accuracy assessment using a common validation dataset for these GLC products. In this study, a novel stratified random sampling GLC validation dataset (SRS_Val) containing 79,112 validation samples was developed using a visual interpretation method, significantly increasing the number of samples of heterogeneous regions and rare land-cover types. Then, we quantitatively assessed the accuracy of these six GLC products using the developed SRS_Val dataset at global and regional scales. The results reveal that ESA WorldCover achieved the highest overall accuracy (of 70.54% +/- 9%) among the global 10 m land cover products, followed by FROM-GLC10 (68.95% +/- 8%) and ESRI Land Cover (58.90% +/- 7%) and that GLC_FCS30 had the best overall accuracy (of 72.55% +/- 9%) among the global 30 m land cover datasets, followed by GlobeLand30 (69.96% +/- 9%) and FROM-GLC30 (66.30% +/- 8%). The mapping accuracy of the GLC products decreased significantly with the increased heterogeneity of landscapes, and all GLC products had poor mapping accuracies in countries with heterogeneous landscapes, such as some countries in Central and Southern Africa. Finally, we investigated the consistency of six GLC products from the perspective of area distributions and spatial patterns. It was found that the area consistencies between the five GLC products (except ESRI Land Cover) were greater than 85% and that the six GLC products showed large discrepancies in area consistency for grassland, shrubland, wetlands and bare land. In terms of spatial patterns, the totally inconsistent pixel proportions of the 10 m and 30 m GLC products were 23.58% and 14.12%, respectively, and these inconsistent pixels were mainly distributed in transition zones, complex terrains regions, heterogeneous landscapes, or mixed land-cover types. Therefore, the SRS_Val dataset well supports the quantitative evaluation of fine-resolution GLC products, and the assessment results provide users with quantitative metrics to select GLC products suitable for their needs.

TI  - Differential transmissibility to <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> gametocytes in patients with diverse Duffy blood group genotypes
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMeasuring risk of malaria transmission is complex, especially in case of Plasmodium vivax. This may be overcome using membrane feeding assays in the field where P. vivax is endemic. However, mosquito-feeding assays are affected by a number of human, parasite and mosquito factors. Here, this study identified the contributions of Duffy blood group status of P. vivax-infected patients as a risk of parasite transmission to mosquitoes.MethodsA membrane feeding assay was conducted on a total of 44 conveniently recruited P. vivax infected patients in Adama city and its surroundings in East Shewa Zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia from October, 2019 to January, 2021. The assay was performed in Adama City administration. Mosquito infection rates were determined by midgut dissections at seven to 8 days post-infection. Duffy genotyping was defined for each of the 44 P. vivax infected patients.ResultsThe infection rate of Anopheles mosquitoes was 32.6% (296/907) with 77.3% proportion of infectious participants (34/44). Infectiousness of participants to Anopheles mosquitoes appeared to be higher among individuals with homozygous Duffy positive blood group (TCT/TCT) than heterozygous (TCT/CCT), but the difference was not statistically significant. The mean oocyst density was significantly higher among mosquitoes fed on blood of participants with FY*B/FY*B-ES than other genotypes (P = 0.001).ConclusionDuffy antigen polymorphisms appears to contribute to transmissibility difference of P. vivax gametocytes to Anopheles mosquitoes, but further studies are required.

TI  - Hysterectomy alone vs. hysterectomy plus sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer: Perioperative and long-term results from a propensity-score based study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare outcomes after hysterectomy and hysterectomy plus sentinel node mapping (SNM) in endometrial cancer (EC) patients.Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study, collecting data of EC patients treated between 2006 and 2016 in nine referral centers.Results: The study population included 398 (69.5%) and 174 (30.5%) patients having hysterectomy and hysterectomy plus SNM. As the results of the adoption of a propensity-score matched analysis, we selected two homogeneous cohort of patients (150 having hysterectomy only vs. 150 having hysterec-tomy plus SNM). The SNM group had a longer operative time, but did not correlate with length of hospital stay and estimated blood loss. Overall severe complication rates were similar between groups (0.7% in the hysterectomy group vs. 1.3% in the hysterectomy plus SNM group; p 1/4 0.561). No lymphatic-specific complication occurred. Overall, 12.6% of patients having SNM were diagnosed with disease harboring in their lymph nodes. Adjuvant therapy administration rate was similar between groups. Considering patients having SNM, 4% of patients received adjuvant therapy on the basis of nodal status alone; all the other patients received adjuvant therapy also on the basis of uterine risk factors. Five-year disease-free (p = 0.720) and overall (p = 0.632) survival was not influenced by surgical approach.Conclusions: Hysterectomy (with or without SNM) is a safe and effective method for managing EC patients. Potentially, these data support the omission of side specific lymphadenectomy in case of un-successful mapping. Further evidence is warranted in to confirm the role SNM in the era of molecular/genomic profiling.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis and identification of deforestation hotspots in the Moroccan western Rif
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the north of Morocco, forest areas are under threat mainly due to the expansion of agricultural land, forest fires and socio-demographic, economic and urban dynamics. Despite the magnitude of deforestation in this area, quantitative studies and investigations of its evolution in time and space are rare or non-existent. The present study aims to assess and quantify gross forest losses in the Western Rif between 2001 and 2020 through the exploitation of Global Forest Change (GFC) data developed by Hansen et al. (version 1.8) based on high reso-lution Landsat TM satellite images. We used Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) methods to identify statistically significant spatio-temporal trends in forest losses with ArcGis 10.8 and Geoda software. The main results showed that over the last two decades, the Western Rif has lost 8.39% of its forest heritage, a total area of 272 km2. The greatest forest losses were recorded in the provinces of Chefchaouen, Tetouan and Larache (70% of total losses), while the highest annual deforestation rates are reported in the prefectures of M'diq-Fnideq and Tangier-Assilah (0.9% and 0.89% respectively). Moreover, we observed that 81% of the deforested areas were recorded in the formations of the following types: matorral, cork oak stands and artificial pine forest. A first analysis of local Moran's spatial autocorrelation based on the communal division and on the variables relating to forest losses and gross deforestation rates revealed the existence of 3 significant clusters of the high-high (HH) type. A second optimized analysis of deforestation hotspot (Getis-Ord statistical test) based on a 0.5 km x 0.5 km grid identified 26 deforestation fronts in the study area. Finally, we conducted an emerging hotspot analysis to take into account the time dimension and we concluded that the oscillating deforestation model predominates in the Western Rif. These results constitute valuable decision elements to better guide, prioritize and rationalize the monitoring, conservation and restoration efforts of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Comparing Different Spatial Resolutions and Indices for Retrieving Land Surface Phenology for Deciduous Broadleaf Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) are an extremely widespread vegetation type in the global ecosystem and an indicator of global environmental change; thus, they require accurate phenological monitoring. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of the sensitivity of phenological retrievals for DBF in terms of different spatial resolution data and proxy indices. In this study, 79 globally distributed DBF PhenoCam Network sites (total 314 site-years, 2013-2018) were used as the reference data (based on green chromaticity coordinates, GCC). Different spatial resolutions (30 m Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, and 500 m MCD43A4 data) and satellite remote sensing vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; enhanced vegetation index, EVI; and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation, NIRV) were compared to find the most suitable data and indices for DBF phenological retrievals. The results showed that: (1) for different spatial resolutions, both 30 m Landsat-Sentinel-2 data and 500 m MODIS data accurately captured (R-2 > 0.8) DBF phenological metrics (i.e., the start of the growing season, SOS, and the end of the growing season, EOS), which are associated with the comparatively homogeneous landscape pattern of DBF; (2) for SOS, the NIRv index was closer to GCC than EVI and NDVI, and it showed a slight advantage over EVI and a significant advantage over NDVI. However, for EOS, NDVI performed best, outperforming EVI and NIRv; and (3) for different phenological metrics, the 30 m data showed a significant advantage for detecting SOS relative to the 500 m data, while the 500 m MCD43A4 outperformed the 30 m data for EOS. This was because of the differences between the wavebands used for GCC and for the satellite remote sensing vegetation indices calculations, as well as the different sensitivity of spatial resolution data to bare soil. This study provides a reference for preferred data and indices for broad scale accurate monitoring of DBF phenology.

TI  - Synergistic use of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 in predicting forest variables
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest variables measurement is indispensable to supervising the dynamic of forest carbon storage. As commonly quantified forest variables, canopy cover (CC), diameter at breast height (DBH), and tree height (TH) were the predicted objects in our study. Recently, remote sensing technology, with high efficiency and wide temporal and spatial coverage, has been extensively used in practice. However, integrating open access satellite resources Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat 8 (L8) to quantify forest CC, DBH, and TH has not been extensively examined in the literature. In this study, we explored the potential of individual satellite bands/indices and the integration of different sensors in predicting mean CC, mean DBH, and mean TH in the plots dominated by four tree species (total area 102,887.6 ha). We acquired the satellite patterns of S1, S2, and L8 covered our research plots in 2017, and extracted the mean pixel values of the spectral images for every plot we detected. Specifically, seven sets of features derived from the satellite images of S1, S2, and L8 were used to predict CC, DBH, and TH for the survey plots. The results mainly indicated that group S2 + L8 (RMSEr (the relative root mean square error) = 17.9%, 21.0%, 23.0%) or S2 + L8 + S1 (RMSEr = 17. 8%, 21.0%, 23.1%) achieved the best accuracy for CC, DBH, and TH of all plots. Additionally, group S2 + L8 outperformed the other groups within two sensors and was superior to the individual sensors. Adding S1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR, the sensor carried by S1) had no evident improvement or deviation for most models, nevertheless, numerous bands/indices of SAR occupied important positions in variable importance and were been selected by stepwise regression, which denoted that it is available and valuable for forest parameters of some dominant tree species. Moreover, shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands played a crucial role in the three forest parameters prediction during the rainy season. SWIR bands (RMSEr = 20.5%), NIR bands (RMSEr = 24.1%), and red-edge bands (RMSEr = 27.1%) exerted the most significant implication for predicting CC, DBH, and TH apiece as univariate models. Green bands and NIR also occupied more positions of higher variable importance in multivariate models for estimating DBH and TH, while SWIR took up more for CC in all dominant species. Furthermore, non-parametric models outperformed the parametric model on the whole. In the meanwhile, the best models also were influenced by the data analysis methods.In a nutshell, a combination of multiple satellite sensors was proposed for forest variable selection, especially different optical sensors. SAR data were also inspired to be pitched in related forest measurement work, but it requires some data processing before applying to the research in many cases.

TI  - Methane emissions are predominantly responsible for record-breaking atmospheric methane growth rates in 2020 and 2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global atmospheric methane growth rates reported by NOAA for 2020 and 2021 are the largest since systematic measurements began in 1983. To explore the underlying reasons for these anomalous growth rates, we use newly available methane data from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to estimate methane surface emissions. Relative to baseline values in 2019, we find that a significant global increase in methane emissions of 27.0 +/- 11.3 and 20.8 +/- 11.4 Tg is needed to reproduce observed atmospheric methane in 2020 and 2021, respectively, assuming fixed climatological values for OH. We see the largest annual increases in methane emissions during 2020 over Eastern Africa (14 +/- 3 Tg), tropical Asia (3 +/- 4 Tg), tropical South America (5 +/- 4 Tg), and temperate Eurasia (3 +/- 3 Tg), and the largest reductions are observed over China (-6 +/- 3 Tg) and India (-2 +/- 3 Tg). We find comparable emission changes in 2021, relative to 2019, except for tropical and temperate South America where emissions increased by 9 +/- 4 and 4 +/- 3 Tg, respectively, and for temperate North America where emissions increased by 5 +/- 2 Tg. The elevated contributions we saw in 2020 over the western half of Africa (-5 +/- 3 Tg) are substantially reduced in 2021, compared to our 2019 baseline. We find statistically significant positive correlations between anomalies of tropical methane emissions and groundwater, consistent with recent studies that have highlighted a growing role for microbial sources over the tropics. Emission reductions over India and China are expected in 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdown but continued in 2021, which we do not currently understand. To investigate the role of reduced OH concentrations during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020 on the elevated atmospheric methane growth in 2020-2021, we extended our inversion state vector to include monthly scaling factors for OH concentrations over six latitude bands. During 2020, we find that tropospheric OH is reduced by 1.4 +/- 1.7 % relative to the corresponding 2019 baseline value. The corresponding revised global growth of a posteriori methane emissions in 2020 decreased by 34 % to 17.9 +/- 13.2 Tg, relative to the a posteriori value that we inferred using fixed climatological OH values, consistent with sensitivity tests using the OH climatology inversion using reduced values for OH. The counter statement is that 66 % of the global increase in atmospheric methane during 2020 was due to increased emissions, particularly from tropical regions. Regional flux differences between the joint methane-OH inversion and the OH climatology inversion in 2020 are typically much smaller than 10 %. We find that OH is reduced by a much smaller amount during 2021 than in 2020, representing about 10 % of the growth of atmospheric methane in that year. Therefore, we conclude that most of the observed increase in atmospheric methane during 2020 and 2021 is due to increased emissions, with a significant contribution from reduced levels of OH.

TI  - Groundwater Prospecting Using a Multi-Technique Framework in the Lower Casas Grandes Basin, Chihuahua, Mexico
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a strategic resource for economic development, social justice, environmental sustainability, and water governance. The lower Casas Grandes River Basin, located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, is in a semi-arid region with increasing groundwater demand and regional challenges such as drought and depletion of aquifers. Even though there is official information about the availability of groundwater, a comprehensive aquifer characterization requiring an interdisciplinary investigation using a diverse suite of tools and multiple data sources has yet to be carried out. This study presents a multi-technique framework to evaluate potential sites to drill for groundwater resources and reduce the risk of unsuccessful drilling. The main components of the methodology include wellhead leveling correction with a differential global positioning survey to define piezometric levels, principal component analysis using LANDSAT-8 images, application of geospatial tools, geophysics analysis using time domain electromagnetic surveys (TDES) and vertical electric soundings (VES), and structural geohydrology to define aquifer characteristics. The results showed that using the proposed framework steps improved the possibility of identifying subsurface layers with lower resistivity values that could be related to groundwater. Low resistivity values (35 Ohm-m) were found at depths from 50 to 85 m at sites where the regional static water level reached a depth of 245 m, indicating the potential location of a shallow groundwater resource at a site where the intersection of a fracture trace was identified. This procedure can be used in other regions in the world where limited information is available for groundwater exploration, thus reducing the risk of drilling dry wells in complex hydrogeological environments.

TI  - Research on large area cloud forecasting method based on satellite cloud images
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud cover is an important issue for Earth observation satellite imaging. When the proportion of clouds in the remote sensing image is too high,or the specific target is not visible,the remote sensing image will be invalid. Earth observation satellites can choose among multiple observation targets based on cloud forecast information. For the application of Earth observation satellite mission planning, a large-area short-term cloud forecasting method was proposed. First, the cloud motion vector was obtained by the Farneback optical flow method. Subsequently, the predicted cloud image can be obtained by extrapolating the cloud motion vector. Meanwhile, the Laplace operator was introduced to depict the characterization of the diffusion phenomenon in the process of cloud movement. Utilizing the real cloud image sequence data of the FY -2 satellite, the diffusion factor can be optimized through the backpropagation algorithm of the neural network to improve the effect of cloud forecasting. Through the analysis of forecasting results, the introduced Laplace operator method can improve the accuracy of cloud forecasting. The error of the 80% quantile of cloud coverage is about 11.7%. The cloud cover forecasting with this level of accuracy can be used to guide the mission planning of Earth observation satellites.

TI  - A novel approach to assess the urban land-use efficiency of 767 resource-based cities in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - China is accelerating the transformation and development of resource-based cities. Urban land-use efficiency is crucial for assessing land output capacity and regional development quality. Measuring the land-use efficiency of resource-based cities and determining its main factors help improve land-use efficiency and promote the transformation of resource-based cities. However, previous urban land-use efficiency studies of multi-source data and its driving factors have been insufficient. Therefore, according to this study's inherent characteristics of urban land use efficiency, a feasible analysis framework is built using multi-source remote sensing data. Three indicators are proposed: urban construction land intensity, urban nighttime light intensity, and urban point of interest (POI) density. We developed the urban land-use efficiency index (ULEI) to explore the spatial pattern of urban land-use efficiency in resource-based cities. We applied the ternary phase diagram to identify critical factors in the three criteria. The results show that land-use efficiency is generally low in resource-based cities at the county scale. According to the ULEI, the top and bottom resource-based cities have significant agglomeration. The southwest region has higher land-use efficiency, while the northern region has the opposite. Meanwhile, there are significant differences in the urban land-use efficiency of resource-based cities in different growth stages. Growing cities have the highest land-use efficiency, while recessionary cities have the opposite. In addition, resource-based cities with higher land-use efficiency tend to be more balanced among the three criteria. Our results show the approach's effectiveness, which provides objective and precise spatial information for urban land use at the county scale for resource-based cities, leading to more informed decision-making.

TI  - Comparative Study on Remote Sensing Methods for Forest Height Mapping in Complex Mountainous Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is one of the critical parameters for carbon sink estimation. Although spaceborne lidar data can obtain relatively high precision canopy height on discrete light spots, to obtain continuous canopy height, the integration of optical remote sensing image data is required to achieve "from discrete to continuous" extrapolation based on different prediction models (parametric model and non-parametric model). This study focuses on the Shangri-La area and seeks to assess the practical applicability of two predictive models under complex mountainous conditions, using a combination of active and passive remote sensing data from ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2. The research aims to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of these models in addressing the unique challenges presented by mountainous terrain, including rugged topography, variable vegetation cover, and extreme weather conditions. Through this work, we hope to contribute to the development of improved geospatial prediction algorithms for mountainous regions worldwide. The results show the following: (1) the fitting effect of the selected parametric model (empirical function regression) is poor in the area of Quercus acutissima and Pinus yunnanensis; (2) evaluation of the importance of each explanatory variable in the non-parametric model (random forest regression) shows that topographic and meteorological factors play a dominant role in canopy height inversion; (3) when random forest regression is applied to the inversion of canopy height, there is often a problem of error accumulation, which is of particular concern to the Quercus acutissima and Pinus yunnanensis; (4) the random forest regression with the optimal features has relatively higher precision by comparing the inversion accuracy of canopy height data of the empirical function regression, random forest regression with all features, and random forest regression with the optimal features in the study area, i.e., R-2 (coefficient of determination) = 0.865 and RMSE (root mean square error) = 3.184 m. In contrast, the poor estimation results reflected by the empirical function regression, mainly resulting from the lack of consideration of topographic and meteorological factors, are not applicable to the inversion of canopy height under complex topographic conditions.

TI  - Research advances in imaging markers for predicting hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage: a narrative review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionStroke is a major global health concern and is ranked as the second leading cause of death worldwide, with the third highest incidence of disability. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke that is responsible for a significant proportion of stroke-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hematoma expansion (HE), which occurs in up to one-third of ICH patients, is a strong predictor of poor prognosis and can be potentially preventable if high-risk patients are identified early. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of previous research in this area and highlight the potential use of imaging markers for future research studies. Recent advancesImaging markers have been developed in recent years to aid in the early detection of HE and guide clinical decision-making. These markers have been found to be effective in predicting HE in ICH patients and include specific manifestations on Computed Tomography (CT) and CT Angiography (CTA), such as the spot sign, leakage sign, spot-tail sign, island sign, satellite sign, iodine sign, blend sign, swirl sign, black hole sign, and hypodensities. The use of imaging markers holds great promise for improving the management and outcomes of ICH patients. ConclusionThe management of ICH presents a significant challenge, and identifying high-risk patients for HE is crucial to improving outcomes. The use of imaging markers for HE prediction can aid in the rapid identification of such patients and may serve as potential targets for anti-HE therapies in the acute phase of ICH. Therefore, further research is needed to establish the reliability and validity of these markers in identifying high-risk patients and guiding appropriate treatment decisions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Afterslip following the 2014 Yutian Mw 6.9 Earthquake Using COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of early afterslip is essential for seismic hazard evaluation and determination of fault friction properties. In this study, we used early post-seismic COSMO-SkyMed (19 February 2014-08 April 2014) and long-term Sentinel-1 (16 October 2014-17 June 2020) observations from multiple platforms over different periods to create a rate decay model driven by post-seismic afterslip. The combined observations provide full coverage of the post-seismic deformation following the 2014 Yutian Mw 6.9 earthquake that occurred at the southwestern end of the Altyn Tagh Fault. The observation and modeling results showed that post-seismic deformation was characterized by left-lateral strike-slip movement with minor normal slip, which was consistent with that of co-seismic rupture. The maximum early afterslip (7-55 days) was as large as approximately 0.09 m with a depth of 7 km in the west of co-seismic rupture, and the maximum long-term afterslip was about 0.24 m. The simulated post-seismic deformation caused by poroelastic rebound and viscoelastic relaxation suggests that the afterslip mechanism controls the post-seismic deformation. The coupling pattern of the aftershock and afterslip indicates that the aftershock was mainly caused by the afterslip. The post-seismic spatiotemporal features of the 2014 Yutian earthquake have significant implications for analyzing seismic hazards at the southwestern end of the Altyn Tagh Fault.

TI  - Formalizing the Hidden Curriculum of Performance Enhancing Errors
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Surgical Education and Training (ICOSET)
CL  - Edinburgh, ENGLAND
AB  - Despite its inevitability, error remains an uncomfortable topic for discussion amongst surgeons. There are a range of reasons cited for this; significantly, there is an inextri-cable link between a surgeon's actions and their patient's outcomes. Attempts to reflect on error are often unstructured and without a defined end point, and modern surgical curricula lack content to guide resi-dents' learning on recognizing and reflecting on sentinel events. There is a need to develop a tool to guide a stan-dardized, safe, and constructive response to error.The current educational paradigm revolves around error avoidance. However, there is an evolving evidence base surrounding the inclusion of error management the-ory (EMT) into surgical training. This method explores and incorporates positive discussions surrounding errors, and has been demonstrated to improve long-term skill acquisition and training outcomes.We must harness the performance enhancing effects of our errors in the same way we do our successes. Implicated in all surgical performance is human factors science/ergonomics (HFE) -the interface between psy-chology, engineering, and performance. Developing a national HFE curriculum in the context of EMT would provide a common language to facilitate objective reflec-tions regarding surgeons' operative performance and manage the stigma associated with fallibility.

TI  - Use of imaging prediction model for omission of axillary surgery in early-stage breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeTo develop a prediction model incorporating clinicopathological information, US, and MRI to diagnose axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis with acceptable false negative rate (FNR) in patients with early stage, clinically node-negative breast cancers.MethodsIn this single center retrospective study, the inclusion criteria comprised women with clinical T1 or T2 and N0 breast cancers who underwent preoperative US and MRI between January 2017 and July 2018. Patients were temporally divided into the development and validation cohorts. Clinicopathological information, US, and MRI findings were collected. Two prediction models (US model and combined US and MRI model) were created using logistic regression analysis from the development cohort. FNRs of the two models were compared using the McNemar test.ResultsA total of 964 women comprised the development (603 women, 54 +/- 11 years) and validation (361 women, 53 +/- 10 years) cohorts with 107 (18%) and 77 (21%) axillary LN metastases in each cohort, respectively. The US model consisted of tumor size and morphology of LN on US. The combined US and MRI model consisted of asymmetry of LN number, long diameter of LN, tumor type, and multiplicity of breast cancers on MRI, in addition to tumor size and morphology of LN on US. The combined model showed significantly lower FNR than the US model in both development (5% vs. 32%, P < .001) and validation (9% vs. 35%, P < .001) cohorts.ConclusionOur prediction model combining US and MRI characteristics of index cancer and LN lowered FNR compared to using US alone, and could potentially lead to avoid unnecessary SLNB in early stage, clinically node-negative breast cancers.

TI  - Validation of NASA Sea Surface Temperature Satellite Products Using Saildrone Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is at the core of many processes in the oceans. Various remote sensing platforms have been used to obtain SST products of different scales, but their validation remains a topic of ongoing research. One promising platform is an uncrewed surface vehicle called Saildrone. We use the data from eight Saildrone deployments of the USA West Coast 2019 campaign to validate MODIS level-2 and Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) level-4 satellite SST products at 1 km spatial resolution and to assess the robustness of the quality levels of MODIS level-2 products over the California Coast. Pixel-based SST comparisons between Saildrone and the satellite products were performed, as well as thermal gradient comparisons computed both at the pixel-base level and using kriging interpolation. The results generally showed better accuracies for the MUR products. The characterization of the MODIS quality level proved to be valid in areas covered by bad-quality MODIS pixels but less valid in areas covered by lower-quality pixels. The latter implies possible errors in the MODIS quality level characterization and MUR interpolation processes. We have demonstrated the ability of the Saildrones to accurately validate near-shore satellite SST products and provide important information for the quality assessment of satellite products.

TI  - Landsat 8 land surface temperature product validation and analysis
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal band of Landsat series satellites has a spatial resolution of 60-120 m, which plays an important role in various environmental monitoring. With the release of land surface temperature (LST) product of Landsat series satellites worldwide, the validation work also begins. However, there is still a lack of validation for long time series. Taking the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin as the study area, the Landsat 8 LST product with 31 clear and cloudless scene images from 2013 to 2016 were verified and analyzed by using the ground measured data observed by the three weather stations of Wetland Station (SD), Gobi Station (GB) and Daman Super Station (CJZ), and the Landsat 8 LST product was compared with the widely used single-channel algorithm (JMS) inversion results. The validation results show that the accuracy of both the Landsat 8 LST product and the JMS inversion results arc high,and R2 at each site is better than 0. 919. Based on the analysis of all sites,the accuracy of Landsat 8 LST product is slightly higher than the JMS.

TI  - Maori realities, intimacies, and sexual expressions: reconceptualising consent to uphold kaumatua mana in aged residential care
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly, kaumatua (Maori elders) in Aotearoa (New Zealand) live apart from whanau (Maori extended family) in residential care, where policies are shaped by post-colonial legislation and ethical principles that privilege individual rights over Indigenous priorities and rights. The communal context of residential care has created late-life opportunity for intimacy and sexual expression with new partners. These issues are addressed in the international literature, highlighting the benefits and complexities. Literature report there may be clashes between resident and family members' wishes, and tensions around privacy and consent. This article considers survey data and semi-structured interviews with kaimahi (Maori care workers) and a kaumatua who were part of a larger study of staff, residents, and family in the residential aged care context. Post-colonial individualistic rights-based approaches do not necessarily fit with a Maori worldview. A Maori-led articulation of consent is essential to uphold the mana (authority, influence, power) of kaumatua and whanau.

TI  - An object-based image analysis approach for comparing tree detection from satellite imagery at different scales; A case study in Sukumba Mali
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper combines an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, with markov-random field based-super resolution mapping (MRF-SRM) technique to extract individual tree objects from satellite imagery. Extraction of individual trees in urban and developing cities using satellite im-ageries has been quite challenging and a subject of active research with many approaches to it. The study area is a part of Sukumba village located in Koutiala district, Mali. The aim is to evalu-ate the performance comparison of the combined MRF-SRM approach, which was demonstrated for each combination of scale factor and class separability. Due to varying contrast sensitivity, there exist a general limitation in the spatial distribution of land cover data sets derived from most coarse and fine resolution satellite imageries. A 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 and 2 m spatial resolution Worldview-3 satellite images were used for the study. First, the pixel based MRF-SRM classification technique of Tolpekin and Stein, 2009 was applied on both images. Sub-sequently, the classified SRM thematic results were partitioned into objects (segments) using re-gion growing segmentation algorithm as post a classification procedure. Finally, validation and comparison of the resulting tree objects was done using an object based image analysis approach to determine existential (TP), extensional (FP) and positional (PA) accuracy. For Sentinel-2 image and out of 1787 reference objects, 1214 (TP) was detected and 573 (FP) was undetected. The PA is 6.504 m out of 10 m, total detection error is 0.467 m and the final detection accuracy is 68%. Similarly, for Worldview-3 image and out of 1787 reference objects, 1772 (TP) was detected and 15 (FP) was undetected. The PA is 1.714 m out of 2 m, total detection error is 0.318 m and the fi-nal detection accuracy is 99%. The successful approach used in this study will support the capac-ity of monitoring agricultural change in data sparse regions and developing countries.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to comprehensively and accurately evaluate the adsorption effect of Eichhornia crassipes planting on algae in water, this study used 131 cloudless Sentinel-2 images to monitor the scale and growth dynamics of Eichhornia crassipes planting in Caohai and its surrounding waters. Based on the single and multi-peak histogram characteristics of the NDWI image in the study area, the empirical threshold and the optimized histogram slope adaptive threshold (OHSAT) segmentation methods were respectively used and manual inspection was added to accurately segment the water bodies and Eichhornia crassipes. The results of the analysis of Eichhornia crassipes area, growth status (NDVI), water body algae density (NDVI), and their spatial-temporal co-variation and trends show that the Eichhornia crassipes has a significant enrichment effect on algae, showing a significant decreasing trend of water bloom centered on it. The size and growth status of Eichhornia crassipes are inversely proportional to the water body NDVI, and reasonable harvesting plans based on these findings are expected to achieve optimized pollution control effects.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability of Upwelling in the West-Central South China Sea and Its Relationship with the Wind Field
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationSustainable Development and Conservation of Marine Environment and Fisheries Resources in the Central and Western South China Sea.The west-central South China Sea upwelling event is a critical process that regulates the climate and marine ecosystem in the region. In this study, we used sea surface temperature (SST) satellite data from 2000 to 2018 to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of upwelling in the west-central South China Sea and combined the wind field data to investigate the effects of wind direction and speed on upwelling. We divided the upwelling sea area into three regions based on the different shoreline angles along the eastern coast of the South China Peninsula: OU_1, OU_2, and OU_3. Our results showed that the upwelling events occurred mainly from May to September in the OU_1 and OU_2 waters. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of the monthly mean SST moment level field indicated a cyclical interannual variation of upwelling in the west-central South China Sea. The correlation analysis showed that wind direction changes have a significant impact on the upwelling intensity center, with the upwelling intensity center moving towards high latitudes and away from the coast when the wind direction changes from north to east. When the wind direction changes from east to south, the upwelling intensity center moves towards low latitudes and near the coast. The average lag time of upwelling events to the wind field in the central and western South China Sea was 38.9 h, with OU_2 showing a longer response time than the other seas. Our study provides important insights into the mechanisms governing upwelling in the west-central South China Sea, which can effectively promote the rational use of ecological resources and provide a scientific basis for marine ecological protection in the region.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this study, an attempt has been made using rainfall, LST, and NDVI combination of LSNR model which is used to infer drought condition in different monsoon period and to predict the seasonal changes of drought condition. The Indian monsoon pattern with different seasonal changes has been studied for the year 2009 to 2013 using optical and passive remote sensing data, and cross correlation with different time lag is carried out. The cross correlation between LST and NDVI time-lag deviation responses describe that May month LST having influence with September NDVI (90 days before onset) in other words 2-3 months. The correlation performed with a combination of rainfall and NDVI are not at significant level. The passive Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture data also clearly examined the drought and normal years, as the soil moisture is highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature to assess drought condition. The relationship between Tropical Rainfall Meteorological Mission (TRMM) rainfall records is compared with observed Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) datasets for the same time period to confirm the drought severity. This will help in being prepared for the drought condition well before it actually sets in and is useful for planner in agricultural operations.

TI  - Satellite fault detection method based on time-series modeling
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A kind of satellite fault detection method was introduced to handle the problems of relying on rule database, insufficient multi parameter fusion and unbalanced distribution of data samples in satellite fault detection. The semi supervised model was constructed based on time-series characteristics of satellite data and was proposed to achieve effective excavation of satellite data rules and data driven fault detection. Considering the temporal correlation between satellite data,this kind of fault detection method was proposed based on long short-term memory network. Also, a sliding window mechanism was involved for better predicting and detecting efficiency. Considering the correlation between multiple parameters as another dimension, temporal convolutional network(TCN) and auto-encoder network were used to excavate the correlation between historical data and different parameters at the same time. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to traditional fault detection models such as BP neural network in key indicators.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Risk Analysis of Land Use in the Coastal Zone of the Yangtze River Delta Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive accumulation of big data, along with the development of a high-performance platform, bridge the gap between the previous inability to provide long-term time series and broad-scale coastal zone monitoring and risk warnings with remote sensing techniques. Based on 20 years of Landsat images from the Google Earth Engine platform, the time series land cover in the coastal zone of the Yangtze River Delta in China was classified. Then, a spatiotemporal clustering method based on grid segmentation was proposed to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution details of artificial surface expansion and the risks of cropland loss and ecological degradation caused by this. The results showed that significant changes have taken place in the quantitative structure and spatial morphology of coastal land use in the past 20 years. The artificial surface maintained a growth trend, increasing by 229%, while cropland decreased by 19%. Natural land showed a fluctuation pattern of "up -> down -> up". The spatiotemporal details of land use obtained through 1km grid segmentation and clustering analysis were more significant. The artificial surface mainly underwent a progressive spatial expansion along the central urban area and important transportation axes (types III and IV), with the most dramatic changes occurring from 2010 to 2013. Type III cropland loss was the most significant, falling from 75.02% in 2000 to 38.23% in 2020. At the same time, the change in type III water body corresponds to the newly increased area of reclamation, which has decreased by 17% in the past 20 years, indicating that the degradation of coastal natural wetlands was significant. This paper provided a comprehensive diagnosis of coastal land use change, which could help policy makers and implementers to propose more targeted and differentiated coastal development and protection policies.

TI  - A Twenty-Year Assessment of Spatiotemporal Variation of Surface Temperature in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A good understanding of the processes of land surface temperature (LST) change is important for assessing regional climate change. In the present study, we obtained the MODIS MOD11A2 LST products over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 2001 to 2020. In order to comprehensively assess the spatial and temporal variability of LST in the YRD region over the past two decades, the Theil-Sen Median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test, BFAST01 trend decomposition, and landscape pattern analysis were used in this study. We show that the rate of linear change in LST in the YRD ranges from -0.019 degrees C/month to 0.046 degrees C/month. The BFAST01 trend decomposition identifies more details of LST change and monotonic increases, reversal increase, and interruption increase are the main warming trends. The distribution of the different trend types shows strong aggregation with high spatial heterogeneity. The LST breakpoints are mainly located in the northern and southern YRD, which frequently occurred during 2010-2013. Of the various land types, breakpoints occur most frequently in cropland and high NDVI (0.5-0.7) areas, and the intensity of most of them is within 2 degrees C. In addition, much stronger warming occurs in urban areas than in other land types. Our study provides a better understanding of the dynamics of LST in the YRD region over the past 20 years and highlights that breakpoints cannot be circumvented in regional temperature assessment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of long-term surface and vertical suspended particulate matter in the Liaohe estuary, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The estuary and its nearshore waters are of great ecological value. As one of the important water quality eval-uation indicators, suspended particulate matter (SPM) is also relevant to the ecology of the estuary. However, the current research on SPM of surface water is quite well established. It is urgent to study the vertical distribution of SPM due to its significance for further studies of biogeochemical processes in the water column. This study developed remote estimation model of SPM for five different depth water layers in the Liaohe estuary based on in situ Rrs(lambda) data and support vector regression (SVR) methods, and the model performed well (RMSE = 24.32 mg/ L, MAPE = 26.11%, MAE = 18.37 mg/L, N = 115). After applying the model to 10,090 MODIS images collected in 2000-2021, results show that: (1) Vertical distribution of SPM concentration in the Liaohe estuary could be divided into three types: top-down decreasing type (Type I), uniform type (Type II) and top-down increasing type (Type III). (2) Seasonal distribution of SPM concentration in the Liaohe estuary is: medium in spring (76.30 +/- 10.34 mg/L), low in summer (61.80 +/- 6.98 mg/L) and high in autumn (82.28 +/- 19.12 mg/L). There is a sig-nificant decreasing trend of SPM from 2000 to 2021 (p < 0.01). (3) Meteorological factors (wind speed and precipitation), water depth, human reforestation and reclamation activities are closely related to SPM concentration.

TI  - Long-term effects of rewetting and drought on GPP in a temperate peatland based on satellite remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rewetting previously drained peatlands restores the critical function of peatlands as long-term carbon storages and sinks currently threatened by climate change and additional human-induced disturbances. Understanding and projecting the restoration process by rewetting, however, currently face a pressing challenge, the lack of consistent and gap-free records of important carbon cycling indicators of peatlands such as the gross primary production (GPP) over long term. In this study, we reconstructed the GPP in a rewetted peatland called Zarnekow (Fluxnet-ID: DE-Zrk) in Germany from 2000 to 2020 by combining long-term satellite observations and limited-term tower-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements based on Random Forest regression models. The R2 between the reconstructed data and EC data was 0.6. The reasonable reconstruction of long-term GPP enabled trend analysis that identified two distinct periods of decreasing/increasing in GPP due to rewetting and droughts. Rewetting in the winter of 2004 and 2005 stabilized GPP after a decreasing period. A drought in 2018 significantly increased GPP, and GPP re-mained high over the following two years. Furthermore, the month-specific trends show significant seasonality at this site, specifically, an increasing trend over the 21 years in the growing-season months of June to August and a decreas-ing trend in the other months. The most important variables for satellite-based estimates of GPP at this site include total evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index and near-infrared reflectance vegetation index. Long-term analyses of carbon fluxes through the combination of satellite observations and EC measurements provide crucial insights into the restoration of carbon sequestration functions in rewetted peatlands.

TI  - Combining deep learning methods and multi-resolution analysis for drought forecasting modeling
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach for drought forecasting based on combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Resolution Analysis Wavelet Transform (MRA-WT), called MRA-WT-LSTM. In fact, Deep Learning (DL) methods provided an outstanding performance in several forecasting fields, especially drought. LSTM has proved a high ability in dealing with time-series drought indices compared to the others existing methods. Therefore, in this study LSTM was used to provide long-term drought forecasts. However, the non-stationarity of the drought indices is a major challenge that needs to be taken into consideration. In this regard, MRA-WT was applied to analyze the non-stationary time-series drought indices. Experiments were carried out in the Sarab region, Iran in the period between 1988-2016 in order to predict the standardized precipitation Evaporation index (SPEI). Drought is the most natural hazards in Sarab region that affect the socioeconomic development. The input data include the station data (i.e. rainfall, temperature (mean, minimum, and maximum), humidity, pressure, and Evaporation) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat images. Through the experiment, the proposed methodology is evaluated compared to three ML methods (i.e. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR)) and LSTM. The different models were compared in terms of statistical metrics such as the coefficient of determination ( R-2 ), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Results revealed the effectiveness of MRA-WT-LSTM for drought forecasting with R-2 up to 0,93 and RMSE reached 0,02 for the different time lags.

TI  - Sub-basins prioritization based on morphometric analysis and geographic information systems: a case study of the Barada river basin, Damascus countryside governorate, Syria
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-basins prioritization is considered an essential procedure in ecosystem management and planning on watershed scales. Integrating morphometric parameters and remote-sensing data (RS) in a geographic information system (GIS) environment provides an advanced platform that effectively investigates sub-basins prioritization. In the current study, prioritization in eight sub-basins belonging to the Barada river basin was investigated by utilizing morphometric assessment in order to comprehensively specify the sub-basins prioritization for conservation strategies. The final map evaluates sub-basins prioritization classes: low, moderate, high, and very high. The results also determines the SB8, SB4, SB3, SB7 and SB6 sub-basins have the highest prioritization, which, in turn, refers to the urgent need conserving measures. Totally, the spatial outcomes of the present study constructively proved the efficiency of extracted morphometric layers from RS-data in regard to the spatial evaluation of prioritization in the Barada river basin; they also include an important tool for post-war environmental rehabilitation in river basins in Syria.

TI  - Mapping and evaluating sustainable and unsustainable urban areas for ecological management towards achieving low-carbon city: an empirical study of Asir Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation can cause a variety of environmental and health issues, which has prompted experts to evaluate degraded areas and develop management strategies aimed at promoting urban sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. In low-carbon cities, sustainable urban areas have low carbon emission and prioritised carbon reduction by implementing sustainable transportation, green infrastructure, and energy-efficient buildings. On the other hand, unsustainable urban areas tend to lack these priorities and rely heavily on non-renewable energy sources and have high carbon emission. Therefore, this study aims to identify the most sustainable and unsustainable regions in the Abha-Khamis Mushayet Twin City region of Saudi Arabia in respect to urbanisation and carbon emission during the period between 1990 and 2020. To do so, we used Landsat datasets to create land use land cover (LULC) maps and then calculated carbon storage, emission, and absorption using InVest software. Additionally, the study examined micro-climatic conditions by calculating the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which allowed determining sustainable and unsustainable regions by comparing the UHI model and carbon similarity and mismatch model using coupling coordination degree model (CCDM). The study found that during the last three decades, the LULC pattern of the region underwent significant alterations, resulting in a substantial decline in carbon storage from 710,425 Mg C/hm(2) in 1990 to approximately 527,012.9 Mg C/hm(2) in 2020. Conversely, carbon emissions were observed to be very high in areas with high built-up density, with emission levels exceeding 20 tons per annum. Whilst the areas of excess carbon have decreased significantly, the areas of excess carbon emission have increased over time, resulting in the UHI effect due to high greenhouse gases. By comparing the UHI and carbon similarity and mismatch model, the researchers found that over 280 km(2) of the study area is unsustainable and has increased since 1990. In contrast, only about 410 km(2) of the study area is currently sustainable. To promote sustainability, the study recommends several strategies such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage; green infrastructure; and the use of renewable energy to manage carbon emissions.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (BBIBP-CorV) among Healthcare Workers: A Seven-Month Follow-Up Study at Fifteen Central Hospitals
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During a pandemic, healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting COVID-19. To protect these important individuals, it is highly recommended that they receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Our study focused on evaluating the safety and efficacy of Egypt's first approved vaccine, the Sinopharm vaccine (BBIBP-CorV), and comparing these findings with other vaccines. Methods: An observational study was conducted in fifteen triage and isolation hospitals, from the 1st of March until the end of September 2021. The study included fully vaccinated and unvaccinated participants, and we measured vaccine effectiveness (using 1-aHR), the incidence rate of severely to critically ill hospitalized cases, COVID-19-related work absenteeism, and the safety of the vaccine as outcomes. Results: Of the 1364 healthcare workers who were interviewed, 1228 agreed to participate. After taking the hazard ratio into account, the vaccine effectiveness was found to be 67% (95% CI, 80-43%) for symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases. The incidence rate ratio for hospitalization was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.15-1.31) in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group, and there was a significant reduction in absenteeism among the vaccinated group (p < 0.007). Most adverse events were mild and well tolerated. Vaccinated pregnant and lactating mothers did not experience any sentinel adverse events. Conclusion: Our study found that the BBIBP-CorV vaccine was effective in protecting healthcare workers from COVID-19.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-instrumental analysis of the meridional ionospheric response is presented over Europe during the two largest ICME-driven geomagnetic storms of solar cycle #24 maximum. Data from 5 European digisonde stations, ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System, Total Electron Content (GNSS TEC), the ratio of the TEC difference (rTEC), as well as Swarm and Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite observations have been used for the investigation of selected intervals (11-17 November, 2012, and 16-25 March, 2015). The storm evolution is monitored by digisonde foF2 critical frequency (related to the maximum electron density of F2-layer) and GNSS TEC data. Moreover, Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) measurements from the TIMED satellite are used to investigate the changes in the thermospheric O/N-2 ratio. Our main focus was on the main phase of the geomagnetic storms, when during the nighttime hours extremely depleted plasma was detected. The extreme depletion is observed in foF2, TEC and rTEC, which is found to be directly connected to the equatorward motion of the midlatitude ionospheric trough (MIT) on the nightside. We demonstrate a method (beside the existing ones) which allows the monitoring of the storm-time evolution of the disturbances (e.g., MIT, SAPS, SED) in the thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere system by the combined analysis of the worldwide digisonde system data (with the drift measurements and the ionospheric layer parameters with 5-15 min cadence), with rTEC and GNSS TEC data, and with the satellite data like Swarm, TIMED/GUVI.

TI  - A Biocratic Paradigm: Exploring the Complexity of Trauma-Informed Leadership and <i>Creating Presence</i>™
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A paradigm shift is under way in the human services because of breakthrough knowledge and research in understanding the underlying etiology of physical, emotional, and social problems at the micro-level of the individual, at the meso-level of the family and institutions, and at the macro-level of the entire society. The three levels of human existence-micro, mezzo, and macro-constitute interactive, interdependent, complex adaptive living systems. The complexity of these problems requires us to use our imaginations to envision health in individuals, organizations, and societies because it does not presently exist. After thousands of years of unrelenting exposure to trauma and adversity, we have all normalized what is a traumatogenic civilization. As a result, we live in a trauma-organized society in ways we are just beginning to understand in this century. This biopsychosocial knowledge base that is drawn upon here has come to be known as "trauma-informed" knowledge because it began with a deepening understanding of the impact of trauma on survivors of combat, disasters, and genocide, but now extends far beyond those specific boundaries. To lead any organization in a time of significant change means leading a revolution in understanding human nature and the fundamental causes of human pathology that are endangering all life on this planet and then helping organizational members develop skills to positively influence the changes necessary. In the 1930s, Dr. Walter B. Cannon, a Harvard physiologist who had named the "fight-flight" response and defined homeostasis, used the word "biocracy" to describe the relationship between the physical body and the social body, emphasizing the vital importance of democracy. This paper is a beginning attempt at integrating the concept of a biocratic organization with that of the trauma-informed knowledge necessary for leadership. Hope lies in properly diagnosing the problem, remembering ancient peace-making strategies, embracing universal life-preserving values, inspiring a new vision for the future, and radically and consciously changing our present self and other-destructive behavior. The paper concludes with a brief description of a new online educational program called Creating Presence (TM) that is being used in organizations as a method for creating and supporting the development of biocratic, trauma-informed organizations.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Large scale biomass burning like forest fires and crop residue burning can significantly impact the physical environment, including land cover, land use, ecology, habitats, and climate change. We investigated the effect of fire counts on surface Black Carbon mass concentration (BCC) and Tropospheric Columnar NO2 (TCN) over the North Eastern Region (NER) of India in the domain: 20 degrees N-30 degrees N and 88 degrees E-98 degrees E for 15 years from 2006 to 2020 using MODIS, MERRA-2 and OMI data. Significant fire counts are recorded in January, February, March, and April. An average of 65,000 fire counts is recorded in March and April during the 15 years of study over the domain. TCN is high in Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland, followed by Assam, Tripura, and Meghalaya in March and April, which varies from 18.79 x 10(14) to 29.08 x 10(14) cm(-2) in March, 10.76 x 10(14)-15.81 x 10(14) cm(-2) in January and February, and 12.67 x 10(14)-14.2 x 10(14) cm(-2) in April. Spatially averaged BC varies from 1.80 to 2.76 mu g m(-3) in January and February and 1.82-2.36 mu g m(-3) in March. BCC is high in Mizoram, Tripura, Manipur, Nagaland, and Brahmaputra valley of Assam than in the rest of the NER.

TI  - Atmospheric distribution of HCN from satellite observations and 3-D model simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is an important tracer of biomass burning, but there are significant uncertainties in its atmospheric budget, especially its photochemical and ocean sinks. Here we use a tracer version of the TOMCAT global 3-D chemical transport model to investigate the physical and chemical processes driving the abundance of HCN in the troposphere and stratosphere over the period 2004-2016. The modelled HCN distribution is compared with version 4.1 of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) HCN satellite data, which provide profiles up to around 42 km, and with ground-based column measurements from the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The long-term ACE-FTS measurements reveal the strong enhancements in upper-tropospheric HCN due to large wildfire events in Indonesia in 2006 and 2015. Our 3-D model simulations confirm previous lower-altitude balloon comparisons that the currently recommended NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reaction rate coefficient of HCN with OH greatly overestimates the HCN loss. The use of the rate coefficient proposed by in combination with the HCN oxidation by O(D-1) gives good agreement between ACE-FTS observations and the model. Furthermore, the model photochemical loss terms show that the reduction in the HCN mixing ratio with height in the middle stratosphere is mainly driven by the O(1D) sink with only a small contribution from a reaction with OH. From comparisons of the model tracers with ground-based HCN observations we test the magnitude of the ocean sink in two different published schemes . We find that in our 3-D model the two schemes produce HCN abundances which are very different to the NDACC observations but in different directions. A model HCN tracer using the scheme overestimates the HCN concentration by almost a factor of 2, while a HCN tracer using the scheme underestimates the observations by about one-third. To obtain good agreement between the model and observations, we need to scale the magnitudes of the global ocean sinks by factors of 0.25 and 2 for the schemes of and , respectively. This work shows that the atmospheric photochemical sinks of HCN now appear well constrained but improvements are needed in parameterizing the major ocean uptake sink.

TI  - A Reference-Free Method for the Thematic Accuracy Estimation of Global Land Cover Products Based on the Triple Collocation Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land cover (GLC) data are an indispensable resource for understanding the relationship between human activities and the natural environment. Estimating their classification accuracy is significant for studying environmental change and sustainable development. With the rapid emergence of various GLC products, the lack of high-quality reference data poses a severe risk to traditional accuracy estimation methods, in which reference data are always required. Thus, meeting the needs of large-scale, fast evaluation for GLC products becomes challenging. The triple collocation approach (TCCA) is originally applied to assess classification accuracy in earthquake damage mapping when ground truth is unavailable. TCCA can provide unbiased accuracy estimation of three classification systems when their errors are conditionally independent. In this study, we extend the idea of TCCA and test its performance in the accuracy estimation of GLC data without ground reference data. Firstly, to generate two additional classification systems besides the original GLC data, a k-order neighbourhood is defined for each assessment unit (i.e., geographic tiles), and a local classification strategy is implemented to train two classifiers based on local samples and features from remote sensing images. Secondly, to reduce the uncertainty from complex classification schemes, the multi-class problem in GLC is transformed into multiple binary-class problems when estimating the accuracy of each land class. Building upon over 15 million sample points with remote sensing features retrieved from Google Earth Engine, we demonstrate the performance of our method on WorldCover 2020, and the experiment shows that screening reliable sample points during training local classifiers can significantly improve the overall estimation with a relative error of less than 4% at the continent level. This study proves the feasibility of estimating GLC accuracy using the existing land information and remote sensing data, reducing the demand for costly reference data in GLC assessment and enriching the assessment approaches for large-scale land cover data.

TI  - Linking disturbance history to current forest structure to assess the impact of disturbances in tropical dry forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests are widespread, harbour vast amounts of carbon and unique biodiversity, and underpin the livelihoods of millions. A variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances affect tropical dry forest canopy, yet our understanding of how these disturbances impact on forest structure and ecosystem functioning, and how forests develop after different disturbances, is partial. This translates into knowledge gaps regarding long-term outcomes of disturbances on forest structure as well as which of these outcomes signify recovery vs forest degradation. Here, we use a rich dataset of remotely-sensed, high-resolution forest indicators in a multilevel Bayesian regression framework to understand the effect of different disturbance agents (partial clearing, fire, logging, drought and riparian changes) on aboveground biomass, and woody cover in the Argentine Dry Chaco. Our models show that post-disturbance trajectories of forest structural indicators differ markedly among different disturbance agents. For example, riparian changes affected biomass most strongly but had the fastest recovery, whereas logging had a generally lower impact and mostly affected tree cover, but recovery was slow or never occurred. Importantly, even three decades after the disturbance event, woody cover and biomass exhibited higher values for natural disturbances compared to anthropogenic disturbances. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbances had slower recovery rates than natural disturbances. Overall, our approach shows the potential of remote-sensing indicators and space-for-time substitution to unravel the diverse vegetation response of different disturbance agents. Given the high and rising human pressure on dry forests in the Chaco and globally, our findings also show the long-lasting effects that anthropogenic disturbances have on these valuable forests.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging-radiomics in endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveEndometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecological tumor in developed countries. Clinicopathological factors and molecular subtypes are used to stratify the risk of recurrence and to tailor adjuvant treatment. The present study aimed to assess the role of radiomics analysis in pre-operatively predicting molecular or clinicopathological prognostic factors in patients with endometrial carcinoma. MethodsLiterature was searched for publications reporting radiomics analysis in assessing diagnostic performance of MRI for different outcomes. Diagnostic accuracy performance of risk prediction models was pooled using the metandi command in Stata. ResultsA search of MEDLINE (PubMed) resulted in 153 relevant articles. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 3608 patients. MRI showed pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.785 and 0.814, respectively, in predicting high-grade endometrial carcinoma, deep myometrial invasion (pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.743 and 0.816, respectively), lymphovascular space invasion (pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.656 and 0.753, respectively), and nodal metastasis (pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.831 and 0.736, respectively). ConclusionsPre-operative MRI-radiomics analyses in patients with endometrial carcinoma is a good predictor of tumor grading, deep myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, and nodal metastasis.

TI  - Vegetation restoration dominated the attenuated soil loss rate on the Loess Plateau, China over the last 50 years
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Loess Plateau has experienced large-scale land use changes in the past few decades. Understanding how land use change affects soil erosion is critical in the region's ecological construction and land management. In this study, the Beiluo River Basin in the core area of the Loess Plateau was selected to investigate the effects of land use changes on soil loss rates over the last 50 years. Results show that the land use has changed considerably, mainly reflected in the upper reaches. From 1970 to 2020, cropland in the upper reaches decreased by 54 %, directly leading to a 9.1-fold increase in forested land. Landsat-NDVI shows vegetation coverage increased from 21.1 % to 69.9 % over time. The Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) was used and confirmed to be satisfactory with a high coefficient of determination (R2, 0.89) and a strong Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (0.72), although an underestimation exists. The specific soil loss simulated in the upper reaches maintained a high rate of around 8,000 t.km(-2).yr(-1) from the 1970s to the 1990s, dramatically dropping to 3,058 t.km(-2).yr(-1) in the 2000s, then attenuated to 1,321 t.km(-2).yr(-1) in the 2020s. For the entire basin, soil loss rates dropped from 4,090 to 1,848 and 890 t.km(-2).yr(-1) from the 1970s to the 2000s and 2020s, respectively. Attribution analysis showed that the dominant factor of the change in soil loss rates in the 1980s and 1990s relative to the 1970s was the change in rainfall erosivity for the entire watershed. However, vegetation restoration rapidly converted to the dominant factor contributing 78.3 % to soil loss decrease in the 2000s. The shift is evident in each reach of the basin except the terrain-plain area with the majority of farmland. The findings are helpful for sustainable land use planning and socio-economic development on the Loess Plateau and in similar areas.

TI  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Model for Earthquake Spatial Probability Assessment in Arabian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among all the natural hazards, earthquake prediction is an arduous task. Although many studies have been published on earthquake hazard assessment (EHA), very few have been published on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in spatial probability assessment (SPA). There is a great deal of complexity observed in the SPA modeling process due to the involvement of seismological to geophysical factors. Recent studies have shown that the insertion of certain integrated factors such as ground shaking, seismic gap, and tectonic contacts in the AI model improves accuracy to a great extent. Because of the black-box nature of AI models, this paper explores the use of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model in SPA. This study aims to develop a hybrid Inception v3-ensemble extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model and shapely additive explanations (SHAP). The model would efficiently interpret and recognize factors' behavior and their weighted contribution. The work explains the specific factors responsible for and their importance in SPA. The earthquake inventory data were collected from the US Geological Survey (USGS) for the past 22 years ranging the magnitudes from 5 M-w and above. Landsat-8 satellite imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data were also incorporated in the analysis. Results revealed that the SHAP outputs align with the hybrid Inception v3-XGBoost model (87.9% accuracy) explanations, thus indicating the necessity to add new factors such as seismic gaps and tectonic contacts, where the absence of these factors makes the prediction model performs poorly. According to SHAP interpretations, peak ground accelerations (PGA), magnitude variation, seismic gap, and epicenter density are the most critical factors for SPA. The recent Turkey earthquakes (M-w 7.8, 7.5, and 6.7) due to the active east Anatolian fault validate the obtained AI-based earthquake SPA results. The conclusions drawn from the explainable algorithm depicted the importance of relevant, irrelevant, and new futuristic factors in AI-based SPA modeling.

TI  - Assessment of a New Solar Radiation Nowcasting Method Based on FY-4A Satellite Imagery, the McClear Model and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global warming effect has been accelerating rapidly and poses a threat to human survival and health. The top priority to solve this problem is to provide reliable renewable energy. To achieve this goal, it is important to provide fast and accurate solar radiation predictions based on limited observation data. In this study, a fast and accurate solar radiation nowcasting method is proposed by combining FY-4A satellite data and the McClear clear sky model under the condition of only radiation observation. The results show that the random forest (RF) performed better than the support vector regression (SVR) model and the reference model (Clim-Pers), with the smallest normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values (between 13.90% and 33.80%), smallest normalized mean absolute error (nMAE) values (between 7.50% and 24.77%), smallest normalized mean bias error (nMBE) values (between -1.17% and 0.7%) and highest R-2 values (between 0.76 and 0.95) under different time horizons. In addition, it can be summarized that remote sensing data can significantly improve the radiation forecasting performance and can effectively guarantee the stability of radiation predictions when the time horizon exceeds 60 min. Furthermore, to obtain the optimal operation efficiency, the prediction results were interpreted by introducing the latest SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. From the interpretation results, we selected the three key channels of an FY-4A and then made the model lightweight. Compared with the original input model, the new one predicted the results more rapidly. For instance, the lightweight parameter input model needed only 0.3084 s (compared to 0.5591 s for full parameter input) per single data point on average for the 10 min global solar radiation forecast in Yuzhong. Meanwhile, the prediction effect also remained stable and reliable. Overall, the new method showed its advantages in radiation prediction under the condition that only solar radiation observations were available. This is very important for radiation prediction in cities with scarce meteorological observation, and it can provide a reference for the location planning of photovoltaic power stations.

TI  - Eddy Detection in the Marginal Ice Zone with Sentinel-1 Data Using YOLOv5
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection and analysis of ocean eddies in the marginal ice zone via remote sensing is a very challenging task but of critical importance for scientific applications and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, as one of the first steps toward the automation of the eddy detection process, we investigated the potential of applying YOLOv5, a deep convolutional neural network architecture, to specifically collected and labeled high-resolution synthetic aperture radar data for a very dynamic area over the Fram Strait. Our approach involved fine-tuning pre-trained YOLOv5 models on a sparse dataset and achieved accurate results with minimal training data. The performances of the models were evaluated using several metrics, and the best model was selected by visual examination. The experimental results obtained from the validation and test datasets consistently demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the chosen model to identify submesoscale and mesoscale eddies with different structures. Moreover, our work provides a foundation for automated eddy detection in the marginal ice zone using synthetic aperture radar imagery and contributes to advancing oceanography research.

TI  - Decreased latency in landsat-derived land surface temperature products: A case for near-real-time evapotranspiration estimation in California
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring accurate measurements of crop consumptive water use in the form of evapotranspiration (ET) is increasingly important in California cropping systems as demands for water resources shift under a changing climate. Growers use various methods for estimating ET to guide irrigation management, some of which are based on satellite remote sensing. Although this approach has proven reliable, operational applications remain hindered by latency in satellite product delivery, due in part to computationally expensive atmospheric correction steps. This is particularly true in approaches that utilize thermal infrared (TIR) imagery, which is sensitive to atmospheric corrections. The current study evaluates two approaches to derive a pseudoatmospherically corrected Land Surface Temperature (LST) in near-real-time (NRT) for ingestion into the ALEXI-DisALEXI ET model. Evaluation is done for selected Landsat scenes over California for the year 2022. Both approaches take advantage of the Landsat Collection 2 dataset, including availability of atmospheric correction parameters and atmospherically corrected LST. The first approach is based on the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) and atmospheric correction parameters from previous overpass available in the Collection 2 dataset. The second is based on a random forest (RF) regression model, using Landsat Collection 2 atmospheric correction parameters and LST as input for training. Results indicate the RF approach outperforms the RTE approach, with an average mean absolute error of 0.6 K, compared to 2.0 K for the RTE method. The RTE method produces more spatial and temporal variability in LST due to temporal differences in atmospheric transmissivity. When used to estimate ET, we find little difference between NRT LST-based ET estimates and ET derived using the Collection 2 LST product, albeit RF-based ET provides less day-to-day variation. Results suggest promise in using such an approach to derive LST and subsequently ET in NRT, and toward improving daily water management and irrigation efficiency in the vineyard and orchard systems of California.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of the Sentinel Lymph Node Technique in Patients with Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The optimal limits of the bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) template in bladder cancer treatment remain controversial. This study aimed to investigate whether radio-guided sentinel node (SLN) detection is a reliable technique for the perioperative localisation of potential lymphatic metastasis during cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Materials and Methods: We studied 54 patients with pT2-pT4 MIBC who underwent cystectomy with extended PLND (ePLND) augmented by the SLN technique. The identification of SLN was performed by preoperative SPECT/CT hybrid lymphoscintigraphy using peritumoral injection of nanocolloid-Tc-99m, followed by intraoperative navigation with a handheld ?-probe. All nodal specimens were collected separately and then fixed in formalin, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and examined by an experienced uropathologist. Results: A total of 1414 LNs were resected and examined for the presence of metastases. The mean number of harvested LNs was 26 (range: 11-50) per patient. In 51 of 54 patients, 192 SLNs were resected. In addition, 20/192 (10.4%) SLNs were located outside of the ePLND area. Overall, 72 metastatic LNs (LN+) were found in 22 of 54 patients (40.7%) and in 24/192 SLNs (12.5%). The SLN technique detected LN+ in 14 of 22 (64%) patients. The SLNs were the only sites of metastasis (SLN+ = LN+) in 6 of 22 (27.3%) LN+ patients, including two cases with foci located in the pararectal region. The diagnostic values for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and false-negative rate for the SLN technique were 66.66%, 4.16%, 28.57%, and 33.33%, respectively. Extended lymphadenectomy and its combination with the SLN technique enabled the correct assessment in 96.3 and 100% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of ePLND and SLN provides a better pN assessment compared to ePLND alone. Although the SLN technique has restrictions that limit its diagnostic value, its use as an addition to lymphadenectomy allows for the visualisation of nonstandard lymph drainage pathways that may be potential metastatic routes.

TI  - Assessing lake water quality during COVID-19 era using geospatial techniques and artificial neural network model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality of a tropical lake ( East Kolkata Wetland or EKW, India) along with seasonal change using Landsat 8 and 9 images of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The research focuses on detecting, monitoring, and predicting water quality in the EKW region using eight parameters-normalized suspended material index (NSMI), suspended particular matter (SPM), total phosphorus (TP), electrical conductivity (EC), chlorophyll-alpha, floating algae index (FAI), turbidity, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and two water quality indices such as Carlson tropic state index (CTSI) and entropy-weighted water quality index (EWQI). The results demonstrate that SPM, turbidity, EC, TP, and SDD improved while the FAI and chlorophyll-alpha increased during the lockdown period due to the stagnation of water as well as a reduction in industrial and anthropogenic pollution. Moreover, the prediction of EWQI using an artificial neural network indicates that the overall water quality will improve more if the lockdown period is sustained for another 3 years. The outcomes of the study will help the stakeholders develop effective regulations and strategies for the timely restoration of lake water quality.

TI  - A ubiquitous method for predicting underground petroleum deposits based on satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The method of finding new petroleum deposits beneath the earth's surface is always challenging for having low accuracy while simultaneously being highly expensive. As a remedy, this paper presents a novel way to predict the locations of petroleum deposits. Here, we focus on a region of the Middle East, Iraq to be specific, and conduct a detailed study on predicting locations of petroleum deposits there based on our proposed method. To do so, we develop a new method of predicting the location of a new petroleum deposit based on publicly available data sensed by an open satellite named Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Using GRACE data, we calculate the gravity gradient tensor of the earth over the region of Iraq and its surroundings. We use this calculated data to predict the locations of prospective petroleum deposits over the region of Iraq. In the process of our study for making the predictions, we leverage machine learning, graph-based analysis, and our newly-proposed OR-nAND method altogether. Our incremental improvement in the proposed methodologies enables us to predict 25 out of 26 existing petroleum deposits within the area under our study. Additionally, our method shows some prospective petroleum deposits that need to be explored physically in the future. It is worth mentioning that, as our study presents a generalized approach (demonstrated through investigating multiple datasets), we can apply it anywhere in the world beyond the area focused on in this study as an experimental case.

TI  - The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio drives cellularization in the close animal relative Sphaeroforma arctica
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ratio of nuclear content to cytoplasmic volume (N/C ratio) is a key regulator driving the maternal-to -zy-gotic transition in most animal embryos. Altering this ratio often impacts zygotic genome activation and de-regulates the timing and outcome of embryogenesis.1-3 Despite being ubiquitous across animals, little is known about when the N/C ratio evolved to control multicellular development. Such capacity either origi-nated with the emergence of animal multicellularity or was co-opted from the mechanisms present in unicel-lular organisms.4 An effective strategy to tackle this question is to investigate the close relatives of animals exhibiting life cycles with transient multicellular stages.5 Among these are ichthyosporeans, a lineage of pro-tists undergoing coenocytic development followed by cellularization and cell release.6-8 During cellulariza-tion, a transient multicellular stage resembling animal epithelia is generated, offering a unique opportunity to examine whether the N/C ratio regulates multicellular development. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy to characterize how the N/C ratio affects the life cycle of the best-studied ichthyosporean model, Sphaero-forma arctica. We uncover that the last stages of cellularization coincide with a significant increase in the N/C ratio. Increasing the N/C ratio by reducing the coenocytic volume accelerates cellularization, whereas decreasing the N/C ratio by lowering the nuclear content halts it. Moreover, centrifugation and pharmacolog-ical inhibitor experiments suggest that the N/C ratio is locally sensed at the cortex and relies on phosphatase activity. Altogether, our results show that the N/C ratio drives cellularization in S. arctica, suggesting that its capacity to control multicellular development predates animal emergence.

TI  - GRACE Downscaler: A Framework to Develop and Evaluate Downscaling Models for GRACE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and managing groundwater resources is critical for sustaining livelihoods and supporting various human activities, including irrigation and drinking water supply. The most common method of monitoring groundwater is well water level measurements. These records can be difficult to collect and maintain, especially in countries with limited infrastructure and resources. However, long-term data collection is required to characterize and evaluate trends. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that uses data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and downscaling models to generate higher-resolution (1 km) groundwater predictions. The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing users to implement any machine learning model of interest. We selected four models: deep learning model, gradient tree boosting, multi-layer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors regressor. To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, we offer a case study of Sunflower County, Mississippi, using well data to validate the predictions. Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of groundwater resource management by demonstrating a framework using remote sensing data and machine learning techniques to improve monitoring and management of this critical resource, especially to those who seek a faster way to begin to use these datasets and applications.

TI  - Cross-sensor remote sensing imagery super-resolution via an edge-guided attention-based network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep learning based super-resolution (SR) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress in the reconstruction of ideally simulated high-quality remote sensing image datasets. However, due to the large variation in image quality caused by the complex degradation factors, their performance decreases dramatically on real-world images acquired by different satellite sensors. To this end, we propose a cross-sensor SR framework that consists of a cross-sensor degradation modeling strategy for bridging the gap between the images obtained by the source and target sensors, and an edge-guided attention-based SR (EGASR) network to promote the learning of high-frequency feature representation. Specifically, we build a degradation pool on the low-resolution (LR) target sensor to produce a degraded training dataset simulated from the high-resolution (HR) images ob-tained by the source sensor. Furthermore, the EGASR network, which employs the edge-guided residual attention block (EGRAB) to introduce implicit edge prior to enhance edge-related information, is embedded in the cross -sensor SR framework for reconstructing HR results with sharp details. The proposed method is applied on images from the Chinese Gaofen (GF) satellite sensors and compared to several representative SR methods. An ideally simulated GF-2 LR/HR image set with only downsampling considered is first used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EGASR network. Moreover, GF-2/GF-1 and GF-2/GF-6 cross-sensor SR datasets are constructed by synthesizing GF-2 degraded image pairs with the degradation pools estimated from the GF-1 and GF-6 images, respectively. The results show that: 1) the proposed EGASR model shows superiority in reconstructing textural details and edge features, and achieves the best results among the state-of-art SR methods involved in com-parison; 2) the cross-sensor SR framework significantly promotes the model's ability to super-resolve real-world LR images acquired by the target satellite sensors, e.g., the NIQE values are improved by at least 30% and 34% on average with respect to other comparative methods for GF-2/GF-1 and GF-2/GF-6 datasets in the real experi-ments, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation of eight band SuperDove imagery for aquatic applications
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Planet's SuperDove constellation is evaluated for remote sensing of water targets. SuperDoves are small satellites with on board eight band PlanetScope imagers that add four new bands compared to the previous generations of Doves. The Yellow (612 nm) and Red Edge (707 nm) bands are of particular interest to aquatic applications, for example in aiding the retrieval of pigment absorption. The dark spectrum fitting (DSF) algorithm is implemented in ACOLITE for processing of SuperDove data, and its outputs are compared to matchup data collected using an autonomous pan-and-tilt hyperspectral radiometer (PANTHYR) installed in the turbid waters of the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ). Results for 35 matchups from 32 unique SuperDove satellites indicate on average low differences with PANTHYR observations for the first seven bands (443-707 nm), with mean absolute relative differences (MARD) 15-20%. The mean average differences (MAD) are between -0.01 and 0 for the 492-666 nm bands, i.e. DSF results show a negative bias, while the Coastal Blue (444 nm) and Red Edge (707 nm) show a small positive bias (MAD 0.004 and 0.002). The NIR band (866 nm) shows a larger positive bias (MAD 0.01), and larger relative differences (MARD 60%). Root mean squared differences (RMSD) are rather flat at around 0.01 with peaks in the bands with highest water reflectance of around 0.015. The surface reflectance products as provided by Planet (PSR) show a similar average performance to DSF, with slightly larger and mostly positive biases, except in both Green bands, where the MAD is close to 0. MARD in the two Green bands is a bit lower for PSR (9.5-10.6%) compared to DSF (9.9-13.0%). Higher scatter is found for the PSR (RMSD 0.015-0.020), with some matchups showing large, spectrally mostly flat differences, likely due to the external aerosol optical depth (tau a) inputs not being representative for these particular images. Chlorophyll a absorption (aChl) is retrieved from PANTHYR measurements, and the PANTHYR data are used to calibrate aChl retrieval algorithms for SuperDove in the BCZ. Various Red band indices (RBI) and two neural networks are evaluated for aChl estimation. The best performing RBI algorithm, i.e. the Red band difference (RBD), showed a MARD of 34% for DSF and 25% for PSR with positive biases of 0.11 and 0.03 m-1 respectively for 24 PANTHYR aChl matchups. The difference in RBD performance between DSF and PSR can be largely explained by their respective average biases in the Red and Red Edge bands, which are opposite signs for DSF (negative bias in the red), and positive for both bands for PSR. Mapping of turbid water aChl and hence chlorophyll a concentration (C) using SuperDove is demonstrated for coastal bloom imagery, showing how SuperDove data can supplement monitoring programmes.

TI  - Remote Sensing Application in Pure Premium Rate-Making of Winter Wheat Crop Insurance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop insurance is a crucial way to avoid disaster losses and to guarantee farmers' basic production income in China and abroad. Securing agricultural production is a critical way to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty and an essential means to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. How to pay out more quickly and fairly after a disaster has become an urgent issue for agricultural insurance. The standard domestic crop insurance rate is determined based on the statistical data of the entire administrative unit and ignores the spatial risk difference of disasters inside the administrative unit. Therefore, obtaining a pure premium based on crops inside the administrative unit is a key problem. Based on remote sensing data and insurance actuarial models, we studied and determined the fair premium rates to insure winter wheat at the farmer level in Heze, Shandong, China. Our study shows that remote sensing data can provide data security for determining a pure premium rate at the level of individual farms, and provide the primary reference for determining farmer-level crop insurance premium rates. The use of remote sensing for determining those rates can improve the customization of crop insurance and reduce farmers' lower incomes due to exposure to natural disasters, improve farmers' resilience to risk, and prevent a return to poverty due to disasters, ultimately reaching the UN Sustainable Development goals of eradicating hunger and reducing poverty.

TI  - Water vapour products from ERA5, MERSI-II/FY-3D, OLCI/Sentinel-3A, OLCI/Sentinel-3B, MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra in Australia: A comparison against <i>in situ</i> GPS water vapour data
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia is a region of high sensitivity to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation events in association with atmospheric water vapour, which is an essential atmospheric parameter in hydrological cycle, energy transport and climate monitoring. In this article, we thoroughly validated the quality of multisource precipitable water vapour (PWV) products sourced from ERA5 reanalysis, advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II) sensor on the FY-3D satellite, Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensor on the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua and Terra satellites. The PWV estimates measured by 453 in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) sites from 1 June 2019 to 31 May 2020 over Australia were employed as the common reference. The validation results show that all the reanalysis-based and satellite-based PWV products had a good agreement with reference GPS-based PWV data. ERA5 reanalysis had the highest PWV accuracy with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.016 mm and a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 12.038%, while the MODIS/Terra instrument had the lowest PWV accuracy (RMSE = 4.903 mm and RRMSE = 34.187%). In contrast to the MERSI-II/FY-3D instrument that underestimated PWV, the PWV data from ERA5, OLCI/Sentinel-3A, OLCI/Sentinel-3B, MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra overestimated the water vapour values. The quality of reanalysis-based and satellite-based PWV measurements showed significant dependencies on several variables - location, PWV, solar zenith angle, season, elevation, land surface cover and latitude. It is expected that this research can help enhance the understanding of the quality of reanalysis and satellite water vapour products in Australia, that is, ERA5, OLCI/Sentinel-3A, OLCI/Sentinel-3B, MODIS/Aqua and MODIS/Terra. This work could provide an insight into improving the accuracy of reanalysis-based and satellite-based PWV data products after exploring the dependency factors that affect PWV performance as presented in our work.

TI  - Estimation of Quercus Biomass in Shangri-La Based on GEDI Spaceborne Lidar Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating forest biomass based on spaceborne lidar on a county scale is challenging due to the incomplete coverage of spaceborne lidar data. Therefore, this research aims to interpolate GEDI spots and explore the feasibility of approaches to improving Quercus forest biomass estimation accuracy in the alpine mountains of Yunnan Province, China. This paper uses GEDI data as the main information source and a typical mountainous area in Shangri-La, northwestern Yunnan Province, China, as the study area. Based on the pre-processing of light spots. A total of 38 parameters were extracted from the canopy and vertical profiles of 1307 light spots in the study area, and the polygon data of the whole study area were obtained from the light spot data through Kriging interpolation. Multiple linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest were used to establish biomass models. The results showed that the optimal model is selected using the semi-variance function for the Kriging interpolation of each parameter of GEDI spot, the optimal model of modis_nonvegetated is a linear model, and the optimal model for rv, sensitivity, and modis_treecover is the exponential model. Analysis of the correlation between 39 parameters extracted from GEDI L2B and three topographic factors with oak biomass showed that sensitivity had a highly significant positive correlation (p < 0.01) with Quercus biomass, followed by a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) with aspect and modis_nonvegation. After variable selection, the estimation model of Quercus biomass established using random forest had R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 19.76 t/hm(2), and the estimation accuracy was better than that of multiple linear regression and support vector regression. The estimated total biomass of Quercus in the study area was mainly distributed between 26.48 and 257.63 t/hm(2), with an average value of 114.33 t/hm(2) and a total biomass of about 1.26 x 10(7) t/hm(2). This study obtained spatial consecutive information using Kriging interpolation. It provided a new research direction for estimating other forest structural parameters using GEDI data.

TI  - Mapping Growing Stem Volume Using Dual-Polarization GaoFen-3 SAR Images in Evergreen Coniferous Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unaffected by cloud cover and solar illumination, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have great capability to map forest growing stem volume (GSV) in complex biophysical environments. Up to now, c-band dual-polarization Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images, acquired by the first Chinese civilian satellite equipped with multi-polarized modes, are rarely applied in mapping forest GSV. To evaluate the capability of dual-polarization GF-3 SAR images in mapping forest GSV, several proposed derived features were initially extracted by mathematical operations and applied to obtain optimal feature sets by different feature sorting methods and feature selection methods. Then, the maps of GSV in an evergreen coniferous forest were inverted by various machine learning algorithms and stacking ensemble learning methods with different strategies. The results implied that backscattering coefficients and partially proposed derived features showed high sensitivity to the forest GSV, and the saturation phenomenon also obviously occurred once the forest GSV was larger than 300 m(3)/ha. Furthermore, the results showed that the accuracy of the mapped GSV was significantly improved using the stacking ensemble learning methods. Using various optimal feature sets and base models (MLR, KNN, SVM, and RF), the rRMSE values mainly ranged from 30% to 40%. After using the stacking ensemble learning methods, the values of rRMSE ranged from 16.71% to 20.51%. This confirmed that dual-polarization GF-3 images have great potential to map forest GSV in evergreen coniferous forests.

TI  - Coastal Aquaculture Extraction Using GF-3 Fully Polarimetric SAR Imagery: A Framework Integrating UNet plus plus with Marker-Controlled Watershed Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal aquaculture monitoring is vital for sustainable offshore aquaculture management. However, the dense distribution and various sizes of aquacultures make it challenging to accurately extract the boundaries of aquaculture ponds. In this study, we develop a novel combined framework that integrates UNet++ with a marker-controlled watershed segmentation strategy to facilitate aquaculture boundary extraction from fully polarimetric GaoFen-3 SAR imagery. First, four polarimetric decomposition algorithms were applied to extract 13 polarimetric scattering features. Together with the nine other polarisation and texture features, a total of 22 polarimetric features were then extracted, among which four were optimised according to the separability index. Subsequently, to reduce the "adhesion" phenomenon and separate adjacent and even adhering ponds into individual aquaculture units, two UNet++ subnetworks were utilised to construct the marker and foreground functions, the results of which were then used in the marker-controlled watershed algorithm to obtain refined aquaculture results. A multiclass segmentation strategy that divides the intermediate markers into three categories (aquaculture, background and dikes) was applied to the marker function. In addition, a boundary patch refinement postprocessing strategy was applied to the two subnetworks to extract and repair the complex/error-prone boundaries of the aquaculture ponds, followed by a morphological operation that was conducted for label augmentation. An experimental investigation performed to extract individual aquacultures in the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands indicated that the crucial features for aquacultures are Shannon entropy (SE), the intensity component of SE (SE_I) and the corresponding mean texture features (Mean_SE and Mean_SE_I). When the optimal features were introduced, our proposed method performed better than standard UNet++ in aquaculture extraction, achieving improvements of 1.8%, 3.2%, 21.7% and 12.1% in F1, IoU, MR and insF1, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can handle the adhesion of both adjacent objects and unclear boundaries effectively and capture clear and refined aquaculture boundaries.

TI  - Impact of Fire on Secondary Forest Succession in a Sub-Tropical Landscape
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Hong Kong, as in many tropical areas, grasslands are maintained by fire on disturbed and abandoned land. However, Hong Kong's native forests are regenerating in many areas, alongside frequent burning of the hillsides, and are in different stages of structural succession to closed canopy forest patches. Understanding the major determinants of secondary succession is a vital input to forest management policies. Given the importance of forests for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon cycling. This study examines the relationship between burning regimes and structural forest succession over 42 years from 1973 to 2015, using an archive of satellite images, aerial photographs and field plot data. Overlay of a fire frequency map with maps of forest structural classes at different dates indicates the number of fires undergone by each successional class as well as the time taken to progress from one class to another under different fire regimes. Results indicate that the native sub-tropical evergreen forests, which are naturally fire intolerant, can regenerate alongside moderate burning, and once the shrub stage is reached, succession to closed forest is relatively rapid and can occur within 13 years. More than one burn, however, is more destructive, and twice-burnt areas were seen to have only one-third of the woody biomass of once-burnt plots. The most frequent fires occurred in areas where mono-cultural plantations had been destroyed by disease in the 1960s and were subsequently invaded by grasslands. These former plantation areas remained in early successional stages of grass and open shrubland by 2015. Other plantations from the 1970s and 1980s remain as plantations today and have acted as a barrier to natural forest succession, attesting to the greater effectiveness of fire control over re-afforestation measures.

TI  - Leveraging remotely sensed non-wall-to-wall data for wall-to-wall upscaling in forest inventory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) has enhanced forest inventory with model-based inference, that is, a family of statistical procedures rigorously estimates the parameter of a variable of interest (VOI) for a spatial population, e.g., the mean or total of forest carbon for a study area. Upscaling in earth observation, alias to this estimation, aggregates VOI from a finer spatial resolution to a coarser one with reduced uncertainty, serving decision making for natural resource management at larger scales. However, conventional model-based estimation (CMB) confronts a major challenge: it only supports RS wall-to-wall data, meaning that remotely sensed data must be available in panorama and non-wall-to-wall but quality data such as lidar or even cloud-masked satellite imagery are not supported due to incomplete coverage, impeding precise upscaling with cutting-edge instruments or for large scale applications. Consequently, this study aims to develop and demonstrate the use and usefulness of RS nonwall-to-wall data for upscaling with Hierarchical model-based estimation (HMB) which incorporates a two-stage model for bridging RS non- and wall-to-wall data; and for optimizing cost-efficiency, to evaluate the effects of non-wall-to-wall sample size on upscaling precision. Three main conclusions are relevant: (1) the HMB is a variant of the CMB estimator through trading in the uncertainty of the second-stage model to enable estimation using RS non-wall-to-wall data; (2) a quality first-stage model is key to exerting the advantage of HMB relative to the CMB estimator; (3) the variance of the HMB estimator is dominated by the first-stage model variance component, indicating that increasing the sample size in the first-stage is effective for increasing the overall precision. Overall, the HMB estimator balances tradeoffs between cost, efficiency and flexibility when devising a model-based upscaling in earth observation.

TI  - Soil moisture content-based analysis of terrestrial ecosystems in China: Water use efficiency of vegetation systems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a prerequisite for the formation of earth-biochemical-ecological systems. Differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources are important factors in the formation of differences in the distribution of vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems and are key to the differences in vegetation productivity. Vegetation water use efficiency is calculated by the total amount of fixed biogenic carbon per unit mass of water consumed in photosynthesis and can be used to assess the intensity and capacity of an ecosystem to use water biomass. Based on remote satellite sensing data, this study proposes a new water use efficiency assessment model. The model was validated using flux site data, and we analyzed the relative contribution of climate factors to soil moisture use efficiency using a first-difference method. The results revealed the following: (1) The soil moisture use efficiencies (SUE) of remote sensing data inversions that were evaluated using flux site data based on correlation coefficients and Nash coefficients showed high reliability, and only the NMG (Inner Mongolia) station showed low correlation among the nine sites. (2) Among the nine agricultural sub-regions in China, only the SUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region showed a decreasing trend (-1.08 g C/m- 2 kg H2O yr), while all other regions showed an increasing trend. (3) The highest vegetation soil moisture use efficiency (1.83 g C/m- 2 kg H2O) was found in ferralisols, while the lowest vegetation SUE (0.17 g C/m- 2 kg H2O) was found in arid soils. The SUE of different vegetation types showed the characteristics of forest > scrub > cultivated vegetation > wetland > grassland. (4) The relative contribution of gross primary productivity (GPP) to the change in SUE was 37.53%, while the relative contribution of soil moisture content to the change in SUE was -26.71%. Among the five climatic factors, temperature was the most dominant factor affecting the change in SUE, followed by precipitation, net radiation, leaf area index, and potential evapotranspiration. Revealing the relationship between terrestrial ecosystem GPP, soil moisture content, and their responses to climate factors is a prerequisite for understanding the adaptation strategies of regional terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change, which can help to inform decision-making for the sustainable development of ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of Snowmelt Impacts on Flood Flows Based on Remote Sensing Using SRM Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt is an important source of stream flows in mountainous areas. This study investigated the impact of snowmelt on flooding. First, the study area was divided into four zones based on elevation. Second, the Snow-Covered Area (SCA) from 2013 to 2018 was estimated from daily MODIS images with the help of Google Earth Engine. Runoff in the area was then simulated using the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM). As a result, short periods with high runoff and the possibility of floods were identified, while the contribution of snowmelt and rainfall in the total runoff was separated. The results showed that while the snowmelt on average accounted for only 23% of total runoff in the zone with elevation under 2000 m, the ratio increased with elevation, ultimately reaching as high as 87% in the zone with elevation above 3000 m. As the height increases, the effect of snow on runoff and flooding increases so much that it should not be ignored. However, in most hydrological studies, the effect of snow is ignored due to the lack of sufficient data about snow. This study showed that snow can be very effective, especially in high areas.

AB  - Total soil CO2 efflux (FCO2) is the second most important carbon flux after photosynthesis in boreal forests. However, accurate modelling of FCO2 remains challenging because of its high variability, both temporally and spatially. Using an Abies balsamea-dominated boreal landscape in Quebec (eastern Canada) as a case study, we modelled seasonal, intra-seasonal and spatial variability of FCO2 using climate variables and topographic and canopy structure attributes derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and assessed their respective contributions to soil CO2 emissions. Weekly point measurements of FCO2 at 99 sites were taken over an area of 122 ha between June and October 2020. The seasonal component of FCO2 was quantified and subtracted from FCO2 measurements to isolate the spatial and intra-seasonal components of the flux. The two components were then modelled using a Random Forest Regression model and studied using accumulated local effect plots (ALE plots). Our approach explained 81% of the variation in FCO2: the seasonal pattern explained 36% of the variation in FCO2 measurements, while spatial and intra-seasonal patterns together explained 45%. The most important factors explaining spatial variation were vegetation height and the slope height. Average air temperature of the last two days before efflux measurements was the most important factor explaining intra-seasonal variation. The proposed methodology makes it possible to predict FCO2 from external factors derived from climate and remote sensing data and enables the decomposition of FCO2 into its seasonal, intra-seasonal and spatial components. Our results demonstrate the importance of spatial and intra-seasonal variations in FCO2 compared to seasonal variation, a finding that has implications for the measurement and modelling of FCO2 at landscape and global scales.

TI  - Data-Driven Air Quality and Environmental Evaluation for Cattle Farms
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agricultural practices and the raising of animals are key contributors to air pollution. Cattle farms contain hazardous gases, so we developed a cattle farm air pollution analyzer to count the number of cattle and provide comprehensive statistics on different air pollutant concentrations based on severity over various time periods. The modeling was performed in two parts: the first stage focused on object detection using satellite data of farm images to identify and count the number of cattle; the second stage predicted the next hour air pollutant concentration of the seven cattle farm air pollutants considered. The output from the second stage was then visualized based on severity, and analytics were performed on the historical data. The visualization illustrates the relationship between cattle count and air pollutants, an important factor for analyzing the pollutant concentration trend. We proposed the models Detectron2, YOLOv4, RetinaNet, and YOLOv5 for the first stage, and LSTM (single/multi lag), CNN-LSTM, and Bi-LSTM for the second stage. YOLOv5 performed best in stage one with an average precision of 0.916 and recall of 0.912, with the average precision and recall for all models being above 0.87. For stage two, CNN-LSTM performed well with an MAE of 3.511 and an MAPE of 0.016, while a stacked model had an MAE of 5.010 and an MAPE of 0.023.

TI  - A twenty-year dataset of soil moisture and vegetation optical depth from AMSR-E/2 measurements using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) are essential variables in the terrestrial ecosystem. The multi-frequency radiometers AMSR-E and AMSR2 provide >20 years of data records, enabling the development of long-term SM and VOD products. Most of the current retrieval algorithms either only focus on SM or VOD, and generally ignore the polarization or simplify the frequency dependence of vegetation effects for reducing the unknowns and facilitating the retrieval process, limiting the synergic applicability of VOD and SM products in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. In this study, a new global SM and frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD product from 2002 to 2021 was developed using the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA), based on the inter-calibrated AMSR-E/2 multi-frequency passive microwave measurements. The MCCA algorithm comprehensively considers the physical relationship between multiple microwave channels and could retrieve frequency- and polarization-dependent VOD while considering the accuracy of the SM retrievals. In the overall comparison with other SM products (AMSR-ANN, CCI-passive v07.1, LPRM-C/X, JAXA) over 25 dense SM networks, MCCA achieved the best scores in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 0.074 m3/m3), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.073 m3/m3) and bias (0.007 m3/m3), and presented slightly lower value of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R = 0.709) than LPRM-X (R = 0.735). For the indirect evaluation of VOD with aboveground biomass (AGB) and MODIS NDVI, the MCCA product showed the performance comparable to other products (LPRM-C/X, VODCA-C/X/Ku). MCCA-derived VODs, especially for the H-polarized VODs, exhibited smooth non-linear density distribution with AGB and high temporal correlations with MODIS NDVI over most regions of the globe. In particular, MCCA-derived VODs can physically present reasonable variations across the microwave spectrum (values of VOD increase with microwave frequency), which is superior to the LPRM and VODCA products. It is expected that the MCCA algorithm can be extended to the observations of the ongoing AMSR2 or other similar satellite missions with multi-frequency capability, such as FY-3B/C/D/F/G or the upcoming AMSR3 and CMIR missions.

TI  - Method of Validating Satellite Surface Reflectance Product Using Empirical Line Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospherically corrected surface reflectance (SR) products are used for reliable monitoring of land surfaces and are the standard products of Landsat sensors. Due to increased demand for SR products, a need exists to verify that the L2C2 (Level-2 Collection-2) SR products are precise and accurate. The Level-2 Collection 2 (L2C2) SR Product has processed satellite imagery data that correct for atmospheric effects such as absorption and scattering, providing a more accurate representation of Earth's surface. The validation of SR products using ground truth measurement is essential. This study aims to develop and evaluate a validation methodology for satellite SR products. Thus, the Empirical Line Method (ELM) is used here for atmospheric validation of remotely sensed data. Validation is performed using the SR derived from ELM tied to ground truth measurement. Absolute surface reflectance models of Algodones Dunes and the Salton Sea located in North America Sonoran Desert are developed to extend the temporally limited ground truth measurements. This model can give ground truth reflectance in any time frame independent of time constraints. The result of the absolute surface reflectance model of Algodones Dunes indicates that the model predicts the response of Algodones Dunes with an average accuracy of 0.0041 and precision of 0.0063 and gives ground measurements across all multispectral between 350 and 2500 nm. For the Salton Sea, the model predicts the response of the Salton Sea with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0035 and gives ground measurements across all multispectral between 350 and 2500 nm. The ELM generates atmospheric coefficients (gain and bias), which are applied to an image to obtain SR. Validation results indicated that for L9-OLI-2, L8-OLI, and L5-TM-SR products, the RMSE range is 0.0019 to 0.0106, 0.0019 to 0.0148 and 0.0026 to 0.0045 reflectance unit, respectively, and accuracy is within 0.0038, 0.0022, and 0.0055 reflectance unit across all spectral bands of L9, L8, and L5, respectively. On average, the validation result showed a strong linear relation between the L2C2 SR products and ELM SR within 0.5 to 1 reflectance units. These results demonstrate the high accuracy and reliability of the L2C2 SR product, providing valuable information for a wide range of remote sensing applications, including land cover and land use mapping, vegetation monitoring, and climate change studies.

TI  - Estimating Suspended Sediment Concentration Using Remote Sensing for the Teles Pires River, Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving environmental sustainability involves measuring indices that show responses to different production processes and management types. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in water bodies is a parameter of great importance, as it is related to watercourse morphology, land use and occupation in river basins, and sediment transport and accumulation. Although already established, the methods used for acquiring such data in the field are costly. This hinders extrapolations along water bodies and reservoirs. Remote sensing is a feasible alternative to remedy these obstacles, as changes in suspended sediment concentrations are detectable by satellite images. Therefore, satellite image reflectance can be used to estimate SSC spatially and temporally. We used Sentinel-2 A and B imagery to estimate SSC for the Teles Pires River in Brazil's Amazon. Sensor images used were matched to the same days as field sampling. Google Earth Engine (GEE), a tool that allows agility and flexibility, was used for data processing. Access to several data sources and processing robustness show that GEE can accurately estimate water quality parameters via remote sensing. The best SSC estimator was the reflectance of the B4 band corresponding to the red range of the visible spectrum, with the exponential model showing the best fit and accuracy.

TI  - Characterization of Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Forest Fire in Chhattisgarh, India, Using MODIS-Based Active Fire Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the most common natural and anthropogenic events that have long-term impacts on the environment. In this study, we analyzed 17 years of data on forest fires in Chhattisgarh, India, using active fire and burned area data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Chhattisgarh was selected as the study area due to its high incidences of forest fires, significant forest cover, and scarce studies on forest fires. Our findings showed that the number of forest fires in the region increased over time, from 1487 forest fires in 2005 to 3074 forest fires in 2021, with the highest number of fires occurring in 2017 and 2009. Most of the fires occurred in deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas, following a consistent seasonal pattern, with the highest percentage of fires (88.88%) occurring in March, April, and May. The fire hotspot was located in the southwest region, dominated by deciduous broadleaf forests which are particularly prone to fires. These results emphasize the significance of effective fire management strategies that consider the seasonal and annual variability of forest fires, particularly in high-risk areas. Immediate attention to controlling forest fires is also critical to minimize its impact on the environment and local communities.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Changing Dynamics of Miombo Deforestation and Illegal Human Activities for Forest Fire in Kundelungu National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Kundelungu National Park (KNP), southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, illicit human activities including recurrent bushfires contribute to constant regression of forest cover. This study quantifies the landscape dynamics and analyses the spatio-temporal distribution of bushfire occurrence within KNP. Based on classified Landsat images from 2001, 2008, 2015 and 2022, the evolutionary trend of land cover was mapped and quantified through landscape metrics. The spatial transformation processes underlying the observed landscape dynamics were identified based on a decision tree. Finally, the spatio-temporal fire risk assessment was carried out after defining the burnt areas for each year between 2001 and 2022. The obtained results, expressed by the process of dissection and attrition of patches, show that the forest cover has regressed from 2339 km(2) to 1596 km(2) within the PNK, with an annual deforestation rate varying from 0.8% to 3.4% between 2001 and 2022. Over the same period, the average distance between forest patches has increased significantly, indicating fragmentation and spatial isolation. On the other hand, savannahs as well as field and fallow mosaics have expanded within KNP through the creation of new patches. In addition, several active fires affected more savannahs between 2001 (70 km(2) in Integral Zone, 239 km(2) in Annex Zone and 309 km(2) in KNP) and 2022 (76 km(2) in Integral Zone, 744 km(2) in Annex Zone and 819 km(2) in KNP), limiting their capacity to evolve into forests. Overall, anthropogenic pressure is higher in the Annex Zone of the KNP. Illegal agricultural development and vegetation fires have thus doubled the level of landscape disturbance in 21 years. Our observations justify the need to strengthen protection measures for KNP by limiting repeated human intrusions.

TI  - Flooding in the Digital Twin Earth: The Case Study of the Enza River Levee Breach in December 2017
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate delineation of flood hazard maps is a key element of flood risk management policy. Flood inundation models are fundamental for reproducing the boundaries of flood-prone areas, but their calibration is limited to the information available on the areas affected by inundation during observed flood events (typically fragmentary photo, video or partial surveys). In recent years, Earth Observation data have supported flood monitoring and emergency response (e.g., the Copernicus Emergency Service) thanks to the proliferation of available satellite sensors, also at high spatial resolution. Under this umbrella, the study investigates a levee breach that occurred in December 2017 along the Enza River, a right tributary of the Po River, that caused the inundation of a large area including Lentigione village. The flood event is simulated with a 2D hydraulic model using satellite images to calibrate the roughness coefficients. The results show that the processing and the timing of the high-resolution satellite imagery is fundamental for a reliable representation of the flooded area.

TI  - Synergistic Integration of Time Series Optical and SAR Satellite Data for Mariculture Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mariculture is an important part of aquaculture, and it is important to address global food security and nutrition issues. However, seawater environmental conditions are complex and variable, which causes large uncertainties in the remote sensing spectral features. At the same time, mariculture types are distinct because of the different types of aquaculture (cage aquaculture and raft aquaculture). These factors bring great challenges for mariculture extraction and mapping using remote sensing. In order to solve these problems, an optical remote sensing aquaculture index named the marine aquaculture index (MAI) is proposed. Based on this spectral index, using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, a random forest classification scheme is proposed for mapping mariculture by combining spectral, textural, geometric, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering. The results revealed that (1) MAI can emphasize the difference between mariculture and seawater; (2) the overall accuracy of mariculture in the Bohai Rim is 94.10%, and the kappa coefficient is 0.91; and (3) the area of cage aquaculture and raft aquaculture in the Bohai Rim is 16.89 km(2) and 1206.71 km(2), respectively. This study details an effective method for carrying out mariculture monitoring and ensuring the sustainable development of aquaculture.

TI  - Cropland Extraction in Southern China from Very High-Resolution Images Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cropland information is crucial for the assessment of food security and the formulation of effective agricultural policies. Extracting cropland from remote sensing imagery is challenging due to spectral diversity and mixed pixels. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have facilitated the availability of very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images that provide detailed ground information. However, VHR cropland extraction in southern China is difficult because of the high heterogeneity and fragmentation of cropland and the insufficient observations of VHR sensors. To address these challenges, we proposed a deep learning-based method for automated high-resolution cropland extraction. The method used an improved HRRS-U-Net model to accurately identify the extent of cropland and explicitly locate field boundaries. The HRRS-U-Net maintained high-resolution details throughout the network to generate precise cropland boundaries. Additionally, the residual learning (RL) and the channel attention mechanism (CAM) were introduced to extract deeper discriminative representations. The proposed method was evaluated over four city-wide study areas (Qingyuan, Yangjiang, Guangzhou, and Shantou) with a diverse range of agricultural systems, using GaoFen-2 (GF-2) images. The cropland extraction results for the study areas had an overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 97.00% to 98.33%, with F1 scores (F1) of 0.830-0.940 and Kappa coefficients (Kappa) of 0.814-0.929. The OA was 97.85%, F1 was 0.915, and Kappa was 0.901 over all study areas. Moreover, our proposed method demonstrated advantages compared to machine learning methods (e.g., RF) and previous semantic segmentation models, such as U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and MPSPNet. The results demonstrated the generalization ability and reliability of the proposed method for cropland extraction in southern China using VHR remote images.

TI  - Bathymetry over broad geographic areas using optical high-spatial-resolution satellite remote sensing without in-situ data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial-resolution satellite remote sensing (RS) images facilitate mapping fine-scale bathymetry over broad geographic areas using either empirical or analytical methods. However, inferring bathymetry from such images remains challenging in practical applications. For the empirical approach, high-quality in-situ depth calibration data that are required to establish a reliable empirical bathymetric model are either unavailable or excessively expensive. For the analytical approach, high-spatial-resolution RS images without an adequate number of spectral bands can be problematic in deriving depths from a bio-optical radiative transfer model (RTM). This paper proposes an analytical-empirical hybrid approach for estimating shallow bathymetry over broad geographic areas using optical high-spatial-and low-spectral-resolution satellite images without in-situ depth calibration data. In the proposed approach, the calibration data group that best matches the relationship between depths and the corresponding logarithmic blue/green band ratios at the time of image acquisition is identified by comparing a radiative transfer model-generated calibration data set to image-extracted reference data. Then a band-ratio bathymetric model that best fits the bathymetric images is constructed using the best-fit calibration data group. Lastly, depths are estimated from the high-spatial-resolution satellite multispectral images using the best-fit band-ratio model. Two types of high-spatial-resolution satellite images covering seven oceanic islands in the Yongle Group within the South China Sea (SCS) were used to test the proposed approach. The derived color-coded digital depth model (DDM) visually showed the depth distribution of shallow water areas around the islands. The accuracy assessment showed that the proposed approach performed well in shallow water areas, and can attain a bathymetric accuracy similar to those reported by the traditional satellite-derived bathymetric methods. The proposed approach can be used as an alternative for estimating depth when existing empirical models are not applicable due to a lack of in-situ depth calibration data.

TI  - Study of the Preparation Phase of Turkey's Powerful Earthquake (6 February 2023) by a Geophysical Multi-Parametric Fuzzy Inference System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 6 February 2023, a powerful earthquake at the border between Turkey and Syria caused catastrophic consequences and was, unfortunately, one of the deadliest earthquakes of the recent decades. The moment magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be 7.8, and it was localized in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey. This article aims to investigate the behavior of more than 50 different lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere (LAI) anomalies obtained from satellite data and different data services in a time period of about six months before the earthquake to discuss the possibility of predicting the mentioned earthquake by an early warning system based on various geophysical parameters. In this study, 52 time series covering six months of data were acquired with: (i) three identical satellites of the Swarm constellation (Alpha (A), Bravo (B) and Charlie (C); and the analyzed parameters: electron density (Ne) and temperature (Te), magnetic field scalar (F) and vector (X, Y and Z) components); (ii) the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform service data (including ozone, water vapor and surface temperature), (iii) the Giovanni data service (including the aerosol optical depth (AOD), methane, carbon monoxide and ozone); and (iv) the USGS earthquake catalogue (including the daily seismic rate and maximum magnitude for each day), around the location of the seismic event from 1 September 2022 to 17 February 2023, and these were analyzed. The results show that the number of seismic anomalies increased since about 33 days before the earthquake and reached a peak, i.e., the highest number, one day before. The findings of implementing the proposed predictor based on the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) emphasize that the occurrence of a powerful earthquake could be predicted from about nine days to one day before the earthquake due to the clear increase in the number of seismo-LAI anomalies. However, this study has still conducted a posteriori, knowing the earthquake's epicenter and magnitude. Therefore, based on the results of this article and similar research, we emphasize the urgency of the creation of early earthquake warning systems in seismic-prone areas by investigating the data of different services, such as GEE, Giovanni and various other global satellite platforms services, such as Swarm. Finally, the path toward earthquake prediction is still long, and the goal is far, but the present results support the idea that this challenging goal could be achieved in the future.

TI  - Multilayer Perceptron for the Future Urban Growth of the Kharj Region in 2040
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is described as an increase in the size and use of cities, which is frequently the consequence of an increase in the number of residents due to internal or external migration and an increase in economic activity rates. In recent decades, modern technology and mathematical models have been used to determine future urban growth on a large scale and develop sustainable urban policies in the long term. The cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have witnessed economic growth in recent decades, which has resulted in urban expansion, as is evident in this case study of the Kharj region. Since most of the previous studies have not applied mathematical models to predict the urban growth of the Kharj region, this study aims at simulating urban growth over the next two decades, between 2020 and 2040, by monitoring the growth during the past thirty years, which is the period between 1990 and 2020. This study relies on the satellite visualizations of the Landsat satellites 5, 7, and 8 for classifying the land cover by applying the land change model (LCM) and comparing the land-use maps for the years 2000 and 2020. Then, the factors affecting urban growth, such as distance from the city center, the road network, valleys, and land slopes, are determined to monitor the prediction of urban growth. The results showed that the urban areas extended significantly toward the south, southeast, southwest, and northwest, with an area of 269 km(2). The results further revealed a significant decline in agricultural and vacant lands due to their transformation into residential areas, educational establishments, and industrial facilities. The model's accuracy was tested to confirm the mathematical model's validity. The Kappa index findings indicated a high percentage, ranging from 89% in 2010 to 90% in 2020.

TI  - Automatic assessment of public open spaces using street view imagery
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Public open space (POS) is essential to urban areas. Assessing them usually requires tedious approaches such as fieldwork and manual processes. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Computer Vision (CV) have been adopted in some urban environment research, bringing fine granularity and human perspective. However, limited aspects have been subject in these studies, and SVI and CV have not been used for holistic POS assessment. This research introduces a novel approach of employing them in conjunction with traditionally used geospatial and remote sensing data for automating POS assessment and doing so extensively. Indicators from both subjective and objective perspectives are developed, and CV algorithms are adopted for retrieving visual features. In a case study spanning 800 POS in Hong Kong and Singapore, a method is designed to predict both subjective and objective scores. The results demonstrate the perceptual models achieved acceptable to high accuracy scores, and suggest that SVI reflects different aspects of POS compared to previous approaches. The paper concludes that SVI can be adopted in POS assessment as a new instrument, extending their research scope to rarely considered off -road areas, and contributing with a new approach for the design and allocation of POS in urban planning.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Bathymetry for Selected Shallow Maltese Coastal Zones
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric information has become essential to help maintain and operate coastal zones. Traditional in situ bathymetry mapping using echo sounders is inefficient in shallow waters and operates at a high logistical cost. On the other hand, lidar mapping provides an efficient means of mapping coastal areas. However, this comes at a high acquisition cost as well. In comparison, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) provides a more cost-effective way of mapping coastal regions, albeit at a lower resolution. This work utilises all three of these methods collectively, to obtain accurate bathymetric depth data of two pocket beaches, Golden Bay and Ghajn Tuffieha, located in the northwestern region of Malta. Using the Google Earth Engine platform, together with Sentinel-2 data and collected in situ measurements, an empirical pre-processing workflow for estimating SDB was developed. Four different machine learning algorithms which produced differing depth accuracies by calibrating SDBs with those derived from alternative techniques were tested. Thus, this study provides an insight into the depth accuracy that can be achieved for shallow coastal regions using SDB techniques.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Numerous cities throughout the world are experiencing tremendous population growth in their peripheral areas, resulting in a progressive modification of landscapes and raising serious concerns about natural environments, notably forests and agricultural area. Monitoring LULC changes can assist in understanding historical trends, while simulation-based modelling shed light on possible potential future developments. Both of these tactics are indispensable and complimentary for implementing effective land use policies to mitigate the adverse ramifications of urbanization. Present area of investigation, Siliguri town one of prime trading hub of whole north-east India surrounded by ecologically sensitives zones Himalayas. To monitor land use dynamics of peri-urban spaces in Siliguri town Landsat images of 2000, 2010 and 2020 were derived from USGS and classified using Support vector machine learning algorithms. Following the quantification of the previous trend of landuse change, an integrated Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and CA-Markov chain Model was utilized to forecast LULC for the years 2030 and 2050. Eleven pertinent geographical factors, comprising topographical, socioeconomic, and connectivity information, were generated and validated using the crammer v test. The results from LULC modeling predicts as compared to 2020, the urban area is expected to increase by 48.23%, while forest areas, other vegetation cover, and agricultural areas are predicted to shrink by 9.42%, 29.83%, and 26.60% respectively, by the year 2050. The results could provide useful information about historical and potential landuse change and as well as assist local governments in formulating management strategies for the protection of ecological resource.

TI  - Landsat-8 Observations of Foam Coverage under Fetch-Limited Wave Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we aimed to clarify the problem of foam coverage dependence on wave fetch, which is of interest in satellite microwave radiometry, but for which controversial results were reported previously. The classical approach to investigating developing waves was applied. That is, the waves are considered as coming from the coast under approximately constant wind velocity. The study includes two scenes of intensive katabatic winds in the Gulf of Lion and the Gulf of Tehuantepec. We used two Bands of Landsat OLI images to extract the wave spectral peak frequency and the sea fraction covered by foam simultaneously along the wave fetch. The distributions of the spectral peak frequency along the fetch obeying the classical wave growth law clearly showed that we observed the developing waves. Along the fetch, the sea surface covered with foam grows about three times with the power law. This development of foam coverage occurred at the range of dimensionless fetches from 50 up to 7000 if the fetch is scaled using wind velocity and gravity acceleration. A simple model of the foam coverage growth with wave fetch is suggested. We modeled wave energy dissipation rate using the JONSWAP wave spectrum for developing seas. The model explains the observations at the quantitative level. Reported results can be applied to investigations of tropical cyclones using satellite microwave radiometry.

TI  - A noise autocovariance model for SAR altimeter measurements with implications for optimal sampling
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earlier work has empirically demonstrated some advantages of an increased posting rate of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altime-ters beyond the expected ground resolution of about 320 m in Delay-Doppler (unfocused SAR, UFSAR) processing, corresponding to -20 Hz sampling. Higher posting rates of 40-80 Hz were shown to prevent spectral aliasing of the signal, enable to measure swell wave related signal distortions and may lead to a reduced root mean square error of 1 Hz estimates of Sea Surface Heights (SSH), radar cross section (sigma0) and Significant Wave Heights (SWH) from current SAR altimeters. These improvements were explained by the narrow noise autocovariance function of the waveform signal's power speckle noise in along-track direction on one hand, and frequency dou-bling by power detection (squaring of the signal) on the other. It has not been explained, however, why the power speckle noise decor-relates faster than anticipated by the predicted Doppler resolution, and whether this decorrelation depends on the altimeter and processing configuration. Also, it has not been shown explicitly that the estimates of SSH, SWH and sigma0 decorrelate in the same way. Describing the noise autocovariance function - or equivalently the noise power spectral density via the Wiener-Kintchin theorem - is necessary on two counts: Knowing the noise autocovariance allows to apply optimal filtering strategies that maximize precision on one hand, while the noise power spectral density predicts the frequencies contained in the noise (and signals), which in turn determines the required sampling frequency according to the Nyquist theorem. Using a newly derived analytic noise autocovariance model for UFSAR-processed altimeter data, we show that the swift signal decorrelation is mainly due to the observation geometry. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the noise autocovariance functions of power speckle, SSH, SWH and sigma0 estimates in along-track direc-tion are different and depend on the sea state. On top of that, the noise autocovariance functions are strongly dependent on the number of Doppler beams used for multilooking, the used retracker, and the processing choices such as antenna gain pattern compensation and windowing within the UFSAR processing (Level-1b). We validated our noise autocovariance model with segments of 42 Sentinel-3B overpasses. Our findings are in accordance to all earlier work, but indicate that the reported precision improvements with respect to 20 Hz may have been too optimistic and that the SSH, SWH and sigma0 generally decorrelate slower than the power speckle noise. We found that the required posting rate is always higher or equal to 40 Hz. Our results will potentially enable improved spectral analysis and optimal filtering of any UFSAR altimetry data. More importantly, our results can be used to trade off different aspects for deter-mining an optimal posting rate in UFSAR altimeter processing in different sea states and with changing processing parameters, which is necessary in view of strict precision requirements of existing and future SAR altimetry missions.

TI  - Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Feature-Based Network for Cloud Removal in Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination is a common issue that severely reduces the quality of optical satellite images in remote sensing fields. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, cloud contamination is expected to be addressed. In this paper, we propose Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model-Cloud Removal (DDPM-CR), a novel cloud removal network that can effectively remove both thin and thick clouds in optical image scenes. Our network leverages the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) architecture to integrate both clouded optical and auxiliary SAR images as input to extract DDPM features, providing significant information for missing information retrieval. Additionally, we propose a cloud removal head adopting the DDPM features with an attention mechanism at multiple scales to remove clouds. To achieve better network performance, we propose a cloud-oriented loss that considers both high- and low-frequency image information as well as cloud regions in the training procedure. Our ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate that the DDPM-CR network outperforms other methods under various cloud conditions, achieving better visual effects and accuracy metrics (MAE = 0.0229, RMSE = 0.0268, PSNR = 31.7712, and SSIM = 0.9033). These results suggest that the DDPM-CR network is a promising solution for retrieving missing information in either thin or thick cloud-covered regions, especially when using auxiliary information such as SAR data.

TI  - Comparison of Different Remotely Sensed Data Sources for Detection of Presence of Standing Dead Trees Using a Tree-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deadwood is an important key ecological element for forest ecosystem biodiversity. Its low occurrence, especially in managed forests, makes inventory through field campaigns challenging. Remote sensing can provide a more objective and systematic approach to detect deadwood for large areas. Traditional area-based approaches have, however, shown limitations when it comes to predicting rare objects such as standing dead trees (SDT). To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a tree-based approach that uses a local maxima function to identify trees from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and optical data, and predict their status, i.e., living or dead, from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI was calculated from aerial images (hyperspectral and simulated aerial image) and from satellite images (PlanetScope and Sentinel-2). By comparing the different remotely sensed data sources, we aimed to assess the impact of spatial and spectral resolutions in the prediction of SDT. The presence/absence of SDT was perfectly predicted by combining trees identified using ALS-derived canopy height models with spatial resolutions between 0.75 m and 1 m and a search window size of 3 pixels, and NDVI computed from aerial images to predict their status. The presence/absence of SDT was not predicted as accurately when using NDVI computed from satellite images. A root-mean-square deviation of around 35 trees ha(-1) was obtained when predicting the density of SDT with NDVI from aerial images and around 60 trees ha(-1) with NDVI from satellite images. The tree-based approach presented in this study shows great potential to predict the presence of SDT over large areas.

TI  - SGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy practice for right-sided breast cancer combined with RNI: A retrospective study on dosimetry and setup accuracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe retrospectively studied the dosimetry and setup accuracy of deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) radiotherapy in right-sided breast cancer patients with regional nodal irradiation (RNI) who had completed treatment based on surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT) technology by Sentinel/Catalyst system, aiming to clarify the clinical application value and related issues. MethodsDosimetric indicators of four organs at risk (OARs), namely the heart, right coronary artery (RCA), right lung, and liver, were compared on the premise that the planning target volume met dose-volume prescription requirements. Meanwhile, the patients were divided into the edge of the xiphoid process (EXP), sternum middle (SM), and left breast wall (LBW) groups according to different positions of respiratory gating primary points. The CBCT setup error data of the three groups were contrasted for the treatment accuracy study, and the effects of different gating window heights on the right lung volume increases were compared among the three groups. ResultsCompared with free breath (FB), DIBH reduced the maximum dose of heart and RCA by 739.3 +/- 571.2 cGy and 509.8 +/- 403.8 cGy, respectively (p < 0.05). The liver changed the most in terms of the mean dose (916.9 +/- 318.9 cGy to 281.2 +/- 150.3 cGy, p < 0.05). The setup error of the EXP group in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction was 3.6 +/- 4.5 mm, which is the highest among the three groups. The right lung volume increases in the EXP, SM, and LBW groups were 72.3%, 69.9%, and 67.2%, respectively (p = 0.08), and the corresponding breath-holding heights were 13.5 +/- 3.7 mm, 10.3 +/- 2.4 mm, and 9.6 +/- 2.8 mm, respectively (p < 0.05). ConclusionsSGRT-based DIBH radiotherapy can better protect the four OARs of right-sided breast cancer patients with RNI. Different respiratory gating primary points have different setup accuracy and breath-hold height.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper examines the developmental trajectories of students' self-authored worldview commitments over four years of college and the reasons they offered for making associated developmental gains. Through a longitudinal, mixed methods approach, we unearthed four distinctive developmental trajectories of a nationally-representative cohort of 9,470 students enrolled across 122 institutions. We found that provocative encounters with worldview diversity - those that appropriately challenged students to examine their own religious commitments - served as catalysts for growth during college. The varied contexts of those provocative encounters, both inside and outside the college classroom, are highlighted in students' own words. Implications for research are discussed.

TI  - Robotic radioguided surgery: toward full integration of radio- and hybrid-detection modalities
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeIncreasingly more laparoscopic surgical procedures are performed with robotic platforms, even becoming the standard for some indications. While providing the surgeon with great surgical dexterity, these systems do not improve surgical decision making. With unique detection capabilities and a plurality of tracers available, radioguidance could fulfill a crucial part in this pursuit of precision surgery. There are, however, specific restrictions, limitations, but also great potentials, requiring a redesign of traditional modalities.MethodsThis narrative review provides an overview of the challenges encountered during robotic laparoscopic surgery and the engineering steps that have been taken toward full integration of radioguidance and hybrid guidance modalities (i.e., combined radio and fluorescence detection).ResultsFirst steps have been made toward full integration. Current developments with tethered DROP-IN probes successfully bring radioguidance to the robotic platform as evaluated in sentinel node surgery (i.e., urology and gynecology) as well as tumor-targeted surgery (i.e., PSMA primary and salvage surgery). Although technically challenging, preclinical steps are made toward even further miniaturization and integration, optimizing the surgical logistics and improving surgical abilities. Mixed-reality visualizations show great potential to fully incorporate feedback of the image-guided surgery modalities within the surgical robotic console as well.ConclusionRobotic radioguidance procedures provide specific challenges, but at the same time create a significant growth potential for both image-guided surgery and interventional nuclear medicine.

TI  - Estimating particulate matter concentrations and meteorological contributions in China during 2000-2020
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) on climate and human health is highly dependent on the accurate prediction of its concentration and size distribution. High-complexity machine learning models have been widely used for PM concentration prediction, but such models are often considered as "black boxes", lacking interpretability. Here, a simple structure lightGBM model is built for ground PM estimation, and the SHAP approach is used to separate the meteorological contributions due to its strong influence on PM concen-tration. The models show good performance with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.84-0.88, 0.80-0.85, and 0.71-0.79, for PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5-10 (2.5-10 mu m), respectively. The lightGBM model trains 45 times faster than the XGBoost model while showing similar accuracy. More importantly, the models have small performance gaps between training and predicting (delta R2: 0.07-0.12), effectively reducing overfitting risk. The PM datasets (10 km daily) of three size ranges are then generated over China from 2000 to 2020. The SHAP method shows good agreement with the meteorological normalization approach in separating the meteorological contributions (R2 > 0.5). In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH), meteorology has greater influence on PM2.5-10 (-5.66%- 9.99%) than PM2.5 and PM10. In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), albedo has a large contribution to PM2.5 concentration under the influence of solar radiation. Notably, relative humidity (RH) has different seasonal effects on PM of three size ranges. In the BTH region, RH has negative effects on PM2.5 (-0.52 mu g/m3) and positive effects on PM10 (1.01 mu g/m3) and PM2.5-10 (3.39 mu g/m3) in spring, but has opposite effects in summer. The results of SHAP approach are consistent with existing conclusions and imply its feasibility in explaining haze formation. The generated PM datasets are useful in health assessment, environmental man-agement, and climate change studies.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on glacial retreat during 1990-2021 in the Chinese Altay Mountains
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Melting glaciers have changed the spatial-temporal distribution of water resources in inland river basins and are one of the important inducements of extreme hydrological events. Most previous studies on glacier changes in the Chinese Altay Mountains have focused on the period 1960-2011; however, there is a lack of glacier data reflecting recent changes (1990-2021) over the past decades, and the response of glaciers to regional climate change is still unclear. In this study, Landsat images and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) were used to map glacier outlines from 1990 to 2021 for the whole region and its surrounding areas, and the impacts of temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation variation on glacier retreat were investigated. The results indicate that (1) the glacier area retreat rate of 0.55 %center dot a-1 in the Chinese Altay Mountains during 1990-2021 is obviously lower than the glacier area shrinkage rate of 0.75 %center dot a-1 from 1960 to 2009, and the retreat rate of glacier volume is 0.60 %center dot a-1. (2) More than 80 % of the total glacier area located at elevation ranged from 2600 to 3400 m, and the greatest glacier area loss occurred within the elevation range of 2800-3000 m. Although the glacier area was retreating in all orientations, the south-facing glacier has the largest retreat rate. (3) The rate of change of glacier area was -1.26 %center dot a-1, -0.71 %center dot a-1 and -0.51 %center dot a-1 in the Haba sub-basin, Sawir Mountains region, and Burqin sub-basin, respectively. (4) Owing to the slowdown in the warming rate since 1990, the glacier shrinkage rate was moderate during 1990-2021 compared to the 1960 s-1980 s, and contribution of the increase of solar radiation (35.72 %) and summer temperature (25.3 %) to glacier retreat from 1990 to 2021 were more prominent than other climate factors.

TI  - Developing global annual land surface phenology datasets (1982-2018) from the AVHRR data using multiple phenology retrieval methods
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology that reflects periodical changes in terrestrial vegetation plays an important role in influencing the functioning and services of ecosystems. Satellite-derived metrics of land surface phenology have been widely used to assess the patterns in land cover dynamics. There are still limited satellite-based datasets of global land surface phenology available to date due to uneven qualities of satellite data. Here, we developed a global annual land surface phenology dataset based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from 1982 to 2018. The number of global vegetation growing seasons for each individual pixel was counted for each year from 1982 to 2018. We implemented four phenology retrieval methods, including the amplitude threshold method, the second-order derivative method, the third-order derivative method, and the curvature change rate method, to retrieve four key phenological metrics for each vegetation growth cycle, including the start of the growing season (SOS), maturity, senescence, and the end of the growing season (EOS). The results show that the phenological metrics retrieved using different phenology retrieval methods have similar patterns of global spatial distribution. From 1982 to 2018, the timing of both maturity and senescence within a year advanced in the Northern Hemisphere and the timing of SOS delayed in the Southern Hemisphere. The phenological metrics extracted from in-situ data such as the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Database (PEP725), and flux tower measurements were positively correlated with satellite-derived phenological metrics. Despite the effects of mismatching spatial scales, the retrieved phenological metrics based on 5 km AVHRR data were consistent with those based on 500 m Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and 30 m fused satellite data at both site-scale and regional-scale. The developed dataset released for usages and applications on global land surface dynamics offers potential end users options for choosing desirable phenological metrics derived from different methods.

TI  - An Effective Deep Learning Model for Monitoring Mangroves: A Case Study of the Indus Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of mangroves using remote sensing images is of great significance for assisting ecological conservation efforts in coastal zones. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to a variety of fields. However, few studies have applied deep learning methods to the automatic detection of mangroves and few scholars have used medium-resolution Landsat images for large-scale mangrove identification. In this study, cloud-free Landsat 8 OLI imagery of the Indus Delta was acquired using the GEE platform, and NDVI and land use data were used to produce integrated labels to reduce the complexity and subjectivity of manually labeled samples. We proposed the use of MSNet, a semantic segmentation model fusing multiple-scale features, for mangrove extraction in the Indus Delta, and compared the performance of the MSNet model with three other semantic segmentation models, FCN-8s, SegNet, and U-Net. The overall performance ranking of the deep learning methods was MSNet > U-Net > SegNet > FCN-8s. The parallel-structured MSNet model was easy to train, had the fewest parameters and the highest validation accuracy, and provided the best results for the extraction of mangrove pixels with weak features. The MSNet model not only maintains the high-resolution features of the image and fully learns the pixels with weak features during the training process but also fuses the multiple-scale underlying features at different scales to enhance the semantic information and improve the accuracy of feature recognition and segmentation localization. Finally, the areas covered by mangroves in the Indus Delta in 2014 and 2022 were extracted using the best-performing MSNet. The statistics show an increase in mangrove-covered areas in the Indus Delta between 2014 and 2022, with a reduction of 44.37 km(2), an increase of 170.48 km(2), and a net increase of 126.11 km(2).

TI  - Learning-Based Near-Infrared Band Simulation with Applications on Large-Scale Landcover Classification
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral sensors are important instruments for Earth observation. In remote sensing applications, the near-infrared (NIR) band, together with the visible spectrum (RGB), provide abundant information about ground objects. However, the NIR band is typically not available on low-cost camera systems, which presents challenges for the vegetation extraction. To this end, this paper presents a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) method to simulate the NIR band from RGB bands of Sentinel-2 multispectral data. We adapt a robust loss function and a structural similarity index loss (SSIM) in addition to the GAN loss to improve the model performance. With 45,529 multi-seasonal test images across the globe, the simulated NIR band had a mean absolute error of 0.02378 and an SSIM of 89.98%. A rule-based landcover classification using the simulated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) achieved a Jaccard score of 89.50%. The evaluation metrics demonstrated the versatility of the learning-based paradigm in remote sensing applications. Our simulation approach is flexible and can be easily adapted to other spectral bands.

TI  - Extraction of impervious surface with Landsat based on machine learning in Chengdu urban, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of urbanization, materials such as steel and concrete are widely used in urban con-struction such as road paving and house building, resulting in an increase in impervious surface area in cities. Rapid urbanization in China today has led to a huge increase in impervious surface area, which has increased the risk of urban waterlogging. Therefore, there are more reasons to conduct research on impervious surface and explore the relationship between impervious surface and urban waterlogging. This research has been done to obtain the optimal model for extracting impervious surface in Chengdu urban area and to explore the correlation between impervious surface changes and urban waterlogging in the same area. In order to obtain the optimal model, five different machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes (NB), Convolu-tional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Capsules Network (CapsNet) and Random Forest (RF) have been used to extract the urban impervious surface in this study. The ac-curacy of the classification models is evaluated using the overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (KC), and macro F1 (F1). It is found that CNN is the best option to extract the urban impervious surface of Chengdu with an OA of 0.7809. In addition, based on the optimal model to extract the impervious surface of Chengdu, a partial correlation analysis was conducted between urban wa-terlogging and urban impervious in the study area, it was concluded that there was a positive cor-relation between the two with a partial correlation coefficient of 0.979.

TI  - Sentinel node- assisted neck dissection in advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma-A new protocol for staging and treatment
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is used to improve the staging of and guide treatment in patients with early-stage T1-T2 N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The role of sentinel nodes (SNs) and the use of SN-technique in advanced OSCC (T3-T4 and/or N+) remain to be evaluated. This study investigates the nodal drainage and the rate of positive SNs (SNs+) in all stages of OSCC.Materials and Methods: In total, 85 patients with T1-T4 OSCC diagnosed 2019-2021 were included. We used a prolonged interval between peritumoral injection of radionuclide and SPECT-CT to include all SNs.Results: Patients with advanced OSCC presented a higher proportion of contralateral lymphatic drainage and a higher rate of SN+ compared to patients with early-stage disease. T3-T4 and N+ tumors presented a tendency for a higher rate of contralateral lymphatic drainage compared to T1-T2 and N0 tumors (p = 0.1). The prevalence of positive nodes (SNs+) was higher among patients with advanced disease, T3-T4 versus T1-T2 (p = 0.0398).Conclusion: SN-assisted ND enables identification and removal of all SNs + and has the potential for more accurate staging and could possibly give prognostic advantages regarding regional recurrence for all OSCC patients, especially among those with advanced disease. The precise localization of the SNs + also suggests that a more individualized ND approach might be possible in the future even for patients with advanced OSCC.

TI  - Excessive pumping limits the benefits of a strengthening summer monsoon for recovery in India
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustaining groundwater under the warming climate in India remains a challenge for the food and water secu-rity of over one billion people. However, the crucial role of the strengthening of the Indian summer monsoon and future warming on dwindling groundwater storage in north India remains unexplored. Using in situ groundwater observations and model simulations, we show that during 2002-2022, about 95% of ground-water loss (-498 km3) from India occurred from north India (-472 km3), a global groundwater depletion hot -spot. Well observations show a more robust coupling with climate through rainfall variability. Groundwater loss is driven by excessive pumping from nonrenewable groundwater storage and will continue to dominate in the near future despite projected increases in rainfall (-4%-6%). The highest projected groundwater re-covery (258.9 +/- 171.6 km3) in the near period (2021-2040) is only about half of the total groundwater loss. Therefore, increased rainfall may not help recover the lost groundwater.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Injection for Identification of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Patients with Primary Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe dual technique using blue dye in combination with a radioisotope is considered the gold standard for identifying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with breast cancer. Unfortunately, not all cancer centres have access to radioactive material, which jeopardizes the SLN identification rate and patient safety.AimWe aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride injection (MHI) for identifying axillary SLNs in patients with primary breast cancer.Patients and methodsWe have conducted a prospective non-randomized analysis of patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who agreed to participate in the study between December 2019 and December 2022. We have used the patient's medical records to collect the data. We have used the SLN intraoperative identification rate as a marker for the efficacy of the technique and both the immediate and delayed complication rates and routine blood tests as markers for the safety of the technique.ResultsOut of the 296 patients, 289 (97.6%) had their SLNs identified using MHI, while seven patients (2.3%) had four-node sampling carried out because the SLNs were not identified. Liver functions were not significantly affected by MHI, and there was no technique-related readmission or reported morbidity or mortality.ConclusionWe have found that the MHI technique is still inferior to the combined radioactive directed technique and patent blue V dye in SLN identification. Yet, it may serve as a safe and reliable alternative in cases where the radioactive technique is unavailable.

TI  - Assessing the influence of crop model structure on the performance of data assimilation for sugarcane
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-base crop models (PBM) are important tools to describe how the agricultural system responds to envi-ronmental conditions. Sugarcane represents a major world source of sugar and ethanol and its PBMs had different levels of complexity in terms of structure, i.e. how detailed their processes were described. Yet, literature has widely demonstrated that data assimilation techniques (DA) represent a valuable option for reducing model uncertainty, but the inconsistency between PBM and the assimilated variable can significantly affect the per-formance of DA. Such limitation is strictly connected to model structure, and a hypothesis that arises from literature is that the use of more complex models would reduce model uncertainty after DA. We accessed the performance of using two different PBMs, one more detailed (DSSAT/SAMUCA, DS) and the other more general (WOFOST, WO), by assimilating leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from Landsat 7 ETM + and 8/OLI, using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Both PBMs were calibrated and evaluated with a robust database of 13 ex-periments and evaluated against a sugarmill database to evaluate the EnKF performance, compared with sim-ulations without DA (Open-loop, OP). Moreover, the processes involved in LAI simulations were analyzed to assess the EnKF performance. The DS had superior performance in the calibration and evaluation step with EF = 0.907, 0.878, 0.458 for stalk dry mass, stalk fresh yield (SFY), and LAI, while WO showed EF = 0.622, 0.610, 0.417 for the same variables, respectively. The calibration step affected the OP plot simulation, with DS having higher accuracy (RMSE = 31.678 Mg ha -1) and precision (R2 = 0.509), compared with WO (RMSE = 39.593 Mg ha -1; R2 = 0.458). However, after DA, both PBM presented error inconsistency with EnKF, despite the decrease in RMSE (-44.73% and-29.58%) and increase in R2 (22.15% and 36.50%) of DS and WO, respectively. The error inconsistency diverged from each PBM: the OP simulation of DS overestimated the Landsat LAI; after DA, simulated LAI decreased resulting in SFY underestimation (Bias =-11.469 Mg ha -1); WO showed OP simulations for LAI closer to Landsat's LAI values, despite the positive Bias in SFY estimation, and so EnKF slightly reduced the SFY overestimation (Bias = 22.944 Mg ha -1). Thus, the better descriptions of DS in terms of structure did not inhibit the error inconsistency. We suggested that new studies are required to understand how the assimilated variables impact on the other state variables of the PBM.

TI  - Vegetation recovery drivers at short-term after fire are plant community-dependent in mediterranean burned landscapes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large, severe wildfires can cause unpredictable changes in Mediterranean plant communities that undermine ecosystem resilience. Understanding the geophysical drivers shaping vegetation dynamics after fire is vital to provide integrated knowledge into plant community recovery feedbacks in the context of global change. We investigated the role of fire severity and a comprehensive set of geophysical drivers in the post-fire vegetation recovery of Mediterranean landscapes. We used physical-based remote sensing techniques to estimate vegetation recovery and examined whether this recovery is plant-community dependent in the short-term (one year) after the fire. The fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER) recovery was selected as a resilience indicator for Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) forests, Quercus ilex L. (holm oak) woodlands, shrublands dominated by Cytisus oromediterraneus Rivas Mart. et al. (black broom) and grasslands. To obtain the pre- and post-fire FCOVER, we used the Gaussian processes regression algorithm trained with the PROSAIL-D radiative transfer model. The algorithm was parameterized to account for the variability of biophysical conditions in the plant communities considered and was applied to the Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Validation of remotely-sensed FCOVER with field data in burned and control plots was successful (R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 10.83%), without significant under or overestimation. We selected 31 variables pertaining to fire severity, climate, post-fire soil moisture, pre-fire soil condition, and landscape configuration as putative predictors of FCOVER recovery percentage (FCOVER%rec), calculated as the ratio of post-fire to pre-fire FCOVER. Random Forest regression (RFR) was used to disentangle the influences of fire severity and geophysical drivers on community-specific FCOVER%rec. Fire severity and postfire surface soil moisture variables were relevant predictors in RFR models in all plant communities. However, their importance was largely community-dependent. In grasslands, surface soil moisture in the early summer season one year after fire was the major variable explaining variability in FCOVER%rec. In holm oak woodlands, the contribution of fire severity and surface soil moisture was balanced. Conversely, fire severity largely outweighed other variables in driving FCOVER%rec in black broom shrublands and Scots pine forests. Pre-fire climate, soil condition and landscape configuration variables were not meaningful predictors in general. Our findings offer novel insights into the processes that underlie resilience in fire-prone plant communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin. This establishes a baseline to help prioritize adaptive management strategies for the most vulnerable areas in the region.

TI  - Multivariate prediction of soil aggregate-associated organic carbon by simulating satellite sensor bands
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil aggregate-associated organic carbon (SAOC) is critical for maintaining soil quality and environmental health. To realize non-destructive and potentially applicable assessments on SAOC by using the hyperspectral technology, the resampling method was adopted to simulate the different satellites bands and the three multi-variate methods of support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) were also implemented to calibrate the predictive models on SAOC. The results showed that the computed Three-band index 2 (TBI2) was proved to be highly related to both soil micro-and macroaggregate-associated organic carbon (OC) among all spectral indexes, and the highest correlation coefficient (R =-0.443) was ob-tained between the microaggregate-associated OC and TBI2 derived from the simulated bands 7, 4, 10 of Sentinel-2 satellite. For the macroaggregate-associated OC, the good correlation (R =-0.422) was also acquired with TBI2 which was constructed by using the simulated bands 7, 6, and 1 from the Sentinel-2 satellite. The calibrated models show that accepted accuracy for microaggregate-associated OC was achieved with R2 = 0.773, RMSE = 0.853, RPD = 1.808, and it outperformed than macroaggregates model (R2 = 0.709; RMSE = 0.969, RPD = 1.255) which was limited in the practical application with lower predictive accuracy. The results of correlation analysis and multivariate models performance indicated that the microaggregate-associated OC is highly related to responding to the spectral band simulated with different satellites than macroaggregates. This study provides a possible way to link the hyperspectral and remote sensing satellites, and open up opportunity for large-scale estimation on SAOC.

TI  - Endothelial ACKR1 is induced by neutrophil contact and down-regulated by secretion in extracellular vesicles
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atypical chemokine receptor-1 (ACKR1), previously known as the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines, is a widely conserved cell surface protein that is expressed on erythrocytes and the endothelium of post-capillary venules. In addition to being the receptor for the parasite causing malaria, ACKR1 has been postulated to regulate innate immunity by displaying and trafficking chemokines. Intriguingly, a common mutation in its promoter leads to loss of the erythrocyte protein but leaves endothelial expression unaffected. Study of endothelial ACKR1 has been limited by the rapid down-regulation of both transcript and protein when endothelial cells are extracted and cultured from tissue. Thus, to date the study of endothelial ACKR1 has been limited to heterologous over-expression models or the use of transgenic mice. Here we report that exposure to whole blood induces ACKR1 mRNA and protein expression in cultured primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells. We found that contact with neutrophils is required for this effect. We show that NF-kappa B regulates ACKR1 expression and that upon removal of blood, the protein is rapidly secreted by extracellular vesicles. Finally, we confirm that endogenous ACKR1 does not signal upon stimulation with IL-8 or CXCL1. Our observations define a simple method for inducing endogenous endothelial ACKR1 protein that will facilitate further functional studies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution and influencing factors of synergizing the reduction of pollution and carbon emissions-Utilizing multi-source remote sensing data and GTWR model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasping current circumstances and influencing components of the synergistic degree regarding reducing pollution and carbon has been recognized as a crucial part of China in response to the protection of the environment and climate mitigation. With the introduction of remote sensing night-time light, CO2 emissions at multi-scale have been estimated in this study. Accordingly, an upward trend of "CO2-PM2.5" synergistic reduction was discovered, which was indicated by an increase of 78.18% regarding the index constructed of 358 cities in China from 2014 to 2020. Additionally, it has been confirmed that the reduction in pollution and carbon emissions could coordinate with economic growth indirectly. Lastly, it has identified the spatial discrepancy of influencing factors and the results have emphasized the rebound effect of technological progress and industrial upgrades, whilst the development of clean energy can offset the increase in energy consumption thus contributing to the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction. Moreover, it has been highlighted that environmental background, industrial structure, and socio-economic characteristics of different cities should be considered comprehensively in order to better achieve the goals of "Beautiful China" and "Carbon Neutrality".

TI  - Biomimetic Fe-Cu Dual-atomic-site catalysts enable efficient H2O2 activation for tumor lymphatic metastasis inhibition
T2  - NANO TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving efficient activation of H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and further improving the therapeutic efficiency is a great challenge in chemodynamic therapy against cancer. Herein, inspired by natural enzymes, atomically dispersed catalysts with Fe-Cu hetero-binuclear active sites on hollow ni-trogen-doped carbon nanospheres (FeCuNC) are synthesized as catalytic nanomedicines for cancer therapy. We found that Fe-Cu hetero-binuclear sites in FeCuNC can catalytically dissociate the O-O bonds in H2O2 molecules more easily than those of single-Fe sites. Besides, the intrinsic photothermal effect of FeCuNC not only further accelerates H2O2 decomposition to produce abundant reactive oxygen species but also achieves synergistically chemodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy to induce cancer cell apoptosis and re-strain tumor growth. Moreover, FeCuNC can accurately identify sentinel lymph node metastasis and ef-fectively suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence. This work will provide an advanced strategy for the design of advanced catalysts for H2O2 activation in TME, which holds great promise for practical clinical applications.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An automated algorithm for calculating the ocean contrast in support of oil spill response
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing of the ocean, contrast in the measured intensity between clean water and other features is used to identify different objects on the ocean surface either directly or indirectly via alteration of the ocean wave spectrum. The damping ratio, a measure of contrast, is increasingly used for operational oil spill monitoring as an aid or alternative to visual inspections by trained personnel, and can in some cases identify thicker oil in a slick. A method is proposed for automatically calculating the contrast based upon the statistical properties of the measured intensity signals from the ocean surface, and shown to work well even for complex slick geometries. The algorithm is demonstrated using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from UAVSAR and Sentinel-1 to show that it can handle multi-frequency and medium-to-high resolution data. The algorithm's flexibility and computational simplicity makes it suitable for real-time processing to support oil spill response.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma in Situ: A Detailed Review of Current Practices
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ is a challenge for breast surgeons, beginning with its difficult radiological detection and continuing with its contentious multimodal treatment and management. It is becoming more common as a result of widespread screening mammography and usually manifests as a cluster of calcifications. Patients are usually asymptomatic or present with a small, palpable lump. It is, however, a premalignant lesion that has the potential to progress to invasive carcinoma and is treated similarly with multimodal therapy. Treatment options currently include total or simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy or lumpectomy with radiation. Tamoxifen and human epidermal growth factor receptor two suppression therapy are examples of adjuvant therapy. A review of consensus guidelines and literature was performed, in which we included the available online literature on the concerned topic from 2000-2022. This article is not a complete review of all the available literature; rather, it is a comprehensive review of the topic and its current management guidelines.

TI  - A novel antenna steering mechanism with self hold-down feature for communication spacecrafts
T2  - CEAS SPACE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Steerable antennas are widely used for Satellite communications. A steerable reflector array antenna is designed to meet in-flight reconfigurability requirements for space applications such as minimized interference and production of fixed spot beams on the ground from an LEO/GEO Satellite. Indian communication Spacecraft in the discussion was being realized as an exclusive communication satellite catering to user service requirements in Ku-band. It has four Ku-band offset-shaped steerable reflectors of 0.6 m aperture diameter. Normally any deploying/moving mechanism needs a hold-down mechanism to resist the launch loads. Any type of hold-down mechanism requires a release actuator and such a dedicated hold-down system requires both mechanical and electrical resources which means increased mass and power requirements. Hence, a separate launch hold-down requirement is also eliminated by moving the mechanism to the dead centre position. The steering mechanism consists of an input link and an output link connected by a coupler link. Antenna is connected to the output link. The input link is driven by a motor. The link lengths are selected such that the output link oscillates by a known angle for specified rotation of the input link through kinematic analysis. When the motor is operated, the input link rotates and in turn moves the output link up and down about the main bearing axis thereby steering the antenna with high accuracy. This paper presents the concept and design details of the novel steering mechanism incorporating a four-bar linkage for steering through small angles ranging from 0 degrees to 5 degrees and back. Additionally, details of hardware realization, performance evaluation through ground testing and on-orbit performance summary are also provided.

TI  - Automated snow avalanche monitoring for Austria: State of the art and roadmap for future work
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Avalanches pose a significant threat to the population and infrastructure of mountainous regions. The mapping and documentation of avalanches in Austria is mostly done by experts during field observations and covers usually only specific localized areas. A comprehensive mapping of avalanches is, however, crucial for the work of local avalanche commissions as well as avalanche warning services to assess, e.g., the avalanche danger. Over the past decade, mapping avalanches from satellite imagery has proven to be a promising and rapid approach to monitor avalanche activity in specific regions. Several recent avalanche detection approaches use deep learning-based algorithms to improve detection rates compared to traditional segmentation algorithms. Building on the success of these deep learning-based approaches, we present the first steps to build a modular data pipeline to map historical avalanche cycles in Copernicus Sentinel-1 imagery of the Austrian Alps. The Sentinel-1 mission has provided free all-weather synthetic aperture radar data since 2014, which has proven suitable for avalanche mapping in a Norwegian test area. In addition, we present a roadmap for setting up a segmentation algorithm, in which a general U-Net approach will serve as a baseline and will be compared with the mapping results of additional algorithms initially applied to autonomous driving. We propose to train the U-Net using labeled training dataset of avalanche outlines from Switzerland, Norway and Greenland. Due to the lack of training and validation data from Austria, we plan to compile the first avalanche archive for Austria. Meteorological variables, e.g., precipitation or wind, are highly important for the release of avalanches. In a completely new approach, we will therefore consider weather station data or outputs of numerical weather models in the learning-based algorithm to improve the detection performance. The mapping results in Austria will be complemented with pointwise field measurements of the MOLISENS platform and the RIEGL VZ-6000 terrestrial laser scanner.

TI  - Atmospheric-correction-free red tide quantification algorithm for GOCI based on machine learning combined with a radiative transfer simulation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite ocean color observation has been an effective way to detect red tide in a wide coastal area of many countries. However, red tide water, which has high red and infra-red reflectance, often causes failure in atmospheric correction, making quantification algorithms based on remote sensing reflectance produce large errors. This study proposes a new framework that tackles the difficulties in red tide quantification stemming from atmospheric variability, limited in-situ training data, and image artifacts, through the combined use of radiative simulation, machine learning, and in-situ measurements. The framework was applied to the geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) to monitor Margalefidinium blooms that are frequent in Korean coasts. The estimation results were validated first quantitatively with independent ship survey data, and then qualitatively with other 3 red tide algorithms. Finally, the operational robustness of the proposed framework was analyzed based on the data acquired in the entire outbreak period in 2018. The results showed that the proposed algorithm produced a high correlation with field data (R-2 similar to 0.89) and high detection rate and low false alarms compared to the other red tide algorithms. The monitoring result for 2018 also demonstrated that the initiation, expansion, peak, and termination of red tide were successfully identified by the satellite data, which coincides with the field survey results provided by the national fishery agency.

TI  - Mapping tree species diversity in temperate montane forests using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and topography data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on spatial patterns of tree species diversity (TSD) is essential for biodiversity assessment, forest disturbance monitoring, and the management and conservation of forest resources. TSD mapping ap-proaches based on the Spectral Variability Hypothesis (SVH) could provide a reliable alternative to image classification methods. However, such methods have not been tested in large-scale TSD mapping using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. In this study, we developed a new workflow for large-scale TSD mapping in an approximately 4000 km2 temperate montane forest using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery-based heterogeneity metrics and topographic data. Through a systematic comparison of model performance in 24 prediction scenarios with different combinations of input variables, and a correlation analysis between six image heterogeneity metrics and two in-situ TSD indicators (species richness S and Shannon-Wiener diversity H '), we assessed the effects of vegetation phenology, image heterogeneity metrics, and sensor type on the accuracy of TSD pre-dictions. Our results show that (1) the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery produced higher ac-curacy of TSD predictions compared to the Sentinel-2 data alone, and that the further inclusion of topographic data yielded the highest accuracy (S: R2 = 0.562, RMSE = 1.502; H ': R2 = 0.628, RMSE = 0.231); (2) both Multi -Temporal and Spectral-Temporal-Metric data capture phenology-related information of tree species and signif-icantly improved the accuracy of TSD predictions; (3) texture metrics outperformed other image heterogeneity metrics (i.e., Coefficient of Variation, Rao's Q, Convex Hull Volume, Spectral Angle Mapper, and the Convex Hull Area), and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived image heterogeneity metrics were most effective in predicting TSD; and (4) the spatial distribution of TSD showed a clear decrease trend along the altitudinal gradient (r = -0.61 for S and -0.45 for H ') and varied significantly among forest types. Our results suggest a good potential of the SVH-based approaches combined with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data for large-scale TSD mapping in temperate montane forests. The TSD maps generated in our study will be valuable for forest biodiversity assessments and for developing management and conservation measures.

TI  - Saving philosopher Descartes: Valentin Asmus as a guardian of culture
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Early in his career, Valentin Asmus gave a polemical lecture on Descartes's dialectics, and during the "Thaw" he published a book on Rene Descartes's life and scientific work. Asmus was the guardian of classical philosophical culture in the worst of times, when it was attacked by ideologically biased and semi-literate "Red professors." They proclaimed Descartes founder of "modern idealism" and of a "mechanical worldview" hostile to dialectics. Asmus responded by arguing that Descartes had contributed much to the development of the dialectic and materialist view of the world-this was the only possible way to rehabilitate Descartes's philosophical legacy from ideological accusations. In his 1956 book, Asmus gave an overview of Descartes's philosophy as a whole. He was fluent in the philosophical techniques of Marxist histmat (short for "historical materialism"); at the same time, the portrait he draws of Descartes clearly shows the Kantian way of thinking, which Asmus learned from the schoolroom in the pre-revolutionary period.

TI  - Ground penetrating radar investigation and georeferencing without global satellite navigation systems: The case history of the amphitheatre of Lecce, Italy
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a case history relative to ground penetrating radar measurements performed close to the Roman amphitheatre of Lecce, Italy. We have performed a classical data elaboration with focusing of the data and slicing putting into evidence hidden details of the structure of the monument. It will be shown that the interpretation of the ground penetrating radar data is meaningfully helped by the consultation of ancient documents, which makes the final result multidisciplinary. Finally, we have georeferenced the data matching the shape of the depth slices with the shape of the investigated roads. In fact, we did not have at disposal any differential global satellite navigation systems. Indeed, this can be a method exploitable in cases when satellite data are not available, either because the area is shadowed or because the user does not have a differential global satellite navigation system. The proposed geographical matching is achieved by means of the matching between the shape of the slices and those of the physical obstacles present in the field. Therefore, it is essentially based on a continuous of points, and so it is probably more precise than a method based on the only vertexes. In particular, the proposed procedure does not require any deformation of the shape of the slice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover in the Brazilian semiarid region have intensified, due to climate change and anthropic activities, amplifying land degradation and the desertification process. In this scenario, the objective of this study is to evaluate the spatio-temporality of the conditions of loss and gain of land use and land cover in the Brazilian semiarid region, with an emphasis on Caatinga and water resources. From the satellite environmental monitoring of the municipality Boqueira similar to o, Paraiba, Brazil, digital cloud processing was performed via Google Earth Engine (GEE) based on Landsat geospatial data, between the years 2012 and 2021. The biophysical pa-rameters, surface albedo, vegetation indices, and thematic maps of land use and occupation were used in the study. The natural vegetation and water bodies decreased while the areas of exposed land and pasture increased significantly. The albedo and vegetation indices indicated areas with a high water deficit in the Caatinga. Highlighted the absence of vegetation resilience, with a reduction of Caatinga (9.33%) and low water availability (2.24%) in the study area.

AB  - Outdoor workers are exposed to many hazards, including solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Identifying, reporting, analyzing and tracking the exposures or health outcomes of outdoor workers have not generally been formally considered. This article aims to summarize the best practices/strategies for creating an occupational sun exposure or skin cancer surveillance system for outdoor workers and to understand the key barriers and facilitators to the development of such a system. For the design of a successful occupational safety and health (OSH) surveillance system five occupational surveillance strategies are summarized: exposure registry, disease registry, disease screening/medical surveillance, sentinel event surveillance, and disease surveillance via data linkage. Ten key considerations are identified, including identifying a clear goal, a defined target population and stakeholder involvement, five critical barriers are highlighted including underreporting and funding, and five vital facilitators are recognized including communication/collaboration and a simple reporting process.

TI  - Study of early identification method for large landslides in high vegetation coverage areas of Southwest China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide disasters with dense vegetation and steep terrain, and high concealment frequently occur in Southwest China. Current field surveys, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technologies all have limitations in complex environments with high vegetation coverage. In this study, the landslide in Xinmo Village, Mao County, Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, was used as the research object. The slope types were divided according to the regional stratum occurrence and slope direction, and the dip slope was identified as the pre-selected area for the landslide. Nine vegetation indexes were constructed based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, and Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) with high correlation was selected as the indicator of landslide change to estimate the vegetation coverage. The relationship between vegetation anomalies and landslide creep was analyzed by superimposing slope structure and vegetation spatial variation characteristics. The results showed that from May 2015 to May 2017, the vegetation coverage in the landslide main source area, above the deformation body, local collapse area, and around the washouts showed a significant decrease; i.e., as the time of landslide was approaching, some vegetation in the study area was affected by the landslide deformation and the growth condition became worse. Between April and May 2017, the vegetation coverage in the area not affected by the landslide was less than 0.6 (i.e., bare ground area) decreased abruptly, with change rates of 78.4, 87.7, and 89.7%, respectively, which is consistent with the development pattern of vegetation in the growing period; while the reduction rate of image elements in the vegetation abnormal area was only 20.5%, which judged that the vegetation might be affected by landslide creep and the growth and development were hindered. The study shows that there is an obvious spatial-temporal correlation between vegetation anomalies and landslide deformation during the landslide creep phase, which indirectly reflects the evolution process of landslide gradual destabilization and provides a theoretical basis for the early identification of landslides in high vegetation coverage areas.

TI  - Grassland cut detection based on Sentinel-2 time series to respond to the environmental and technical challenges of the Austrian fodder production for livestock feeding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between yield and quality of grassland fodder is an important factor for livestock farmers to consider when deciding the timing of grassland cuts. Even for experienced farmers, estimating this relationship is difficult because external factors such as weather can affect the growth rate of plants. Satellite remote sensing techniques have good potential for the modelling of fodder biomass and quality. However, more accurate grassland cut dates are needed. Unfortunately, current cut detection methods vary in both form, function and accuracy and a common framework for cut detection does not yet exist, especially for in-season cut estimation. The aim of this study is to develop an improved methodology for Austrian fodder production systems that can be used for both post-season and in-season cut detection. In the first case, cuts are detected at the end of the vegetation period and used for post-season assessment at national and regional levels. In the second case, cuts are detected in near-real-time during the season, and they can be used to model yield and quality. The approach is tested across the Austrian landscape on mown grasslands using freely available Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The method uses a fitted NDVI curve obtained by iteratively smoothing the upper envelope of the actual observations using the Whittaker smoother. Cuts are detected by meeting a threshold in the difference between the fitted NDVI curve and the actual observed NDVI values. Additional innovative steps were developed to reduce the impact of cloud cover on the results for timely and accurate cut detection, including a gradient boosting algorithm to detect false positive cuts due to missed clouds. A set of rules for the method was trained on 97 plots and validated on a further 502 plots over three years (2020, 2021 and 2022). The method performed well in plots with two to four cuts per season, but occasionally struggled in more intensively managed systems, most likely due to a rule preventing two cuts within 27 days. A pooled post-season cut date detection f-score of 0.79 suggests that the method can accurately detect cuts, with absolute detection errors of <5 days. The main misclassifications were the results of (thin and semi-transparent) clouds being erroneously detected as cuts. With an f-score of 0.80 and total absolute delayed detection of approximately 6 days, the inseason cut date detection performs similarly to the post-season configuration. This indicates a high potential for near-real-time applications. Our results moreover indicate a general improvement of existing methodologies despite performing the cut detection across the fragmented, mountainous and diverse Austrian landscape. Future work will include grazed pastures and natural grassland with less intensive human activity.

TI  - Spectroscopic and photometric studies on four solar-type short-period contact binaries in the triple stellar systems
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We reported new spectroscopy and photometry for four short-period binaries, which were acquired by several small telescopes in China from 2020 to 2022. From new spectrum and Large Sky Area Multiobject Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope data, we determined their spectral types of G8V for PZ UMa, G7 for MM Com, and V0685 Peg and G3 for V1055 Her. When compared to the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curve (LC) with a 2-min cadence, the difference between two light maxima for V1055 Her displays a 29.7-d oscillation. Utilizing the Wilson-Devinney program, we deduced 10 photometric solutions from our new and TESS data. Four binaries are W-type ones with variable O'Connell effects. For LC2022.1 (MM Com) and LC2022.9 (V1055 Her),?m(max)=Max.I-Max.II is as large as 15 per cent of variable light amplitude, which may be attributed to the spot's migration and evolution. From the mass-luminosity diagram, the more massive components aref somewhat evolved main-sequence stars, whereas the less massive ones are overluminous as a result of energy exchange. Based on all eclipse timing residuals, the orbital period variations are preferably described by the light-travel time effects via the presence of additional companions. Their modulation periods range from 10 to 20 yr for four binaries, corresponding the companion's mass ranging from M-3 = 0.11 to 0.34 M-?. Therefore, four solar-type short-period contact binaries (i.e. MM Com, PZ UMa, V0685 Peg, and V1055 Her) may be triple stellar systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes and influencing factors of water clarity in the Yellow Sea over the past 20 years
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency is an important parameter for describing the optical properties of water. It reflects changes in marine environment and is of great significance for guiding the development and protection of marine envi-ronment. In this study, based on the algorithm proposed by Lee et al. in 2015, water transparency in the Yellow Sea from 2003 to 2022 was inverted. The results revealed that, in terms of spatial distribution, the water in western region of the Yellow Sea had relatively low transparency, whereas the water in the central and southern regions had high transparency. Regarding temporal trends, declining transparency was observed throughout most of the study period, but the trends reversed and transparency began to increase in 2017. Empirical orthogonal function analysis confirmed that water transparency was primarily influenced by the optical con-stituents of water. Long-term monitoring of water clarity is of significant importance for the preservation of marine ecological environments.

TI  - High-frequency zones of phytoplankton blooms in the Rio de la Plata Estuary associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the Rio de la Plata Estuary has shown an increase in the frequency and intensity of phyto-plankton blooms with negative impacts on production activities, human health, and biodiversity. Water quality monitoring programs provide samples from the coastal zone alone, which limits the collection of data inside the Estuary and the analysis of the spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton blooms, as well as their relationship with flow rate. In this work, a systematic satellite monitoring of the Estuary was carried out for the first time. Sentinel-2 images captured during 2016-2021 were used along with the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index. It included one year of El Nin & SIM;o, one neutral year and two consecutive years of La Nin & SIM;a. Four zones with the highest frequency of bloom occurrence were delimited. Data on the extent and intensity in which blooms occurred were extracted and related to the flow rates of the main tributaries using Bayesian models. The most intense and frequent blooms were detected on the southern and northern coasts, respectively (maximum values of 515 km2 in January 2021, NDCI>0.06), followed by a wide area of intense phytoplankton development inside the Estuary. Blooms were more frequent in warmer months, with elevated Chl-a concentrations in 75% of the months of the study period on the Argentine coast, and 50% on the Uruguayan coast. Blooms were positively correlated with low flows. Therefore, the most extensive and intense bloom episodes occur during La Nin & SIM;a events. During El Nin & SIM;o, the high flows transport the biomass originating in the Estuary and in the hydroelectric reservoirs located upstream, which can even be transported along the northern coast. This work identified a recurrent pattern of phytoplankton blooms and the hydro-meteorological conditions that favor their magnifi-cation in a context of strong climate variability in the region and estuarine eutrophication.

TI  - Optimizing rice in-season nitrogen topdressing by coupling experimental and modeling data with machine learning algorithms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The modern in-season crop N recommendation approaches should have high reliability in promoting agricultural sustainability. These approaches are relevant to soil properties, meteorological conditions, management prac-tices, and crop in-season growing status. This study aims to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to incorporate the above variables as well as the field reactive nitrogen (N) losses (i.e., N damage cost) simulated by a DeNi-trification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to develop a new strategy for optimizing rice in-season topdressing N (TN) usage. Rice field experiments with multiple N treatments and rice varieties were carried out during 2015-2021 at four study sites in eastern China. Four ML algorithms, namely random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), lasso regression (LSR), and partial least square regression (PLSR) were used to develop in-season prediction models of yield and reactive N losses by combining soil, meteorological, and management data with crop remote sensing data. The observed in-season agronomic optimum N rates (AONR) that can maximize rice yield at different sites were in the range of 116.5 to 177.4 kg N ha -1, while the in-season economic optimum N rates (EONR) that can maximize marginal revenue (i.e., yield income minus N fertilizer costs and N damage costs) were in the range of 97.4 to 163.6 kg N ha -1. The developed ML models were further used to simulate yield and marginal revenue responses to a series of assumed TN rates (0-300 kg N ha -1, gradient = 20 kg N ha -1). Comparably, RFR model and SVR model were more suitable for determining optimum TN rates, because their simulated response curves of yield and marginal revenue fit the normal regulation (linear plus plateau or single-peak shapes). Independent validation results showed that the in-season AONR and EONR predicted by RFR and SVR well accorded with the observed values (R2 >= 0.64, RRMSE <= 18.3 %), and the accuracy of ML models containing both historical and in-season meteorological information is superior to ML models that contain in-season meteorological information only. The proposed ML-based strategy is expected to help the regional rice production systems precisely manage N use, improve net profits, and reduce environmental footprints.

TI  - Leveraging Google Earth Engine to estimate foliar C: N ratio in an African savannah rangeland using Sentinel 2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands are important fodder for livestock and wildlife, and provide a range of ecosystem services to the environment. Foliar nutrients such as nitrogen, carbon, and plant pigments such as chlorophyll can be used as indicators of rangeland stress, and play a vital role in determining their health and productivity. The C:N ratio is a key factor in regulating nutrient utilization efficiency and productivity in plants. Understanding the C:N ratio in rangelands could therefore help herders understand the nutrient limitations, and herbivores distribution to facilitate strategic grazing plans and management. Therefore, there is a need for spatially accurate and up-to-date information on C:N ratio to understand and monitor rangeland health for proactive rangeland management. Remote sensing approaches are spatially explicit, cost-effective, and efficient in monitoring foliar nutrient ratio in rangelands. Whereas, the new generation and advanced Sentinel 2 multispectral sensor has the potential to monitor vegetation health, the strength of its spectral settings in relation to predicting the C:N ratio in rangelands remains largely unexplored. Advanced and freely available Sentinel 2 multispectral sensor (MSI) with specialized red edge bands offer unprecedented opportunities in mapping and monitoring rangeland nutrients. Hence, this study examined the prospect of combined Sentinel-2 (MSI) spectral bands and vegetation indices, and the random forest algorithm to map the C: N ratio within a rangeland. To determine the C:N ratio distribution, the Random Forest and the Boruta variable selection were employed to assess the performance of the combined Sentinel 2 spectral bands and vegetation indices models. Results show an estimated accuracy R2 of 81 and 74, with RMSE of 2.38 and 2.68 for calibration and validation datasets of the C:N ratio model established by combining the spectral bands and vegetation indices. The random forest variable selection model indicates that the red edge bands, and near-infrared were the most valuable in predicting the C:N ratio. The red edge and near-infrared (Inverted Red-edge Chlorophyll Index) and near-infrared and red band (Enhanced Vegetation Index) vegetation indices were important predictor variables for estimating the C:N ratio. This study demonstrates the prospects and value of mapping the geographic distribution of the C:N ratio in rangelands using high spatial resolution Sentinel 2 MSI. This information will not only help determine nutrient deficiencies in rangelands but will also provide informed recommendation in mitigating landscape degeneration to allow for rangeland regeneration.

TI  - Radiotherapy or Surgery of the Axilla After a Positive Sentinel Node in Breast Cancer: 10-Year Results of the Randomized Controlled EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.PURPOSE The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 10981-22023 AMAROS trial evaluated axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus axillary radiotherapy (ART) in patients with cT1-2, node-negative breast cancer and a positive sentinel node (SN) biopsy. At 5 years, both modalities showed excellent and comparable axillary control, with significantly less morbidity after ART. We now report the preplanned 10-year analysis of the axillary recurrence rate (ARR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS), and an updated 5-year analysis of morbidity and quality of life.METHODS In this open-label multicenter phase III noninferiority trial, 4,806 patients underwent SN biopsy; 1,425 were node-positive and randomly assigned to either ALND (n = 744) or ART (n = 681).RESULTS Per intention-to-treat analysis, 10-year ARR cumulative incidence was 0.93% (95% CI, 0.18 to 1.68; seven events) after ALND and 1.82% (95% CI, 0.74 to 2.94; 11 events) after ART (hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% CI, 0.67 to 4.39). There were no differences in OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52) or DFS (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.46). ALND was associated with a higher lymphedema rate in updated 5-year analyses (24.5% v 11.9%; P<.001). Quality-of-life scales did not differ by treatment through 5 years. Exploratory analysis showed a 10-year cumulative incidence of second primary cancers of 12.1% (95% CI, 9.6 to 14.9) after ART and 8.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 10.7) after ALND.CONCLUSION This 10-year analysis confirms a low ARR after both ART and ALND with no difference in OS, DFS, and locoregional control. Considering less arm morbidity, ART is preferred over ALND for patients with SNpositive cT1-2 breast cancer. (c) 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Balpara: A Practical Approach to Working With Ontological Difference in Indigenous Land & Sea Management
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Indigenous peoples are increasingly entering conservation partnerships with non-Indigenous actors. While these partnerships can provide resources to assist in the care of ancestral homelands, a lack of appreciation for ontological difference can lead to the restriction of self-determination and harm Indigenous ways of knowing, doing and being. For conservation to succeed globally, it is vital to share practical approaches that can help to better recognize and negotiate ontological differences and promote genuinely pluralistic partnerships. In this paper we describe our decade-long experiment in working with ontological difference in Indigenous Land and Sea Management. We present 'Balpara' as an emerging approach to good-faith partnerships, while reflecting on benefits, challenges and limitations. Further, we offer key principles that have guided our pluriversal collaborations as inspiration for others interested in working generatively with ontological difference in Indigenous-led conservation.

TI  - When Less Can Be More: How the 10-Year Updated Results From the Randomized Controlled AMAROS Trial Should Affect Axillary Management in the Setting of a Positive Node
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.It is important to reflect on how far we as a medical community have come when treating breast cancer. Ongoing research, clinical trials, and better understanding of biology have transformed our understanding and treatment of breast cancer. There is still much to learn. Although progress was slow for decades, treatments have evolved more quickly in the recent past. The Halsted radical mastectomy, first popularized in 1894, was performed for almost a century, and although it decreased local recurrence, it did not improve survival. This well-intentioned surgery disfigured women and was abandoned as better systemic therapies were introduced and less aggressive surgical procedures were found to be equivalent in clinical trials. The evolution of trials in the modern era has taught us an important lesson. De-escalation of surgical interventions in the setting of improved systemic therapy can lead to better patient outcomes. We present a case of a clinician with an early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma responsive to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and who subsequently underwent a partial mastectomy with axillary sentinal lymph node biopsy. Although clinically node-negative, she was pathologically node-positive, and concerned about both optimizing her outcomes and minimizing the risk of lymphedema. The release of 10-year follow-up data from the AMAROS trial furthers our knowledge and understanding of the impact of local control measures of the axilla. The concepts illustrated by the findings of AMAROS may be applied in clinical practice and ultimately help us make rational treatment choices and support shared decision making for patients like ours.

TI  - Restoring Asia's roar: Opportunities for tiger recovery across the historic range
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife conservation in the Anthropocene requires bold conservation solutions including restoration of ecosystems and species. The recovery of large carnivore populations is a conservation goal which can generate significant benefits in terms of ecosystem services, ecological functionality, and human well-being. Tigers Panthera tigris, Asia's most iconic species, are currently restricted to less than 10% of their historic range with recent national extinctions from a number of countries in mainland Southeast Asia. Tiger recovery through range expansion requires suitable habitat, a robust prey base, and high levels of institutional support for conservation. We explored government support for conservation to produce a ranking of the political opportunities for tiger restoration across current and former tiger range countries. We used this analysis, in combination with globally remotely sensed data-sets on human impact, to show that there is potential for significant tiger range expansion. We identified large expanses of currently unoccupied, but potentially suitable, habitat in at least 14 countries including all extant tiger range countries and four countries with extirpated tiger populations - Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Kazakhstan. Thirty-two percent of expansion areas were within 50-km, and 50% within 100-km, of current tiger populations highlighting that in many landscapes range expansion could be driven by the natural dispersal of tigers provided connectivity is maintained or enhanced. The proportion of potential range within existing protected areas varied between <5% in India, Indonesia, and China, to >60% in Thailand and Cambodia. As such socially appropriate conservation approaches, in collaboration with local communities, will be necessary to support tiger recovery in many areas. We recommend that some of the areas which we have identified should be highlighted as significant for future tiger conservation by tiger range country governments. Whilst the landscapes and sites which we identify will require detailed ground-truthing, and all tiger reintroductions need extensive planning and feasibility assessments, safeguarding these areas for human-carnivore coexistence could provide significant planetary benefits and support both tiger recovery and Global Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - A retrospective investigation of feather corticosterone in a highly contaminated white-tailed eagle<i> (Haliaeetus</i><i> albicilla)</i> population
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as organochlorines (OCs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), is associated with adverse health effects in wildlife. Many POPs have been banned and conse-quently their environmental concentrations have declined. To assess both temporal trends of POPs and their detrimental impacts, raptors are extensively used as biomonitors due to their high food web position and high contaminant levels. White-tailed eagles (WTEs; Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Baltic ecosystem represent a sentinel species of environmental pollution, as they have suffered population declines due to reproductive failure caused by severe exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) during the 1960s through 1980s. However, there is a lack of long-term studies that cover a wide range of environmental contaminants and their effects at the individual level. In this study, we used 135 pooled samples of shed body feathers collected in 1968-2012 from breeding WTE pairs in Sweden. Feathers constitute a temporal archive for substances incorporated into the feather during growth, including corticosterone, which is the primary avian glucocorticoid and a stress-associated hormone. Here, we analysed the WTE feather pools to investigate annual variations in feather corticosterone (fCORT), POPs (OCs and PBDEs), and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (SIs; dietary proxies). We examined whether the expected fluctuations in POPs affected fCORT (8-94 pg. mm-1) in the WTE pairs. Despite clear temporal declining trends in POP concentrations (p < 0.01), we found no sig-nificant associations between fCORT and POPs or SIs (p > 0.05 in all cases). Our results do not support fCORT as a relevant biomarker of contaminant-mediated effects in WTEs despite studying a highly contaminated popu-lation. However, although not detecting a relationship between fCORT, POP contamination and diet, fCORT represents a non-destructive and retrospective assessment of long-term stress physiology in wild raptors other-wise not readily available.

T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing techniques, such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), have the potential to document and monitor surface deformation up to a millimetre scale especially in areas where ground monitoring is not feasible. The InSAR technique has been used to isolate and map some current and potential landslide areas in Kinnaur region of the Satluj Valley in Himachal Pradesh. The fragile ecosystem of Kinnaur has been challenged by the shifting climatic pattern and immense anthropogenic pressure associated with burgeoning hydroelectric projects, leading to destructive landslides of epic proportions. Three recent landslides that occurred at Ribba and Pangi villages of the Satluj River Valley and the Batseri landslide in the Sangla Valley were studied and potential landslide areas along the Satluj Valley were mapped with Sentinel-1 multi-baseline interferograms using data acquired between 2016 and 2021. The analysis suggests significant changes in velocities (+/- 11 mm/y) where the subsidence rate ranges from -6 to -11 mm/y with a cumulative displacement of +/- 45 mm/y. Our study highlights the potential locations for future landslides and provides an early warning landslide map to support future disaster prevention in highly deformed regions.

TI  - Species-based Mapping of Carbon Stocks in Salt Marsh: Tianjin Coastal Zone as a Case Study
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of geographical position and high carbon storage potential, coastal salt marshes are recognized as an essential component of blue carbon and play an indispensable role in regulating climate and reaching carbon neutrality targets. Nonetheless, accurately mapping salt marsh carbon stock on a regional scale remains challenging. The framework of mapping salt marsh carbon stock was developed by using machine learning (temporal-phenological-spatial) models, vegetation index aboveground biomass inversion models, and above/belowground biomass allometric models. Here, we employed Sentinel-2 time series images based on Google Earth Engine in combination with field survey data to produce a 10-m map of salt marsh carbon stocks in the Tianjin coastal zone (TCZ). The total and average carbon stocks of TCZ salt marsh vegetation in 2020 were approximately 6.24 x 103 Mg C and 45.02 Mg C/ha, respectively. In terms of vegetative species, the carbon stock was ranked by Spartina alterniflora (2.89 x 103 Mg C) > Phragmites australis (1.74 x 103 Mg C) > Suaeda salsa (1.61 x 103 Mg C). The carbon density of 3 representative salt marsh species sampled in Tianjin were calculated: S. alterniflora (18.63 Mg/ha) > P. australis (6.49 Mg/ ha) > S. salsa (1.40 Mg/ha). The random forest algorithm shows the best performance in classifying, with an overall accuracy of 87.21%. This work created the replicable and generic technical framework for mapping carbon stocks in salt marshes, which supports blue carbon accounting and provides case support for "nature-based solutions."

TI  - African Christianity and healing: Implications for pastoral care
T2  - IN DIE SKRIFLIG-IN LUCE VERBI
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid rise of Christianity in the developing world, and specifically in Africa, has asked renewed questions about pastoral theology and pastoral care. The African worldview, as a possible explanation for the increase in Christianity, is one of the most cited reasons for this growth. Pentecostalism and the Charismatic movement are referred to as `new' Christianity. The new Christianity is influenced by the practices and characteristics of the African worldview. Wholistic healing derives from the African worldview perspective that reduces the dichotomy between spiritual and science, or spirit and body. This approach to healing, differs from the Western worldview that approaches healing from a biomedical perspective. The disparity in worldviews and subsequent different approaches to healing, are assessed against the backdrop of the implications for pastoral theology and pastoral care. Contribution: The African worldview and `new' Christianity contribute by engaging critically with the separation of the two worldviews, the narrow use of experience within the dialogical movement of theory and praxis, and the key concepts of pastoral theology such as illness and suffering, reconciliation, shepherding, and pastoring.

TI  - Risk factors for the development of severe breast cancer-related lymphedema: a retrospective cohort study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSevere lymphedema presents a challenge in terms of treatment due to the significant formation of scar tissue that accompanies it. The aim of this study was to identify intraoperative and preoperative risk factors of severe lymphedema and to develop a nomogram for estimating the risk of severe lymphedema within 3 years of surgery.MethodData was collected from a retrospective cohort of 326 patients with BCRL at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from November 2015 to November 2018. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictive indicators of severe lymphedema. A nomogram was developed to further improve the clinical applicability.ResultsIn the retrospective cohort, the ratio of severe/non-severe lymphedema within 3 years of surgery was 1:3. Independent risk factors for severe lymphedema were determined to be age, positive lymph nodes, interpectoral (Rotter's) lymph nodes (IPNs) dissection, and educational level. IPNs dissection was found to contribute greatly to the development of severe lymphedema with a higher odds ratio (7.76; 95% CI: 3.87-15.54) than other risk factors. A nomogram was developed by integrating age, positive lymph nodes, IPNs dissection, and educational level, which yielded a C-index of 0.810 and 0.681 in the training and validation cohort, respectively. This suggested a moderate performance of the nomogram in predicting the risk of severe lymphedema within 3 years of surgery. The cut-off values of the low-, medium- and high-risk probabilities were 0.0876 and 0.3498, and the severe lymphedema exhibited a significantly higher risk probability as compared with the non-severe lymphedema.ConclusionThis study identified the risk factors of severe lymphedema and highlighted the substantial contribution of IPNs dissection to the severity of lymphedema.

TI  - Trends in Severe Outcomes Among Adult and Pediatric Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program, March 2020 to May 2022
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Trends in COVID-19 severe outcomes have significant implications for the health care system and are key to informing public health measures. However, data summarizing trends in severe outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Canada are not well described.OBJECTIVE To describe trends in severe outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Active prospective surveillance in this cohort study was conducted from March 15, 2020, to May 28, 2022, at a sentinel network of 155 acute care hospitals across Canada. Participants included adult (aged >= 18 years) and pediatric (aged 0-17 years) patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at a Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP)-participating hospital.EXPOSURES COVID-19 waves, COVID-19 vaccination status, and age group.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The CNISP collected weekly aggregate data on the following severe outcomes: hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), receipt of mechanical ventilation, receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and all-cause in-hospital death.RESULTS Among 1 513 065 admissions, the proportion of adult (n = 51 679) and pediatric (n = 4035) patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was highest in waves 5 and 6 of the pandemic compared with waves 1 to 4 (77.3 vs 24.7 per 1000 patient admissions). Despite this, the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 who were admitted to an ICU, received mechanical ventilation, received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and died were each significantly lower in waves 5 and 6 when compared with waves 1 through 4. Admission to the ICU and in-hospital all-cause death rates were significantly higher among those who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 when compared with those who were fully vaccinated (incidence rate ratio, 4.3 and 3.9, respectively) or fully vaccinated with an additional dose (incidence rate ratio, 12.2 and 15.1, respectively).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study of patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is important to reduce the burden on the Canadian health care system as well as severe outcomes associated with COVID-19.

TI  - Response of macrophyte litter decomposition in global blue carbon ecosystems to climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are important nature-based solutions for climate change--mitigation. However, current debates question the reliability and contribution of BCEs under future climatic-scenarios. The answer to this question depends on ecosystem processes driving carbon-sequestration and -storage, such as primary production and decomposition, and their future rates. We performed a global meta-analysis on litter decomposition rate constants (k) in BCEs and predicted changes in carbon release from 309 studies. The relationships between k and climatic factors were examined by extracting remote-sensing data on air temperature, sea-surface temperature, and precipitation aligning to the decomposition time of each experiment. We constructed global numerical models of litter decomposition to forecast k and carbon release under different scenarios. The current k averages at 27 +/- 3 x 10(-2) day(-1) for macroalgae were higher than for seagrasses (1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(-2) day-1), mangroves (1.6 +/- 0.1 x 10(-2) day(-1)) and tidal marshes (5.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3) day(-1)). Macrophyte k increased with both air temperature and precipitation in intertidal BCEs and with sea surface temperature for subtidal seagrasses. Above a temperature threshold for vascular plant litter at similar to 25 degrees C and similar to 20 degrees C for macroalgae, k drastically increased with increasing temperature. However, the direct effect of high temperatures on k are obscured by other factors in field experiments compared with laboratory experiments. We defined "fundamental" and "realized" temperature response to explain this effect. Based on relationships for realized temperature response, we predict that proportions of decomposed litter will increase by 0.9%-5% and 4.7%-28.8% by 2100 under low-( 2 degrees C) and high-warming conditions (4 degrees C) compared to 2020, respectively. Net litter carbon sinks in BCEs will increase due to higher increase in litter C production than in decomposition by 2100 compared to 2020 under RCP 8.5. We highlight that BCEs will play an increasingly important role in future climate change-mitigation. Our findings can be leveraged for blue carbon accounting under future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Deriving a year 2000 glacier inventory for New Zealand from the existing 2016 inventory
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to adverse snow and cloud conditions, only a few inventories are available for the maritime glaciers in New Zealand. These are difficult to compare as different approaches and baseline data have been used to create them. In consequence, glacier fluctuations in New Zealand over the past two decades are only known for a few glaciers based on field observations. Here we present the results of a new inventory for the 'year 2000' (some scenes are from 2001 and 2002) that is based on glacier outlines from a recently published inventory for the year 2016 and allowed consistent change assessment for nearly 3000 glaciers over this period. The year 2000 inventory was created by manual on-screen digitizing using Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery (15 m panchromatic band) in the background and the year 2016 outlines as a starting point. Major challenges faced were late and early seasonal snow, clouds and shadow, the geo-location mismatch between Landsat and Sentinel-2 as well as the correct interpretation of ice patches and ice under debris cover. In total, we re-mapped 2967 glaciers covering an area of 885.5 km(2) in 2000, which is 91.7 km(2) (or 10.4%) more than the 793.8 km(2) mapped in 2016. Area change rates (mean rate -0.65% a(-1)) increase towards smaller glaciers. Strongest area loss from 2000 to 2016 occurred at elevations similar to 1900 m but the highest relative loss was found below 800 m a.s.l. In total, 109 glaciers split into two or more entities and 264 had wasted away by 2016.

TI  - Population Dynamics and Estimation of Damage of the Spittlebug <i>Aeneolamia varia</i> on Sugarcane in Colombia by Using remote Sensing and Machine Learning Tools
T2  - SUGAR TECH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spittlebug (Aeneolamia varia) is one of the most important sugarcane pests in Colombia, where a recent increase in population and distribution specially in southwestern Colombia have led to the need for new technologies for integrated pest management. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatial distribution of this pest in commercial sugarcane fields and to validate machine learning (ML) tools for indirect injury detection and impact on yield (damage) using satellite images. This study was carried out in fields grown with the CC 01-1940 variety in El Cerrito, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, where systematic sampling of the populations (number of adults and nymphs per stem) was carried out. The spatial aggregation and distribution were determined using Moran's index and point patterns, sequence observations, and analysis with distance indicators (Sadie). The indirect injury detection and quantification of the impact on production were carried out with a ML approach using satellite image products with 10 m spatial and five days temporal resolutions, obtained from a Sentinel-2 sensor using Google Earth Engine. The results indicated that spittlebug populations had an aggregate spatial behavior and high spatial dependence. In addition, the ML algorithms predicted spittlebug injury, and the effect on production was estimated at 26.4 tons of cane per hectare, which represented a 17% reduction in the expected yield. The use of spatial analysis and remote sensing tools are an alternative for indirect detection of injury and for understanding population dynamics of the pest in sugarcane, so they can become instrumental for decision-making on an integrated pest management program.

TI  - Effects of typhoon and upwelling on Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> distribution in the northeastern coast of Hainan during Summer
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons or upwelling are thought to promote higher phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in many previous studies. However, the combined effects of typhoons and upwelling have been less studied in the South China Sea. Based on satellite remote sensing data, we investigated potential contributions of temperature-characterizing upwelling and typhoon events to Chl-a changes in the Hainan northeast area. Results showed that the Chl-a concentration was 0.80 mg m(-3) at the coastal upwelling index (CUI) of 1.7 degrees C in the summer of 2020 when there were no typhoons crossing the area. The CUI (1.01 degrees C) of typhoon-influenced period in 2019 was 0.21 degrees C higher than that of typhoon-free period in 2019. And the Chl-a also increased from 0.70 mg m(-3) to 0.99 mg m(-3). In comparison, during the typhoon-free period, with the higher CUI, there was the higher concentration of Chl-a. In addition, the typhoon affected Chl-a concentration is significantly higher than that in the other two typhoon-free periods of 2019 and 2020. Though the typhoon has a limited effect on the upwelling intensity, the Chl-a concentration is much higher than when the upwelling acts alone. This is due to the combined effect of typhoon (vertical mixing and runoff) and upwelling. The above results indicate that upwelling dominated the changes in Chl-a concentration in the Hainan northeast upwelling area during the typhoon-free period. In contrast, strong vertical mixing and runoff dominated the changes of Chl-a concentration during the typhoon-influenced period in the above area.

TI  - Ice-nucleating particles in northern Greenland: annual cycles, biological contribution and parameterizations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) can initiate ice formation in clouds at temperatures above - 38 C-? through heterogeneous ice nucleation. As a result, INPs affect cloud microphysical and radiative properties, cloud lifetime, and precipitation behavior and thereby ultimately the Earth's climate. Yet, little is known regarding the sources, abundance and properties of INPs, especially in remote regions such as the Arctic. In this study, 2 -yearlong INP measurements (from July 2018 to September 2020) at Villum Research Station in northern Greenland are presented. A low-volume filter sampler was deployed to collect filter samples for offline INP analysis. An annual cycle of INP concentration (NINP) was observed, and the fraction of heat-labile INPs was found to be higher in months with low to no snow cover and lower in months when the surface was well covered in snow (> 0.8 m). Samples were categorized into three different types based only on the slope of their INP spectra, namely into summer, winter and mix type. For each of the types a temperature-dependent INP parameterization was derived, clearly different depending on the time of the year. Winter and summer types occurred only during their respective seasons and were seen 60 % of the time. The mixed type occurred in the remaining 40 % of the time throughout the year. April, May and November were found to be transition months. A case study comparing April 2019 and April 2020 was performed. The month of April was selected because a significant difference in NINP was observed during these two periods, with clearly higher NINP in April 2020. In parallel to the observed differences in NINP, also a higher cloud-ice fraction was observed in satellite data for April 2020, compared to April 2019. NINP in the case study period revealed no clear dependency on either meteorological parameters or different surface types which were passed by the collected air masses. Overall, the results suggest that the coastal regions of Greenland were the main sources of INPs in April 2019 and 2020, most likely including both local terrestrial and marine sources.

TI  - Case report: Aortoesophageal fistula-an extremely rare but life-threatening cardiovascular cause of hematemesis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is an extremely rare cardiovascular etiology of hematemesis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. As such, its recognition and diagnosis are challenging and may be delayed when such patients present to the emergency department (ED). Without timely surgical intervention, AEF is almost always fatal. Awareness of AEF as a possible diagnosis and consequently early identification of these patients presenting to the ED are therefore crucial in optimizing clinical outcomes. We report a 45-year-old male presenting to the ED with the classical triad of an AEF (Chiari's triad)-midthoracic pain or dysphagia, a sentinel episode of minor hematemesis, then massive hematemesis with risk of exsanguination. The case report highlights the importance of considering the differential diagnosis of AEF when evaluating patients presenting to the ED with hematemesis, especially if they have predisposing risk factors such as prior aortic or esophageal surgeries, aortic aneurysms, or thoracic malignancies. Patients suspected of having AEF should be prioritized for early computed tomography angiography to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Simulation of canopy urban heat island at a block scale based on local climate zones and urban weather generator: a case study of Beijing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The current research on urban heat island (UHI) effect mostly focuses on the analysis of land use type changes and the surface UHI intensity. Few studies on the urban canopy heat island effect at a block scale of local climate zone (LCZ), although the canopy heat island effect is a key factor affecting human thermal comfort. Therefore, this study will combine the LCZ classification system and the urban weather generator (UWG) model to simulate and quantitatively analyse the urban canopy heat island effect in Beijing at the block scale. First, based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral remote sensing images, the residual neural network (ResNet) method was used to obtain the LCZ of Beijing, and the results of LCZs was validated based on the google earth engine (GEE). Then, according to the classification results of local climate zones, the input parameters of the UWG and their corresponding value ranges are calculated. Finally, the UWG model is used to simulate the canopy temperature in different local climate zones, and the urban canopy temperature is validated using the meteorological station dataset. We quantitatively analyse the temperature differences between different types of LCZs. The results shows that the canopy heat island effect in Beijing gradually weakened outward from the city centre. This is mainly due to the relatively dense distribution of compact local climate zones in the centre of Beijing, while the surrounding areas of Beijing have lower building density and better natural coverage. The canopy urban heat island intensity of built-up LCZs is significantly stronger than that of natural-covered LCZs. The heat island intensity of the compact LCZ is higher than that of the open LCZ with the same building height. However, for LCZs with comparable compactness, the heat island intensity of high-level LCZs is higher than that of low-level LCZs.

TI  - Does higher demand for medicinal plants lead to more harvest? Evidence from the dual trade of <i>Nardostachy jatamansi</i> and <i>Fritillaria cirrhosa</i> and Tibetan people's harvesting behavior
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAs the demand for herbal medicines is surging worldwide, regions of medicinal plants are vulnerable to large-scale and unsustainable exploitation for commercial trade and use. Yet, we still lack the understanding about the relationship between indigenous people harvesting and trade practices of medicinal plants and their influencing factors for possible intervention measures. MethodsHere, we combined qualitative and quantitative methods to survey traders (N = 20) and local harvesters (N = 923) from nine Tibetan townships in Hongyuan county, Sichuan Province, on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in China. Specifically, we elucidated the local value chain of medicinal plants trade and harvest of Nardostachy jatamansi and Fritillaria cirrhosa, and explored the factors influencing harvester's willingness to harvest these plants. Furthermore, we empirically tested the constructs of the COM-B model (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation -Behavior) in predicting the sustainable harvesting behavior of medicinal plants. Results and DiscussionOur results revealed that the trade characteristics of N. jatamansi and F. cirrhosa were contrasting, and the sustainability of the former species was largely dependent on the latter one. Importantly, the traders' practices were affected by the supply, while the harvesters' willingness to harvest were mainly influenced by harvest incomes, past harvesting experience, and grassland tenure. Finally, though motivation was not directly affecting harvesting behavior, the harvesters' ecological worldview indirectly affected their harvesting behavior, particularly through the mediation of the level of compliance of village rules and customs. Overall, our results provided crucial insights for the conservation and sustainable management of the valuable wild medicinal plants.

AB  - Micronutrient malnutrition is a global challenge affecting >2 billion people, in particular those with a crop-based diet and limited access to nutrient-rich food sources. Conventional methods for measuring the crop nutrients such as wet chemical analysis of grains are time-consuming and cost-prohibitive and, consequently, unsuitable for the consistent quantification of nutrients across space and time. In this study, we propose a new method that is using PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) and Sentinel-2 images to estimate the nutrient concentrations of crop grains before harvest. We collected grain samples for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat from a farm situated in Italy and measured their nutrient concentrations in the lab. These measurements together with the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images acquired at the main phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) were used as input for twoband vegetation indices (TBVIs) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to predict Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S) and Zinc (Zn). Models' performances were assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For PRISMA images, the best prediction results were obtained for P in soybean (R2 = 0.69), K in soybean (R2 = 0.66), Mg in soybean (R2 = 0.58), Fe in soybean (R2 = 0.57), K in wheat (R2 = 0.57), K in corn (R2 = 0.55), P in wheat (R2 = 0.51), S in rice (R2 = 0.58) using TBVIs. In contrast to PRISMA, PLSR outperformed TBVIs when Sentinel-2 images were used as input. For Sentinel-2, the best predictions were obtained for P in soybean (R2 = 0.73), K in wheat (R2 = 0.67), Mg in soybean (R2 = 0.62), Zn in wheat (R2 = 0.56), Fe in soybean (R2 = 0.52), P in wheat (R2 = 0.52). Our study showed that estimating the nutrient composition of crops using remote sensing images has the potential to change how we approach a cost-effective, timely, and spatially explicit representation of the crops' nutritional quality.

TI  - DinSAR coseismic deformation measurements of the Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake (Chile)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The beginning of radars goes back to the 1930s where its main boost was related to the second world war. Nowadays, the techniques associated with radars are focused around a vast variety of civil, geodetic, and military applications. The development of the synthetic aperture principle, in the 1950s and 1960s, gave birth to a lot of new applications, and together with the technological progress of the last decades, the technique of interferometry with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data became one of the most powerful ones for sensing remotely, with high quality and a vast spatial coverage. We used Sentinel-1 data and the differential interferometry SAR (DinSAR) technique to map and measure the surface deformation related to the 2015 Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake (Chile). We also validated the results, by analysing the temporal variation of coordinates acquired from global navigation satellite system observations and projecting them in the geometry of the SAR system. Using this application we prove the DinSAR technique to be useful and powerful for the observation and analysis of surface deformation caused by the release of stress during the Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake. It proved to be an efficient tool to detect and map the surface deformation with high spatial resolution in an approximate area of 20,000 km(2).

TI  - The assessment of climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic aspects of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Cerrado is the most biodiverse savanna and maintains other biomes. Aware of its significance, this paper evaluated the Brazilian Cerrado's climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic aspects using remote sensing data and spatial statistics (correlation analysis and principal components analysis-PCA). Following the measures of sample adequacy (MSA) and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) tests, seventeen variables were evaluated.ResultsThe MSA revealed that the dataset had a good quality (0.76), and nine variables were selected: elevation, evapotranspiration, active fires, Human Development Index (HDI), land use and land cover (LULC; shrubland and cropland/rainfed), rainfall (spring and autumn), and livestock. The correlation matrix indicated a positive (negative) association between HDI and autumn rainfall (HDI and active fires) with a value of 0.77 (- 0.55). The PCA results determined which three principal components (PC) were adequate for extracting spatial patterns, accounting for 68.02% of the total variance with respective values of 38.59%, 16.89%, and 12.5%. Due to economic development and agribusiness, Cerrado's northern (central, western, and southern) areas had negative (positive) score HDI values, as shown in PC1. Climatic (rainfall-spring and fall) and environmental (cropland/rainfed and shrubland) aspects dominated the PC2, with negative scores in northern and western portions due to the transition zone between Amazon and Cerrado biomes caused by rainfall variability. On the other hand, environmental aspects (LULC-shrubland and elevation) influenced the PC3; areas with high altitudes (> 500 m) received a higher score.ConclusionAgricultural expansion substantially affected LULC, leading to deforestation-caused suppression of native vegetation.

TI  - Investigating land use land cover changes and their effects on land surface temperature and urban heat islands in Sharqiyah Governorate, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) issue is a result of the undesirable effects of urban growth on the environment, such as temperature rises and landscape changes that cause environmental dangers. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) change on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and then study UHI in Sharqiyah from 2001 to 2022 using remote sensing data. This data was collected from the Landsat satellite and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 11A Thermal sensors. A Mono-Window Algorithm was used on Landsat 8 and 9 data to estimate the LST. To determine the LST and UHI, the thermal band was utilized. LULC maps were created using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique. To evaluate various LULC indices in the Sharqiyah and find their correlation with LST, the spectral indices Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bare Land Index (NDBaI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were obtained from the processing of multispectral Landsat data. To check data sources, air temperature measurements for Sharqiyah were also acquired. The results show that urban expansion has increased in a noticeable trend. The built-up area increased by 18.9% during the research phase, and the region's mean LST increased within 3.98 degrees C. The UHI threshold temperature increased by 4.27 degrees C. This research is critical for Planning Engineers and environmental scientists to realize LULC variations effects on LST and to suggest suitable political steps to regulate urbanization in Sharqiyah Governorate.

TI  - Evaluation of predicted loss of different land use and land cover (LULC) due to coastal erosion in Bangladesh
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion is one of the most significant environmental threats to coastal communities globally. In Bangladesh, coastal erosion is a regularly occurring and major destructive process, impacting both human and ecological systems at sea level. The Lower Meghna estuary, located in southern Bangladesh, is among the most vulnerable landscapes in the world to the impacts of coastal erosion. Erosion causes population displacement, loss of productive land area, loss of infrastructure and communication systems, and, most importantly, household livelihoods. With an aim to assess the impacts of historical and predicted shoreline change on different land use and land cover, this study estimated historical shoreline movement, predicted shoreline positions based on historical data, and quantified and assessed past land use and land cover change. Multi-temporal Landsat images from 1988-2021 were used to quantify historical shoreline movement and past land use and land cover. A time-series classification of historical land use and land cover (LULC) were produced to both quantify LULC change and to evaluate the utility of the future shoreline predictions for calculating amounts of lost or newly added land resources by LULC type. Our results suggest that the agricultural land is the most dominant land cover/use (76.04% of the total land loss) lost over the studied period. Our results concluded that the best performed model for predicting land loss was the 10-year time depth and 20-year time horizon model. The 10-year time depth and 20-year time horizon model was also most accurate for agricultural, forested, and inland waterbody land use/covers loss prediction. We strongly believe that our results will build a foundation for future research studying the dynamics of coastal and deltaic environments.

TI  - SWAT-3PG: Improving forest growth simulation with a process-based forest model in SWAT
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a new process-based forest module for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), based on the Physiological Process in Predicting Growth (3-PG) model (SWAT-3PG). The new model allows for improved biomass assimilation, partitioning (stem, foliage, root), and losses (root turnover, foliage loss, mortality). Evaluation at field-scale showed that SWAT-3PG can replicate the different forest biomass components for evergreen forests well. Testing for deciduous and mixed forests sites using remote-sensed data showed that the model can simulate leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) reasonably well and can be used to constrain SWAT-3PG when lack of field data. Sensitivity analysis of SWAT3PG showed its potential in evaluating the impacts of management and climate on forested ecosystems. SWAT3PG can also be of importance to forest managers as it can estimate variables such as plant height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and basal area.

TI  - Spectral unmixing based random forest classifier for detecting surface water changes in multitemporal pansharpened Landsat image
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The gradual depletion of surface water in major lakes and their impact in the sustainable development of local water resources has been a great challenge. Monitoring surface water and detecting changes in the lake are the main objectives of this study. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) of 2010, 2000 and 2018 Lake Urmia images acquired from US Geological Survey were used for detecting the changes. Surface water changes are usually identified by extracting the water features from individual time series multispectral images. In this study, a novel change detection framework has been proposed involving pixel level fusion and classification. The spatial frequency based undecimated wavelet transform fusion (UDWT - SF) effectively extracted the spectral information from MS image and spatial infor-mation from PAN image of the same scene captured at different time periods. The endmembers of the fused images were selected using pixel purity index endmember extraction algorithm and the abundance estimation by the application of fully constrained least square spectral unmixing algorithm. An efficient sub-pixel classification process is designed by employing the spectral signatures, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the abundance estimation generated from the pansharpened image in a random forest classifier. Experimental results indicate that the proposed classifier attained 99.9945% user's accuracy for water area and 99.9675% producer's accuracy for changed area. Similarly, the producer's accuracy of water and changed area are 99.9866% and 99.9868% respectively. The kappa coefficient and the overall accuracy of the proposed sub-pixel random forest classification on multitemporal multispectral image is 0.97 and 99.89% respectively. The lake surface area is computed and it is found that an area of 1369 Sq km has been decreased from the year 2000 to 2010 and 310 Sq km decreased from 2010 to 2018 as per the assessment based on the proposed random forest classifier. Spectral unmixing based random forest classifier (RF-SP) on fused image yields better results in terms of accuracy compared to other classifiers and it is more appropriate for detecting the multitemporal surface water changes.

TI  - Three acidic polysaccharides derived from sour jujube seeds protect intestinal epithelial barrier function in LPS induced Caco-2 cell inflammation model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Normal intestinal epithelial barrier function plays a key role in the prevention of many diseases such as infectious enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, etc. In this study, three novel acidic polysaccharides ZY-2, ZY-3 and ZY-4 were isolated from sour jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. Spinosa) seeds and purified by DEAE Sephrose Fast Flow gel. The molecular weight of ZY-2, ZY-3 and ZY-4 was 7.76 kDa, 10.71 kDa and 8.31 kDa respectively, mainly composed of different proportions of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, galactose, xylose and arabinose. 1H NMR and Congo red experiment results showed that the three poly-saccharides mainly contained both alpha-type and beta-type glycosidic bonds with obvious triple helix structural traits. The polysaccharides could up-regulate the expression levels of occludin and ZO-1 in LPS-induced inflammation Caco-2 cells, and reduce IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha significantly. In conclusion, the acidic polysaccharides from sour jujube seeds exhibited great potential in protection intestinal epithelial barrier function through anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  - Shadow is related to roughness but MODIS BRDF should not be used to estimate lateral cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple geometric-optical model is used to show that shadow in optical remote sensing imagery contains information about surface roughness. The use of MODIS albedo products for the purpose of estimating surface roughness so that these products may aid in dust emission modeling has been proposed in previous studies (Chappell et al. 2010; Chappell and Webb 2016; Chappell et al. 2018). This approach is evaluated through geometric-optical modeling and by analysis of existing MODIS data. Little support is found for the utility of this approach for dust emission modeling. However, because there is clearly information about surface roughness in optical satellite imagery, some suggestions for the proper use of optical data to estimate surface roughness are made.

TI  - A Description of the Statistical Methods for the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) Study
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Diarrheal diseases remain a health threat to children in low- and middle-income countries. The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study was a 36-month, prospective, matched case-control study designed to estimate the etiology, incidence, and adverse clinical consequences of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children aged 0-59 months. VIDA was conducted following rotavirus vaccine introduction at 3 censused sites in sub-Saharan Africa that participated in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) similar to 10 years earlier. We describe the study design and statistical methods of VIDA and where they differ from GEMS. Methods We aimed to enroll 8-9 MSD cases every 2 weeks from sentinel health centers in 3 age strata (0-11, 12-23, 24-59 months) and 1 to 3 controls matched by age, sex, date of case enrollment, and village. Clinical, epidemiological, and anthropometric data were collected at enrollment and similar to 60 days later. A stool specimen collected at enrollment was analyzed by both conventional methods and quantitative PCR for enteric pathogens. For the matched case-control study, we estimated the population-based, pathogen-specific attributable fraction (AF) and attributable incidence adjusted for age, site, and other pathogens, and identified episodes attributable to a specific pathogen for additional analyses. A prospective cohort study nested within the original matched case-control study allowed assessment of (1) the association between potential risk factors and outcomes other than MSD status and (2) the impact of MSD on linear growth. Conclusions GEMS and VIDA together comprise the largest and most comprehensive assessment of MSD conducted to date in sub-Saharan Africa populations at highest risk for morbidity and mortality from diarrhea. The statistical methods used in VIDA have endeavored to maximize the use of available data to produce more robust estimates of the pathogen-specific disease burden that might be prevented by effective interventions.We provide a description of the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study design, data collected, and a detailed explanation of the statistical methods, including where they differ from those of the study predecessor, the Global Enteric Multicenter Study.

TI  - Bedfast and floating-ice dynamics of thermokarst lakes using a temporal deep-learning mapping approach: case study of the Old Crow Flats, Yukon, Canada
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the recent climate warming, monitoring of lake ice in Arctic and subarctic regions is becoming increasingly important. Many shallow Arctic lakes and ponds of thermokarst origin freeze to the bed in the winter months, maintaining the underlying permafrost in its frozen state. However, as air temperatures rise and precipitation increases, fewer lakes are expected to develop bedfast ice. In this work, we propose a novel temporal deep-learning approach to lake ice regime mapping from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and employ it to study lake ice dynamics in the Old Crow Flats (OCF), Yukon, Canada, over the 1992/1993 to 2020/2021 period. We utilized a combination of Sentinel-1, ERS-1 and ERS-2, and RADARSAT-1 to create an extensive annotated dataset of SAR time series labeled as either bedfast ice, floating ice, or land, which was used to train a temporal convolutional neural network (TempCNN). The trained TempCNN, in turn, allowed us to automatically map lake ice regimes. The classified maps aligned well with the available field measurements and ice thickness simulations obtained with a thermodynamic lake ice model. Reaching a mean overall classification accuracy of 95 %, the TempCNN was determined to be suitable for automated lake ice regime classification. The fraction of bedfast ice in the OCF increased by 11 % over the 29-year period of analysis. Findings suggest that the OCF lake ice dynamics are dominated by lake drainage events, brought on by thermokarst processes accelerated by climate warming, and fluctuations in water level and winter snowfall. Catastrophic drainage and lowered water levels cause surface water area and lake depth to decrease and lake ice to often transition from floating to bedfast ice, while a reduction in snowfall allows for the growth of thicker ice. The proposed lake ice regime mapping approach allowed us to assess the combined impacts of warming, drainage, and changing precipitation patterns on transitions between bedfast and floating-ice regimes, which is crucial to understanding evolving permafrost dynamics beneath shallow lakes and drained basins in thermokarst lowlands such as the OCF.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of driving factors-induced impacts for global long-term surface urban heat island
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A series of empirical analytical tools have been adopted to investigate the driving mechanisms of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) on a global scale, among which spatial heterogeneity is yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the spatial non-stationarity of the driving factors concerning surface properties, climate conditions, and urbanization processes for global long-term SUHI. First, the potential impact on SUHI was explored using global ordinary least squares regression. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale GWR (MGWR) from local perspectives were employed for comparison. The results show that the MGWR has the highest goodness of fit at 0.87, 0.73, 0.90, 0.74, 0.85, and 0.76 for annual day/night (AD/AN), summer day/night (SD/SN), and winter day/night (WD/WN) scales, respectively. Although both global and local schemes exhibit similar influencing magnitudes and signs on the SUHI, the MGWR is better at capturing spatial non-stationarity. Globally, for AD, AN, SD, SN, WD, and WN, the coefficients of the urban-rural vegetation index difference (Delta EVI) and surface albedo difference (Delta WSA), urban mean precipitation (MAP), wind speed (WS), population density (PD), and urban area (UA) are -0.50, +0.30, +0.16, +1.31, -0.03, and +0.03, respectively, at daytime, and -0.38, -0.33, -0.39, -0.10, +0.18, and +0.08, respectively, at night-time. Given the spatial heterogeneity of multiple factors, Delta EVI exhibits a strong mitigation effect on the SD SUHI especially in arid zones. The negative influence of Delta WSA on night-time SUHI demonstrates a strong latitudinal disparity and greater sensitivity in the equatorial zone. The positive correlations between MAP and AD/SD SUHIs have evident latitudinal and longitudinal variations. The mitigation effect of WS displayed distinct coastal amplification, especially in WD. In contrast, the PD and UA presented prominent positive impacts on night-time SUHI with less seasonal contrast.

AB  - An urban agglomeration represents a mature stage in the development of urban areas with a highly concentrated spatial form. This research paper aimed to comprehend the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, identify its spatial structure, and interconnections based on the NPP-VIIRS night light remote sensing data from 2012 to 2021. Additionally, the study was supplemented with statistical data from corresponding years to extract the range of urban built-up areas in the study region over the past ten years. The data were analysed using various methods such as light value statistics, urban rank-size rule, standard deviation ellipse, fractal dimension, and measure of urban association. The analysis was conducted based on three aspects: scale, morphology, and spatial structure. The findings indicated that the total amount of light in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration had been increasing steadily, with Baoding showing the highest rate of increase, followed by Langfang. Furthermore, the urban agglomeration had a decreasing trend in fragmentation and fractal dimension, with concentrated built-up areas and regular geometry. The urban centre of gravity was shifting towards the northeast, i.e. closer to the geometric centre of the urban agglomeration. The primacy ratio of the urban agglomerations followed an undulating declining pattern, and the gap between cities in the urban agglomerations gradually narrowed. Although transport integration had led to increased urban connectivity, the northern and southern regions were still not sufficiently connected.

TI  - Analysis of atmospheric turbulence and vibration impact on the performance of satellite-ground laser communication beam
T2  - MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - With satellite laser communication, advantages can be achieved in high communication rate, precise beam pointing, high confidentiality, and light-small terminal. Satellite-ground (SG) laser links also play a crucial role as trunk links. However, the SG link is influenced by atmospheric turbulence and platform vibration, these two factors will cause unstable link tracking. This paper focuses on the viewpoint of beam energy transmission, using the low-frequency harmonic phase compensating method to establish the random phase screen. On the basis of this model, the laser beam energy distribution and the spot mass positioning error are analyzed considering turbulence taking vibration which is not considered in previous studies. The simulation results show that the spot mass center (SMC) is impressionable in strong turbulence under platform vibration, but in a weak turbulent environment, SMC is insensitive to vibration when turbulence and vibration are at the same noise level.

TI  - Differential response of chlorophyll-a concentrations to explosive volcanism in the western South Pacific
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When it is deposited in the ocean, volcanic ash has the potential to release iron and other nutrients into surface water to stimulate ocean productivity. In the western South Pacific Ocean (SPO), one of the most important volcanic ash deposition regions, occasional widespread transport of volcanic ash may supply the nutrients not only locally around source islands but also within the wider the western SPO, accompanied by phytoplankton response. Through a comparative analysis of satellite and reanalysis data for the past 19 years (2004-2022), this study reveals that four explosive volcanic eruptions, Rabaul volcano, Papua New Guinea (October, 2006), Ambae volcano, Vanuatu (July, 2018), Ulawun volcano, Papua New Guinea (June, 2019), and Hunga volcano, Tonga (January, 2022), had the most strong stratospheric injection (>15 km) and mass loading of volcanic materials over the wider the western SPO (covering an area of >765,000 km(2)). The transport of 2006, 2018, 2019 volcanic emissions, was not likely associated with significant ash deposition over the western SPO. However, the Hunga eruption led to the deposition of ash-laden volcanic plumes over a wide area (similar to 2,000 km from source), and was followed by the increase in chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) in the region (similar to 70% increase). Minor changes related to other nutrient sources (e.g., hydrothermal input) suggest a link between the increase in Chl-a and 2022 Hunga ash falls over the western SPO. Our results indicate that volcanic ash deposition has implications for phytoplankton productivity in the western SPO, and highlights the need for further research into understanding how nutrient supply alleviated limitations of phytoplankton at the community level.

TI  - "Sentinel or accomplice": gut microbiota and microglia crosstalk in disorders of gut-brain interaction
T2  - PROTEIN & CELL
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Abnormal brain-gut interaction is considered the core pathological mechanism behind the disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), in which the intestinal microbiota plays an important role. Microglia are the "sentinels" of the central nervous system (CNS), which participate in tissue damage caused by traumatic brain injury, resist central infection and participate in neurogenesis, and are involved in the occurrence of various neurological diseases. With in-depth research on DGBI, we could find an interaction between the intestinal microbiota and microglia and that they are jointly involved in the occurrence of DGBI, especially in individuals with comorbidities of mental disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This bidirectional regulation of microbiota and microglia provides a new direction for the treatment of DGBI. In this review, we focus on the role and underlying mechanism of the interaction between gut microbiota and microglia in DGBI, especially IBS, and the corresponding clinical application prospects and highlight its potential to treat DGBI in individuals with psychiatric comorbidities.

TI  - A nomogram based on genotypic and clinicopathologic factors to predict the non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in Chinese women breast cancer patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard treatment for breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla. However, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is still the standard care for sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive patients. Clinical data reveals about 40-75% of patients without non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis after ALND. Unnecessary ALND increases the risk of complications and detracts from quality of life. In this study, we expect to develop a nomogram based on genotypic and clinicopathologic factors to predict the risk of NSLN metastasis in SLN-positive Chinese women breast cancer patients. MethodsThis retrospective study collected data from 1,879 women breast cancer patients enrolled from multiple centers. Genotypic features contain 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer susceptibility, therapy and prognosis. SNP genotyping was identified by the quantitative PCR detection platform. The genetic features were divided into two clusters by the mutational stability. The normalized polygenic risk score (PRS) was used to evaluate the combined effect of each SNP cluster. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was adopted to select the most useful predictive features, and RFE based on support vector machine (SVM) was used to reduce the number of SNPs. Multivariable logistic regression models (i.e., nomogram) were built for predicting NSLN metastasis. The predictive abilities of three types of model (based on only clinicopathologic information, the integrated clinicopathologic and all SNPs information, and integrated clinicopathologic and significant SNPs information) were compared. Internal and external validations were performed and the area under ROC curves (AUCs) as well as a series of evaluation indicators were assessed. Results229 patients underwent SLNB followed by ALND and without any neo-adjuvant therapy, 79 among them (34%) had a positive axillary NSLN metastasis. The LDA-RFE identified the characteristics including lymphovascular invasion, number of positive SLNs, number of negative SLNs and two SNP clusters as significant predictors of NSLN metastasis. Furthermore, the SVM-RFE selected 29 significant SNPs in the prediction of NSLN metastasis. In internal validation, the median AUCs of the clinical and all SNPs combining model, the clinical and 29 significant SNPs combining model, and the clinical model were 0.837, 0.795 and 0.708 respectively. Meanwhile, in external validation, the AUCs of the three models were 0.817, 0.815 and 0.745 respectively. ConclusionWe present a new nomogram by combining genotypic and clinicopathologic factors to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity comparing with traditional clinicopathologic factors to predict NSLN metastasis in Chinese women breast cancer. It is recommended that more validations are required in prospective studies among different patient populations.

TI  - Crop mapping using supervised machine learning and deep learning: a systematic literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The ever-increasing global population presents a looming threat to food production. To meet growing food demands while minimizing negative impacts on water and soil, agricultural practices must be altered. To make informed decisions, decision-makers require timely, accurate, and efficient crop maps. Remote sensing-based crop mapping faces numerous challenges. However, recent years have seen substantial advances in crop mapping through the use of big data, multi-sensor imagery, the democratization of remote sensing data, and the success of deep learning algorithms. This systematic literature review provides an overview of the history and evolution of crop mapping using remote sensing techniques. It also discusses the latest scientific advances in the field of crop mapping, which involve the use of machine and deep learning models. The review protocol involved the analysis of 386 peer-reviewed publications. The results of the analysis show that areas such as crop rotation mapping, double cropping, and early crop mapping require further exploration. The use of LiDAR as a tool for crop mapping also needs more attention, and hierarchical crop mapping is recommended. This review provides a comprehensive framework for future researchers interested in accurate large-scale crop mapping from multi-source image data and machine and deep learning techniques.

TI  - Forest Aboveground Biomass Prediction by Integrating Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data, Landsat 8 OLI-Derived Forest Canopy Density and Spectral Indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest canopy density (FCD) is one of the important parameters for forest mapping and monitoring. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is one of the most accurate tools used in field data collection. Hence, the present study aimed to predict forest aboveground biomass (AGB) by integrating TLS data, satellite data-derived FCD and spectral indices. FCD Mapper was used to classify Landsat-8 OLI data into FCD classes, which were validated using field-measured FCD. In the field, point cloud data were collected from each FCD class using TLS. The diameter at breast height (dbh) and height of individual trees were retrieved from the point cloud data and validated with field-measured dbh and height. AGB was estimated from the TLS-derived dbh and height and modelled as a function of Landsat-8 OLI-derived FCD classes and spectral indices. A total of 11 FCD classes were generated, which showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.96) with the field-measured FCD. From the TLS point cloud data, 96% of individual trees were extracted. Positive correlations were found between TLS-measured dbh and field-measured dbh (r = 0.99), and TLS-measured height and field-measured height (r = 0.96). A linear function best fitted between TLS-estimated AGB and FCD classes was established. Because of the low variability in AGB due to absolute FCD classes, the model was further extended using a few spectral indices. Using a multiple linear model, the average AGB (374 Mg ha(-1)) and total AGB (3,024,550 Mg) of the study area were predicted. The study highlighted that the combined application of TLS and satellite data-derived FCD and spectral indices can be one of the fastest and accurate methods in forest AGB prediction.

TI  - Improving Deciduous Forest Inventory Plot Center Measurement Using Unoccupied Aerial Systems Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-based forest inventory plots are fundamental for many forest studies. These on-the-ground measurements of small samples of forested areas provide foresters with key information such as the size, abundance, health, and value of their forests. Recently, forest inventory plots have begun to be used as ground validation for tree features automatically extracted from remotely sensed data sets. Additionally, machine learning methods for feature extraction rely heavily on large quantities of training data and require these field forest inventory measurement datasets for algorithm training. Undermining the usefulness of forest inventory plot data as validation or training data is the positional uncertainty of plot location measurements. Because global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) cannot reliably measure plot center coordinates under thick tree canopy, plot center coordinates usually contain multiple meters of horizontal error. We present a method for reliably measuring plot center coordinates in which plot centers are individually marked with low-cost targets, allowing plot centers to be manually measured from orthoimagery captured during the leaf-off season. Our plot center measurements are shown to have less than 10 cm of horizontal error, an improvement of an order of magnitude over traditional GNSS methods.

TI  - Investigation of buried karst sinkholes under a bog using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Active evaporite karst processes in the Baltic states are associated with a few relatively small regions where gypsum rocks can be found close to the Earth's surface. One of these areas lies in the vicinity of the Pandu bog. However, such a possibly active karst region, which is covered by peat and in which the mapping of karst formations is complex, has not been previously investigated. In this study, we present a buried and peat-filled karst cover-collapse sinkhole mapping approach that involves a combination of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and conventional boreholes. A detailed map of the bog's substratum topography was constructed from a geophysical surveying dataset. It reveals 15 distinctly expressed sinkholes with diameters of several tens of metres. Overall, 140 potential sinkholes were also mapped using remote sensing data in the vicinity of the bog. Higher electrical resistivity anomalies were identified inside the peat; they coincide with scatter-free zones in GPR data and water layers in boreholes. Highly disturbed internal peat layering was also detected in these sinkholes. It is suggested that these water layers and disturbed peat layering may have formed due to the subsidence of the lower peat layers, and thus they represent relatively younger sinkholes. This is also supported by evidence from orthophoto maps, which showed the formation and disappearance of surficial lakes and depressions on the bog surface. Our results revealed the presence of active and widespread karst processes under the bog that have not been previously noticed despite the fact that they have implications for the assessment of geohazards in this area.

TI  - Aortic sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer: 6 year prospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe our final results using dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in endometrial cancer along parametrial and infundibular drainage pathways.Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study between 26 June 2014 and 31 December 2020 enrolling 332 patients that underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer at our hospital. In all cases, we performed SLN biopsy with dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection identifying pelvic and aortic SLNs. All SLNs were processed with an ultrastaging technique. A total of 172 patients also under-went total pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.Results: The detection rates were as follows: 94.0% overall for SLNs; 91.3% overall for pelvic SLNs; 70.5% for bilateral SLNs; 68.1% for para-aortic SLNs, and 3.0% for isolated paraaortic SLNs. We found lymph node involvement in 56 (16.9%) cases, macrometastasis in 22, micrometastasis in 12 and isolated tumor cells in 22. Fourteen patients had isolated aortic nodal involvement, representing 25% of the positive cases. There was one false negative (SLN biopsy negative but lymphadenectomy positive). Applying the SLN algorithm, the sensitivity of the dual injection technique for SLN detection was 98.3% (95% CI 91-99.7), specificity 100% (95% CI 98.5-100), negative predictive value 99.6% (95% CI 97.8-99.9), and positive predictive value 100% (95% CI 93.8-100). Overall survival at 60 months was 91.35%, with no differences between patients with negative nodes, isolated tumor cells and treated nodal micrometastasis.Conclusions: Dual sentinel node injection is a feasible technique that achieves adequate detection rates. Addi-tionally, this technique allows a high rate of aortic detection, identifying a non-negligible percentage of iso-lated aortic metastases. Aortic metastases in endometrial cancer account for as many as a quarter of the positive cases and should be considered, especially in high-risk patients.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - SFCNet: Deep Learning-based Lightweight Separable Factorized Convolution Network for Landslide Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to detect landslides automatically and accurately in today's environment, yet these are essential in preventing and minimizing natural landslide threats. Despite developing numerous deep learning models for landslide detection, a lightweight framework for embedding landslide detection in mobile devices or hardware is yet to be devised. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model for pixel-based landslide detection called Separable Factorized Convolution Network (SFCNet). The proposed SFCNet's efficiency is observed in the study area, located on the eastern side of the Western Ghats in the Kodagu district, India, which is known for its landslide endeavor. SFCNet is a lightweight convolutional network that incorporates separable and factorized convolution. The separable convolution and factorized convolution are employed in the proposed SFCNet to lower the number of parameters and the computational complexity. In addition, the SFCNet's performance is examined under various scaling and folding instances. The results prove that the proposed SFCNet minimizes the number of parameters by over 95% compared to the existing deep CNN model. The proposed SFCNet's F1 score and accuracy on landslide detection are 98.34 and 98.36%, respectively. The susceptibility map of landslides for the study area is mapped from the probability of prediction of landslides by the SFCNet. From the SFCNet's performance on landslide detection and mapping, it is observed that it has significant scope for various applications in large area landslide identification. Therefore, it can be suggested for risk analysis and emergency rescue.

TI  - A global spatial-temporal land use regression model for nitrogen dioxide air pollution
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) recently revised its health guidelines for Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution, reducing the annual mean NO2 level to 10 mu g/m(3) (5.3 ppb) and the 24-h mean to 25 mu g/m(3) (13.3 ppb). NO2 is a pollutant of global concern, but it is also a criteria air pollutant that varies spatiotemporally at fine resolutions due to its relatively short lifetime (similar to hours). Current models have limited ability to capture both temporal and spatial NO2 variation and none are available with global coverage. Land use regression (LUR) models that incorporate timevarying predictors (e.g., meteorology and satellite NO2 measures) and land use characteristics (e.g., road density, emission sources) have significant potential to address this need.Methods: We created a daily Land use regression model with 50 x 50 m(2) spatial resolution using 5.7 million daily air monitor averages collected from 8,250 monitor locations.Results: In cross-validation, the model captured 47%, 59%, and 63% of daily, monthly, and annual global NO2 variation. Daily, monthly, and annual root mean square error were 6.8, 5.0, and 4.4 ppb and absolute bias were 46%, 30%, and 21%, respectively. The final model has 11 variables, including road density and built environments with fine (30 m or less) spatial resolution and meteorological and satellite data with daily temporal resolution. Major roads and satellite-based estimates of NO2 were consistently the strongest predictors of NO2 measurements in all regions.Discussion: Daily model estimates from 2005-2019 are available and can be used for global risk assessments and health studies, particularly in countries without NO2 monitoring.

TI  - A Clinical Series in Patients with Naso-Pharyngeal Cancer and Their Outcomes with Stent Graft Treatment for Sentinel Bleeding to Prevent Frank Carotid Rupture
T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of heparin-bonded VIABAHN stent graft for carotid rupture in patients with nasopharyngeal carci-noma (NPC). Methods: A total of 1,596 patients with NPC were enrolled. Fifteen patients (8 male and 7 fe-male), who developed carotid artery rupture (CAR) after radiotherapy between January 2016 and June 2019, were retrospectively analyzed. Complications and mortality were assessed at 12 months postoperatively. Results: The incidence of carotid burst syndrome in the NPC cohort was 0.94%. The distribu-tion of site of arterial rupture was as follows: common carotid artery (4 cases), C1 segment of internal carotid artery (8 cases), and C2 segment of internal carotid artery (3 cases). All patients successfully underwent emergency deployment of the heparin-bonded VIABAHN to seal off the ruptured carotid artery. The survival rate as of 12-month follow-up was 80.0%. Three patients died of short-term rebleeding, lung infection, and tumor progression. No stent-related complica-tions occurred in our cohort. Conclusions: Heparin-bonded VIABAHN-covered stents may be a safe and effective treat-ment option for carotid rupture in patients with NPC.

TI  - Scale transfer learning of hyperspectral prediction model of heavy metal content in maize: From laboratory to satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For sustainable development of the environment, there has been a growing interest in using remote sensing technology to monitor the content of heavy metals in crops. Satellite hyperspectral data, while capable of providing valuable information, is often subject to environmental factors. On the other hand, laboratory spectra are collected under controlled conditions, enabling more accurate and stable models to be built. As a result, this study used the laboratory maize spectra measured using an SVC spectrometer to establish the heavy metal content prediction model and applied it to hyperspectral satellite images (Gaofen-5 and Zhuhai-1) to achieve large-scale and rapid monitoring of heavy metal content in farmland maize. However, due to the difference between the laboratory spectra (source domain) and satellite spectra (target domain), the direct transfer of laboratory models to the satellite scale has shown poor results. To address this challenge, multiple factors, including spectral feature selection, domain adaptation, regression methods, and correction models were taken into account to construct the multi-factor combined model. The research has shown that modelling after spectral feature selection can increase the accuracy of the model while reducing its complexity. Additionally, the domain adaptation method can narrow the gap between the source domain and the target domain, improving the transfer learning performance of different domains to a certain extent. Furthermore, the addition of a constructed correction model generally improves the accuracy of the transfer model. The optimal transferable model is finally obtained, which can effectively apply the laboratory heavy metal content prediction model to satellite images, and achieve large-scale and rapid monitoring of heavy metal content in farmland maize.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of frozen section and patterns of nodal spread in high grade endometrial cancer: A secondary outcome of the SENTOR prospective cohort study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The study aimed to define the accuracy of intraoperative frozen section (FS) for the detection of metastases in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and describe the pattern of lymph node (LN) spread and relation to molecular classifiers in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. We performed a secondary outcome of clinicopathologic data from the Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy versus Lymphadenectomy for Intermediate- and High-Grade Endometrial Cancer Staging (SENTOR) prospective cohort study evaluating SLNB in patients with clinical stage I high-grade EC (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01886066). The primary outcome was the sensitivity of FS of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) specimen, compared to a standardized ultrastaging protocol. Secondary outcomes included the pattern and characteristics of LN spread.Results. There were 126 patients with high-grade EC with a median age of 66 years (range:44-86) and a median Body Mass Index (BMI) of 26.9 kg/m2 (range:17.6-49.3). FS was performed on surgical specimens from 212 hemipelves; SLNs were identified in 202 specimens (95.7%) and fatty tissue alone was identified in 10 specimens (4.7%). Of the 202 hemipelves in which SLNs were identified, 24 were positive for metastatic disease on final pathology. Initial FS correctly identified only 12, yielding a sensitivity of 50% (12/24, 95% CI 29.6-70.4) and a negative predictive value of 94% (178/190, 95% CI 89-96.5). A total of 24 patients (19%) had LN metastases: 16 (13%) had isolated pelvic metastases, 7 (6%) had both pelvic and para-aortic metastases and 1 (0.8%) had an isolated para-aortic metastasis.Conclusions. Intraoperative FS of SLNs in high-grade EC patients has poor sensitivity. Since isolated para-aortic metastases are rare, para-aortic lymphadenectomy may be omitted in patients in which SLNs were successfully mapped to the pelvis.

TI  - Carbon emissions and radiative forcings from tundra wildfires in theYukon-Kuskokwim River Delta, Alaska
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tundra environments are experiencing elevated levels of wildfire, and the frequency is expected to keep increasing due to rapid climate change in the Arctic. Tundra wildfires can release globally significant amounts of greenhouse gasses that influence the Earth's radiative balance. Here we develop a novel method for estimating carbon loss and the resulting radiative forcings of gaseous and aerosol emissions from the 2015 tundra wildfires in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska. We paired burn depth measurements using two vegetative reference points that survived the fire event - Sphagnum fuscum and Dicranum spp. - with measurements of local organic matter and soil carbon properties to estimate total ecosystem organic matter and carbon loss. We used remotely sensed data on fire severity from Landsat 8 to scale our measured losses to the entire fire-affected area, with an estimated total loss of 2.04 Tg of organic matter and 0.91 Tg of carbon and an average loss of 3.76 kg m(-2) of organic matter and 1.68 kg m(-2) of carbon in the 2015 YKD wildfires. To demonstrate the impact of these fires on the Earth's radiation budget, we developed a simple but comprehensive framework to estimate the radiative forcing from Arctic wildfires. We synthesized existing research on the lifetime and radiative forcings of gaseous and aerosol emissions of CO2, N2O, CH4, O-3 and its precursors, and fire aerosols. The model shows a net positive cumulative mean radiative forcing of 3.67 W m-2 using representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 3.37 W m(-2 )using RCP 8.5 at 80 years post-fire, which was dominated by CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the climate impact of tundra wildfires, which positively reinforce climate warming and increased fire frequency through the radiative forcings of their gaseous emissions.

TI  - The hidden sentinel of the skin: An overview on the role of interleukin-13 in atopic dermatitis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that interleukin (IL)-13 is a crucial cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). It is a central driver of type-2 T-helper inflammation and is overexpressed in lesional skin of AD patients. Upon release in peripheral skin, IL-13 activates its receptors, recruits inflammatory cells, and modifies the skin microbiome. IL-13 also reduces the expression of epidermal barrier proteins and activates sensory nerve mediating the itch transmission signal. Novel therapeutics that target IL-13 seem to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The aim of our manuscript is to review the role that IL-13 plays in AD immunopathogenesis.

TI  - Benchmarking Sentinel-2-derived predictors for long-term burn severity modelling: the 2016-17 Chilean firestorm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed burn severity modelling is commonly addressed by regressing fire-induced forest biophysical damage measured in the field, using the Composite Burn Index (CBI) method on a pre- to post-fire difference of the normalized burn ratio ( increment NBR) representing early fire effects. Although less often addressed, it may also be modelled on a wider post-fire temporal range to assess longer-lasting ecological effects. However, this approach may involve a larger set of potential predictors, posing a high-dimensional statistical issue. This study examines the performance of different spectrotemporal combinations of remotely sensed predictors for long-term burn severity modelling of the two largest wildfires during the central Chilean firestorm in the summer of 2017, in order to assess their predictive contribution and to support their optimal selection. Sentinel-2 images acquired annually in 2016-2020 were used to create different spectrotemporal combinations of predictor sets, encompassing increment NBR, differenced normalized difference water index ( increment NDWI) and differenced normalized difference vegetation index ( increment NDVI), as well as differenced bands. Thereafter, they were modelled by CBI data collected in the field, using conventional (least-squares-based) and ridge-regularized linear regressions, and assessed by spatial cross-validation. Among the multiple-variable models, ridge regression outperformed multiple linear regression, the highest accuracies being achieved by the multitemporal sets comprising any of the differenced index types. Among these, increment NBRs reached the lowest average root mean square error (RMSEavg = 0.591). Results confirm the importance of increment NBR as burn severity predictor in a long-term assessment context, top-performing for both, single- and multiple-variable models. They also highlight the value of tracking the temporal trajectory of this differenced index when enlarging the number of post-fire image dates involved, and hence, no a-priori knowledge about what predictor to select exists.

TI  - Multiple psychotherapeutic approaches and perspectives on eco-anxiety
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In highly diverse psychotherapy practices, psychotherapists with their individual schemas and personalities treat patients who are just as individual, each with his/her own partially dysfunctional schema, personality, worldview, and life situation. Intuition gained through experience is often applied, and a wide range of perspectives, techniques, and treatment options appropriate to the specific situation and psychotherapist-patient relationship are required for successful treatment of eco-anxiety manifestations. Several examples will be used to present the approaches of different psychotherapeutic approaches to eco-anxiety such as analytical psychology, logotherapy and existential analysis, psychodrama, and Morita-therapy. The treatment-possibilities-expanding psychotherapy science is presented, which helps psychotherapists to look beyond their original learned approach and learn about new perspectives and treatment methods in a methodologically sound way, which they already do intuitively.

TI  - Deep Kernel Dictionary Learning for detection of wave breaking features in Atmospheric Gravity Waves
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Gravity Waves play a significant role in the Middle Atmosphere Dynamics and breaking of Gravity Waves leads to turbulence. To confirm the breaking of Atmospheric Gravity Waves, we require Wind Velocity profiles with high accuracy and the problem in the existing scenario is the Wind velocity measuring instruments are not accurate at the altitude of interest and are very sparse. We came up with a solution by taking advantage of Dictionary Learning and Deep Learning approach for the detection of the Wave Breaking events from atmospheric temperature perturbations instead of looking for wind velocity profiles.In the present work, we discuss incorporating Kernels into Deep Dictionary Learning. The Deep Dictionary Learning algorithm, introduced recently, shows an improvement in feature detection in comparison to k-means Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD) Dictionary Learning, Convolution Neural Network, and LSTM Auto -Encoders. Incorporating Kernels into Deep Dictionary Learning increases the effectiveness of the detection of the Wave Breaking events. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated with a case study on the detection of atmospheric Gravity Wave Breaking event leading to turbulence in the atmosphere using satellite data (Aura-Microwave Limb Sounder) and is validated using data available from the ground-based instruments.

TI  - Seasonal variability of characteristics of nonlinear internal waves in the Kuril-Kamchatka region by Sentinel 1 data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal variability of the surface manifestations of nonlinear internal waves (NIW's) in the Kuril-Kamchatka region from December 2018 to November 2019 was investigated based on the analysis of the Sentinel 1 satellite imagery archive. On 827 satellite images, 1876 manifestations of NIW's were registered with a wavelength from 80 to 1900 m, containing from 2 to 18 waves in a packet. It was identified that the number of NIW's registered in the water area varied significantly during the year. The minimum number of manifestations was recorded from January to March, and the maximum number of manifestations was observed from July to September. Areas of the frequent occurrence of NIW's manifestations were identified: near the Kunashir Island, over the Vityaz ridge, near Cape Shipunsky and in Kamchatka Bay. Manifestations of NIW's in these areas were recorded in all seasons of the year. These areas accounted for about 53% of all registered manifestations of NIW's, and their area was about 20% of the study region area. The calculation of the tidal body force criterion for the main diurnal and semidiurnal tidal harmonics made it possible to identify potential generation sites of internal tidal waves. About 70% of NIW's manifestations in August were detected in areas close to potential generation sites of diurnal internal tidal wave K1. This is explained by closeness of the generation and the disintegration sites of internal tidal waves under conditions of being beyond the critical latitude, where the tidal frequency coincides with the inertial one. Using the example of the area above the Vityaz ridge, the connection between the seasonal variability in the number of recorded manifestations and the annual variations in the tidal body force for harmonics K1, O1 and P1, mixed layer depth, the surface wind speed and the Brunt-Vaisala frequency was shown. This is consistent with the results of studies carried out in the adjacent regions of the Pacific Ocean. The existing archives of the Sentinel-1 radar image and the continuation of this satellite mission in the future will make it possible to estimate the long-term variability of NIW's characteristic and to assess the impact of climate change on them.

TI  - Development of the grass LAI and CCC remote sensing-based models and their transferability using sentinel-2 data in heterogeneous grasslands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of biophysical variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) at high spatiotemporal resolution is important for managing natural and heterogeneous environments. However, accurate estimation of biophysical variables particularly over heterogeneous environments remains a challenge. The objective of the study was to develop locally parameterized grass LAI and CCC empirical models using the Sentinel-2 variables combined with the Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and Random forest (RF) at the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and Marakele National Park (MNP) in South Africa. Results showed that in MNP, SMLR yielded better LAI estimation with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.67 m(2).m(-2) and mean adjusted error (MAE) of 0.54, explaining 48% of LAI variability, when bands and indices are combined. In contrast, RF gave better CCC estimation i.e. RMSE and MAE of 17.08 mu g.cm(-2) and 13.18 respectively, explaining about 40% of CCC variability with Sentinel-2 bands only. In GGHNP, the RF models provided the best estimates of both LAI and CCC compared to SMLR models. Furthermore, the CCC and LAI estimation models of GGHNP showed improved model accuracies when 50% and 75% of the MNP field samples were transferred to the GGHNP models. In contrast, the CCC and LAI estimation models of MNP showed a decline in model performance across all scenarios where the GGHNP field samples were transferred to the MNP models. These findings have significant implications for the development of locally parameterized types of models that can provide improved and consistent site-specific accurate estimates of grass biophysical parameters over heterogeneous environments.

TI  - Has the advent of modern adjuvant systemic therapy for melanoma rendered sentinel node biopsy unnecessary?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The prognostic value of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is well established and SNB was therefore adopted as a requirement for pathological staging of melanomas > 1 mm thick in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition. Consequently, a negative SNB status became an eligibility criterion for clinical trials of adjuvant systemic therapy in resected stage IIB/C melanoma. However, since the Keynote 716 trial demonstrated an improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with Stage IIB/C melanoma, all of whom had SNB staging, some have argued that SNB is no longer required for patients with T3 and T4 primary melanomas. The rationale for omitting SNB is that these patients will be able to access adjuvant immunotherapy regardless of SNB status, avoiding the costs and potential complications of SNB. However, this argument overlooks the prognostic value of knowing a patient's nodal status and the therapeutic benefit of SNB in regional disease control. Based on extrapolation of data from multiple sources, we demonstrate that the risk of regional node-field relapse with SNB and immunotherapy for T3b and T4 melanomas is around 7-9% but is 20-27% without SNB. Similarly, the node-field recurrence rate with SNB alone is around 14% compared to around 40% with no SNB or immunotherapy. Consequently, in the absence of prospective data, we propose that the optimal management of the regional node-field for high-risk T3b and T4 primary melanomas is likely to be achieved by combining SNB and adjuvant immunotherapy for those patients who are suitable, rather than either treatment alone.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - NIR-II Imaging and Sandwiched Plasmonic Biosensor for Ultrasensitive Intraoperative Definition of Tumor-Invaded Lymph Nodes
T2  - NANO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radical lymphadenectomy remains the cornerstone of preventing tumor metastasis through the lymphatic system. Current surgical resection of lymph nodes (LNs) based on fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) suffers from low sensitivity/ selectivity with only qualitative information, hampering accurate intraoperative decision-making. Herein, we develop a modularized theranostic system including NIR-II FGS and a sandwiched plasmonic chip (SPC). Intraoperative NIR-II FGS and detection of tumor-positive lymph nodes were performed on the gastric tumor to determine the feasibility of the modularized theranostic system in defining LN metastasis. Under the NIR-II imaging window, the orthotopic tumor and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were successfully excised without ambient light interference in the operating room. Importantly, the SPC biosensor achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for tumor markers and realized rapid and high-throughput intraoperative SLN detection. We propose the synergetic design of combining the NIR-II FGS and suitable biosensor will substantially improve the efficiency of cancer diagnosis and therapy follow-up.

TI  - Ecological response of land use change in a large opencast coal mine area of China
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land is the carrier of ecological environment, and the change of land use is bound to cause changes in many natural phenomena and ecological processes. In turn, the change of ecological environment will largely restrict the degree and direction of land use change in a certain region. With the development of current land use, the ecological response of regional land use has become a research hot spot. The study is mainly based on the improved remote sensing ecological index calculated by MATLAB software. The land use transfer matrix method is used to identify the transferred area and key land types, and spatial multiple regression analysis is used to establish the ecological response equation of key land types. The study provides a reference for land resource development and ecological environment protection in large opencast coal mining areas by quantitatively evaluating the land use change and ecological response process in the study area. The research results show that the remote sensing ecological index is mainly obtained through remote sensing technology, which has the ad-vantages of easy parameter acquisition, large time series span, and wide evaluation range. The improved remote sensing ecological index can better quantitatively reflect the quality of the ecological environment in the study area. The calculation method is intuitive and clear, and has strong theoretical significance and reference func-tion. The conceptual model of ecological response to land use change constructed on this basis can better reveal the dynamic process, action mechanism and changing trend of ecological response. The ecological environment quality of the study area is generally poor, and the ecological environment quality of the poor grade accounts for a large proportion. The change of land use from cultivated land to industrial and mining land is the Granger reason that leads to the decline of ecological environment quality in the study area, and the process of transformation has a strong negative correlation effect on ecological environment quality. Different land use types have different transfer processes and different losses to the quality of the ecological environment.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of forest aboveground biomass using Landsat 8 OLI images by quantile regression neural network for <i>Pinus densata</i> forests in southwestern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a challenge to reduce the uncertainties of the underestimation and overestimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) which is common in optical remote sensing imagery. In this study, four models, namely, the linear stepwise regression (LSR), artificial neural network (ANN), quantile regression (QR), and quantile regression neural network (QRNN) were used to estimate Pinus densata forest AGB data by collecting 146 sample plots combined with Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) images in Shangri-La City, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. The results showed that compared with the LSR, the R-2 and mean square error (RMSE) of the ANN, QR, and QRNN had improved significantly. In particular, the QRNN was able to significantly improve the situation of overestimation and underestimation when we estimated forest biomass, which had the highest R-2 (0.971) and lowest RMSE (9.791 Mg/ha) for the whole biomass segment. Meanwhile, through model validation, we found that the QRNN had the highest R-2 (0.761) and lowest RMSE (6.486 Mg/ha) on the biomass segment of <40 Mg/ha. Furthermore, it had the highest R-2 (0.904) and lowest RMSE (9.059 Mg/ha) on the biomass segment of >160 Mg/ha, which offered great potential for improving the estimation accuracy of the Pinus densata forest AGB. In conclusion, the QRNN, combining the advantages of QR and ANN, provides great potential for reducing the precision influence caused by the overestimation and underestimation in forest AGB estimation using optical remote sensing data.

TI  - Differentiating oil palm plantations from natural forest to improve land cover mapping in Ghana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree crops like oil palm present a unique challenge in land cover mapping, as they are often misclassified as natural forest. The area cultivated with oil palm in Ghana has rapidly expanded since 2000, and production is expected to continue to increase. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data was used as inputs to a random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine to map mature, closed-canopy oil palm extent in 2019 of a Ghana study area that includes both industrial plantations and smallholders. The combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands and derived indices outperformed either satellite alone for mapping industrial oil palm (90.3% overall ac-curacy). A separate accuracy assessment for this combined input approach demonstrated high accuracy mapping smallholders as well (80.4% overall accuracy), a key challenge in the West African context. To validate these findings, results were compared with available production information and a global oil palm remote sensing product. The resulting map can inform sus-tainable oil palm efforts in Ghana, which is understudied in current oil palm remote sensing literature, and the methodology provides an example for future studies of oil palm sourcing areas using only publicly available data.

TI  - Impacts of watershed management on land use/cover changes and landscape greenness in Yezat Watershed, North West, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, watershed management interventions have been implemented since the 1980s to curve land degradation and improve the agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers. However, little effort has been made to investigate the impacts of watershed management on land use/cover changes and landscape greenness. Thus, this study was conducted to assess the long-term impacts of watershed management on land use/cover changes and landscape greenness in the Yezat watershed. Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2021 were employed and analyzed to produce maps of the respective years using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Data from satellite images, coupled with field observation and the socio-economic survey, revealed an effective approach for analyzing the extent, rate, and spatial patterns of land use/cover changes. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was also employed to detect vegetation greenness. The results of the study show that between 1990 and 2021, the built-up area, plantation, natural forest, shrubland, and grasslands were increased by + 254 ha, + 712.3 ha, 196.3 ha, + 1070.8, and + 425.3 ha respectively due to watershed management interventions. Conversely, cultivated land was decreased with a rate of - 2658.7 ha(,) in the study area. However, the reverse is true between 1990 and 2000 due to large-scale land degradation. Besides, the result of the study also shows that a low landscape greenness value (- 0.11) was observed between 1990 and 2000, and a high landscape greenness value (+ 0.2) was observed between 1990 and 2021. The observed change in landscape greenness in the watershed was due to the change in shrubland (+ 1070.8 ha), grassland (+ 425.3 ha), plantation (+ 712.3 ha), and forestland (+ 196.3 ha) covers between 1990 and 2021 years. Such observed changes in land use land covers, landscape greenness, and cultivated land in the study watershed have important implications for the improvement of soil moisture, soil fertility, biodiversity, groundwater recharge, carbon sequestration, soil erosion land, crop yield, and ecosystem services.

TI  - Enthalpy balance theory unifies diverse glacier surge behaviour
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - It is commonly asserted that there are two distinct classes of glacier surges: slow, long-duration 'Svalbard-type' surges, triggered by a transition from cold- to warm-based conditions (thermal switching), and fast, shorter-duration 'Alaska-type' surges triggered by a reorganisation of the basal drainage system (hydraulic switching). This classification, however, reflects neither the diversity of surges in Svalbard and Alaska (and other regions), nor the fundamental dynamic processes underlying all surges. We argue that enthalpy balance theory offers a framework for understanding the spectrum of glacier surging behaviours while emphasising their essential dynamic unity. In this paper, we summarise enthalpy balance theory, illustrate its potential to explain so-called 'Svalbard-type' and 'Alaska-type' surges using a single set of principles, and show examples of a much wider range of glacier surge behaviour than previously observed. We then identify some future directions for research, including strategies for testing predictions of the theory against field and remote sensing data, and priorities for numerical model development.

TI  - Canopy height and biomass prediction in <i>Mombaca guinea</i> grass pastures using satellite imagery and machine learning
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can serve as a promising solution for monitoring spatio-temporal variability in grasslands, providing timely information about different biophysical parameters. We aimed to develop models for canopy height classification and aboveground biomass estimation in pastures of Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaca using machine learning techniques and images obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite. We used different spectral bands from the Sentinel-2, which were obtained and processed entirely in the cloud computing space. Three canopy height classes were defined according to grazing management recommendations: Class 0 (< 0.45 m), Class 1 (0.45-0.80 m) and Class 2 (> 0.80 m). For modeling, the original database was divided into training data (85%) and test data (15%). To avoid dependency between our training and test datasets and ensure greater generalization capacity, we used a spatial grouping evaluation structure. The random forest algorithm was used to predict canopy height and aboveground biomass by using height and biomass field reference data obtained from 54 paddocks in Brazil between 2016 and 2018. Our results demonstrated precision, recall, and accuracy values of up to 73%, 73%, and 72%, respectively, for canopy height classification. In addition, the models showed reasonable predictive performance for aboveground fresh biomass (AFB) and dry matter concentration (DMC; R-2 = 0.61 and 0.69, respectively). We conclude that the combined use of satellite imagery and machine learning techniques has potential to predict canopy height and aboveground biomass of Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaca. However, further studies should be conducted to improve the proposed models and develop software to implement the tool under field conditions.

TI  - A comparison analysis of different PV simulation tools using satellite data
T2  - ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - PV systems are an effective way to satisfy power demands while also lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The rising usage of PV systems, particularly in this year of energy crisis, has raised the necessity for modeling tools for photovoltaic systems. When developing a new PV system, these simulation tools aid in the sizing of the system. They aid in assessing the effect of air temperature and wind speed on photovoltaic modules prior to installation and during operation, providing us with a figure for the PV system's production yield. This paper deals with the validation, testing, and comparison of three different simulation software packages: SAM, RETScreen, and PVsyst, which use satellite data from different databases. The three software programs are used to model and simulate a 98.4 kWp PV system in Tirana city, Albania. The results obtained by three software programs have been compared with the energy data obtained from the monitoring of a 98.4 kWp PV system on the terrace of a building in Tirana. For comparison analysis the common metrics such as: Mean Bias Error, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and Systematic Error are calculated. The analysis showed that the annual normalized difference was to the smallest for the simulation in SAM and to the largest for the simulation in PVsyst, respectively, by 1.17% and 3.44%. Meanwhile, the systematic error was smallest for RETScreen and has a value of 403.36 kWh. In light of the results from the SAM program, that was among the three simulation tools used in this analysis, we recommend using it.

TI  - Popular education to improve water quality and hygiene in a Mexican indigenous community
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Long-term research has identified significant water contamination and associated poor health outcomes in the indigenous community of Alpuyeca, located in south-central Mexico. We set out to develop a popular education initiative in this community to improve water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) knowledge and practices. In order to avoid recreating hierarchical power dynamics in this vulnerable community, a participatory action research (PAR) design was used, wherein the community took leadership and facilitation roles in each stage of the research process. In qualitative interviews and design sessions, community members identified unsatisfied WaSH needs in households and community institutions and articulated a clear worldview of the spiritual role of water, which guided the development of a series of popular education-based workshops and discussions. The popular education initiative process was documented with a mixed methods framework, using before-and-after surveys, semi-structured interviews and participatory observation. Increases in knowledge and practices related to water purification, water consumption and hand hygiene were noted in the community. The community identified locally installed and managed ecotechnologies as a key opportunity for sustainable development, community participation and the adoption of water and sanitation systems, compatible with public imaginaries of the role of water.

TI  - Long-term survival outcomes in high-risk endometrial cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy alone versus lymphadenectomy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveEndometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic neoplasm. To date, international guidelines recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy for low-risk neoplasms, while systematic lymphadenectomy is still considered for high-risk cases. This study aimed to compare the long-term survival of high-risk patients who were submitted to sentinel lymph node biopsy alone versus systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. MethodsPatients with high-risk endometrial cancer according to the 2021 European Society of Gynaecological Oncology/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology/European Society of Pathology risk classification were retrospectively analyzed. The primary aim of the study was to compare the long-term overall survival and disease-free survival of high-risk endometrial cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy versus systematic lymphadenectomy. A supplementary post-hoc survival analysis of cases with nodal metastasis was performed to compare sentinel lymph node and lymphadenectomy survival outcomes in this subset of patients. ResultsThe study enrolled 237 patients with histologically proven high-risk endometrial cancer. Patients were followed up for a median of 31 months (IQR 18-40). During the follow-up, 38 (16.0%) patients had a recurrence, and 19 (8.0%) patients died. Disease-free survival (85.2% vs 82.8%; p=0.74) and overall survival (91.3% vs 92.6%; p=0.62) were not different between the sentinel lymph node alone and lymphadenectomy groups. Furthermore, neither overall survival (96.1% vs 91.4%; p=0.43) nor disease-free survival (83.7% vs 76.4%; p=0.46) were different among sentinel lymph node alone and lymphadenectomy groups in patients with nodal metastasis. ConclusionsSentinel lymph node mapping alone in high-risk endometrial cancer appears to be an oncologically safe technique over a long observational time. Systematic lymphadenectomy in this population does not offer a survival advantage.

TI  - The Sentinel Bait Station: an automated, intelligent design pest animal baiting system
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context. Ground baiting is a strategic method for reducing vertebrate pest populations. Best practice involves maximising bait availability to the target species, although sustaining this availability is resource intensive because baits need to be replaced each time they are taken. This study focused on improving pest population management through the novel baiting technique outlined in this manuscript, although there is potential use across other species and applications (e.g. disease management). Aims. To develop and test an automated, intelligent, and semipermanent, multi-bait dispenser that detects target species before distributing baits and provides another bait when a target species revisits the site. Methods. We designed and field tested the Sentinel Bait Station, which comprises a camera trap with in-built species-recognition capacity, wireless communication and a dispenser with the capacity for five baits. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed and validated via laboratory simulation with images collected by the camera. The prototype was then evaluated in the field under real-world conditions with wild-living canids, using non-toxic baits. Key results. Field testing achieved 19 automatically offered baits with seven bait removals by canids. The underlying image recognition algorithm yielded an accuracy of 90%, precision of 83%, sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 96% throughout field testing. The response time of the system, from the point of motion detection (within 6-10 mand the field-of-view of the camera) to a bait being offered to a target species, was 9.81 +/- 2.63 s. Conclusion. The Sentinel Bait Station was able to distinguish target species from non-target species. Consequently, baits were successfully deployed to target species and withheld from non-target species. Therefore, this proof-of-concept device is able to successfully provide baits to successive targets from secure on-board storage, thereby overcoming the need for daily bait replacement. Implications. The proof-of-concept Sentinel Bait Station design, together with the findings and observations from field trials, confirmed the system can deliver multiple baits and increase the specificity in which baits are presented to the target species using artificial intelligence. With further refinement and operational field trials, this device will provide another tool for practitioners to utilise in pest management programs.

TI  - Performance of two clinical fluorescence imaging systems with different targeted and non-targeted near-infrared fluorophores: a cadaveric explorative study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence-guided surgery is increasingly utilized in humans and pets. As clinical imaging systems are optimized for Indocyanine green (ICG) detection, the usage of targeted dyes necessitates the validation of these systems for each dye. We investigated the impact of skin pigmentation and tissue overlay on the sensitivity of two NIR cameras (IC-Flow (TM), Visionsense (TM) VS3 Iridum) for the detection of non-targeted (ICG, IRDye800) and targeted (Angiostamp (TM), FAP-Cyan) NIR fluorophores in an ex vivo big animal model.Methods: We quantitatively measured the limit of detection (LOD) and signalto-background ratio (SBR) and implemented a semi-quantitative visual score to account for subjective interpretation of images by the surgeon.Results: Visionsense (TM) VS3 Iridum outperformed IC-Flow (TM) in terms of LOD and SBR for the detection of all dyes except FAP-Cyan. Median SBR was negatively affected by skin pigmentation and tissue overlay with both camera systems. Level of agreement between quantitative and semi-quantitative visual score and interobserver agreement were better with Visionsense (TM) VS3 Iridum.Conclusion: The overlay of different tissue types and skin pigmentation may negatively affect the ability of the two tested camera systems to identify nanomolar concentrations of targeted-fluorescent dyes and should be considered when planning surgical applications.

TI  - Identifying river bank erosion potential zones through geo-spatial and binary logistic regression modeling approach: a case study of river Ganga in Malda district (India)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the causative factors for high bank erosion probability along the left bank of Ganga river in Malda district using binary logistic regression model. The bank erosion at the outer bend of Ganga in Manikchak and Kaliachak-II blocks during the recession of flood water in Ganga poses serious threats to the inhabitants of Diara since the construction of the Farakka barrage. The constriction slowly started a problem of water pilling at the up-stream of the barrage and extended up to the Bhutni Island (40 km up stream). The seepage mechanism allows the entry of rising flood water to the banks and again released when water level recedes gradually and causes bank slumping. In recent monsoon (2020), Gopalpur, Jot Bhabani Dharampur gram panchayats of Manikchak block are heavily affected by bank erosion. A total of nine causative factors are selected as predictor variables in binary logistic regression model categorized broadly as vegetation, water and moisture indices, proximity based on river channel and settlement, soil characteristics and land use-cover classes. The omnibus test of model coefficient gives the likelihood ratio (224.433) for the overall model fitting (p value 0.0). The model predicts correctly 254 sites as low bank erosion (LBE) and 111 sites as High bank erosion (HBE) category with 84.4% and 67.3% accuracy. The soil bearing capacity significantly expresses highest odds (87.6%) of telling the high probability of bank erosion. The model produces an accuracy of up to 87.4%.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polymyxin-carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (PCR-Kp) with pan (PDR)- or extensively drug-resistant phenotypes has been increasingly described worldwide. Here, we report a PCR-Kp outbreak causing untreatable infections descriptively correlated with bacterial genomes. Hospital-wide surveillance of PCR-Kp was initiated in December-2014, after the first detection of a K. pneumoniae phenotype initially classified as PDR, recovered from close spatiotemporal cases of a sentinel hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Whole-genome sequencing of clinical PCR-Kp was performed to investigate similarities and dissimilarities in phylogeny, resistance and virulence genes, plasmid structures and genetic polymorphisms. A target phenotypic profile was detected in 10% (12/117) of the tested K. pneumoniae complex bacteria recovered from patients (8.5%, 8/94) who had epidemiological links and were involved in intractable infections and death, with combined therapeutic drugs failing to meet synergy. Two resistant bacterial clades belong to the same transmission cluster (ST437) or might have different sources (ST11). The severity of infection was likely related to patients' comorbidities, lack of antimicrobial therapy and predicted bacterial genes related to high resistance, survival, and proliferation. This report contributes to the actual knowledge about the natural history of PCR-Kp infection, while reporting from a time when there were no licensed drugs in the world to treat some of these infections. More studies comparing clinical findings with bacterial genetic markers during clonal spread are needed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> column with depthwise partial convolutional neural network
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived measurements are negatively impacted by cloud cover and surface reflectivity. These biases must be discarded and significantly increase the amount of missing data within remote sensing images. This paper expands the application of a partial convolutional neural network (PCNN) to incorporate depthwise convolution layers, conferring temporal dimensionality to the imputation process. The addition of a temporal dimension to the imputation process adds a state of successive existence within the dataset, which spatial imputation cannot capture. The depthwise convolution process enables the PCNN to independently convolve the data for each channel. The deep learning system is trained with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model-simulated tropospheric column density of Nitrogen Dioxide (TCDNO2) to impute TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument TCDNO2. The depthwise PCNN model achieves an index of agreement of 0.88 and outperforms the default PCNN models, with and without temporal dimensionality of data, and conventional data imputation methods such as inverse distance weighting by 4-7 and 10-15% in the index of agreement and correlation, respectively. The model demonstrates more consistency in the reconstruction of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument tropospheric column density of NO2 images. The model has also demonstrated the accurate imputation of remote sensing images with over 95% of the data missing. PCNN enables the accurate imputation of remote sensing data with large regions of missing data and will benefit future researchers conducting data assimilation for numerical models, emission studies, and human health impact analyses from air pollution.

TI  - A classification scheme for mixed-species bird flocks
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The literature on mixed-species flocks references a wide variety of bird associations. These studies, however, have used an array of unstructured characteristics to describe flocks, ranging from the temporal occurrence of flocking to the identity and behavioural features of constituent members, with little consensus on which key traits define and characterize a mixed-species flock. Moreover, although most studies report species-specific roles, there is no clear consensus about what these roles signify nor how to define them. This lack of consistency limits our ability to compare flocks from different habitats, regions and species pools. To unify this sizable body of literature, we reviewed and synthesized 538 studies on mixed-species flocks. We propose 13 categories to classify mixed-species flocks using behavioural and physical traits at the flock and participant level, as well as the habitat where the flock occurs. Lastly, we discuss the historical terminology for different species roles and propose definitions to clarify and distinguish among nuclear, leader, sentinel, and flock-following species. We envision that these guidelines will provide a universal language for mixed-species flock research, paving the way for future comparisons and new insight between different regions and systems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mixed-species groups and aggregations: shaping ecological and behavioural patterns and processes'.

TI  - Variable Accessibility to Consumer Pricing Among Breast Cancer Operations
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandate that every US hospital provide public online pricing information for services rendered. This allows patients to compare prices across hospital systems before establishing care. The goal of this project was to evaluate hospital compliance and patient-level accessibility to price transparency for common breast cancer surgical procedures.MethodsA sample case of a 62-year-old female with a T2N0 breast cancer was chosen. The patient would have the option of undergoing a partial mastectomy or mastectomy, both with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Eight Massachusetts academic medical centers were evaluated. Searches were performed by authors for each hospital system and procedure using the sample case.ResultsEvery hospital had a cost calculator on its website. The average success rate of establishing a cost for partial mastectomy, mastectomy, and SLNB was 58, 35, and 25%, respectively. The median time to reach the cost calculator tool was 32 s (range 25-37 s). In successful attempts, the median pre-insurance estimated cost of a partial mastectomy was $16,509 (range $11,776-22,169), compared with $24,541 (range $16,921-25,543) for mastectomy and $12,342 (range $4034-20,644) for SLNB. SLNB costs varied significantly across hospitals (p = 0.025), but no statistically significant difference was observed for partial mastectomy or mastectomy.ConclusionDespite new regulatory requirements by CMS for increased price transparency for surgical procedures, our results demonstrate poor success rates in obtaining cost estimates and significant variability of reported hospital charges. Further efforts to improve the quality of hospital cost estimate calculators are necessary for informed decision-making for patients with breast cancer.

TI  - A rapid and accurate method of mapping invasive Tamarix genotypes using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The management of invasive Tamarix genotypes depends on reliable and accurate information of their extent and distribution. This study investigated the utility of the multispectral Sentinel-2 imageries to map infestations of the invasive Tamarix along three riparian ecosystems in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Methods: The Sentinel-2 image was acquired from the GloVis website (http://glovis. usgs.gov/). Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were used to classify and estimate the spatial distribution of invasive Tamarix genotypes and other land-cover types in three riparian zones viz. the Leeu, Swart and Olifants rivers. A total of 888 reference points comprising of actual 86 GPS points and additional 802 points digitized using the Google Earth Pro free software were used to ground-truth the Sentinel-2 image classification. Results: The results showed the random forest classification produced an overall accuracy of 87.83% (with kappa value of 0.85), while SVM achieved an overall accuracy of 86.31% with kappa value of 0.83. The classification results revealed that the Tamarix invasion was more rampant along the Olifants River near De Rust with a spatial distribution of 913.39 and 857.74 ha based on the RF and SVM classifiers, respectively followed by the Swart River with Tamarix coverage of 420.06 ha and 715.46 hectares, respectively. The smallest extent of Tamarix invasion with only 113.52 and 74.27 hectares for SVM and RF, respectively was found in the Leeu River. Considering the overall accuracy of 85% as the lowest benchmark for a robust classification, the results obtained in this study suggests that the SVM and RF classification of the Sentinel-2 imageries were effective and suitable to map invasive Tamarix genotypes and discriminate them from other land-cover types.

TI  - Multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach in monitoring of deformation zone with permanent monitoring solution and management of environmental changes: A case study of Solotvyno salt mine, Ukraine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt deposits were a rich source of mineral resources in the past, and some are still mined today. However, salt mines, especially abandoned ones, pose a threat to populated areas, infrastructure and the natural environment. Solotvyno (Ukraine) is one of the most significantly affected areas, with a deformation zone where significant year-on-year subsidences occur. Mining activities have caused a disturbance of the balance in the mountain massif, and as a consequence, the mountains are being reshaped, and the land cover is deformed. Deformation zone of the historical salt mine Solotvyno (Ukraine), Tyachiv district of Zakarpattia region is situated on the right bank of the Tisza river in the border area with Romania in Central Europe. This paper deals with the multi-sensor monitoring of the active deformation zone over the Solotvyno salt mine using satellite radar data (Sentinel-1), optical satellite imagery (Pleiades, SPOT) and in-situ UAV photogrammetry. Since the area represents a significant geohazard from a hydrogeological (Tisza River) and civil security standpoints (infrastructure of the inhabited regions), the design of a high-precision monitoring system to monitor and evaluate current environmental changes is proposed. Multi-temporal InSAR analysis exposed steeper subsidence tendencies of >-2 cm in the central part of the monitored area. Optical satellite and UAV images confirmed the increase in water surface in sinkhole areas up to 28,500 m(2) and proved the emergence of new sinkholes in the central part of the Solotvyno mine. The aim of this study is to describe the post-collapse deformation processes by Pleiades and SPOT multi-spectral sensors and Sentinel-1 satellite SAR sensors since the 2010 collapse in order to describe the trends of deformation due to undermining and propose a high-precision permanent monitoring system based on satellite radar interferometry (InSAR).

TI  - Understanding the spatial distribution and plausible genesis of supraglacial debris over the Himalaya-Karakoram region
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The majority of studies discuss the impact of supraglacial debris on glaciers' health while the rationale behind the formation and regional distribution of supraglacial debris in the Himalayan-Karakoram (H-K) region is sparsely researched. The present study attempts to evaluate the role of meteorological, topographical, and geological parameters to understand the regional distribution and plausible genesis of supraglacial debris in the H-K area. Glacier-wise Fractional Debris Cover (FDC) for similar to 5000 glaciers have been estimated using LANDSAT-7 data (1999-2001) based on the Normalized Difference Snow Index. The aforementioned parameters, including FDC, are compiled into a comprehensive database and analysed. Moreover, "2-meter air temperature" from ERA-5 climatological data is used to estimate the number of Freeze-Thaw Cycles. Overall meteorological and topographical parameters show a significant correlation with the distribution of FDC across the H-K region, more prominently for glaciers having low FDC (<0.2). FDC distribution shows a strong dependency on glacier hypsometry with the highest FDC for "Very Bottom Heavy" glaciers and the lowest for "Very Top Heavy" glaciers. The glaciers with Limestone bearing lithology have maximum FDC and are sparsely distributed, but the glaciers with quartzite bearing lithology are widely distributed across the region and have lower FDC.

TI  - A TMVP1-modified near-infrared nanoprobe: molecular imaging for tumor metastasis in sentinel lymph node and targeted enhanced photothermal therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTMVP1 is a novel tumor targeting polypeptide screened by our laboratory with a core sequence of five amino acids LARGR. It specially binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), which is mainly expressed on neo-lymphatic vessels in sentinel lymph node (SLN) with tumor metastasis in adults. Here, we prepared a targeted nanoprobe using TMVP1-modified nanomaterials for tumor metastasis SLN imaging.ResultsIn this study, TMVP1-modified polymer nanomaterials were loaded with the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye, indocyanine green (ICG), to prepare a molecular imaging TMVP1-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) to identify tumor metastasis in SLN at molecular level. TMVP1-ICG-NPs were successfully prepared using the nano-precipitation method. The particle diameter, morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency, UV absorption spectrum, cytotoxicity, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties were determined. The TMVP1-ICG-NPs had a diameter of approximately 130 nm and an ICG loading rate of 70%. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo mouse experiments confirmed that TMVP1-ICG-NPs have good targeting ability to tumors in situ and to SLN with tumor metastasis by binding to VEGFR-3. Effective photothermal therapy (PTT) with TMVP1-ICG-NPs was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. As expected, TMVP1-ICG-NPs improved ICG blood stability, targeted tumor metastasis to SLN, and enhanced PTT/photodynamic (PDT) therapy, without obvious cytotoxicity, making it a promising theranostic nanomedicine.ConclusionTMVP1-ICG-NPs identified SLN with tumor metastasis and were used to perform imaging-guided PTT, which makes it a promising strategy for providing real-time NIR fluorescence imaging and intraoperative PTT for patients with SLN metastasis.

T2  - EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to document both quantitatively and qualitatively the characteristics of spiritual awakenings and their transformational effects in scientists and academics who reported having experienced this phenomenon; it also aimed to explore barriers these individuals perceived to sharing their experiences with others within society. Methods: An interview questionnaire was used to collect detailed descriptions of both the physical and metaphysical experiences of 54 scientists and academics having had a spiritually transformative experience (STE) (e.g., spontaneous energetic awakenings, awakenings occurring through near-death experiences (NDEs), and through spiritual practices). Results and Conclusions: Participants reported the STE as a mystical experience involving feelings of expansion (including conscious awareness leaving the body), energy rising up the spine, a sense of being enveloped in light, love or part of a unified energetic field. Principle triggers for these experiences included concentrating on spiritual matters, the presence of a spiritually developed person, and intense meditation or prayer. Transformational changes in participants included increased sensory sensitivity, creativity, and changes in beliefs, including a desire to serve others, a sense of unity with all, and the immortality of the spirit. Effects on career ranged from incorporating their new worldview and spiritual insights into the way they interacted with others within their current career, to radically changing their career to focus on questions related to the fundamental nature of consciousness or to serve others from this new perspective. Among barriers to sharing experiences, participants noted their concern that they would be misunderstood or ridiculed by others.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations of stage-area hysteretic relationships in large heterogeneous lake-floodplain systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hysteretic relationship between the water level and the inundated area is one of the basic non-linear characteristics of lake hydrology. However, it is difficult to obtain this relationship accurately, especially for large floodplain lakes that exhibit time-varying boundaries with rapid water-level fluctuations. Taking the largest lake-floodplain system of the Yangtze River basin - Poyang Lake and its extremely productive wetland - as an example, we investigated the spatial-temporal variation of the stage-area hysteretic relationship in large het-erogeneous lake-floodplain systems by adopting the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflection Fusion Model (ESTARFM) based on the observed water levels and reconstructed high spatial-temporal resolution inundation datasets using multi-source remote sensing data. The major results indicate that the inundation dynamics in the regions of the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes are remarkably inconsistent. Concerning the inundation behavior of the river and lake-floodplain, a conceptual model was established to explain the formation mechanism of the counter-clockwise and clockwise stage-area hysteretic relationships in the Poyang lake-floodplain system. Further investigation revealed that seasonal lakes exist widely in floodplain settings and have a crucial impact on increasing the hysteresis of upstream stations and decreasing that of downstream stations. The magnitude and direction of the stage-area hysteretic relationships varied with time in a changin-g environment. This study extends the understanding of the complexity of hydrological behavior in large het-erogeneous lake-floodplain systems, which is of vital importance for lake water resources and ecological management.

TI  - A Combined Assessment of Sea Level Rise (SLR) Effect on Antalya Gulf (Turkiye) and Future Predictions on Land Loss
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) and its impact on coastal areas and low-lying topographies have a risk of increasing significance day by day because of its direct effect on geology, economy and urbanization, such as shoreline changes, land loss, re-planning of infrastructure and social impacts. In addition to the traditional measurement methods like tide gauges used in the past, satellite monitoring and data have enriched the scope of studies on SLR and allowed the combined analysis of different data. Antalya, located in the Mediterranean basin of Turkiye and leading in tourism revenues, is an important city where more than 2.5 million people live and are visited by over 15 million tourists yearly, creating an over 10 billion-dollar economy for the country. The effect of SLR on the Antalya Gulf was evaluated by considering five different scenarios that are expected to occur depending on carbon emission rates and SLR values varying from 100 to 500 cm. Inundated regions due to the SLR along the Antalya Gulf were determined using DEMs produced from SRTM satellite images with 30-m resolution and merged with the land use/land cover (LULC) maps acquired from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery with 10-m resolution. Sixteen settlements in the region were classified according to the predominant LULC characteristics, and the effect of SLR was evaluated. It is expected that more than 250 km(2) of land loss and a comprehensive shift in shoreline may occur in the Antalya Gulf within 60-80 years.

TI  - Mangrove species mapping through phenological analysis using random forest algorithm on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing rapid, reliable, and accurate mapping methods is essential to support mangrove species inventory and conservation. The vegetative phenological analysis approach can be incorporated to differentiate mangrove species based on time-series image data. This study aims to (1) characterize the phenological signatures of mangrove species in the observed area, and (2) use the vegetative phenological patterns for mangrove species mapping using the random forest (RF) algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We characterized the vegetative phenological signatures of mangrove species using 82 filtered Sentinel-2 multi-temporal images from 2018 to 2020. Three vegetation indices, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), were compared to observe the mangrove vegetative phenophases trends using the GEE platform. The Mean Decrease of Gini (MDG) and the Mean Decrease of Accuracy (MDA) were calculated to determine months with critical vegetative phenophases of each mangrove species. There were six mangrove species classes and one intertidal class included in the classification at the Clungup Mangrove Conservation (CMC) area in Malang, Indonesia. Each mangrove species phenophases showed that the curve value increased in the rainy season and decreased in the dry season based on the vegetation index value fluctuations. We found that using RF-based classification, we can use these phenophases patterns to differentiate between one mangrove species to another. Our finding shows that the wet months in the middle to the end of the rainy season play an important role in distinguishing between mangrove species. The vegetative phenological analysis resulted in high accuracy in mapping mangrove species in the study area, with an overall accuracy of 72.01% for EVI, 81.82% for SAVI, and 82.51% for NDVI. The results demonstrated that mangrove species could be differentiated and mapped using vegetative phenological analysis based on multitemporal images.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe use of indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared fluorescence imaging is a promising option for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in cutaneous melanoma. The study objective was to compare the performance of ICG and blue dye at detecting SLNs with radioisotope nanocolloid (technetium-99).MethodsBetween April 2018 and June 2022, 293 consecutive patients with cutaneous melanoma (Breslow thickness >= 0.8 mm) underwent wide local excision and SLN biopsy. Patients were divided into group A (ICG; n = 122) and group B (blue dye; n = 163). All patients underwent SPECT/CT imaging preoperatively. SLN detection parameters and complications were compared between the groups.ResultsA total of 285 patients had complete data and were included in the analysis. The median age was 62.0 (range 10-91) years, and 139 (48.8%) were female patients. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.6 mm, 89 (31.2%) patients had ulceration, and 179 (62.8%) patients had mitosis >= 1 mm(2). The mean number of SLNs detected per patient in group A was 1.58 and group B was 1.48. In groups A and B, the SLN detection rate was 96.7% versus 89.6% (p = 0.022) and the pathological SLN detection rate was 92.3% versus 97.1% (p = 0.481), respectively.ConclusionsICG had a higher SLN detection rate and equal pathological SLN detection rate to blue dye. ICG may not be inferior to blue dye and is a useful adjunct to radioisotope in SLN biopsy in cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Development of a near-infrared band derived water indices algorithm for rapid flash flood inundation mapping from sentinel-2 remote sensing datasets
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid satellite-based flash flood inundation mapping and the delivery of flash flood inundation maps during a flash flood event for wetland communities can provide valuable information for decision-makers to put relief measures and emergency responses in place without delay. With remote sensing techniques, flash flood mapping of large areas, basically wetlands, can be done quickly with a high level of precision through different water indices. This study developed an algorithm for rapid flash flood inundation mapping for crisis management through the demarcation of the most flash flood-inundated areas in the Haor Basin (wetlands) of Bangladesh by utilizing high-resolution Sentinel-2 remotely sensed data. The algorithm applied here involves near-infrared (NIR) spectral band-derived indices, namely, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) to develop a rapid flash flood water detection technique integrating three year (2017-2019) datasets before and after flash floods. A simple threshold method was created to cluster the data and identify the flash flood pixels in the imagery using a density slicing technique followed by natural break analysis. Calculations were then made to estimate the flash flood (inundated), mixed pixels and non-inundated pixels for each year and three combinations. NDVI and NDWI, as well as their combinations (NDVI-NDWI), were remarkably effective for extracting inundation, non-inundation and mixed pixels. Additionally, highly consistent results were obtained for all inundation classes in the studied areas, confirming that NIR-derived indices can effectively detect water pixels. However, a higher inundation pixel value was observed in the Tahirpur Subdistrict compared with the other two study areas (Gowainghat and Kulaura). The developed NIR band-derived water indices algorithm produced more than 80.0% accuracy to detect water-related pixels when verified with ground reference points. As shown by these results, the developed NIR band-derived water indices were capable of effectively detecting flash flood water turbidity in wetland areas. Therefore, these NIR band-derived water indices can be applied for rapid flash flood inundation mapping just after a flash flood occurrence for immediate decisions to support affected farmers.

TI  - Deep ultraviolet fluorescence sensing with multispectral imaging to detect and monitor food-borne pathogens on the leafy green phyllosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Demand for sustainable and safe raw agricultural commodities is growing rapidly worldwide. Reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses associated with fresh produce is a task which the industry and academic researchers have been struggling with for many years. There is an immediate need to devise a non-invasive optical detection system to monitor the food-borne pathogens on the leaf surface. The detection of foodborne pathogens on leafy produce is performed often too late because of the invasive techniques used to evaluate the pathogen colonization. Use of deep ultraviolet fluorescence (DUVF) sensing and visible-near infrared multispectral imaging (MSI) has previously been used to monitor plant interactions against both biotic and abiotic stress regimes. Using the patho-system that we developed to monitor Salmonella sp. and Listeria sp. ingression in leafy greens such as lettuce/spinach, we show that plant response in terms of fluctuation of chlorophyll pigments post-Salmonella/Listeria treatment is rapid. We also show that the mode of application of Salmonella/Listeria via foliar or root supplementation changes the ChlA response. Our data also reveals that the plant sentinel response in terms of early photosynthetic response may be critical to detect food-borne pathogens on leafy greens. MSI demonstrated that plant stress was detectable and proportional to the bacterial inoculation rate on plants. Our research may lead to implementation of better strategies and technology to increase yield and reduce risks associated with contamination of foodborne bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Targeted Axillary Dissection with <SUP>125</SUP>I Seed Placement Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in a Danish Multicenter Cohort
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundTargeted axillary dissection (TAD), with marking of the metastatic lymph node before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), is increasingly used for breast cancer axillary staging. In the case of axillary pathological complete response (ax-pCR), axillary lymph node clearance can be omitted. Several marking methods exist, most using re-marking before surgery. Feasibility, learning curve, and identification rate (IR) vary. Marking with I-125 seed before NACT makes re-marking at surgery redundant, possibly increasing feasibility and IR. Here, TAD with I-125 seed placed before NACT is evaluated in a Danish multicenter cohort.MethodsPatients staged with I-125 TAD in Denmark between 1 January 2016 and 31 August 2021 were included. Patients were identified in radioactivity-emitting implant registries at the radiology departments and from the Danish Breast Cancer Group database. Data were extracted from patients' medical records. Information on patient/tumor characteristics, I-125 seed activity, marking period, TAD success, number of sentinel nodes (SNs), the histopathological status of excised nodes, and whether the marked lymph node (MLN) was an SN were registered.Results142 patients were included. The IR of the MLN was 99.3%, and the IR of the SLNB was 91.5%. TAD success was 91.5%. Minor challenges in marking or removal of the MLN were noted in three patients. In 72.3% of the patients, the MLN was a sentinel node. Overall, 40.8% had axillary pCR.ConclusionTAD with I-125 seed marking before NACT is feasible without re-marking at surgery and with only minor surgical challenges. The IR is high. Staging with TAD spares 41% of breast cancer patients an axillary dissection.

TI  - Seasonality of the QBO Impact on Equatorial Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) dominates the interannual variability in the tropical lower stratosphere and is characterized by the descent of alternating easterly and westerly zonal winds. The QBO impact on tropical clouds and convection has received great attention in recent years due to its implications for weather and climate. In this study, a 15-year record of high vertical resolution cloud observations from CALIPSO and a 50 hPa zonal wind QBO index from ERA5 are used to document the QBO impact on equatorial (10 degrees S-10 degrees N) clouds. Observations from radio occultations, the CERES instrument, and the ERA5 reanalysis are also used to document the QBO impact on temperature, cloud radiative effect (CRE), and zonal wind, respectively. It is shown that the QBO impact on zonal mean equatorial cloud fraction has a strong seasonality. The strongest cloud fraction response to the QBO occurs in boreal spring and early summer, which extends from above the mean tropopause to similar to 12.5 km and results in a significant longwave CRE anomaly of 1 W/m(2). The seasonality of the QBO impact on cloud fraction is synchronized with the QBO impacts on temperature and zonal wind in the tropical upper troposphere.Plain Language Summary Approximately every 2 years, eastward or westward winds in the stratosphere above the equator reverse their direction. This pattern of alternating wind direction is called the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). In this study, we use fine vertical resolution satellite data to examine the QBO impact on clouds, which can be signals of storminess and can impact weather and climate. We find that the QBO impact on equatorial clouds spans a deep vertical extent of the upper troposphere and shows a strong seasonality. These cloud responses imply a significant change in the Earth's radiation budget. We also find that the seasonal variations in QBO-cloud connections are concurrent with seasonal variation in QBO-related wind and temperature signals. These changes are most significant during northern hemisphere spring and early summer.

TI  - The 2021 Ms 6.0 Luxian (China) Earthquake: Blind Reverse-Fault Rupture in Deep Sedimentary Formations Likely Induced by Pressure Perturbation From Hydraulic Fracturing
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To resolve the occurrence mechanism of the Luxian earthquake occurred near an active hydraulic fracturing well pad on 15 September 2021, we first use seismic waveforms to invert the focal mechanism solution and centroid depth, and then utilize Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar images and Global Navigation Satellite System observations to determine the seismogenic fault and slip distribution. Our results show that the Luxian event ruptured a previously-unmapped southwest-dipping reverse fault intersecting with one horizontal well of the well pad. Major slip occurred below the shale gas bed (similar to 4 km deep) but above the crystalline basement (similar to 7 km deep). Further analyses on preseismic surface deformation initiated in the northeast of the event reveal that pore pressure near the hypocenter was increased by similar to 4.5 MPa. Consequently, fracking fluid injected through the horizontal well and other wells of nearby pads likely flowed directly into the fault zones and prompted the occurrence of the Luxian earthquake.

TI  - Consistency of serial ultrasonographic joint tissue measurements by the Joint <sub>tissue</sub>Activity and Damage Exam (JADE) protocol in relation to hemophilic joint health parameters
T2  - BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe Joint (tissue)Activity and Damage Exam (JADE) is a point-of-care (POC) musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSKUS) protocol for non-radiologists to evaluate hemophilic arthopathy. Our aim was to determine the consistency of cross-sectional analyses of direct tissue measurements (JADE protocol) and clinical Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS] and functional joint assessments (arc) at three clinic visits.MethodsWe prospectively studied adults (n = 44) with hemophilia (A or B) of any severity and arthropathy at 3 North American sites. We assessed HJHS, total arc, and JADE parameters (bilateral elbows, ankles, and knees) at study entry, at approximate to 12-18 months, and at approximate to 24-36 months, and used MSKUS to evaluate painful episodes between study visits. JADE measurements included osteochondral alterations, cartilage thickness, and soft tissue expansion at sentinel positions. Associations between joint HJHS and total arc with each JADE variable were examined with random intercept models.ResultsAt each visit increasing HJHS and decreasing total arc were associated in the expected direction with increasing length of OAs and soft tissue expansion in all joints, and decreasing cartilage thickness in the knee. However, HJHS associations with cartilage thickness were U-shaped for elbow and ankle (i.e. cartilage thinning and thickening). Associations between total arc and cartilage thickness followed a similar curve. (Near) normal levels of both joint parameters (HJHS and total arc) were associated with normal ranges of cartilage thickness. JADE views were also helpful to detect hemarthrosis in association with joint pains.ConclusionsPOC MSKUS applying direct tissue measurements using the JADE protocol provided reproducible cross-sectional associations with joint health outcomes on three visits. These findings advance protocol validation and enable iterative adaptations resulting in JADE protocol version 2.

TI  - Research on the ozone formation sensitivity indicator of four urban agglomerations of China using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data and ground-based measurements
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near surface ozone is a typical secondary pollutant, and is mostly generated by a series of complex photochemical re-actions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air under sunlight. At present, a large number of studies have applied FNR (a ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieved by satellite) indicator to study the ozone formation sensitivity (OFS). OFS analysis is critical for taking targeted ozone pollution pre-vention and control measures. Regional OFS can be more accurately diagnosed by utilizing localized FNR threshold. In this study, localized FNR thresholds were established for four severe ozone polluted urban agglomerations in China (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, and Chengdu-Chongqing (CY) region), based on the statistical analysis between FNR (obtained from OMI observation, with daily transit time of approximately 13:45 local standard time) and Delta O3/Delta NO2 (the ratio of ozone change to nitro-gen dioxide change between two consecutive months, obtained from ground measurements) from 2014 to 2016. And these thresholds were verified by the statistical analysis between FNR and Delta O3/O3 (ozone change rate between two consecutive months), and between FNR and O3 concentration during the OFS significant shift months. Furthermore, the results were also compared and verified with the method proposed by previous studies. The results indicate that there are significant regional dependences in the FNR threshold, and the lower-upper limits for the four urban agglom-erations are as follows: 0.65-1.21 for BTH, 0.64-1.48 for the YRD, 1.25-2.39 for the PRD, and 1.44-3.69 for CY (FNR < lower limit indicates VOCs-limited regime; lower limit < FNR < upper limit indicates transitional regime; FNR > upper limit indicates NOx-limited regime). This method eliminates the problems associated with the undifferentiated use of FNR thresholds in different regions and significantly reduces the deviations for OFS.

TI  - SVM-based classification of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery of dense urban land cover of Delhi-NCR region
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The technological breakthrough and the availability of multispectral remote sensing data have given rise to an ambitious challenge for the classification of the multispectral images accurately to support administrative bodies in decision-making. In this paper, the multi-temporal medium resolution Sentinel-2 imagery of the densely populated urban area of Delhi-NCR is classified using SVM into five different land cover classes, namely water bodies, barren land, vegetative region, road network, and residential areas. Further, the effect of different kernel functions of SVM on land cover classification performance is contrasted and the radial basis function (RBF) leads to the best results. The experimental results are compared with the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method on different evaluation metrics. The SVM with RBF kernel shows promising improvements in the overall accuracy by 10% relative to the polynomial kernel and by 3% compared to MLC. The analysis of multitemporal spectral imagery of the study area reflects the increase in a built-up area (road network, Buildings), water bodies, and decrement in the area of barren land and vegetation.

TI  - Predictive factors for dissection-free sentinel node micrometastases in early oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This sentinel node (SN) biopsy trial aimed to assess its effectiveness in identifying predictive factors of micrometastases and to determine whether elective neck dissection is necessary in oral squamous cell carcinoma. This retrospective study included 55 patients from three previous trials, with positive SNs. The relationship between the sizes of the metastatic focus and metastasis in non-sentinel node (NSN) was investigated. Four of the 55 largest metastatic focus were isolated tumor cells, and the remaining 51 were ranged from 0.2 to 15 mm, with a median of 2.6 mm. The difference of prevalence between 46 negative- and 9 positive-NSN was statistically significant with regard to age, long diameter of primary site and number of cases with regional recurrence. In comparing the size of largest metastatic focus dividing the number of positive SN, with metastaic focus range of < 3.0 mm in one-positive SN group, there were 18 (33%) negative-NSN and no positive-NSN. Regarding prognosis, 3-year overall survival rate of this group (n = 18) and other (n = 37) were 94% and 73% (p = 0.04), and 3-year recurrence free survival rate of this group and other were 94% and 51% (p = 0.03), respectively. Absolutely a further prospective clinical trial would be needed, micrometastases may be defined as solitary SN metastasis with < 3.0 mm of metastatic focus, and approximately 33% of neck dissections could be avoided using these criteria.

TI  - Multidecadal evaluation of changes in coffee-growing areas using Landsat data in Central Highlands, Vietnam
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vietnam is the world's second-largest coffee exporter. Information on coffee-growing areas is thus important for production estimation. This research developed an approach for coffee mapping and change detection using Landsat and DEM data in Central Highlands, Vietnam. The data were processed for 1995, 2005, and 2020 using random forests (RF). The mapping results, verified with reference data, showed overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient higher than 86.9% and 0.74, respectively. These findings were reaffirmed by a close relationship between the satellite-based coffee area and official statistics, with the root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) greater than 9.9% and 7.6%, respectively. From 1995 to 2020, the newly planted coffee area increased by 135,520 ha, due to the conversion of forests to coffee plantations. Such distributions of coffee areas and decadal changes in farming activities are critically useful for policymakers to formulate successful crop planning strategies.

T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physical geography is the foundation of urban social and economic development. The quantity and quality of land resources and their distribution directly affect the economic, social, environmental and comprehensive benefits of the city. Now, in our country, low land use efficiency and irrational land structure in physical geography are both prominent phenomena. One of the main reasons is the lack of scientific and reasonable physical geography land use structure and utilization efficiency plan. Using remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this paper conducts a comprehensive and systematic survey of urban land use changes and obtains land use classification maps for two periods, supports further research and correctly guides people to develop and utilize natural resources and protect the ecological environment and provide powerful reference materials for realizing sustainable land use and sustainable social and economic development. In addition, this article will also introduce multi-source remote sensing image data fusion technology, including fusion information representation, fusion principle, fusion system framework model, fusion algorithm, control and application. By combining ETM remote sensing data with large-scale topographic maps, GIS is used as a supporting tool to construct a spatial database of urban environment, which promotes the development of research.

TI  - Experimental warming causes mismatches in alpine plant-microbe-fauna phenology
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term observations have shown that many plants and aboveground animals have changed their phenology patterns due to warmer temperatures over the past decades. However, empirical evidence for phenological shifts in alpine organisms, particularly belowground organisms, is scarce. Here, we investigate how the activities and phenology of plants, soil microbes, and soil fauna will respond to warming in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, and whether their potential phenological changes will be synchronized. We experimentally simulate an increase in soil temperature by 2-4 degrees C according to future projections for this region. We find that warming promotes plant growth, soil microbial respiration, and soil fauna feeding by 8%, 57%, and 20%, respectively, but causes dissimilar changes in their phenology during the growing season. Specifically, warming advances soil faunal feeding activity in spring and delays it in autumn, while their peak activity does not change; whereas warming increases the peak activity of plant growth and soil microbial respiration but with only minor shifts in their phenology. Such phenological asynchrony in alpine organisms may alter ecosystem functioning and stability.Phenological shifts driven by climate change are well-studied in plants and aboveground animals, but scarcely in belowground biota. Here, the authors show that soil warming causes phenological mismatches between plants, soil microbes and soil microarthropods in an alpine meadow.

TI  - Identification of cotton and corn plant areas by employing deep transformer encoder approach and different time series satellite images: A case study in Diyarbakir, Turkey
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is very important to determine the crops in the agricultural field in a short time and accurately. Thanks to the satellite images obtained from remote sensing sensors, information can be obtained on many subjects such as the detection and development of agricultural products and annual product forecasting. In this study, it is aimed to automatically detect agricultural crops (corn and cotton) by using Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite image indexes via a new deep learning approach (Deep Transformer Encoder).This work was carried out in several stages, respectively. In the first stage, a pilot area was determined to obtain Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite images of agricultural crops used in this study. In the second stage, the coordinates of 100 sample points from this pilot area were taken with the help of GPS and these coordinates were then transferred to Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 satellite images. In the next step, reflection and backscattering values were obtained from the pixels of the satellite images corresponding to the sample points of these agricultural crops. While creating the data sets of satellite images, the months of June, July, August and September for the years 2016-2021, when the development and harvesting times of agricultural products are close to each other, were preferred. The image data set used in the study consists of a total of 434 images for Sentinel-1 satellite and a total of 693 images for Landsat-8.At the last stage, the datasets obtained from different satellite images were evaluated in three different categories for crop identification with the aid of Deep Transformer Encoder approach. These are: (1-) Crop identification with only Sentinel-1 dataset, (2-) Crop identification only with Landsat-8 dataset, (3-) Crop identification with both Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 datasets. The results showed that 85%, 95% and 87.5% accuracy values were obtained from the band parameters of Sentinel-1 dataset, Landsat-8 dataset and Sentinel1&Landsat-8 datasets, respectively.

TI  - Synergy between TROPOMI sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and MODISspectral reflectance for understanding the dynamics of gross primaryproductivity at Integrated Carbon Observatory System (ICOS) ecosystem fluxsites
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP), which is the amount of carbon taken up by vegetation through photosynthesis for a given time and area, is critical for understanding terrestrial-atmosphere CO2 exchange processes and ecosystem functioning, as well as ecosystem responses and adaptations to climate change. Prior studies, based on ground, airborne, and satellite sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations, have recently revealed close relationships with GPP at different spatial and temporal scales and across different plant functional types (PFTs). However, questions remain regarding whether there is a unique relationship between SIF and GPP across different sites and PFTs and how we can improve GPP estimates using solely remotely sensed data. Using concurrent measurements of daily TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF (daily SIFd); daily MODIS Terra and Aqua spectral reflectance; vegetation indices (VIs, notably normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and photochemical reflectance index (PRI)); and daily tower-based GPP across eight major different PFTs, including mixed forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, croplands, evergreen broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests, grasslands, open shrubland, and wetlands, the strength of the relationships between tower-based GPP and SIFd at 40 Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) flux sites was investigated. The synergy between SIFd and MODIS-based reflectance (R) and VIs to improve GPP estimates using a data-driven modeling approach was also evaluated. The results revealed that the strength of the hyperbolic relationship between GPP and SIFd was strongly site-specific and PFT-dependent. Furthermore, the generalized linear model (GLM), fitted between SIFd, GPP, and site and vegetation type as categorical variables, further supported this site- and PFT-dependent relationship between GPP and SIFd. Using random forest (RF) regression models with GPP as output and the aforementioned variables as predictors (R, SIFd, and VIs), this study also showed that the spectral reflectance bands (RF-R) and SIFd plus spectral reflectance (RF-SIF-R) models explained over 80 % of the seasonal and interannual variations in GPP, whereas the SIFd plus VI (RF-SIF-VI) model reproduced only 75 % of the tower-based GPP variance. In addition, the relative variable importance of predictors of GPP demonstrated that the spectral reflectance bands in the near-infrared, red, and SIFd appeared as the most influential and dominant factors determining GPP predictions, indicating the importance of canopy structure, biochemical properties, and vegetation functioning on GPP estimates. Overall, this study provides insights into understanding the strength of the relationships between GPP and SIF and the use of spectral reflectance and SIFd to improve estimates of GPP across sites and PFTs.

TI  - Recent soybean subsidy policy did not revitalize but stabilize the soybean planting areas in Northeast China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - With over 80 % of soybean demand dependent on imports, China has implemented multiple soybean stimulation policies to improve its soybean self-sufficiency. Northeast (NE) China, the leading soybean-producing region in China, produces more than half of the soybean in the country, and it is unclear whether agricultural policies had substantial effects on soybean planting areas and cropping patterns in NE China. Here, we generated annual crop maps at 10-m resolution in NE China during 2017-2021, and found that recent soybean producer subsidy policy released in 2017 has not revitalized but only stabilized the soybean planting areas in NE China, with a decline (-27.9 %) during 2020-2021 due to the high comparative benefits of maize cultivation. We found that a routine maize-soybean rotation system that might dominate the cropping patterns instead of the soybean subsidy policy. The effects of the routine rotation were more prevelant in the 2300-2700 degrees C d of the >= 10 degrees C accumulated temperature in NE China. The lower net profits of soybean than maize cultivation could be the major reason for the stagnant soybean planting areas, which could be attributed to the low yield of soybean and could not turn the tide only rely on limited producer subsidies. The soybean producer subsidy led to a stabilization of soybean planting areas, which could pave the way for future growth, and further actions are needed to stimulate soybean production in NE China, for example, maize-soybean rotation and maize-soybean strip intercropping which could achieve both productivity and sustainability.

TI  - Identification of tea plantations in typical plateau areas with the combination of Sentinel-1/2 optical and radar remote sensing data based on feature selection algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Efficiently and accurately identifying the spatial distribution of tea plantations in the subtropical plateau regions of southwest China is of great significance for ecological and environmental protection. However, the lands of those regions are fragmented with complex vegetation types. Moreover, there is much cloudy and rainy weather over those areas, making it very difficult to identify tea plantations using only optical remote sensing data. In order to solve these problems, this paper uses Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical data to design seven classification feature combinations to explore the influence of red edge features, radar features and texture features on the identification accuracy of tea plantations. The feasibility of Jeffreys-Matusita distance (JM) feature selection and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) feature selection algorithm to find the optimal feature combination is verified, and the distribution of tea plantations in the study area is acquired by using the object-oriented random forest algorithm. The study shows that (1) the combination of SAR data and optical data can effectively improve the identification accuracy of tea plantations. (2) S2 red edge features and S1 radar features can significantly improve the accuracy of the identification results of tea plantations. (3) After applying the JM distance and RFE feature selection algorithms, the producer's accuracy of tea plantations is improved by 1.39% and 2.38%, and the user's accuracy is improved by 1.02% and 1.3%, respectively, compared with the identification of all features. The overall accuracy of the random forest algorithm combined with RFE is 93.43%. This study proposes the application of feature selection algorithms in identification of tea plantations, which improves accuracy and increases efficiency while minimizing redundant features and provides an effective approach to identify tea plantations in cloudy and rainy areas in the subtropical plateau of southern China.

TI  - MD-ALL: an Integrative Platform for Molecular Diagnosis of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
T2  - Research square
M3  - Preprint
AB  - B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) consists of dozens of subtypes defined by distinct gene expression profiles (GEPs) and various genetic lesions. With the application of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), multiple novel subtypes have been identified, which lead to an advanced B-ALL classification and risk-stratification system. However, the complexity of analyzing RNA-seq data for B-ALL classification hinders the implementation of the new B-ALL taxonomy. Here, we introduce MD-ALL (Molecular Diagnosis of ALL), a user-friendly platform featuring sensitive and accurate B-ALL classification based on GEPs and sentinel genetic alterations. In this study, we systematically analyzed 2,955 B-ALL RNA-seq samples and generated a reference dataset representing all the reported B-ALL subtypes. Using multiple machine learning algorithms, we identified the feature genes and then established highly accurate models for B-ALL classification using either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. Importantly, this platform integrates the key genetic lesions, including sequence mutations, large-scale copy number variations, and gene rearrangements, to perform comprehensive and definitive B-ALL classification. Through validation in a hold-out cohort of 974 samples, our models demonstrated superior performance for B-ALL classification compared with alternative tools. In summary, MD-ALL is a user-friendly B-ALL classification platform designed to enable integrative, accurate, and comprehensive B-ALL subtype classification.

TI  - Mapping local climate zones for cities: A large review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) system provides a universal classification mechanism for urban and natural landscapes and plays an increasingly important role in urban climate research. With the rapid development of various LCZ mapping methods, a thorough survey of the LCZ mapping literature is urgently needed to better understand current progress, challenges, and future directions. Accordingly, this study provided a comprehensive review of the LCZ mapping literature during 2012-2021, with a detailed analysis on literature statistics, research topics, LCZ cities, and active research groups. Furthermore, remote sensing (RS)-based LCZ mapping methods were elucidated from feature sets, classification units, training areas, classification algorithms, and accuracy assessment; geographic information system (GIS)-based LCZ mapping methods were elaborated from LCZ pa-rameters, basic spatial units, classification algorithms, and accuracy assessment; and their combination methods were summarized from two typical integration strategies. Finally, several challenges and future directions for LCZ mapping were discussed. The topics include exploiting multi-source RS and GIS data, determining appro-priate LCZ mapping unit sizes, acquiring high-quality LCZ ground truth data, improving LCZ classification al-gorithms, optimizing LCZ parameters and subclasses, exploring the transferability of LCZ models, conducting global interannual LCZ mapping, and expanding the application of LCZs. The research community can quickly obtain abundant information on the LCZ mapping literature, understand the frameworks of different LCZ mapping methods, and inspire new directions for future research.

TI  - Evaluation of temporal changes in methane content in the atmosphere for areas with a very high rice concentration based on Sentinel-5P data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice cultivation is one of the main sources of methane (CH4) emission into the atmosphere. The research aimed to assess long-term and seasonal changes in CH4 content in the atmosphere in areas where rice production exceeds 30% of the area. These areas include India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia. CH4 content was evaluated using the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI sensor on a monthly basis from February 2019 to January 2022. Long-term and seasonal changes were assessed using statistical methods such as regression analysis and time-series analysis. The results showed that the long-term trend indicates an increase in CH4 concentration. In the analyzed period, the average annual increase in the CH4 content in the atmosphere was highest in eastern India (Bihar and West Bengal areas) and Bangladesh, from 15.9 to 19.6 ppb per year, while in Myanmar (Ayeyarwady) and Indonesia (Java) it was much lower, 3.7 and 9.9 ppb, respectively. Seasonal variability in CH4 content in the atmosphere was characterized by a large annual amplitude in the rice regions of India (from 47 to 58 ppb) and was consistent with CH4 emissions during a typical rice growth cycle. The highest CH4 content was observed in late summer i.e., before rice harvest. The results of the Sentinel-5P measurements confirm the spatial-temporal variability of atmospheric CH4 content in regions with a high share of rice production.

TI  - Quantitative study on internal detection signal of weak magnetic stress in oil and gas pipelines based on force-magnetic noncoaxial effect
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The weak magnetic stress internal detection technology is globally an important technical challenge in pipeline inspection. However, the stress concentration area in the in-service pipeline is very complex, and the influence of the stress direction on the magnetic signal is worthy of further assessment. To improve the accuracy of the magnetic signal analysis of ferromagnetic materials under stress, the angle compensation of classical model is carried out, and a finite element model of non-coaxial force and magnetic was proposed. Compared with the existing model, the improved model improves the detection accuracy within the weak magnetic stress, can more effectively assess the stress state of the pipeline, and timely repair of the pipeline according to the stress state can effectively reduce the possibility of serious accidents in the pipeline. According to the results, in the angle compensated model, the accuracy of the magnetic signal was elevated by 61%, respectively, leading to accurately predict the variation trend of magnetic signal. Gradient total characteristic parameter Stotal increased linearly with the elevation of internal pressure. With the increase of stress angle with the magnetic field, the axial amplitude parameter Rx varied 33% more than the radial amplitude parameter Ry, and the axial angle factor fx decreases at a 50% higher rate than the radial angle factor fy. It indicated that the axial component of the magnetic signal was more sensitive to the change of stress direction.

TI  - Unbalanced impacts of nature and nurture factors on the phenology, area and intensity of algal blooms in global large lakes: MODIS observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the influence of climate warming and human activities, many large lakes have experienced an increase in eutrophication and algal blooms. Although these trends have been identified using low temporal resolution (similar to 16 days) satellites such as those of the Landsat missions, the opportunity to compare high-frequency spatiotemporal variations of algal bloom characteristics between lakes has not been explored. In the present study, we explore daily satellite observations by developing a universal, practical, and robust algorithm to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of algal bloom dynamics in large lakes (>500 km(2)) across the globe. Data from 161 lakes, taken from 2000 to 2020 showed an average accuracy of 79.9 %. Algal blooms were detected in 44% of all lakes, with a higher incidence in temperate lakes (67 % of all temperate lakes), followed by tropical lakes (59 %) compared to lakes in arid climates (23 %). We found positive trends in bloom area and frequency (p < 0.05), as well as an earlier bloom time (p < 0.05). Climate factors were found to be linked to changes in annual initial bloom time (44%); while an increase in human activities was associated to bloom duration (49 %), area (max percent: 53 %, mean percent: 45 %), and frequency (46 %). The study shows the evolution of daily algal blooms and their phenology in global large lakes for the first time. Such information enhances our understanding of algal bloom dynamics and their drivers, with important considerations to improve the management of large lake ecosystems.

TI  - A fast and accurate parametric model of estimating thermal infrared atmospheric parameters: a case study for LANDSAT 8 TIRS sensor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The traditional methods used in atmospheric correction depend on the empirical relationships or the atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM). However, both of them have some deficiencies. The empirical method often depends highly on the training data; it would be applicable under certain conditions. In contrast, the RTM-based method is time consuming and has to run the code each time, which is also not an appropriate choice for operational estimation of the atmospheric parameters. In this study, a fast and accurate parametric model of estimating atmospheric parameters for Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor was proposed to balance the accuracy and efficiency. The layer optical thickness for water vapour, water vapour continuum and other gases are well parameterized in the proposed parametric model, where the band coefficients can be easily determined by a least square fitting over MODTRAN simulations. The results show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the total transmission is 0.004 and the RMSE of for both the atmospheric upward and downward radiances are about 0.0004. Therefore, the proposed model could be used without the help of any atmospheric RTM to achieve the same accuracy as RTM does, but with less computational demand; that is, this model would have a better application market.

TI  - Deep cross-modal feature learning applied to predict acutely decompensated heart failure using in-home collected electrocardiography and transthoracic bioimpedance
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Deep learning has been successfully applied to ECG data to aid in the accurate and more rapid diagnosis of acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Previous applications focused primarily on classifying known ECG patterns in well-controlled clinical settings. However, this approach does not fully capitalize on the potential of deep learning, which directly learns important features without relying on a priori knowledge. In addition, deep learning applications to ECG data obtained from wearable devices have not been well studied, especially in the field of ADHF prediction. Methods: We used ECG and transthoracic bioimpedance data from the SENTINEL-HF study, which enrolled patients (>= 21 years) who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of heart failure or with ADHF symptoms. To build an ECG-based prediction model of ADHF, we developed a deep cross-modal feature learning pipeline, termed ECGX-Net, that utilizes raw ECG time series and transthoracic bioimpedance data from wearable devices. To extract rich features from ECG time series data, we first adopted a transfer learning approach in which ECG time series were transformed into 2D images, followed by feature extraction using ImageNet-pretrained DenseNet121/VGG19 models. After data filtering, we applied cross-modal feature learning in which a regressor was trained with ECG and transthoracic bioimpedance. Then, we concatenated the DenseNet121/VGG19 features with the regression features and used them to train a support vector machine (SVM) without bioimpedance information. Results: The high-precision classifier using ECGX-Net predicted ADHF with a precision of 94 %, a recall of 79 %, and an F1-score of 0.85. The high-recall classifier with only DenseNet121 had a precision of 80 %, a recall of 98 %, and an F1-score of 0.88. We found that ECGX-Net was effective for high-precision classification, while DenseNet121 was effective for high-recall classification. Conclusion: We show the potential for predicting ADHF from single-channel ECG recordings obtained from outpatients, enabling timely warning signs of heart failure. Our cross-modal feature learning pipeline is expected to improve ECG-based heart failure prediction by handling the unique requirements of medical scenarios and resource limitations.

TI  - A heavy burden: Metal exposure across the land-ocean continuum in an adaptable carnivore
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation and associated anthropogenic activities release large quantities of toxic metals and metalloids into the environment, where they may bioaccumulate and threaten both wildlife and human health. In highly transformed landscapes, terrestrial carnivores may be at increased risk of exposure through biomagnification. We quantified metallic element and metalloid exposure in blood of caracals (Caracal caracal), an adaptable felid inhabiting the rapidly urbanising, coastal metropole of Cape Town, South Africa. Using redundancy analysis and mixed-effect models, we explored the influence of demography, landscape use, and diet on the concentration of 11 metals and metalloids. Although species-specific toxic thresholds are lacking, arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr) were present at potentially sublethal levels in several individuals. Increased use of human-transformed land-scapes, particularly urban areas, roads, and vineyards, was significantly associated with increased exposure to aluminium (Al), cobalt (Co) and lead (Pb). Foraging closer to the coast and within aquatic food webs was associated with increased levels of mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and arsenic, where regular predation on seabirds and waterbirds likely facilitates transfer of metals from aquatic to terrestrial food webs. Further, several elements were linked to lower haemoglobin levels (chromium, mercury, manganese, and zinc) and elevated levels of infection-fighting cells (mercury and selenium). Our results highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities as major environmental sources of metal contamination in terrestrial wildlife, including exposure across the land -ocean continuum. These findings contribute towards the growing evidence suggesting cities are particularly toxic areas for wildlife. Co-exposure to a suite of metal pollutants may threaten the long-term health and persistence of Cape Town's caracal population in unexpected ways, particularly when interacting with additional known pollutant and pathogen exposure. The caracal is a valuable sentinel for assessing metal exposure and can be used in pollution monitoring programmes to mitigate exposure and promote biodiversity conservation in human -dominated landscapes.

TI  - The climate change research that makes the front page: Is it fit to engage societal action?
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - By growing awareness for and interest in climate change, media coverage enlarges the window of opportunity by which research can engage individuals and collectives in climate actions. However, we question whether the climate change research that gets mediatized is fit for this challenge. From a survey of the 51,230 scientific articles published in 2020 on climate change, we show that the news media preferentially publicizes research outputs found in multidisciplinary journals and journals perceived as top-tier. An in-depth analysis of the content of the top-100 mediatized papers, in comparison to a random subset, reveals that news media showcases a narrow and limited facet of climate change knowledge (i.e., natural science and health). News media selectivity reduces climate change research to the role of a sentinel and whistleblower for the large-scale, observed, or end -of-century consequences of climate change for natural Earth system components. The social, economic, tech-nological, and energy aspects of climate change are curtailed through mediatization, as well as local and short-term scales of processes and solutions. Reviewing the social psychological mechanisms that underlie behavioral change, we challenge the current criteria used to judge newsworthiness and argue that the consequent media-tization of climate change research fails to breed real society engagement in actions. A transformative agenda for the mediatization of climate change research implies aligning newsworthiness with news effectiveness, i.e., addressing the extent to which communication is effective in presenting research that is likely to produce behavioral change.

TI  - The 2022 Hunga-Tonga megatsunami: Near-field simulation of a once-in-a-century event
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcanic eruption in January 2022 generated catastrophic tsunami and contends for the largest natural explosion in more than a century. The main island, Tongatapu, suffered waves up to 17 m, and Tofua Island suffered waves up to 45 m, comfortably placing HTHH in the "megatsunami" league. We present a tsunami simulation of the Tongan Archipelago calibrated by field observations, drone, and satellite data. Our simulation emphasizes how the complex shallow bathymetry of the area acted as a low -ve-locity wave trap, capturing tsunami for more than 1 hour. Despite its size and long duration, few lives were lost. Simulation suggests that HTHH's location relative to urban centers saved Tonga from a worse outcome. Whereas 2022 seems to have been a lucky escape, other oceanic volcanoes have the capacity to spawn future tsunami at HTHH scale. Our simulation amplifies the state of understanding of volcanic explosion tsunami and provides a framework for assessment of future hazards.

TI  - Towards precision forestry: Drought response from remote sensing-based disturbance monitoring and fine-scale soil information in Central Europe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prolonged drought and susceptibility to biotic stressors induced an extensive calamity in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and widespread crown defoliation in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Central Europe. For future man-agement decisions, it is crucial to link changes in canopy cover to site conditions. However, current knowledge on the role of soil properties for drought-induced forest disturbance is limited due to the scarcity and low spatial resolution of soil information. We present a fine-scale assessment on the role of soil properties for forest disturbance in Norway spruce and European beech derived from optical remote sensing. A forest disturbance modeling framework based on Sentinel-2 time series was applied on 340 km2 in low mountain ranges of Central Germany. Spatio-temporal infor-mation on forest disturbance was calculated at 10 m spatial resolution in the period 2019-2021 and intersected with high-resolution soil information (1:10,000) based on roughly 2850 soil profiles. We found distinct differences in dis-turbed area, depending on soil type, texture, stoniness, effective rooting depth and available water capacity (AWC). For spruce, we found a polynomial relationship between AWC (R2 = 0.7) and disturbance, with highest disturbed area (65 %) for AWC between 90 and 160 mm. Interestingly, we found no evidence for generally higher disturbance on shallow soils, although stands on the deepest soils were significantly less affected. Noteworthy, sites affected first did not necessarily exhibit highest proportions of disturbed area post-drought, indicating recovery or adaptation. We conclude that site-and species-specific understanding of drought impacts benefits from a combination of remote sensing and fine-scale soil information. Since our approach revealed which sites were affected first and most, it qual-ifies for prioritizing in situ monitoring activities to most vulnerable stands in acute drought conditions as well as for developing long-term strategies for reforestation and site-specific risk assessment for precision forestry.

TI  - Shelf break exchange processes influence the availability of the northern shortfin squid, <i>Illex illecebrosus</i>, in the Northwest Atlantic
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States Northern Shortfin squid fishery is known for its large fluctuations in catch at annual scales. In the last 5 years, this fishery has experienced increased availability of Illex illecebrosus along the Northeast US continental shelf (NES), resulting in high catch per unit effort (CPUE) and early fishery closures due to quota exceedance. The fishery occurs within the Northwest Atlantic, whose complex dynamics are set up by the interplay between the large-scale Gulf Stream, mesoscale eddies, Shelfbreak Jet, and shelf-slope exchange processes. Our ability to understand and quantify this regional variability is requisite for understanding the availability patterns of Illex, which are largely influenced by oceanographic conditions. In an effort to advance our current understanding of the seasonal and interannual variability in this species' relative abundance on the NES, we used generalized additive models to examine the relationships between the physical environment and hotspots of productivity to changes in CPUE of I. illecebrosus in the Southern stock component, which comprises the US fishery. Specifically, we derived oceanographic indicators by pairing high-resolution remote sensing data and global ocean reanalysis physical data to high-resolution fishery catch data. We identified a suite of environmental covariates that were strongly related to instances of higher catch rates. In particular, bottom temperature, warm core rings, subsurface features, and frontal dynamics together serve as indicators of habitat condition and primary productivity hotspots, providing great utility for understanding the distribution of Illex with the potential for forecasting seasonal and interannual availability.

TI  - In the bosom of the Earth: a new megalithic monument at the Antequera World Heritage Site
T2  - ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antequera in southern Spain is widely recognised as an outstanding example of the European megalithic phe-nomenon. One of its most remarkable features is the evident relationship between conspicuous natural for-mations and human-built monuments. Here, the authors report the results of their investigation of a tomb newly discovered at the site of Piedras Blancas at the foot of La Pena de los Enamorados, a limestone massif that dominates the Antequera plain. Excavation and multidisciplinary study, including geological, architectural and archaeoastronomical investigations, have revealed a complex funerary monument that is part natural, part built, part hypogeum, part megalith. The results emphasise the centrality of La Pena in the Neolithic worldview and encouragewider investigation of prehistoric place-making.

TI  - Relationship between plant species diversity and aboveground biomass in alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Spatial patterns and the factors driving them
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine grasslands are important ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and are extremely sensitive to climate change. However, the spatial responses of plant species diversity and biomass in alpine grasslands to environmental factors under the background of global climate change have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, a random forest model was constructed using grassland ground monitoring data with satellite remote sensing data and environmental variables to characterize the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass of grasslands in the Three-River Headwaters Region within the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and analyze spatial variation in the relationship between the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass and their driving factors. The results show that (1) the selection of characteristic variables can effectively improve the accuracy of random forest models. The stepwise regression variable selection method was the most effective approach, with an R-2 of 0.60 for the plant species diversity prediction model and 0.55 for the aboveground biomass prediction model, (2) The spatial distribution patterns of the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass in the study area were similar, they were both high in the southeast and low in the northwest and gradually decreased from east to west. The relationship between the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass varied spatially, they were mostly positively correlated (67.63%), but they were negatively correlated in areas with low and high values of plant species diversity and aboveground biomass, and (3) Analysis with geodetector revealed that longitude, average annual precipitation, and elevation were the main factors driving variation in the plant species diversity and aboveground biomass relationship. We characterized plant species diversity and aboveground biomass, as well as their spatial relationships, over a large spatial scale. Our data will aid biodiversity monitoring and grassland conservation management, as well as future studies aimed at clarifying the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

TI  - Impact of sentinel lymph node assessment on the outcomes of patients with advanced endometrial cancer: A meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) assessment is used to treat early endometrial cancer; however, its application in advanced endometrial cancer remains controversial. Therefore, we assessed the effects of SLN assessment and lymphadenectomy (LND) on the prognosis (survival rate and primary outcome) of patients with advanced endometrial cancer.Methods: Pertinent studies were selected from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library until March 19, 2022. Relevant studies were strictly screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from the included studies were extracted and their quality was evaluated. Then RevMan5.4 software was used for the meta-analysis.Results: Four retrospective studies were included, which enrolled 7181 patients; 492 were treated with SLN and 6689 with LND. In terms of overall survival, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.41, I-2 = 0%, P = .39).Conclusions: SLN assessment is an alternative to LND as a treatment modality for advanced endometrial cancer.

TI  - To scan or not to scan: effect of scanning the axilla of all patients undergoing diagnostic breast ultrasound
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast ultrasonography is a useful modality in patients undergoing diagnostic and screening breast imaging. However, breast ultrasound has a high false positive rate and can be time-consuming to perform.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of incidental axillary findings found on diagnostic breast ultrasounds at a single multi-site institution that has a standard protocol of scanning the axilla for all breast ultrasound exams.Methods: All diagnostic breast ultrasounds were retrospectively reviewed from January 2017 to September 2019. Follow-up imaging, relevant clinical history, and pathology results were also reviewed. All positive axillary findings were divided into incidental or non-incidental findings depending on whether there was a direct clinical indication to scan the axilla. Descriptive statistics were performed with a 5% level of significance.Results: Of the 19,695 diagnostic ultrasounds performed during this timeframe, there were 91 (0.5%) incidental axillary findings given a BIRADS category 3 or 4, and none of these findings resulted in the diagnosis of an occult breast cancer. One biopsy-proven SLL/CLL lymphoma was diagnosed that was otherwise clinically occult.Conclusion: Routine axillary scanning in all patients undergoing a diagnostic breast ultrasound at a large multi-site institution yields a low rate of incidental findings and has minimal impact on detection of cancer.

TI  - Cadmium nitrate and DNA methylation in gastropods: comparison between ovotestis and hepatopancreas
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Dietary ingestion is the main route of exposure to hazardous contaminants in land ani-mals. Cadmium, a high-profile toxic metal, affects living systems at different organismal levels, including major storage organs (liver, kidneys), key organs for species survival (gonads), and epigenetic networks regulating gene expression. 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most common and best-characterized epigenetic mark among different modified nucleosides in DNA. This important player in methylation-driven gene expression is impacted by cadmium in sentinel terrestrial vertebrates. However, limited information exists regarding its impact on macroinvertebrates, especially land snails commonly used as (eco)toxicological models. We first investigate the methylomic effects of dietary cadmium given as cadmium nitrate on terrestrial mollusks. Mature specimens of the common brown garden snail, Cornu aspersum, were continuously exposed for four weeks to environmentally-relevant cadmium levels. We determined global genomic DNA methylation in hepatopancreas and ovotestis, as well as changes in the methylation status of CG pairs at the 5' region close to the transcription site of gene encoding the Cd-selective metallothionein (Cd-MT). Weight gain/loss, hypometabolism tendency, and survival rates were also assessed. Although this exposure event did not adversely affect survival, gastropods exposed to the highest Cd dose revealed a significant reduction in body weight and a significant increase in hypometabolic behavior. The hepatopancreas, but not the ovotestis, displayed significant hypermethylation, but only for the aforementioned specimens. We also found that the 5' end of the Cd-MT gene was unmethylated in both organs and its methylation status was insensitive to cadmium exposure. Our results are important since they provide scientists, for the first time, with quantitative data on DNA methylation in gastropod ovotestis and refine our understanding of Cd epigenetic effects on terrestrial mollusks.

TI  - High vector diversity and malaria transmission dynamics in five sentinel sites in Cameroon
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMalaria remains one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Cameroon. To inform vector control intervention decision making, malaria vector surveillance was conducted monthly from October 2018 to September 2020 in five selected sentinel sites (Gounougou and Simatou in the North, and Bonaberi, Mangoum and Nyabessang in the South).MethodsHuman landing catches (HLCs), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps, and pyrethrum spray catches (PSCs) were used to assess vector density, species composition, human biting rate (HBR), endophagic index, indoor resting density (IRD), parity, sporozoite infection rates, entomological inoculation rate (EIR), and Anopheles vectorial capacity.ResultsA total of 139,322 Anopheles mosquitoes from 18 species (or 21 including identified sub-species) were collected across all sites. Out of the 18 species, 12 were malaria vectors including Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), Anopheles funestus s.l.., Anopheles nili, Anopheles moucheti, Anopheles paludis, Anopheles demeilloni, Anopheles. pharoensis, Anopheles ziemanni, Anopheles multicinctus, Anopheles tenebrosus, Anopheles rufipes, and Anopheles marshallii. Anopheles gambiae s.l. remains the major malaria vector (71% of the total Anopheles) collected, though An. moucheti and An. paludis had the highest sporozoite rates in Nyabessang. The mean indoor HBR of Anopheles ranged from 11.0 bites/human/night (b/h/n) in Bonaberi to 104.0 b/h/n in Simatou, while outdoors, it varied from 24.2 b/h/n in Mangoum to 98.7 b/h/n in Simatou. Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. moucheti were actively biting until at least 8:00 a.m. The mean Anopheles IRD was 17.1 females/room, and the parity rate was 68.9%. The mean EIRs for each site were 55.4 infective bites/human/month (ib/h/m) in Gounougou, 99.0 ib/h/m in Simatou, 51.2 ib/h/m in Mangoum, 24.4 ib/h/m in Nyabessang, and 18.1 ib/h/m in Bonaberi. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was confirmed as the main malaria vector with the highest vectorial capacity in all sites based on sporozoite rate, except in Nyabessang.ConclusionThese findings highlight the high malaria transmission occurring in Cameroon and will support the National Malaria Control Program to design evidence-based malaria vector control strategies, and deployment of effective and integrated vector control interventions to reduce malaria transmission and burden in Cameroon, where several Anopheles species could potentially maintain year-round transmission.

TI  - Detection of irrigation dates and amounts on maize plots from the integration of Sentinel-2 derived Leaf Area Index values in the Optirrig crop model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in food production due to the expansion of agricultural lands has led to the intensive use of (mainly) fresh water for irrigation. A key challenge for irrigated agriculture has thus become to optimize the use of available water resources to fit environmental constraints while satisfying the increasing food demand, achieving efficient uses of irrigation water, i.e. well-thought sequences of irrigation dates and amounts. In coherence, we developed a methodology based on the automated acquisition of Leaf Area Index (LAI) values, derived from remote sensing data, confronted with predictions drawn from the Optirrig crop growth and irrigation model, to solve the inverse problem of detecting irrigation dates and amounts, at the plot scale and for maize crops grown in the Occitanie region, France. The method consisted of seeking possible irrigation events (dates, amounts) between two cloud-free Sentinel-2 (S2) optical images and detecting the most probable of these events, responsible for the least difference between the predicted and observed, S2-derived LAI values (LAIS2). The approach was first tested with synthetic noisy values to encompass the effects of errors on the observed and modeled LAI values, and these of increased duration between available observations (cases AS2=5, 10,and 15 days), promoting the possibility to use daily-interpolated LAI values as a starting point for the inverse problem (AS2 is fixed to 10 and 15 days then values are interpolated and recorded on a 5 days basis, cases AS2=5mod10 and 5mod15 days, respectively). From the synthetic dataset, irrigation dates detection results showed that the best performance is obtained for AS2=5 days or when using daily interpolated LAI values when AS2=5mod10 or 5mod15 days with an F -score near 85%. Most irrigation dates were detected with errors between 0 and 3 days, while irrigation amounts (20, 30 or 40 mm) were correctly identified in over 80% of cases, when simulating dry climatic conditions typical of the Mediterranean ring. For the documented real cases, the irrigation dates were detected with an overall recall value of 81.6% when evaluated using daily-interpolated LAIS2. The irrigation amounts are correctly identified for only 28.5% of the detected irrigation dates for the plots located in Mont- pellier. In contrast, the detection of the irrigation amounts was not possible over the plots in Tarbes. This weakness in the detection of irrigation amounts seems related to the fact that Optirrig simulates the exact crop irrigation requirements, based on a soil water balance equation and accurate soil moisture calibration, while farmers' decisions are taken on different grounds in the field. Overall, the obtained results prove the relevance of the combined used of Optirrig and optical remote sensing data for the detection of irrigation dates, and possibly amounts, at field scale.

AB  - Severe skin pain when exposed to long wave ultraviolet radiation or visible light is the main symptom of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). Treatment options for EPP are inadequate and new treatments are needed but hampered by the lack of valid efficacy outcomes. Phototesting with well-defined illumination of the skin can be performed reliably. We aimed to provide an overview of phototest procedures used to evaluate EPP treatments. Systematic searches of Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were performed. Searches identified 11 studies using photosensitivity as efficacy outcome. The studies used eight different phototest protocols. Illuminations were performed with a filtered high-pressure mercury arc, or a xenon arc lamp equipped with monochromator or filters. Some used broadband, others narrowband illumination. In all protocols phototests were performed on the hands or the back. Endpoints were minimal dose required to induce either first symptom of discomfort, erythema, urticaria or intolerable pain. Other endpoints were change in erythema intensity or diameter of any type of flare after exposure compared to before. In conclusion, protocols displayed extensive variability in illumination set-up and evaluation of phototest reactions. Implementation of a standardized phototest method will allow more consistent and reliable outcome evaluation in future therapeutic research of protoporphyric photosensitivity.

TI  - Remote sensing and geochemical investigations of sulfide-bearing metavolcanic and gabbroic rocks (Egypt): Constraints on host-rock petrogenesis and sulfide genesis
T2  - GONDWANA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Field geology, geochemical analyses and multi-sensor remotely sensed data of Landsat-8, ASTER and Sentinel-2 were used to detect various types of hydrothermal alteration and sulfide-gold mineralization in Neoproterozoic metavolcanic and gabbroic rocks from Darhib and El-Beida areas in the South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt. We also used RADAR data of Sentinel-1 using PCI Geomatica software to decipher the structural lineaments that control this mineralization. Different styles of disseminated to massive sulfide deposits include: 1) undeformed magmatic disseminated ores in Darhib gabbros, metavolcanic rocks and metabasic dykes; 2) deformed (remobilized) massive ores mostly of a magmatic-hydrothermal origin in Darhib tremolite talc rocks along E-W shear zones; 3) hydrothermal sulfide ores along El-Beida NW-SE shear zones. Cu-Zn massive ores represent the main sulfides in the Darhib silicified tremolite-talc rocks and meta-andesites, and occur as bands, veins and patches along Darhib E-W shear zones. Discontinuous occurrences of sulfide ores-bearing tremolite-talc rocks indicate that major shear zones act as structural controls on mineralization. Sulfide ores consist chiefly of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite and galena as well as minor covellite and bornite. These ores are highly concentrated along E-W striking Darhib shear zones and resulted from granite-derived hydrothermal fluids that form/and or accumulate sulfide minerals from the sulfide-bearing metavolcanic rocks around shear zones. Two stages of hydrothermal alterations are recorded in the Darhib talc mine including pre- (talcification, amphibolitization and carbonatization) and syn- (silicification and chloritization) sulfide ore alterations. Disseminated sulfide mineralization hosted in Darhib gabbros, metavolcanic rocks and metabasic dykes is of a magmatic origin, similar to Cu-Ni sulfide deposits hosted in gabbroic varieties in worldwide mafic-ultramafic intrusions. On the other hand, El-Beida gold-sulfide-bearing quartz and quartz carbonate veins are hosted in ferruginated and silicified metavolcanics/ metavolcaniclastic rocks along NW-SE shear zones (Najd Fault System trend). These are spatially associated with regional convergent structures (high-angle convergent wrench structures), suggesting orogenic gold type mineralization. The E-W with minor WNWESE shear zones in Darhib and NW-SE trending shear zones in El- Beida structurally controlled sulfides and gold mineralization in the SED of Egypt. El-Beida sulfide mineralization occurs as disseminated ores that consist mainly of pyrite, chalcopyrite, covelite and chalcocite with occasional occurrence of gold. The spatial occurrence of native gold in ferrigenous alteration zones indicates the role of iron in gold precipitation through buffering of gold-bearing complexes. Mineralogical and geochemical data of Darhib and El-Beida sulfide-bearing rocks indicate that they crystallized from depleted mantle sources in a back-arc basin setting, starting with the generation of arc-like volcanic rocks in a nascent BAB stage followed by the emplacement of plutonic equivalent of MORB/OIB-like rocks such as gabbroic intrusions in a mature BAB.

TI  - Inter-seasonal characterization and correlation of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) and Canopy Urban Heat Island (CUHI) in the urbanized environment of Delhi
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 6th assessment report warns India about excessive heat. As India's population, urbanization, built-up regions, and concrete expand, vulnerable people may face higher heat risks. Delhi, India's capital and second-largest city, is noted for its excessive heat and air pollution. Heat in Delhi is spatially distributed and varies in magnitude due to built-up area density, the absence of a natural landscape, and other geographi-cal aspects. To pinpoint the hotspot region, the study attempts to characterize Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs) and Canopy Urban Heat Islands (CUHIs). Temporal and seasonal assessment of LST (Land Surface Temperature) using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiome-ters) data and Ambient Temperature (AT) data from 39 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitoring stations with a representative radius of 1-5 km used to explore the inter-seasonal variation of SUHI and CUHI over the city in terms of magnitude and extent for 2019, 2020, and 2021. To describe SUHI and CUHI, a two-dimensional Gaussian fitting-based image analysis method is developed. The results show that the region's greatest SUHI magnitude is 2.36 degrees C in the monsoon season and 2.09 degrees C in the spring season. In comparison, the maximum CUHI magnitude is 4.74 degrees C and 3.15 degrees C in the Autumn and Winter seasons, respectively. The impact of SUHI can be experienced up to 82 km2 from the critical location in Winter and CUHI has 67.83 km2 in Sum-mer. Inter seasonal comparison matrix between SUHI and CUHI demonstrates a positive but mod-est association due to considerable seasonal parameter fluctuation. UHI hotspot zone is at the centre of the urban with little seasonal fluctuation. South-West (SW) is a hotspot for SUHI and CUHI during the monsoon and spring seasons due to its dense residential and industrial areas. During winter, SUHI indicates SW as the critical zone and CUHI depicts NW. The finding shows that Delhi has a longer duration of hot weather. This study could help to understand UHI in Delhi at the local scale. The study shows UHI's seasonality and potential drivers. Critical hotspots and seasonal shifts should be used in urban development to improve Delhi's thermal environment.

TI  - Identification of climate change impact and thermal comfort zones in semi-arid regions of AP, India using LST and NDBI techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Andhra Pradesh, in southern India, frequently experiences warm summers and winters. However, the year-round greater relative humidity and the positioning of the summer hot spots are linked to actual weather heat exhaustion during the warmest months. Climate change is a significant-and frequently disregarded-factor in the relationship between climate and mortality. With the use of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), we sought to identify the climatic change in this research. Additionally, we attempted to identify the Thermal Comfort Zones (TCZs) in Andhra Pradesh, South India's semi-arid regions. Arc GIS and ERDAS Imagine were used to process the satellite data of Landsat 4-5 (TM & MSS), Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI for the development of LST and NDBI. The research was conducted for the past thirty years from 1990 to 2020. The resultant thermal comfort zones map was classified into four zones, Zone -I (Safe zone), Zone - II (Moderately safe zone), Zone - III (Risk Zone), and Zone-IV (Highly Risk Zone). The relation between the LST and NDBI is also revealed using correlation regression analysis in the study region. It has been noted that urban centre and high-density regions had greater LST than rural locations. The study finds that although this differs from one ecological zone to another and the distribution of LST intensity in the urban area depends on its changing LULC, various types of land cover within an urban region might impact the spatial pattern of urban LST. The main conclusions of this study might help policymakers understand the need of enabling more sustainable urban development in cities.

TI  - Combining optical and microwave remote sensing for assessing gullies in human-disturbed vegetated landscapes
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate assessment of the gully is key to stopping soil loss, especially in agricultural landscapes. This study aims to combine freely distributed remote sensing data for the evaluation of gullies located in a tropical watershed with a history of cattle production. Eighty-four vectorized gullies were defined in the Pirizal River basin, part of the highly eroded Upper Taquari (Brazil). We examined 56 variables from Sentinel-1/2 and ALOSPALSAR-1 datasets, including SAR products and optical products like textures, water, vegetation, and terrain indices. Following a correlation analysis, 19 variables were selected for mapping in a Random Forest classifier by considering samples of active (soil) and stabilized (vegetation) pixels. The method reached an overall accuracy of 89%, in which soil abundance was responsible for 44% of the overall importance in the classification. Optical indices and texture products outperformed SAR products, whose importance represented only 14%. In the studied river basin, about 63% of the gullies were found stabilized, 30% in the process of stabilization, and only 7% active. The method proved effective, low cost, and promptly replicable to general river basins with gullies, mainly those in the tropics where vegetation has a significant role in soil loss control.

TI  - Uncovering Early Traces of Bark Beetle Induced Forest Stress via Semantically Enriched Sentinel-2 Data and Spectral Indices
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems are shaped by both abiotic and biotic disturbances. Unlike sudden disturbance agents, such as wind, avalanches and fire, bark beetle infestation progresses gradually. By the time infestation is observable by the human eye, trees are already in the final stages of infestation-the red- and grey-attack. In the relevant phase-the green-attack-biochemical and biophysical processes take place, which, however, are not or hardly visible. In this study, we applied a time series analysis based on semantically enriched Sentinel-2 data and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) to detect early traces of bark beetle infestation in the Berchtesgaden National Park, Germany. Our approach used a stratified and hierarchical hybrid remote sensing image understanding system for pre-selecting candidate pixels, followed by the use of SVIs to confirm or refute the initial selection, heading towards a 'convergence of evidence approach'. Our results revealed that the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave-infrared (SWIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum provided the best separability between pixels classified as healthy and early infested. Referring to vegetation indices, we found that those related to water stress have proven to be most sensitive. Compared to a SVI-only model that did not incorporate the concept of candidate pixels, our approach achieved distinctively higher producer's accuracy (76% vs. 63%) and user's accuracy (61% vs. 42%). The temporal accuracy of our method depends on the availability of satellite data and varies up to 3 weeks before or after the first ground-based detection in the field. Nonetheless, our method offers valuable early detection capabilities that can aid in implementing timely interventions to address bark beetle infestations in the early stage.

TI  - Long-term assessment of the effectiveness of coastal protection regulations in conserving natural habitats in Spain
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spain has undergone rapid socioeconomic development in the past three decades. This has been linked to massive residential and infrastructural development based on a short-term, profitable and resource-intensive consuming model. As a result, large amounts of agricultural, natural and semi-natural soils have been lost to artificial areas, especially around main cities and on the coast. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of the Spanish Shores Act at preventing land development in two biogeographical regions and three administrative scales between 1988 and 2020 using a BACI design and remote sensing data. We also analysed the combined effect of other regulations to prevent land development on the coast. The Shores Act was effective in reducing land development although moderate to substantial land development occurred in the zones affected by the Law, especially in the Mediterranean region. Adding other sectoral regulations to the Shores Act notably and consistently reduced land development across regions. Among them, cumulative protected area (PA) regulations were most effective in reducing coastal land development. The use of satellite images, especially Sentinel 2A MSI data within a BACI design, proved a useful method for assessing the effectiveness of fine-scale objectives of environmental policies such as the Shores Act.

TI  - An insatiable hunger for charisma? A follower-centric analysis of populism and charismatic leadership
T2  - LEADERSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - While scholarship often assumes that strong leaders and charismatic leadership play an important role in the emergence of populist politics, research has missed a closer exploration of charisma attribution to populists. Addressing this charismatic leadership hypothesis requires populism and charisma to be analysed from the followers' perspective. This article takes a unique look at the social-psychological dynamics behind populism. Using quantitative survey data that was collected from Hungarian voters (N = 1200), this article examines the relationship between populist attitudes as follower characteristics in modern politics and charisma attribution. To reveal how a populist worldview can affect the follower's expectations and perceptions, we break charisma attribution down into three phases: (1) the general hunger for charisma (the romance of leadership); (2) perceptions of charismatic behaviour of the top candidates in the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary elections (i.e., Viktor Orban and Peter Marki-Zay); and (3) emotional attachment to these leaders. Our findings show that populism makes people more hungry for charisma and more sensitive to recognising charismatic behaviour but does not necessarily create an emotional bond with specific leaders. This article also sheds light on some directions of future research to explore other distinctive characteristics of populist followers that can influence social constructions of charismatic leadership. The limitations and implications are also discussed.

TI  - The economic burden of RSV-associated illness in children aged &lt; 5 years, South Africa 2011-2016
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundData on the economic burden of RSV-associated illness will inform decisions on the programmatic implementation of maternal vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We estimated the cost of RSV-associated illness in fine age bands to allow more accurate cost-effectiveness models to account for a limited duration of protection conferred by short- or long-acting interventions.MethodsWe conducted a costing study at sentinel sites across South Africa to estimate out-of-pocket and indirect costs for RSV-associated mild and severe illness. We collected facility-specific costs for staffing, equipment, services, diagnostic tests, and treatment. Using case-based data we calculated a patient day equivalent (PDE) for RSV-associated hospitalizations or clinic visits; the PDE was multiplied by the number of days of care to provide a case cost to the healthcare system. We estimated the costs in 3-month age intervals in children aged < 1 year and as a single group for children aged 1-4 years. We then applied our data to a modified version of the World Health Organization tool for estimating the mean annual national cost burden, including medically and non-medically attended RSV-associated illness.ResultsThe estimated mean annual cost of RSV-associated illness in children aged < 5 years was US dollars ($)137,204,393, of which 76% ($111,742,713) were healthcare system incurred, 6% ($8,881,612) were out-of-pocket expenses and 13% ($28,225,.801) were indirect costs. Thirty-three percent ($45,652,677/$137,204,393) of the total cost in children aged < 5 years was in the < 3-month age group, of which 52% ($71,654,002/$137,204,393) were healthcare system incurred. The costs of non-medically attended cases increased with age from $3,307,218 in the < 3-month age group to $8,603,377 in the 9-11-month age group.ConclusionsAmong children < 5 years of age with RSV in South Africa, the highest cost burden was in the youngest infants; therefore, interventions against RSV targeting this age group are important to reduce the health and cost burden of RSV-associated illness.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of multi-temporal synthetic-aperture radar imagery in land-cover mapping using a forward stepwise selection approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar images are a supplement or alternative to optical images, especially in tropical regions where cloud cover is a challenge. The present study evaluated the performance of using multitemporal synthetic-aperture radar images in land-cover mapping in Binh Duong province, Vietnam. Two experimental cases were investigated: Case 1 used only multi-temporal radar images, whereas Case 2 used a combination of multi-temporal radar images and one optical image. A set of 24 Sentinel-1 images and one Landsat-8 image acquired in 2020 were processed. A forward stepwise selection approach based on a random forest algorithm and a six-class classification scheme were used to determine the best combination of images. In Case 1, the 16-date combination gained the best result with an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.6%. Considering the trade-off between efficiency and cost, the seven-date combination (OA = 76.1%) could be the optimal integration. Compared to using single-date radar images, the OA in Case 1 was improved by 9.5%, and the producer's and user's accuracies were improved by 4.68%-33.33%. Meanwhile, in Case 2, the combination of one optical and seven radar images gave the best result (OA = 83.7%). It had at least 7.1% higher OA than Case 1. However, its OA was at least 2.4% lower, and the producer's and user's accuracies of most classes were reduced when compared to using only a single Landsat8 image. Overall, the findings of this study confirmed the effectiveness of using multi-temporal radar images in land-cover mapping. However, the effectiveness of the combination of radar and optical images needs further elucidation.

TI  - Remote sensing in mapping biodiversity-A case study of epiphytic lichen communities
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In boreal forests, European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species that hosts a variety of accompanying species including epiphytic lichens. Forest management actions have led to a decrease in aspen abundance and subsequent loss of suitable habitats of epiphytic lichens. In this study, we evaluate the environmental responses of epiphytic lichen species richness and community composition on aspen, focusing on the potential of remote sensing by combined hyperspectral imaging and airborne laser scanning to identify suitable habitats for epiphytic lichens. We measured different substrate and habitat parameters in the field (e.g., aspen diameter and bark pH) and by remote sensing (e.g., mean canopy height and tree species composition of the surrounding forest) in the study area in Southern Finland that includes protected and non-protected forest. We used linear regression and the Hierarchical Model of Species Communities (HMSC) to compare how the different parameters explain and predict lichen species richness and community composition, respectively. We show that coarse predictions of epiphytic lichen community composition can be made using parameters extracted from remote sensing data. Estimated mean canopy height, tree density, dominant tree species and tree species diversity of the stand predicted the species community on aspens slightly better than field parameters. Remote sensing variables calculated over a larger area (30 m radius) always outperformed the same variables calculated over a smaller area (10 m radius) in predicting community composition, highlighting the cost-efficiency of remote sensing compared to covering a similar area with on-ground measurements. These results are encouraging for the prospects of using remote sensing data to direct field inventories and to map potential high-biodiversity habitats. Aspen bark pH was the only parameter affecting species richness regardless of whether the forest was protected or not, whereas, interestingly, the effects of tree diameter, height and furrow depth were only significant in protected areas. Our results also underline the importance of protected areas, since they hosted a higher tree-specific number of epiphytic lichen species, and red listed species, than non-protected areas.

TI  - Forest disturbance and recovery in Peruvian Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian forests function as biomass and biodiversity reservoirs, contributing to climate change mitigation. While they continuously experience disturbance, the effect that disturbances have on biomass and biodiversity over time has not yet been assessed at a large scale. Here, we evaluate the degree of recent forest disturbance in Peruvian Amazonia and the effects that disturbance, environmental conditions and human use have on biomass and biodiversity in disturbed forests. We integrate tree-level data on aboveground biomass (AGB) and species richness from 1840 forest plots from Peru's National Forest Inventory with remotely sensed monitoring of forest change dynamics, based on disturbances detected from Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index time series. Our results show a clear negative effect of disturbance intensity tree species richness. This effect was also observed on AGB and species richness recovery values towards undisturbed levels, as well as on the recovery of species composition towards undisturbed levels. Time since disturbance had a larger effect on AGB than on species richness. While time since disturbance has a positive effect on AGB, unexpectedly we found a small negative effect of time since disturbance on species richness. We estimate that roughly 15% of Peruvian Amazonian forests have experienced disturbance at least once since 1984, and that, following disturbance, have been increasing in AGB at a rate of 4.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20 years. Furthermore, the positive effect of surrounding forest cover was evident for both AGB and its recovery towards undisturbed levels, as well as for species richness. There was a negative effect of forest accessibility on the recovery of species composition towards undisturbed levels. Moving forward, we recommend that forest-based climate change mitigation endeavours consider forest disturbance through the integration of forest inventory data with remote sensing methods.

TI  - A Globally Applicable Method for NDVI Estimation from Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Using a Deep Neural Network and the SEN12TP Dataset
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation monitoring is important for many applications, e.g., agriculture, food security, or forestry. Optical data from space-borne sensors and spectral indices derived from their data like the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) are frequently used in this context because of their simple derivation and interpretation. However, optical sensors have one major drawback: cloud coverage hinders data acquisition, which is especially troublesome for moderate and tropical regions. One solution to this problem is the use of cloud-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. Yet, with very different image characteristics of optical and SAR data, an optical sensor cannot be easily replaced by SAR sensors. This paper presents a globally applicable model for the estimation of NDVI values from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter data. First, the newly created dataset SEN12TP consisting of Sentinel-1 and -2 images is introduced. Its main features are the sophisticated global sampling strategy and that the images of the two sensors are time-paired. Using this dataset, a deep learning model is trained to regress SAR backscatter data to NDVI values. The benefit of auxiliary input information, e.g., digital elevation models, or land-cover maps is evaluated experimentally. After selection of the best model configuration, another experimental evaluation on a carefully selected hold-out test set confirms that high performance, low error, and good level of spatial detail are achieved. Finally, the potential of our approach to create dense NDVI time series of frequently clouded areas is shown. One limit of our approach is the neglect of the temporal characteristics of the SAR and NDVI data, since only data from a single date are used for prediction.

TI  - Long-term spatial-temporal monitoring of eutrophication in Lake Burdur using remote sensing data
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ?ake eutrophication continues to be one of the major environmental challenges in lakes worldwide. This study is about using a remote sensing approach to monitor long-term chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and the trophic state index (TSI) in ?ake Burdur, Turkiye. Surface reflectances from ?andsat 5, ?andsat 7, and ?andsat 8 satellite image collections were evaluated with an empirical equation to estimate a 38-year-long (1984-2021) time series of the lake's median Chl-a concentrations. Pixel quality masking is applied to retain only acceptable quality information and exclude images affected by cloud cover, icing, and other environmental factors from the analysis. The results were analyzed based on annual, seasonal, and monthly temporal averages. Over a period of 38 years, Chl-a concentrations were found to vary between 58.7 and 196.4 mg/m(3). Notably higher concentrations were recorded in 2010 and 2021, while lower concentrations were observed between 1991 and 1993. A substantial increase in Chl-a concentration was evident from 2002 to 2010. The maximum concentration of Chl-a during the first two decades of the analysis was 130 mg/m(3), which increased to 200 mg/m3 during the last two decades. ?andsatderived TSI values suggested that ?ake Burdur has been mostly hypertrophic for the entire study period.

TI  - Do limits exist on potential woody cover of Brazilian savanna?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing concern of woody plant encroachment worldwide in savanna ecosystems, many studies endeavor to examine the upper bound of woody plant cover, which is referred to as potential woody cover. Potential woody cover defines the maximum possible woody plant encroachment and bears strong implications on savanna dynamics. Both African and North American savannas have been reported to exhibit limits on po-tential woody cover below 650 and 660 mm of mean annual precipitation (MAP), respectively. At present it is less clear whether that limit exists and at what level in the Brazilian savanna (the Cerrado) of South America, throughout which MAP is above 790 mm. This study models the potential woody cover pattern of Brazilian savanna over the present precipitation gradient and in relation to surface and subsurface soil moisture (SM) separately. Remotely sensed products were processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and included MODIS tree cover (MOD44B), TRMM monthly precipitation (3B43), and NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP Global soil moisture. Quantile regression results suggest that below respective thresholds of MAP, surface SM, and subsurface SM, potential woody cover in Brazilian savanna is constrained. Comparison to the savanna in central Texas of the United States reveals that water availability is not the only determinant of potential woody cover. Regional context such as precipitation seasonality and woody plant species are important factors. This study also un-derscores the discrepancy between potential woody cover modelled based on MAP and that based on soil moisture (surface and subsurface).

TI  - Sinking delta: Quantifying the impacts of saltwater intrusion in the Indus Delta of Pakistan
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on an integrated assessment of coastline change and its impacts on the deltaic sustainability of the Indus Delta, the world's fifth-largest delta. The increase in salinity and degradation of mangrove habitat was examined using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery from 1990 to 2020. The tasselled cap transformation indices, multi -statistical End Point Rate and Linear Regression were used to extract the shorelines rates. Mangrove cover area was estimated by applying the Random Forest clasification approach. Impacts of coastal erosion on mangroves and sea-water salinity were determined through the association between electrical conductivity and vegetation soil salinity index (VSSI). The accuracy of the analysis was evaluated using ground truth information obtained from field surveys and Fixed-Point Photography. Major findings of the analysis indicate that the North-West Karachi experienced accre-tion at an average rate of 7.28 +/- 1.15 m/year, with medium salinity (VSSI<0.81) and increased mangrove cover, from 11.0 km2 area in 1990 to 14.5 km2 in 2020. However, the Western Delta has undergone massive erosion at a mean rate of -10.09 +/- 1.61 m/year with obtrusive salinity (0.7 <= VSSI <= 1.2) and 70 km2 of mangrove cover loss. In the Mid-dle West Delta and Middle East Delta erosion is observed at an average rate of -28.45 +/- 0.55 m/year rate, with high obtrusive salinity (0.43 <= VSSI >= 1.32) and rapid mangroves cover loss (14 km2). The Eastern Delta was relatively stable and accelerating towards the sea with increasing mangrove cover (629 km2). Our analysis revealed that erosion, which occured due to reduced sediments flow linked to development of water infrastructures as well as climate change, have serious implications for the ecosystem. Future policy and action-plans should priotitise addressing vul-nerabilities by integrate nature-based solutions for revival of the Delta.

TI  - Erosion vulnerable area assessment of Jamuna River system in Bangladesh using a multi-criteria-based geospatial fuzzy expert system and remote sensing
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Jamuna, a dynamic and unstable braided river system in Bangladesh, is approximately 240 km long and becomes extremely unstable during the rainy season resulting in serious bank erosion. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the erosion-prone areas adjacent to the Jamuna River system. Change detection analysis was carried out using Landsat 8 (OLI) images captured in 2020 by multi-criteria analysis using a geospatial fuzzy expert system and state-of-the-art remote sensing technology. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), distance from the river, land use and land cover (LULC), and slope and elevation were selected as criteria for this analysis. All criteria maps were standardized using fuzzy membership functions and reclassification of each criteria performed. Furthermore, expert judgments were included to rank the criteria influencing vulnerable areas based on an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach. Finally, a weighted overlay map was prepared for erosion vulnerability assessment from the reclassified maps. From these analyses, we found that water bodies covered 1003 km(2) (10.94%), high-to-moderate erosion-prone areas were 7401.21 km(2) (77.39%), marginal erosion-prone areas 1065 km(2) (11.61%) and nonerosion-prone areas only 5.9 km(2) (0.06%), respectively. To verify the vulnerable areas, 150 reference points of water bodies from the mainstream of the Jamuna River were taken using Google Earth Pro images captured in 2020. These points were plotted on the NDWI maps of 2020 and 1990 to verify the detection of changes in the riverbank shifts for 30-year intervals. This confirmed the bank shifted from 3 to 4 km in more than 20 points during this span of time. Our analysis also confirmed that high-to-moderately erosion-vulnerable areas fall between 3 and 7 km. Therefore, we recommend the adoption of new agricultural land use planning, considering erosion venerable areas to ensure agricultural production and livelihood security.

TI  - Automatic forest change detection through a bi-annual time series of satellite imagery: Toward production of an integrated land cover map
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping is fundamental for national and international agencies to monitor forest resources. However, monitoring forest disturbances by direct comparison of these maps poses several difficulties and challenges. As a result, different methodologies have been explored to detect forest disturbances. However, most of them cannot be fully integrated with land cover map production since they require additional input data, while others are not suitable for monitoring small land parcels. This study presents a methodology that fulfils the need to integrate land cover mapping with land cover change detection. Specifically, this methodology was designed to complement the Sentinel-2-based land cover mapping used in Galicia, northwest Spain, a region characterized by small land parceling. First, two previously obtained land cover maps from 2019 and 2020 were compared to identify all the pixels with potential land cover changes using QGIS. The behavior of spectral indexes in a time series were then analyzed to identify which of the previously identified pixels correspond to forest disturbances. This step was implemented in the software R. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to detect different land cover changes it was obtained an overall accuracy of 82%, considering the existence of varying phenologies, diverse topographic conditions, and areas with a high level of stand fragmentation. This study could help agencies that have already developed their own land cover maps to easily advance the integration of their maps with land cover change detection, since this technique can be applied with any land cover mapping methodology based on multitemporal analysis of satellite images, without the need for additional input data.

TI  - Spatio-temporal morphological variability of a tropical barrier island derived from the Landsat collection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier islands are low-lying elongated, narrow sandy deposits, usually parallel to the coastline, separated from the continent by a lagoon. Due to their low elevation above sea level, barrier islands are environments susceptible to drastic morphological changes depending on the meteo-oceanographic conditions to which they are subjected. This work presents the morphological changes between 1985 and 2021 in "Restinga da Marambaia"-a 40 km long barrier island on Brazil's Southeastern coast. One hundred thirty-four scenes from the Landsat collection were processed, enabling the quantification of the barrier island area. Additionally, the rates of change in the position of the shorelines facing the Atlantic Ocean, Sepetiba Bay, and Marambaia Bay were computed. The barrier island's total area and the central sector's width present significant seasonal variability, which is maximum during the austral fall and winter seasons. On the shores facing the Atlantic Ocean and Sepetiba Bay, it is noted that the central and far eastern sectors show an erosional trend. In contrast, the coastline is more stable on the shore facing Marambaia Bay. The seasonal variations of the barrier island area occur during a period of low rainfall and more energetic waves associated with local winds, which produce coastal currents, transporting the available sediments.

TI  - On the differences in the vertical distribution of modeled aerosol opticaldepth over the southeastern Atlantic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern Atlantic is home to an expansive smoke aerosol plume overlying a large cloud deck for approximately a third of the year. The aerosol plume is mainly attributed to the extensive biomass burning activities that occur in southern Africa. Current Earth system models (ESMs) reveal significant differences in their estimates of regional aerosol radiative effects over this region. Such large differences partially stem from uncertainties in the vertical distribution of aerosols in the troposphere. These uncertainties translate into different aerosol optical depths (AODs) in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the free troposphere (FT). This study examines differences of AOD fraction in the FT and AOD differences among ESMs (WRF-CAM5, WRF-FINN, GEOS-Chem, EAM-E3SM, ALADIN, GEOS-FP, and MERRA-2) and aircraft-based measurements from the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign. Models frequently define the PBL as the well-mixed surface-based layer, but this definition misses the upper parts of decoupled PBLs, in which most low-level clouds occur. To account for the presence of decoupled boundary layers in the models, the height of maximum vertical gradient of specific humidity profiles from each model is used to define PBL heights.Results indicate that the monthly mean contribution of AOD in the FT to the total-column AOD ranges from 44% to 74% in September 2016 and from 54% to 71% in August 2017 within the region bounded by 25 degrees S- 0 degrees N-S and 15 degrees W-15 degrees E (excluding land) among the ESMs. ALADIN and GEOS-Chem show similar aerosol plume patterns to a derived above-cloud aerosol product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during September 2016, but none of the models show a similar above-cloud plume pattern to MODIS in August 2017. Using the second-generation High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) to derive an aircraft-based constraint on the AOD and the fractional AOD, we found that WRF-CAM5 produces 40% less AOD than those from the HSRL-2 measurements, but it performs well at separating AOD fraction between the FT and the PBL. AOD fractions in the FT for GEOS-Chem and EAM-E3SM are, respectively, 10% and 15% lower than the AOD fractions from the HSRL-2. Their similar mean AODs reflect a cancellation of high and low AOD biases. Compared with aircraft-based observations, GEOS-FP, MERRA-2, and ALADIN produce 24 %36% less AOD and tend to misplace more aerosols in the PBL. The models generally underestimate AODs for measured AODs that are above 0.8, indicating their limitations at reproducing high AODs. The differences in the absolute AOD, FT AOD, and the vertical apportioning of AOD in different models highlight the need to continue improving the accuracy of modeled AOD distributions. These differences affect the sign and magnitude of the net aerosol radiative forcing, especially when aerosols are in contact with clouds.

TI  - Geo-spatial modelling of carbon stock assessment of date palm at different age stages: An integrated approach of fieldwork, remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a geospatial model for the assessment and mapping of carbon stock (CS) of date palms (DP) in Abu Dhabi, at three age stages: mature, medium and young. The approach relied on the use of correlated remote sensing predictors tested and derived from Landsat-8 imagery over the study period to estimate CS. Multiple predictors including single bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and their combination were used in linear and non-linear regression models to identify the best performing predictors and regression models for DP. Mature DP, older than 10 years, attained the most significant correlation when using a second-order polynomial model with the tasseled cap for wetness as a predictor, yielding R2 of 0.7643. For non-mature DP, less than 10 years, the exponential regression model using renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI) as a predictor provided the most significant correlation for AGB estimation with R2 of 0.4987. The study demonstrated that moderate-resolution Landsat-8 OLI imagery has the potential to estimate the CS in DP of drylands at different age stages. This is the first attempt to estimate CS in DP using geospatial technologies with minimal fieldwork hence, expanding our approach to other remote and less-studied drylands.

TI  - Thirty-four years of Landsat monitoring reveal long-term effects of groundwater abstractions on a World Heritage Site wetland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most biodiverse yet endangered ecosystems on Earth. Despite being the most important wetland in Europe, the Donana National Park (southwestern Spain) is no exception, and the increase of nearby groundwater abstractions for intensive agriculture and human supply has raised international concerns about the conservation of this iconic wetland. It is thus needed to assess wetlands' long-term trends and responses to global and local factors to make informed management decisions. In this paper, we used 442 Landsat satellite images to analyze the historical trends and drivers of the date of desiccation and maximum flooded area in 316 ponds located in Donana National Park during a 34-year period (1985-2018) and found that 59 % of the ponds studied are currently desiccated. The use of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) showed inter-annual variation in rainfall and temperature as the most important factors determining pond flooding. However, GAMMS also showed that intensive agriculture and the nearby tourist resort were related to the desiccation or shrinking of ponds all over Donana, finding that the strongest negative flooding anomalies (i.e. ponds flooding less than explained by climate alone) were located in proximity to pumping areas. These results suggest that current levels of groundwater exploitation may be unsustainable and require urgent measures to control abstractions to ensure the integrity of the Donana pond network, and the persistence of >600 wetland-dependent species.

TI  - Bedrock mediates responses of ecosystem productivity to climate variability
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to climate variability is a critical component of ecosystem resilience to climate change. Variation in ecosystem sensitivity is influenced by many variables. Here we investigate the effect of bedrock lithology and weathering products on the sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to variation in climate water deficit using Bayesian statistical models. Two thirds of terrestrial ecosystems exhibit negative sensitivity, where productivity decreases with increased climate water deficit, while the other third exhibit positive sensitivity. Variation in ecosystem sensitivity is significantly affected by regolith porosity and permeability and regolith and soil thickness, indicating that lithology, through its control on water holding capacity, exerts important controls on ecosystem sensitivity. After accounting for effects of these four variables, significant differences in sensitivity remain among ecosystems on different rock types, indicating the complexity of bedrock effects. Our analysis suggests that regolith affects ecosystem sensitivity to climate change worldwide and thus their resilience.Bedrock properties have a significant effect on ecosystem response to climatic variability due to variable degrees of water retention between different substrates, according to a compilation of global data on climate water deficit and soil properties.

TI  - A systematic evaluation of multi-resolution ICESat-2 ATL08 terrain and canopy heights in boreal forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of NASA's Ice, Cloud, And Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) in September 2018 provides the scientific community an opportunity to observe high-resolution and three-dimensional surface elevations with global coverage. ICESat-2's Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data product focuses on the along-track terrain and canopy heights observations at a 100 m x 11 m spatial resolution. This work expands on past ATL08 validation studies to assess a higher spatial resolution (30 m x 11 m) version of ATL08's height product. This new dataset enables higher resolution mapping and fusion with Landsat data, but has not previously been validated across large geographic extents. In this paper, we examine the accuracy of multi-resolution ICESat-2 ATL08 across North America boreal forests using Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS), an airborne laser ranging system as reference datasets. Overall, strong agreements of terrain elevation and canopy height were found between ATL08 and LVIS at both 100 m x 11 m (RMSEterrain = 2.35 m; biasterrain=-0.17 m; RMSEcanopy = 4.17 m; biascanopy = 0.08 m) and 30 m x 11 m (RMSEterrain = 3.19 m; biasterrain = 0.49; RMSEcanopy = 4.75 m; biascanopy = 0.88 m) spatial resolutions. We found the accuracy of high-resolution terrain and canopy height measurements were constrained by sensor and external conditions during the time of data acquisition with lower uncertainties observed from samples along high-intensity ground tracks and with low topography/slope variabilities. Through this work, we provide insight into the use of multi-resolution ICESat-2 ATL08 for terrain and canopy heights characterization in northern forests. The results found in our study serve as a benchmark for end users to select high-quality ATL08 for a variety of scientific applications.

TI  - Two Typical Synoptic-Scale Weather Patterns of Dust Events over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Synoptic-scale weather systems play dominant roles in inducing high tropospheric dust over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, few studies have summarized the typical synoptic-scale weather patterns when high tropospheric dust occurs over the TP, as well as the difference between the distribution and transport methods of dust under weather patterns. Based on dust optical depth (DOD) from remote sensing data and reanalysis data during 2000 to 2019, two typical synoptic-scale weather patterns (T1 and T2) in the middle troposphere in association with high DOD in spring over the TP were obtained by using the self-organizing map (SOM) clustering method. The results show that the T1 features a deep trough over the Altai Mountains and the westerly wind increases over the TP. As a result, dust is transported from the Taklimakan Desert and Qaidam Basin to the upper troposphere and extends to the TP and northern China. T2 shows a low-pressure system over the western TP and decreased westerly winds over the TP, resulting in dust from the Taklimakan Desert, Qaidam Basin, and western TP to downstream areas. T1 (T2) contributes more to DOD over the eastern (western) TP. Therefore, we believe that a small increase (decrease) in DOD in the western (eastern) part of the TP from 2000 to 2019 may be related to an increase (decrease) in the occurrence of the T2 (T1). This work may provide a new possibility for projecting dust transport and its influence on tropospheric dust over the TP.

TI  - Management of the axilla in postmenopausal patients with cN0 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and its prognostic impact
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the differences in nodal positivity if the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed before or after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in breast cancer patients, and its impact on prognosis.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was performed in a single center including 91 postmenopausal cases with clinically node-negative and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative (HR + /HER2-) breast cancer, treated with NET and SLNB. SLNB was done pre-NET until 2014, and post-NET thereafter. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was indicated only in SLNB macrometastasis, although in selected elderly patients, it was omitted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated in relation to the status of the axilla, and the differences assessed using the log-rank test.ResultsBetween December 2006 and March 2022, SLNB was performed pre-NET in 14 cases and post-NET in 77. Both groups were similar in baseline tumor and patient characteristics. SLNB positivity was similar regardless of whether SLNB was performed before (5/14, 35.7%) or after NET (27/77, 37%), with 2/14 SLN macrometastases in the pre-NET cohort and 17/77 in the post-NET cohort. Only three patients (18.7%) with SLN macrometastasis had > 3 positive nodes following ALND. The 5-year overall survival and distant disease-free survival were 92.4% and 94.8%, respectively, with no significant differences according to SLNB status (p 0.5 and 0.8, respectively).ConclusionSLN positivity did not differ according to its timing (before or after NET). Therefore, NET has no effect on lymph node clearance. Furthermore, the prognosis is good regardless of the axillary involvement. Therefore, factors other than axillary involvement may affect the prognosis in these patients.

TI  - The nature and significance of social ontology
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a bridge-builder perspective on social ontology. Our point of departure is that an important task of philosophy is to provide the bigger picture. To this end, it should investigate folk views and determine whether and how they can be preserved once scrutinized from the perspective of the sciences. However, the sciences typically present us with a fragmented picture of reality. Thus, an important intermediate step is to integrate the most promising social scientific theories with one another. In addition to this, social ontology can provide input to and benefit from other philosophical disciplines that engage in normative theorizing. Thus, we propose that social ontology connects not only with folk ontology and scientific ontology but also with fields such as ethics and political philosophy. Building bridges between them serves to formulate a credible and encompassing worldview that is of theoretical and practical significance.

TI  - The role of the Africentric worldview in the Liberatory process
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the Black Lives Matter movement brings increasing awareness to systemic racism in American society, the Eurocentric worldview and intellectual racism nonetheless remain prevalent. However, opportunity to engage with Africentric knowledge that could help counter the focus on Eurocentric worldview among adults remains limited in graduate courses. When such opportunities do arise, however, they are powerful and transformative. This paper conducts a case study of four students of African descent enrolled in graduate programs that engaged with Africentric knowledge. The results demonstrate that such experiences can create a powerful Liberatory transformation. The five step Liberatory process is a cognitive awakening and a discussion of the implications for practice and research are presented as well.

TI  - Soil salinity prediction using Machine Learning and Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data in Hyper-Arid areas
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We are experiencing a considerable increase in soil salinity as a result of the influence of climate change or environmental contamination produced by excessive industry and agriculture. To be able to cope with this issue, reliable and up-to-date soil salinity measurements are required. The use of remote sensing data allows for faster and more efficient soil salinity mapping. This paper investigates several Machine Learning approaches and modeling methodologies for predicting soil salinity in hyper-arid environments using Sentinel-2 satellite imag-ery. Thus, 393 soil samples collected and used for modeling and testing in the study area, United Arab Emirates. Also, the paper benefits from open-source data and programs, such as Google Earth Engine and Weka. Different modeling strategies have been applied over the data. The results of the modeling show a strong correlation (0.84) with the test results. This study also shows interesting findings that will be examined further in future studies at other sites. As machine learning methods are evolving on a daily basis, new approaches needs to be considered in future studies for the demands of more precise modeling and mapping of soil salinity.

TI  - AI4SeaIce: selecting loss functions for automated SAR sea ice concentration charting
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - For maritime navigation in the Arctic, sea ice charts are an essential tool, which still to this day is drawn manually by professional ice analysts. The total Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) is the primary descriptor of the charts and indicates the fraction of ice in an ocean surface area. Naturally, automating the SIC chart creation is desired. However, the optimal representation of the corresponding machine-learning task is ambivalent and discussed in the community. In this study, we explore the representation with either regressional or classification objectives, each with two different (weighted) loss functions: Mean Square Error and Binary Cross-Entropy, and Categorical Cross-Entropy and the Earth Mover's Distance, respectively. While all models achieve good results they differ as the regression-based models obtain the highest numerical similarity to the reference charts, whereas the classification-optimised models generate results more visually pleasing and consistent. Rescaling the loss functions with inverse class weights improves the performance for intermediate classes at the expense of open water and fully-covered sea ice areas.

TI  - A robust large-scale surface water mapping framework with high spatiotemporal resolution based on the fusion of multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale and dynamic surface water mapping is crucial for understanding the impact of global climate change and human activities on the distribution of surface water resources. Remote sensing imagery has become the primary data source for surface water mapping due to its high spatiotemporal resolution and wide coverage. However, the reliability of current water products during flood seasons is limited due to the influence of clouds on optical remote sensing images. Moreover, annual and seasonal surface water mapping cannot capture intra-month variations of water bodies. To address these challenges, we proposed a high spatiotemporal surface water mapping framework on Google Earth Engine that combines multi-source remote sensing data. Our framework can generate 10 m spatial resolution surface water maps at a 15-day time step. We classified water bodies using Sentinel-2 images and a classification tree algorithm, and then used Sentinel-1 data to compensate for cloudy and missing data areas in Sentinel-2 images, resulting in seamless cloud-unaffected surface water maps. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in six floodplains around the world, and experimental results demonstrate that the water maps generated by our framework outperform existing public datasets and our framework has great potential for hydrological applications. Our proposed framework can capture the details of surface water dynamics with higher spatial and temporal resolution and is free from cloud influence, which is necessary for water resources management, flood monitoring, and disaster response.

TI  - Impervious surface Mapping and its spatial-temporal evolution analysis in the Yellow River Delta over the last three decades using Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The unique geographical location of the land-sea transition makes the ecological environment of the Yellow River Delta very fragile and vulnerable to human activities. As one of the characteristics of anthropogenic activities, monitoring the spatiotemporal changes of impervious surface area (ISA) is of great significance to the protection of the ecological environment in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Based on the Landsat historical images and computing resources provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE), an ISA mapping method was developed through combining spectral, texture features and random forest algorithm, and subsequently was applied to generate the spatiotemporal distribution data of ISA of the YRD for 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2016 and 2021. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracy, with an average overall accuracy of 92.23% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.9090. Through further time-series analysis of ISA, it found that the area of ISA in the YRD increased from the initial 394.87 km(2) to 1081.74 km(2) during study periods, and the annual growth rate broke through new highs, ranging from the initial 1.01 km(2)/year to 67.87 km(2)/year. According to the research results, urban development activities in the region should be strictly restricted in order to protect the ecological environment of the YRD.

TI  - Impacts of land cover changes on biogenic emission and its contribution to ozone and secondary organic aerosol in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The greening impacts on China from 2000 to 2017 led to an increase in vegetated areas and thus enhanced biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. BVOCs are regarded as important precursors for ozone (O-3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). As a result, accurate estimation of BVOC emissions is critical to understand their impacts on air quality. In this study, the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) v2.1 was used to investigate the impact of different leaf area index (LAI) and land cover (LC) datasets on BVOC emissions in China in 2016, and the effects on O-3 and SOA were evaluated based on the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. Three LAI satellite datasets of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD15A2H version 6 (MOD15), and the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), as well as three LC satellite datasets of the MODIS MCD12Q1 LC products, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) LC products, and the CGLS LC products, were used in five parallel experiments (cases: C1-C5). Results show that changing LAI and LC datasets of the model input has an impact on BVOC estimations. BVOC emissions in China ranged from 25.42 to 37.39 Tg in 2016 and were mainly concentrated in central and southeastern China. Changing the LC inputs for the MEGAN model has a more significant difference in BVOC estimates than using different LAI datasets. The combination of C3S LC and GLASS LAI performs better in the CMAQ model, indicating that it is the better choice for BVOC estimations in China. The highest contribution of BVOCs to O-3 and SOA can reach 12 ppb and 9.8 mu gm(-3), respectively. Changing the MEGAN inputs further impacts the concentrations of O-3 and SOA, especially changing LC datasets. The relative difference between MCD12Q1 LC and C3S LC is over 52% and 140% in O-3 and biogenic SOA (BSOA) in central and eastern China. The BSOA difference is mainly attributed to the isoprene SOA (ISOA), a major contributor to BSOA. The relative differences in ISOA between different cases are up to 160% in eastern China. Therefore, our results suggest that the uncertainties in MEGAN inputs should be fully considered in future O-3 and SOA simulations.

TI  - Withdrawal symptoms: party factions, political change and British foreign policy post-Brexit
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of Brexit on British foreign, security and defence policy have been complex. Initial efforts to agree structured cooperation failed, with later governments refusing to negotiate on this area, followed by unstructured re-engagement after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This article argues that these changes can be explained by reference to the factional politics during the Brexit negotiations within the Conservative Party, with the defeat of May's Withdrawal Agreement bringing to power a pro-Brexit faction with a distinct foreign policy worldview and incentives to demonstrate a cleaner break from the European Union. Empirically, the article draws on a series of interviews conducted with UK and EU policymakers. The findings demonstrate the significance of ideology and party factions in a policy domain where the UK is powerful enough to treat EU institutions as useful rather than necessary, and shows the direct and indirect ways factional politics brings about external change.

TI  - In vitro to in vivo extrapolation and high-content imaging for simultaneous characterization of chemically induced liver steatosis and markers of hepatotoxicity
T2  - ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Chemically induced steatosis is characterized by lipid accumulation associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and nucleus distortion. New approach methods integrating in vitro and in silico models are needed to identify chemicals that may induce these cellular events as potential risk factors for steatosis and associated hepatotoxicity. In this study we used high-content imaging for the simultaneous quantification of four cellular markers as sentinels for hepatotoxicity and steatosis in chemically exposed human liver cells in vitro. Furthermore, we evaluated the results with a computational model for the extrapolation of human oral equivalent doses (OED). First, we tested 16 reference chemicals with known capacities to induce cellular alterations in nuclear morphology, lipid accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress. Then, using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and reverse dosimetry, OEDs were extrapolated from data of any stimulated individual sentinel response. The extrapolated OEDs were confirmed to be within biologically relevant exposure ranges for the reference chemicals. Next, we tested 14 chemicals found in food, selected from thousands of putative chemicals on the basis of structure-based prediction for nuclear receptor activation. Amongst these, orotic acid had an extrapolated OED overlapping with realistic exposure ranges. Thus, we were able to characterize known steatosis-inducing chemicals as well as data-scarce food-related chemicals, amongst which we confirmed orotic acid to induce hepatotoxicity. This strategy addresses needs of next generation risk assessment and can be used as a first chemical prioritization hazard screening step in a tiered approach to identify chemical risk factors for steatosis and hepatotoxicity-associated events.

AB  - Introduction: To evaluate the role of unilateral inguinal lymph-node dissection (ILND) plus contralateral dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) vs. bilateral ILND in clinical N1 (cN1) penile squamous cell carcinoma (peSCC) patients.Material and Methods: Within our institutional database (1980-2020, included), we identified 61 consecutive cT1-4 cN1 cM0 patients with histological confirmed peSCC who underwent either unilateral ILND plus DSNB (26) or bilateral ILND (35).Results: Median age was 54 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 48-60 years). Median follow-up was 68 months (IQR 21-105 months). Most patients had pT1 (23 %) or pT2 (54.1%), as well as G2 (47.5%) or G3 (23%) tumors, while lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was present in 67.1% of cases. Considering a cN1 and a cN0 groin, overall 57 out of 61 patients (93.5%) had nodal disease in the cN1 groin. Con-versely, only 14 out of 61 patients (22.9%) had nodal disease in the cN0 groin. 5-year IR-free survival was 91% (Confidence interval [CI] 80%-100%) for bilateral ILND group and 88% (CI 73%-100%) for the ipsilateral ILND plus DSNB group (P-value 0.8). Conversely, 5-year CSS was 76% (CI 62%-92%) for bilateral ILND group and 78% (CI 63%-97%) for the ipsilateral ILND plus contralateral DSNB group (P-value 0.9).Conclusions: In patients with cN1 peSCC the risk of occult contralateral nodal disease is comparable to cN0 high risk peSCC and the gold standard, namely bilateral ILND, may be replaced by unilateral ILND and contralateral DSNB without affecting positive node detec-tion, IRRs and CSS.

TI  - Fluorescence-based sentinel lymph node mapping and lymphography evaluation: results from the IHU-IRCAD-EAES EURO-FIGS registry
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe identification of metastatic lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors in gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been successfully used in GI tumors to detect the lymphatic pathway and the sentinel lymph node (SLN), facilitating fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) with the purpose to achieve a correct nodal staging. The aim of this study was to analyze the current results of NIRF SLN navigation and lymphography through data collected in the EURO-FIGS registry.MethodsProspectively collected data regarding patients and ICG-guided lymphadenectomies were analyzed. Additional analyses were performed to identify predictors of metastatic SLN and determinants of fluorescence positivity and nodal metastases outside the boundaries of standard lymphadenectomies.ResultsOverall, 188 patients were included by 18 surgeons from 10 different centers. Colorectal cancer was the most reported pathology (77.7%), followed by gastric (19.1%) and esophageal tumors (3.2%). ICG was injected with higher doses (p < 0.001) via extraparietal side (63.3%), and with higher volumes (p < 0.001) via endoluminal side (36.7%). Overall, NIRF SLN navigation was positive in 75.5% of all cases and 95.5% of positive SLNs were retrieved, with a metastatic rate of 14.7%. NIRF identification of lymph nodes outside standard lymphatic stations occurred in 52.1% of all cases, 43.8% of which were positive for metastatic involvement. Positive NIRF SLN identification was an independent predictor of metastasis outside standard lymphatic stations (OR = 4.392, p = 0.029), while BMI independently predicted metastasis in retrieved SLNs (OR = 1.187, p = 0.013). Lower doses of ICG were protective against NIRF identification outside standard of care lymphadenectomy (OR = 0.596, p = 0.006), while higher volumes of ICG were predictive of metastatic involvement outside standard of care lymphadenectomy (OR = 1.597, p = 0.001).ConclusionsSLN mapping helps identifying potentially metastatic lymph nodes outside the boundaries of standard lymphadenectomies. The EURO-FIGS registry is a valuable tool to share and analyze European surgeons' practices.

TI  - Comparison of vegetation indices and image classification methods for mangrove mapping at semi-detailed scale in southwest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the mangrove mapping carried out in the Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil, using two remote sensing data processing approaches in order to evaluate their potentialities as a complementary tool for oil spill sensitivity mapping. Ten vegetation indices were computed using the Landsat 8 imagery available in Google Earth Engine, and subsequently their spectral patterns were classified through three supervised and five unsupervised methods. Additionally, one pre-processed Landsat 8 OLI bands composition were classified by these eight classification algo-rithms. To role as a ground-truth for the comparison of 88 automatically produced maps, a mangrove map was prepared based on the methodological guidelines of Oceanic Atmospheric Administration of United States of America for Environmental Sensitivity Index. The best results were presented by Cobweb unsupervised classification of Mangrove Vegetation Index, properly identifying a great mangrove habitats diversity, such as inland brackish, riverine fringe and seaward forests.

TI  - Supervised machine learning for predicting and interpreting dynamic drivers of plantation forest productivity in northern Tasmania, Australia
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of a plantation forest to grow and produce timber is locally constrained by topography, climate, soil conditions, and external factors such as fire and timber harvesting. Accurate estimation of forest productivity supports effective forest management. However, efficiently generating accurate models of forest productivity is hampered by the need to gather, process and integrate large volumes of disparate, high dimensional data that require computationally intensive data analysis processing methods. Recent developments in cloud-based ma-chine learning systems offer a means to address this problem.This research investigates the use of supervised machine learning to model and predict forest productivity across pine (Pinus radiata) plantations in northern Tasmania, Australia. Forest productivity models are generated by integrating 23 predictive features, including multi-temporal LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived topographic attributes, climate (rainfall and temperature) information, and edaphic conditions (geology and soil). Five machine learning (ML) regression algorithms are compared for this task: Linear Regression (LR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Trees Regression (DT), Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Deci-sion Trees Regression (GBDT). The best performing algorithm, in terms of the optimal bias-variance trade-off, was RF (RMSE 2.08 and Bias-0.72) followed closely by GBDT (RMSE 2.13 and Bias-0.68) and DT (RMSE 2.94 and Bias-0.68). Tuning Model Complexity was used to provide a clear understanding of the relationship and interactions between input features and forest productivity, resulting in more accurate and interpretable models. In contrast, we conclude that GBDT results in a more reliable predictive performance than RF, and transferability model to unseen data by assessing the spatial autocorrelation. Across the top performing models, rainfall was the most important factor driving forest productivity, followed by geological class, topographic position index (TPI), landscape aspect and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). This work demonstrates the usefulness of supervised machine learning techniques to generate accurate and efficient forest productivity predictions from large and diverse spatial datasets. Moreover, users are afforded the ability to gain insight into changes that affect forest productivity through time, such as the increasing risks of wildfire and climate change by identifying the factors that contribute the most to the tree growth. By delivering a framework to understand complex and dynamic drivers of productivity through a machine learning pipeline enhanced by cloud-based machine learning systems, forest managers are provided with easily accessible tools to maximisation productivity.

TI  - An unsupervised domain adaptation deep learning method for spatial and temporal transferable crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop type mapping is essential for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. Recently, various machine learning methods have been increasingly used for crop type mapping, but they often lose their validity when directly applied to other regions and years due to differences in the distribution of source and target data, that is, domain shift. To address the problem, we developed a deep adaptation crop classification network (DACCN) based on the idea of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The proposed DACCN mainly consists of two parts, a feature extractor that converts the original input into high-level representations, and a domain aligner where the discrepancy between source and target distributions is measured using multiple kernel variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD). Four states in the United States (U.S.) Corn Belt and two provinces in northeastern China were used as study areas, where samples used for model building and accuracy evaluation were collected based on time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and reference maps in 2018 and 2019. Then, three experiments were designed to verify the transferability of DACCN across space, time, and space-time, respectively. In each experiment, the proposed DACCN was compared to deep crop classification network (DCCN), a model with a similar structure to DACCN but without the domain adaptation mechanism, and two machine learning methods, random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM). The experimental results showed that DACCN outperformed other models in most transfer cases with overall classification accuracies ranging from 0.835 to 0.922. The DACCN also performed better in spatially continuous mapping with its predicted crop type maps more consistent with the reference ones. As an innovative application of transfer learning in crop type mapping, the methodology proposed in this study effectively addressed the problem of missing labels in target domains and alleviated the negative impact of domain shift.

TI  - The impact of coastal erosion on the archaeology of the Cyrenaican coast of Eastern Libya
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion in Cyrenaica (Eastern Libya) represents a major problem for archaeology and heritage management. The area is rich in archaeological sites, often understudied or not fully documented, but also has extensive stretches of vulnerable eroding coastline. This study demonstrates the extent and impact of erosion via shoreline change assessment at two spatial scales. Firstly, wide area assessment using shorelines extracted from a time-series of medium-resolution Landsat imagery. Secondly, site-specific assessment using recent and historic Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. In both cases, extracted shorelines at different timesteps were compared using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool to quantify rates and magnitudes of shoreline movement. The results show extensive zones of erosion at and around the key ancient harbour sites of Apollonia, Ptolemais and Tocra. They also suggest increased rates of coastal retreat in recent years, which is likely linked to anthropogenic actions such as sand mining and urbanization. Forecasts based on present-day shoreline change rates, coupled with ground-level documentation of the vulnerable shorelines is used to identify archaeological features and structures which will likely be progressively damaged or destroyed over the next 20 years. The ability to actively protect archaeological sites is unclear, but there is a clear need for mitigation in the form of enhanced awareness of environmental problems (e.g. caused by sand mining) and more intensive survey/documentation of sites and areas which will be lost in the coming years.

TI  - A novel nomogram model of breast cancer-based imaging for predicting the status of axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is aimed to develop and validate a novel nomogram model that can preoperatively predict axillary lymph node pathological complete response (pCR) after NAT and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer patients. A total of 410 patients who underwent NAT and were pathologically confirmed to be axillary lymph node positive after breast cancer surgery were included. They were divided into two groups: patients with axillary lymph node pCR and patients with residual node lesions after NAT. Then the nomogram prediction model was constructed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The result of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that molecular subtypes, molybdenum target (MG) breast, computerized tomography (CT) breast, ultrasound (US) axilla, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) axilla, and CT axilla (all p<0.001) had a significant impact on the evaluation of axillary lymph node status after NAT. The nomogram score appeared that AUC was 0.832 (95% CI 0.786-0.878) in the training cohort and 0.947 (95% CI 0.906-0.988) in the validation cohort, respectively. The decision curve represented that the nomogram has a positive predictive ability, indicating its potential as a practical clinical tool.

TI  - Real-World Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccines: An Industry Expert View on the Successes, Challenges, and Future Opportunities
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Pharmacovigilance leaders from major vaccine developers describe the learnings from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the area of pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology. The authors aim to raise awareness of the co-operation among vaccine developers, highlight common challenges, advocate for solutions, and propose recommendations for the future in the areas of real-world safety and effectiveness, safety reporting and evaluation, and regulatory submissions. To enable timely evaluation of real-world safety and effectiveness, multi-sponsor study platforms were implemented, resulting in quicker recruitment over wide geographical areas. Future gains could be derived by developing geographically flexible, common protocols and/or joint company-sponsored studies for multiple vaccines and a collective strategy to build low/middle-income country (LMIC) sentinel sites. Safety reporting, signal detection and evaluation was particularly challenging given the unprecedented number of adverse events reported. New methods were required to manage increased report volume while maintaining the ability to quickly identify and respond to new data that could impact the benefit-risk profile of each vaccine. Worldwide health authority submissions, requests for information and differing regulatory requirements imposed significant burden on regulators and industry. Industry consensus on the safety reporting requirements and joint meetings with regulatory authorities markedly reduced this burden for all stakeholders. The most impactful innovations should be undertaken rapidly and expanded to other vaccines and therapeutics, with a multi-stakeholder approach. The authors of this paper make future recommendations and have launched an initiative named BeCOME (Beyond COVID Monitoring Excellence) with a focus on actions in each of the highlighted areas.

TI  - Emergence of Sex Differences in US Adolescent Substance Use
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Adolescence is a common time for experimentation with substance use and the emergence of sex differences in substance use patterns. Although similar in early adolescence, male and female substance use patterns historically diverge by young adulthood, with males using more substances than females. We aim to add to current literature by utilizing a nationally representative sample, assessing a broad range of substances used, and focusing on a sentinel period during which sex differences emerge. We hypothesized that certain sex-specific substance use patterns emerge in adolescence. Methods: Data are from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (n = 13,677), a nationally representative sample of high school students. Weighted logistic analyses of covariance adjusting for race/ethnicity evaluated males' and females' substance use (14 outcomes) by age category. Results: Among all adolescents, more males reported illicit substance use and cigarette smoking than females, whereas more females reported prescription opioid misuse, synthetic cannabis use, recent alcohol use, and binge drinking. Divergence between male and female use usually occurred at 18+ years. Odds of using most illicit substances were significantly greater among males than females at age 18+ years (aORs 1.7-4.47). Among 18+ year-olds, males and females did not differ in electronic vapor product use, alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, synthetic cannabis use, cigarette smoking, or prescription opioid misuse. Conclusions: Sex differences in adolescent use of most but not all substances emerge by age 18+ years. Sex-specific patterns of adolescent substance use may inform specific prevention efforts and identify peak ages for intervention.

TI  - Increased nutrition risk is associated with a prolonged negative conversion of viral RNA in children and adolescents with COVID-19
T2  - NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to determine the factors affecting the time to negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents, with particular reference to nutrition risk assessment on admission.Methods This retrospective observational study was conducted in a sentinel hospital for novel coronavirus in Quanzhou, China. The study population comprised children and adolescents with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation wards between March 25 and April 12, 2022. Based on the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Paediatrics (STAMP), nutrition risk screening was performed within 24 h of admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent factors for the time to negative viral RNA conversion.Results A total of 185 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. The median time to viral RNA conversion (from the first day of a positive nucleic acid test to the first day of consecutive negative results) was 15 days (IQR 12-18 days), ranging from 4 to 25 days. High nutrition risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.543, 95% CI: 0.334-0.881) and fever (HR: 0.663; 95% CI: 0.483-0.910) were independent factors influencing the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Conclusion High nutrition risk and fever were independently associated with delayed viral clearance in children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, so these factors should be considered during the treatment plans for infected children and adolescents.

TI  - Urban growth, changing relationship between biophysical factors and surface thermal characteristics: A geospatial analysis of Agra city, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The kind of urbanization occurred in the last few decades has caused a massive reduction of urban green space raising the land surface temperature, drastic land use and land cover changes, and hampering environmental sustainability in Agra city. Examining urban growth trends and its significant impacts on surface and vegetation cover of Agra helps in assessing nature of spatial development process. The present study examines urban growth, bio-physical factors and surface thermal characteristics in the city. Study uses multiple geospatial techniques to analyse changes. To obtain spatio-temporal landscape dynamics multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI satellite images were used for years 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2021 to classify LULC classes using maximum like-lihood supervised classification algorithm. Based on the spatial drivers and LULC of 2001 and 2011; multi perception based artificial neural network model is applied to predict the urban areas in 2031. Study reports that the greatest loss was found for vegetation cover (VC); a total of 17.89 sq. km. (13.06%) green space lost during the study periods (1991???2021). A remarkable increased in urban area was noticed at a rate of 11.20% during 1991???2001 and 7.97% during 2001???2011. The study has much to offer to urban and environmental planning and sustainable urbanization.

TI  - Long-term oncological results in penile cancer treated by inguinal lymphadenectomy
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn 95% of cases, penile cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma whose specificity is lymphatic spread with the inguinal lymph nodes as the first relay route. Inguinal lymph node dissection is a primordial part of the treatment. The objective was to assess the oncological results of inguinal lymph node dissection in penile cancer at our centre.MethodsWe retrospectively included all patients having undergone inguinal lymph node dissection at our centre between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2020 for the treatment of penile cancer. Patients for whom lymphadenopathy was palliative were excluded. Depending on indications, the procedures consisted in either dynamic sentinel node biopsy, modified lymphadenectomy or radical lymphadenectomy. All cancers were reclassified using the 2016 TNM classification system. Survival was analysed according to the Kaplan-Meier method.Results242 inguinal lymph node dissections were performed in 122 patients. There were 71 pN0 (58%), 9 pN1 (7%), 4 pN2 (3%) and 38 pN3 (31%). Mean follow-up was 51 +/- 45 months. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was 76% in pN0 patients and 17% in pN3 patients. The 5-year specific and overall survival rates were, respectively, 82% and 73% for pN0 stages, and 14% and 17% for pN3 stages. Extracapsular extension on an inguinal lymphadenopathy appeared as a highly negative prognostic factor.ConclusionInguinal lymph node dissection is essential in the treatment of penile cancer. Recurrence-free, specific and overall survival are closely linked to the lymph node stage. Extracapsular extension and pelvic lymph node invasion are highly negative prognostic factors.

TI  - Stable or unstable? Landscape diversity and ecosystem stability across scales in the forest-grassland ecotone in northern China
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context Forest-grassland ecotones, the transitional zones between forests and grasslands, often harbor high levels of biodiversity. According to the portfolio theory, communities with such high biodiversity should exhibit high stability in ecosystem functioning. On the contrary, the theory of 'bi-stability' or 'multistability' predicts that ecosystems exhibiting multiple states or regimes (e.g. forest and grassland) are less stable. Understanding the stability of forest-grassland ecotone has broad implications for forest management and restoration.Objectives In this study, by quantifying landscape heterogeneity and temporal invariability of regional climatic and vegetational metrics, we aimed to reveal how landscape diversity influences the stability of ecosystem functioning in the forest-grassland ecotone.Methods We focused on the forest-grassland ecotone in northern China (i.e. from the forest belt in the Greater Khingan Mountains to the steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia) and used remote sensing data of land cover dynamics from 1992 to 2015 to analyze the landscape diversity and ecosystem dynamics at different grain sizes. To measure the temporal stability of climatic variables and vegetational dynamics, we calculated the interannual variation of temperature (T), wind speed (WS), precipitation (P), and the net primary productivity (NPP) on the grided sampling cells at different spatial scale over the same period.ResultsOur results showed that landscape diversity across this forest-grassland ecotone was positively related to the stability of T and NPP, but negatively related to that of WS and P. These opposite patterns may be explained by the differential nature of ecosystem variables, namely whether they involve transporting substance across space (WS and P) or not (T and NPP). We also found that as the spatial scale increases, the diversity-stability relationships strengthened for all three climatic variables (i.e., T, P, WS). However, the stabilizing effects of landscape diversity on NPP first increased but then decreased with increasing grain size, peaking at similar to 30 km.Conclusions Our empirical analyses demonstrate strong, but context-dependent diversity-stability relationships, shedding light on the paradox in the stability of ecosystem functioning in the ecotone. These findings also have implications for the management of landscape resources to maintain the sustainability of forest-grassland ecotones.

TI  - Landscape dynamics of the aeolian savanna: Santos Luzardo National Park 1988-2018
T2  - LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research defines the savanna aeolian landscape dynamics of the 'Santos Luzardo' National Park in the Llanos of Venezuela between 1988 and 2018, using images from the LANDSAT series to elaborate and compare ecosystems maps. The ecosystem dynamics show that the landscape changes naturally since the transitions occurred towards other types of natural savanna due to soil water seasonality. The savannas are the dominant matrix of the landscape, occupying between 69.1 and 76.7%. The dynamics of transformation of the aeolian savanna landscape are mainly associated with soil water content. The application of temporal studies contributes to understanding the aeolian savanna landscape transformation processes and evaluating their conservation status.

TI  - Hidden vulnerability of US Atlantic coast to sea-level rise due to vertical land motion.
T2  - Nature communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The vulnerability of coastal environments to sea-level rise varies spatially, particularly due to local land subsidence. However, high-resolution observations and models of coastal subsidence are scarce, hindering an accurate vulnerability assessment. We use satellite data from 2007 to 2020 to create high-resolution map of subsidence rate at mm-level accuracy for different land covers along the ~3,500km long US Atlantic coast. Here, we show that subsidence rate exceeding 3mm per year affects most coastal areas, including wetlands, forests, agricultural areas, and developed regions. Coastal marshes represent the dominant land cover type along the US Atlantic coast and are particularly vulnerable to subsidence. We estimate that 58 to 100% of coastal marshes are losing elevation relative to sea level and show that previous studies substantially underestimate marsh vulnerability by not fully accounting for subsidence.

TI  - Thermal Anomaly, Co-Seismic Deformation and Seismic Source Parameters Estimation of June 21 2022, Afghanistan Earthquake Employing InSAR Observations
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On June 21, 2022, a shallow earthquake of Mw 6.0 struck southeastern Afghanistan at the interaction of the Eurasian and Indian Plates. The earthquake was VIII (severe) intensity. It drew the attention of many seismologists and earth scientists. The presented work brings satellite-based detection of pre-earthquake transient thermal anomaly, co-seismic ground deformations estimation using InSAR (SAR Interferometry) and inversion of InSAR deformations results to estimate focal solution parameters. Near the Afghanistan earthquake, a rise of 5-7 degrees C from the normal temperature in both day and night Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series along the SW, NW, NE and east parts of the fault is observed using MODIS satellite thermal data. Sentinel-1A microwave satellite data with the InSAR technique is used to analyze co-seismic ground deformations for both passes, and the estimation of source parameters of the fault and slip distribution of the earthquake using the Bayesian inversion approach is carried out. InSAR-based ground deformations estimate upliftment of about 325 mm and subsidence of -160 mm. The inversion results of ground deformations show that the event might be occurred due to the left lateral slip mechanism. The fault seems to be steeply dipping in eastward with NE-SW trends at a depth of 7 km. A number of aftershocks have occurred till now in the regions as evident by the Coulomb static stress along the NE, east side of the fault. The correlation between high-stress regions using thermal anomaly before the occurrence of event and coulomb static stress map after the occurrence of event have been also observed. The total seismic moment for the event using the inversion result yields a value of 1.08 x 10(25) dyne-cm, which is equivalent to M-w 5.99.

TI  - Incorporating machine learning models and remote sensing to assess the spatial distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity in a light-textured soil
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is a key component in hydrogeology and water management. This study aimed at evaluating popular tree-based machine learning algorithms (Random forest (RF), Quantile random forest (QRF), Cubist (Cu), and Decision tree regression (DTr)) to assess the spatial distribution of Ksat in a sandy agricultural field. Soil surface reflectance derived from Landsat-8 (OLI/TIRS) (several remotely sensed data including original surface reflectances of spectral bands and 22 remote sensing indices) as well as limited ground measured soil data were used as predictor covariates. Using collected disturbed and undisturbed soil samples, physicochemical properties (Ksat, porosity, organic matter, and texture contents) were determined. Based on novel supervised feature selection, covariates including Landsat-8 spectral Band2, Band4, Band6, and Band7, normalized difference pond index (NDPI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and silt content were identified as the most important factors in Ksat prediction. Variable importance analysis showed Band7 and Band6 were explaining 54% of the total Ksat variation. The model evaluation, using five statistics cretria, Taylor diagram and the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test, demonstrates the outperformance of RF being followed by QRF, Cu, and DTr models. Accordingly, the RF method combined with an optimized sampling approach provides the most accurate digital soil Ksat map. The uncertainty analysis showed no significant different trend in Ksat predictions by applying more dense datasets confirming original-limited data (n = 28) was efficient and sufficient to derive a reliable Ksat-map. The developed approach, which can be scaled up at a large scale, seems to be useful in modelling water flow and solute transport for water and nutrient management purposes toward precision agriculture.

TI  - Optical remote sensing of large-scale water pollution in Angola and DR Congo caused by the Catoca mine tailings spill
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Billions of tons of hazardous mine waste are stored in thousands of tailings storage facilities around the world. These impoundments represent one of the most important environmental risk factors of industrial mining, since occasional tailings spills or dam failures cause devastating impacts on humans and ecosystems, specifically along river corridors. In this study, we developed a satellite remote sensing methodology to assess the impacts of tailings spills on water quality focusing on the controversial incident that occurred at the Catoca diamond mine in Angola in late July 2021. The spill allegedly caused important river pollution in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) and led to public health concerns including the loss of human lives - however the mining company denied any responsibility. We processed high resolution imagery acquired by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellites using the Python package Acolite for atmospheric correction and turbidity retrieval, and applied a river skeletonizing algorithm to automatically extract turbidity values for the entire river system. This allowed tracking the propagation of the pollution front from the source at the Catoca mine through the Tshikapa-and the Kasai River during more than one month and across 1400 km, until the pollution front finally dissipated after discharging into the Congo River. We further analyzed a 6-year time series of virtual stations in the Tshikapa River located up-and downstream of the effluent discharge to compare the impacts of the tailings spill to seasonal variabilities of water quality. Turbidity values caused by the spill largely exceeded the seasonal variability in the Tshikapa River in recent years. These findings confirm that the Catoca tailings spill has significantly affected water quality of the Tshikapa-and the Kasai River with total suspended solids concen-trations that were several 10-fold above drinking water standards in Lunda Norte Province, Angola, and Kasai Province, DR Congo, making severe public health impacts for residents and fish kills highly probable. After investigating whether this methodology could be applied to other tailings dam failures that have occurred since the Sentinel-2 mission began in 2015, we recommend to apply it to four other incidents in Mexico, Myanmar, Peru and China, respectively. Overall, this Sentinel-2 workflow provides the opportunity to assess the large-scale impacts of pollution incidents in mining areas around the world in locations where hydrological-and water quality data are scarce and monitoring capacities are limited.

TI  - Rain retrieval algorithm for SSTM-1 aboard upcoming EOS-6 mission
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-Estimator method-based rain retrieval technique, successfully providing rain estimates from INSAT-3D/3DR, is modified to provide rain from Sea Surface Temperature Monitor-1 (SSTM-1) payload aboard the upcoming EOS-6 mission of Indian Space Research Organisation. Pre-launch study utilises moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instrument aboard Terra and Aqua satellites as a proxy to SSTM-1. Performance of estimations is evaluated with rainfall products from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. The results indicate that SSTM-1 can capture not only the global rainfall distribution but also has the potential to resolve rainfall structure of tropical cyclones. Quantitative comparison of the measured rainfall with IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrieval for GPM) rain shows a root mean square error of 3.02 mm hr(-1), bias of 1.06 mm hr(-1) and correlation of 0.48. Present algorithm provides a probability of detection of >65% with respect to rain measurements from GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR), which further demonstrates the potential of SSTM-1 for monitoring rainfall. In addition, the study determines the importance of rain monitoring from SSTM-1 in disaster support and developing flagging/correction procedures for rain-corrupted ocean surface wind vectors from scatterometer payload onboard on the same platform.

TI  - A novel transfer learning framework for sorghum biomass prediction using UAV-based remote sensing data and genetic markers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield for biofuel crops is measured in terms of biomass, so measurements throughout the growing season are crucial in breeding programs, yet traditionally time- and labor-consuming since they involve destructive sampling. Modern remote sensing platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can carry multiple sensors and collect numerous phenotypic traits with efficient, non-invasive field surveys. However, modeling the complex relationships between the observed phenotypic traits and biomass remains a challenging task, as the ground reference data are very limited for each genotype in the breeding experiment. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is proposed for sorghum biomass prediction. The architecture is designed to exploit the time series remote sensing and weather data, as well as static genotypic information. As a large number of features have been derived from the remote sensing data, feature importance analysis is conducted to identify and remove redundant features. A strategy to extract representative information from high-dimensional genetic markers is proposed. To enhance generalization and minimize the need for ground reference data, transfer learning strategies are proposed for selecting the most informative training samples from the target domain. Consequently, a pre-trained model can be refined with limited training samples. Field experiments were conducted over a sorghum breeding trial planted in multiple years with more than 600 testcross hybrids. The results show that the proposed LSTM-based RNN model can achieve high accuracies for single year prediction. Further, with the proposed transfer learning strategies, a pre-trained model can be refined with limited training samples from the target domain and predict biomass with an accuracy comparable to that from a trained-from-scratch model for both multiple experiments within a given year and across multiple years.

TI  - Characterization and expression profile of transient receptor potential channels in sea cucumber <i>Apostichopus japonicus</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the past few decades, heat waves and seasonal variation linked with global warming are causing frequent fluctuations of water temperature in aquatic environments, resulting in further challenges for marine organisms. As a poikilothermic marine animal and a temperate species, sea cucumber A. japonicus is also very sensitive to temperature variation and shows a limited ability to adapt to environmental temperature changes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which A. japonicus perceives signals from such a diverse environment including the trigger of aestivation still remain unclear. TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily, as the great potential "sentinel" of the organism in response to the changes of the external environment signals, perceived little attention and will be the future great candidates for sensory function research in echinoderm. MethodsBLAST program was applied to identify the AjTRPs based on A. japonicus transcriptome database. Gene structure analysis of AjTRPs and phylogenetic analysis of TRPs were performed. The expression profiles of AjTRPs in different tissues and in response to different heat stress treatments (chronic/ acute) were measured using qRT-PCR. ResultsA total of 54 TRPs were identified in A. japonicus. Gene structure analysis showed that the exon numbers and the domains of AjTRPs varied greatly. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AjTPRs were mainly grouped into six subfamilies: TRPA, TRPM, TRPC, TRPV, TRPML, and TRPP. Copy numbers of each TRP member in marine invertebrates including A. japonicus were more than those in vertebrates, however some TRP channel members were lost in invertebrates. Expression profile detection suggested that the representative 15 AjTRP genes belonging to 6 subfamilies were expressed in all tissues examined. ConclusionOur findings indicate that the plastic evolutionary history of TRP channel genes and suggest that TRPM2-1, TRPM2-2, TRPM3, and TRPC3-1 are potential thermo-TRP proteins involved in thermal regulation in A. japonicus. This work facilitates the knowledge of TRP-mediated sensory systems in echinoderms, provides new insights into the mechanisms of aestivation and global warming adaptation in marine invertebrates.

TI  - High-temporal-resolution monitoring of reservoir water storage of the Lancang-Mekong River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) is an important transboundary river in Southeast Asia shared by China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam from upstream to downstream. Construction and operation of dams in the LMR basin has profoundly affected its natural streamflow regime. It is therefore important to monitor changes in reservoir water storage and to quantify the impact of reservoir operation on the redistribution of surface water resources over this basin. Given the difficulty in obtaining in-situ measurements of reservoirs on the LMR, we integrated multisource remote sensing, including satellite altimetry and optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, to generate weekly water levels and water storages of nine largest reservoirs on the main stem of the LMR from 2017 to 2021. Specifically, partial surface water extent (SWE) of reservoirs was extracted from Sentinel-1 SAR images and digital elevation models (DEMs), using Random Forest algorithms trained by partial SWE derived from Sentinel-2 optical images, showing an overall accuracy higher than 95%. Based on the partial SWE and water level estimates from ICESat-2 and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, International Space Station-based) data, the relationships between water levels and partial SWE were derived to convert partial SWE into water level time series. Furthermore, water storage time series of the nine reservoirs were obtained from water level time series and hypsometric functions derived from SRTM DEMs that were corrected by ICESat-2 data to remove systematic errors. For the Xiaowan Reservoir on the Lancang River, there is close agreement between remote sensing-derived water levels and in-situ water levels in terms of a normalized RMSE lower than 5%. Results indicate that multisource remote sensing has large potential for high-temporal-resolution monitoring of reservoir water levels and water storage. This could more precisely evaluate impacts of cascade reservoirs on the streamflow of the LMR and facilitate drought and flood mitigation for riverine countries.

TI  - Comparison of aeolian desertification between the Moltsog Dune Field in Mongolia and the Ujimqin Dune Field in China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aeolian desertification is a severe ecological and environmental problem in arid regions. Research on its spatio-temporal distribution, modelling and driving force is necessary to prevent the development of aeolian desertification. In this study, the Moltsog Dune Field in Mongolia and the Ujimqin Dune Field in China were selected as the study areas, as both contain dunes under similar physical conditions. Using LANDSAT data from 1988, 1995, 2002, 2009, 2016 and 2020, the spatial-temporal distribution and the degree of development of aeolian desertification in the two dune fields over the past 30 years were compared. Two periods of high-resolution images were then used to compare the surface morphological changes induced by aeolian desertification in these dune fields. Climatic and socio-economic data of the same period were used to compare and analyse the potential causes of changes in aeolian desertification in these regions. The results show that: (1) Over the last 30 years, the degree and development rate of aeolian desertification in the Ujimqin Dune Field were generally higher than those in the Moltsog Dune Field, and the former had a high degree of fragmented aeolian desertification patches with an expanding range. (2) The main form of aeolian desertification is the reactivation of fixed dunes, which includes the development of blowouts on the flat grassland under the influence of human activities in the Ujimqin Dune Field. (3) Desertification in Moltsog is mainly affected by climatic factors, while that in Ujimqin is mainly driven by anthropogenic activities. The latter is specifically affected by the high grazing intensity before 2000 and increased mining activities after 2000. These findings provide a reference for comparing the aeolian desertification process and meaningful information for preventing and controlling aeolian desertification and enabling the sustainable development of dune fields in arid regions.

TI  - <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> strain ZY-312 facilitates colonic mucosa regeneration in colitis <i>via</i> motivating STAT3 signaling pathway induced by IL-22 from ILC3 secretion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionProbiotics play critical roles in relieving inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the underlying mechanism of Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312 (B. fragilis) for colonic mucosa regeneration in IBD remains unclear. MethodsThe weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and histopathology-associated index (HAI) were evaluated the therapeutic effects of B. fragilis in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. Colonic mucosa proliferation and apoptosis level, and mucus density were detected by histological stain. Gut microbiota was sequenced by 16srRNA analysis. The expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in colonic mucosa was detected in B. fragilis-treated mice in colitis. B. fragilis-regulated immunity factors of motivating downstream STAT3 phosphorylation were screened by ELISA and flow cytometry. Lastly, B. fragilis-mediated colonic mucosa regeneration effects were verified though the knockout of STAT3 (Stat3(oIEC)) and IL-22 (IL-22(-/-)) in mice, and inhibitor of STAT3 and IL-22 in co-culture model. ResultsB. fragilis alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice with less weight loss, DAI, colon length shortening, and HAI. Further the results showed that B. fragilis motivated STAT3 phosphorylation in colonic mucosa with the upregulation of proliferation index Ki-67 and mucus density, the downregulation of apoptosis level, and the modulation of gut microbiota through a Stat3(oIEC) mice model and STAT3 inhibitor-added model in vitro. Meanhwhile we found that B. fragilis promoted IL-22 production, and increased the percentage of IL-22-secreting type 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3) in colitis. Consequently, We identified that B. fragilis did not increase the expression of pSTAT3, either proliferation level, mucus density, or alter gut microbiota in IL-22(-/-) mice. DiscussionB. fragilis may indirectly motivate ILC3 to secrete IL-22, followed by IL-22-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, hence promoting colonic mucosa regeneration in colitis. It indicates that B. fragilis has the potential to be a biological agent for IBD therapy.

TI  - Niksokowaawak as Axiom: The Indispensability of Comprehensive Relational Animacy in Blackfoot Ways of Knowing, Being, and Doing
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper outlines a proposal, based on Blackfoot worldview, for a collective method to stand alongside Western qualitative and quantitative methods and highlights the value of collective methods in collaborative social-ecological research. Neither qualitative nor quantitative methods are adequate to disclose a world where all things are alive, where "objects" are subjects-agentive beings in their own right. Most Indigenous cultures understand and experience the world as a network of living beings, a collective, with whom they are interrelated/connected and therefore, any efforts to collaborate with Indigenous peoples must acknowledge comprehensive relational animacy. Applying coproduction principles in concert with Blackfoot ways of knowing and being, the authors collaborate to articulate and advance a collective method wherein the many and diverse collective methods of Blackfoot and other Indigenous peoples might find quarter.

TI  - Mapping of salty aeolian dust-source potential areas: Ensemble model or benchmark models?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the effects of dust on human health, environment, agriculture, and transportation, it is necessary to inves-tigate dust emissions susceptibility. This study aimed to study the capability of different machine learning models in an-alyzing land susceptibility to dust emissions. At first, the dust-source areas were identified by examining the frequency of occurrence (FOO) of dusty days using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the MODIS sensor from 2000 to 2020 and field surveys. Then, the weighted subspace random forest (WSRF) model in comparison with three benchmark models- general linear model (GLM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and support vector machine (SVM)-was employed to pre-dict land susceptibility to dust emissions and also to determine the importance of dust-drivers. The results revealed that the WSRF outperformed benchmark models. In a nutshell, the values of accuracy, Kappa, and probability of detection for all models were more than 97 %, and also the false alarm rate was less than 1 % for all models. Spatial analysis indicated a greater frequency of dust events in the outskirts of Urmia Lake (mainly in the eastern and southern parts). Furthermore, according to the map of land susceptibility to dust emissions produced by the WSRF model, about 4.5 %, 2.8 %, 1.8 %, 0.8 %, and 0.2 % of the salt land, rangeland, agricultural, dry-farming, and barren lands, respectively, associated with high and very high degrees of dust emissions susceptibility. Therefore, this study provided in-depth insights into the applicability of the ensemble model, WSRF, to precisely map dust emissions susceptibility.

TI  - Impact of Pathologic Complete Response on the Prognosis of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients: A Cohort Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecular subtype in which estrogen (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) expression does not occur. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.MethodsThis cohort study was conducted in a private-sector oncology clinic located in the city of Teresina, Brazil. Medical charts of 532 breast cancer patients treated from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed. Of these patients, 83 women with TNBC were selected (10 patients were excluded from the study). Univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox regression) were performed to evaluate the impact on patient survival, comparing patients with or without pCR. A significance level of 5% was set. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) curves were constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier model. ResultsAngiolymphatic invasion and positive sentinel lymph node were associated with a lower OS and/or DFS in TNBC (p<0.05). The 10-year OS was 78% and 49%, and the 10-year DFS was 97% and 32% in patients with or without pCR, respectively.ConclusionpCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improvement in OS and DFS in TNBC patients.

TI  - 'FIESTA': a forest inventory estimation and analysis R package
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecologists are increasingly relying on national forest inventories to address a wide variety of issues. The 'FIESTA' R package (Forest Inventory ESTimation and Analysis) is a tool that enables customized investigations using the extensive sample-based inventory data collected across all lands in the US by the US Dept of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. To date, the complex nature of the FIA inventory constrains many users to conduct only limited analyses through existing tools with pre-specified geographic boundaries, timeframes, and auxiliary data under a single statistical estimation process. Yet, the rapid evolution of available remotely sensed data and statistical methods present the opportunity to conduct spatial and temporal analyses of forest attributes that are much more relevant to many pressing ecological, environmental, economic, and social issues in the US, The 'FIESTA' package was developed to augment the current set of available tools by providing a flexible platform that accommodates evolving technologies and leading-edge estimation techniques. The package contains a collection of functions that can query FIA databases, summarize sample-based inventory data, extract and aggregate auxiliary spatial data, and generate estimates with associated variances. The 'FIESTA' R package is available on CRAN ().

TI  - Estimating plant area density of individual trees from discrete airborne laser scanning data using intensity information and path length distribution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant area density (PAD) of individual trees is an important structural indicator related to tree growth status, stress levels due to pests and diseases, photosynthesis potential, and evapotranspiration. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides unprecedented 3D information for mapping forest canopy parameters. Previous studies mainly focused on mapping stand-level and 2D leaf area index. This study proposes a method to estimate PAD from discrete and multiple return ALS data at in-dividual tree scales. The proposed method uses path length distribution to eliminate crown-shape-induced clumping, as well as intensity information to estimate crown transmittance from relative low-density points. The path length distribution is derived from the 3D crown boundary contours created by an alpha shape algorithm, which explicitly considers the non-uniform LiDAR pulse penetration distances. Pulse intensity is calibrated with the nearest pure-ground pulse to mitigate the need for prior leaf and ground reflectance information, which can be used in areas with a heterogeneous background. The proposed method was evaluated both in virtual experiments as well as with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data. The virtual experiments used the large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation model (LESS) to simulate virtual ALS scanning data based on abstract and realistic canopies. Results showed that the ALS-derived PAD is highly accurate, with RMSE less than 0.02 and R2 > 0.99 for the abstract sphere and cube crowns, and RMSE = 0.19 and R2 = 0.578 for the realistic crowns. The comparison with TLS of a birch plot shows that the ALS-derived PAD is consistent with those derived from TLS, with RMSE = 0.14 and R2 = 0.46. This study demonstrated that using the full intensity and geometry information of a point cloud is capable of generating high-resolution forest parameters from ALS data.

TI  - Cross-calibration method based on an automated observation site
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-calibration methods are widely used in high-precision remote sensor cali-brations and ensure observational consistency between sensors. Because two sensors must be observed under the same or similar conditions, the cross-calibration frequency is greatly reduced; performing cross-calibrations on Aqua/Terra MODIS, Sentinel-2A/Sentinel-2B MSI and other similar sensors is difficult due to synchronous-observation limitations. Additionally, few studies have cross-calibrated water-vapor-observation bands sensitive to atmospheric changes. In recent years, standard automated observation sites and unified processing technology networks, such as an Automated Radiative Calibration Network (RadCalNet) and an automated vicarious cali-bration system (AVCS), have provided automatic observation data and means for independently, continuously monitoring sensors, thus offering new cross-calibration references and bridges. We propose an AVCS-based cross-calibration method. By limiting the observational-condition differences when two remote sensors transit over wide temporal ranges through AVCS observation data, we improve the cross-calibration opportunity. Thereby, cross-calibrations and observation consistency evaluations between the abovementioned instruments are realized. The influence of AVCS-measurement uncertainties on the cross-calibration is analyzed. The consistency between the MODIS cross-calibration and sensor observation is within 3% (5% in SWIR bands); that for the MSI is within 1% (2.2% in the water-vapor-observation band); and for the cross-calibration of Aqua MODIS and the two MSI, the consistency between the cross-calibration-predicted TOA reflectance and the sensor-measured TOA reflectance was within 3.8%. Thus, the absolute AVCS-measurement uncertainty is also reduced, especially in the water-vapor-observation band. This method can be applied to cross-calibrations and measurement consistency evaluations of other remote sensors. Later, the spectral-difference influences on cross-calibrations will be further studied.

TI  - Algal biomass mapping of eutrophic lakes using a machine learning approach with MODIS images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms are a widespread issue in eutrophic lakes. Compared with the satellite-derived surface algal bloom area and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration, algae biomass is a more stable way to reflect water quality. Although satellite data have been adopted to observe the water column integrated algal biomass, the previous methods mostly are empirical algorithms, which are not stable enough for widespread use. This paper proposed a machine learning algorithm based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data to estimate the algal biomass, which was successfully applied to a eutrophic lake in China, Lake Taihu. This algorithm was developed by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to in situ algae biomass data in Lake Taihu (n = 140), and the different mainstream machine learning (ML) methods were compared and validated. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) (R2 = 0.67, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 38.88 %) and support vector machines (SVM) (R2 = 0.46, MAPE = 52.02 %) performed poor satisfactory. In contrast, random forest (RF) and extremely gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) algorithms had higher accuracy (RF: R2 = 0.85, MAPE = 22.68 %; XGBoost: R2 = 0.83, MAPE = 24.06 %), demonstrating greater application potential in algal biomass estimation. Field biomass data were further used to estimate the RF algorithm, which showed acceptable precision (R2 = 0.86, MAPE < 7 mg Chla). Subsequently, sensitivity analysis showed that the RF algorithm was not sensitive to high suspension and thickness of aerosols (rate of change <2 %), and inter-day and consecutive days verification showed stability (rate of change <5 %). The algorithm was also extended to Lake Chaohu (R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 18.42 %), demonstrating its potential in other eutrophic lakes. This study for algae biomass estimation provides technical means with higher accuracy and greater universality for the management of eutrophic lakes.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: We analyze the characteristics of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection among diarrhea patients in Kunming from 2018 to 2020 and provide evidence for follow-up surveillance and prevention. Methods: A total of 388 fecal samples of diarrhea patients from four sentinel hospitals in Yunnan Province from 2018 to 2020 were collected. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the fecal toxin genes of C. difficile. The positive fecal samples isolated the bacteria, and isolates were identified by mass spectrometry. The genomic DNA of the strains was extracted for multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The fecal toxin, strain isolation, and clinical patient characteristics, including co-infection with other pathogens, were analyzed. Results: Among the 388 fecal samples, 47 samples with positive reference genes of C. difficile were positive, with a total positive rate of 12.11%. There were 4 (8.51%) non-toxigenic and 43 (91.49%) toxigenic ones. A total of 18 strains C. difficile were isolated from 47 positive specimens, and the isolation rate of positive specimens was 38.30%. Among them, 14 strains were positive for tcdA, tcdB, tcdC, tcdR, and tcdE. All 18 strains of C. difficile were negative for binary toxins. The MLST results showed 10 sequence types (ST), including 5 strains of ST37, accounting for 27.78%; 2 strains of ST129, ST3, ST54, and ST2, respectively; and 1 strain of ST35, ST532, ST48, ST27, and ST39, respectively. Fecal toxin gene positive (tcdB+) results were statistically associated with the patient's age group and with or without fever before the visit; positive isolates were only statistically associated with the patient's age group. In addition, some C. difficile patients have co-infection with other diarrhea-related viruses. Conclusions: The infection of C. difficile in diarrhea patients in Kunming is mostly toxigenic strains, and the high diversity of strains was identified using the MLST method. Therefore, the surveillance and prevention of C. difficile should be strengthened.

TI  - A critical review of methods, principles and progress for estimating the gross primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The gross primary productivity (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems reflects the total amount of organic carbon assimilated by vegetation through photosynthesis per given unit of time and area, which represents the largest carbon flux in carbon budget and plays a fundamental part in the carbon cycle. However, challenges such as determining how to select appropriate methods to improve GPP estimation accuracy at the regional/global scale remain. Therefore, it is of great importance to comprehensively review the research progress on the methods for estimating the GPP of terrestrial ecosystems and to summarize their flaws, merits and application fields. In this study, we reviewed studies of GPP estimation at different spatiotemporal scales, and systematically reviewed the principles, formulas, representative methods (Ground observations, Model simulations, SIF based GPP, and NIRv based GPP) at different scales and models (Statistical/Ecological process/Machine learning/Light use efficiency models), as well as the advantages and limitations of each research method/models. A comprehensive comparison of GPP research methods was performed. We expect that this work will provide some straightforward references for researchers to further understand and to choose appropriate models for assessing forest ecosystem GPP according to the research objectives and area. Thus, critical and effective GPP estimation methods can be established for the terrestrial carbon cycle, carbon neutralization accounting and local carbon emission reduction policy formulation and implementation.

TI  - River channel avulsion in the Taquari River megafan of the Brazilian Pantanal: Remote sensing and modeling reveal recent and future changes
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest crevasse in the Taquari River megafan in the Pantanal, Brazil with a perennial flooded area of similar to 500,000 ha, was initiated in 1997 and impacted the environment and people. Here, we spatially characterize and explored a model aiming at predicting the evolution of the rechanneling of the Taquari River within this huge flooded area. Our approach is based on a spatiotemporal dry/wet index (R), which measures the degree of moisture in six major land cover classes. The index was annually estimated from MapBiomas Landsat rasters between 1996 and 2021 and calculated for 142 grid cells (5 x 5 km each). Temporal regressions were then used to predict the state of individual grids in the long term, up to 2080. The results suggest a gradual and slow terrestrialization between 1997 and 2021 as areas returned to pre-avulsion levels, mainly in the eastern and northern limits, closer to the crevasse. Modeling projections suggest that river rechanneling of the Taquari River might be completed by 2080 with its new mouth on the Paraguay-Mirim River. Large areas that are currently aquatic (open water, flooded soils, and flooded vegetation) are predicted to return to terrestrial state (forests and pastures) in the long term.

TI  - Mapping the benefits and the exchange values of provisioning ecosystem services using GIS and local ecological knowledge in a high-Andean community
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services and their contribution to local economies and livelihoods still need to be fully understood and recognized by many policymakers. The primary purpose of this research is to integrate land use and land cover data and local ecological knowledge-based data with geographical information systems through a participatory approach to enhance natural resource management. We selected the Pariac-Rajucolta watershed as a study area because it is a typical landscape in the high-Andean mountains, with half of its territory inside a protected area. The methods involved a six-month participatory approach quantifying the benefits and exchange values of 33 provisioning ecosystem services, compiling the primary data from the locals and spectral information from Sentinel-2A. The results show that only agricultural and artificial areas delivered multiple benefits and offered the highest commercialization value of ecosystem ser-vices. The community mainly benefits from nutrition, materials, or energy from cultivated terrestrial plants, reared animals, wild plants, and surface water at the watershed level. At the same time, the services with high exchange proportions were mainly short-only meat of guinea pigs, manure, wild fruits, mushrooms, and wild plants for food. The abundance and the spatial distribution of benefits and exchange values of ecosystem services displayed a pattern of high quantity for the downstream and low in the basin's top and midstream of the watershed (inside the protected area). In conclusion, the study shows the importance of knowing ecosystem services benefits and exchange values as an initial approach to developing participatory strategies for managing and conserving natural resources.

TI  - Monitoring for fentanyl within Australian supervised injecting facilities: Findings from feasibility testing of novel methods and collaborative workshops
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Australia is yet to see widespread fentanyl-contaminated heroin, despite the established presence of fentanyl in other countries. International mortality trends alongside a local cluster of fentanyl-related deaths prompted interest in developing methods to monitor for fentanyl and other potentially harmful novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in Australia.Methods: We tested novel methods to monitor for fentanyl and other NPS. From 2017-2021, clients from super-vised injecting facilities (SIFs) in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, contributed urine screens (UDS) with BTNX Rapid ResponseTM fentanyl test strips (FTS) paired with surveys, and injecting equipment associated with opioid overdoses for laboratory analysis. A single site piloted drug checking using FTS with laboratory confirmation. Two workshops were conducted with SIF staff, content experts and people with lived experience to determine how results can inform practices within SIFs.Results: Of the 911 UDS with FTS conducted, less than 1% (n =8) yielded positive results that were not explained by self-reported pharmaceutical fentanyl use, with two laboratory confirmed fentanyl positive results. Injecting equipment from 59 overdoses was tested and neither fentanyl nor other NPS were identified. Drug checking with FTS (n =34) indicated the presence of fentanyl on three tests. Two specimens were subsequently sent for laboratory testing and classified as false positives as the presence of fentanyl was not confirmed. Workshop participants (n =21) felt routine monitoring with FTS currently had limited value. A process for using pre-defined signals to trigger surveillance was developed.Conclusion: The high false positive rates with FTS, relative to the small number of positive results and potential for them to undermine confidence in FTS emphasised the need for confirmatory testing. The role of routine surveillance was unclear within the current low-fentanyl context, however, a process was developed to upscale testing should signals of increased fentanyl prevalence in the Australian heroin market emerge.

TI  - Glacier structure influence on Himalayan ice-front morphology
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the role of glacier structures in controlling ice-front morphology and dynamics of four Himalayan lake-terminating glaciers over a 20-year period. At Imja, Trakarding, Lumdin and Dang Pu glaciers, lake area was mapped between 2000 and 2020 using Landsat 5/7/8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Discrete glacier flow units were identified, with glacier structures (e.g., open crevasses, transverse structures, longitudinal structures) digitised using the finest resolution panchromatic bands in each year (30, 15, or 10 m). Mapping revealed a distinct pattern of transverse structures towards the terminus of each glacier that influence ice-front position and morphology and are then exploited via iceberg calving events. Our structural analysis also illustrates the role of subsurface conduits in calving events. During subsurface conduit collapse, glacier recession is enhanced, leading to calving along adjacent transverse structures. Furthermore, our analysis shows that ice-front morphology influences the pattern of glacier recession. Ice fronts with distinct ice aprons undergo slower periods of recession than ice fronts with ice cliffs. We conclude that glacier structures are important in determining ice-front morphologies at lake-terminating Himalayan glaciers, and therefore, structural analysis is vital when assessing future ice-front positions and behaviour, as well as rates of glacier recession.

TI  - Multi-source datasets acquired over Toulouse (France) in 2021 for urban microclimate studies during the CAMCATT/AI4GEO field campaign
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The CAMCATT-AI4GEO extensive field experiment took place in Toulouse, a city in the southwest of France, from 14th to 25th June 2021 (with complementary measurements per-formed on the 6 September 2021). Its main objective was the acquisition of a new reference dataset on an urban site to support the development and validation of data prod-ucts from the future thermal infrared (TIR) satellite missions such as TRISHNA (CNES/ISRO), LSTM (ESA) and SBG (NASA). With their high spatial (between 30-60m) and temporal (2-3 days) resolutions, the future TIR satellite data will allow a better investigation of the urban climate at the neighbour-hood scale. However, in order to validate the future prod-ucts of these missions such as LST, air temperature, com-fort index and Urban Heat Island (UHI), there is a need to accurately characterise the organisation of the city in terms of 3D geometry, spectral optical properties and both land surface temperature and emissivity (L ST and L SE) at sev-eral scales. In this context, the CAMCATT-AI4GEO field cam-paign provides a set of airborne VISNIR-SWIR (Visible Near InfraRed -ShortWave InfraRed) hyperspectral imagery, mul-tispectral thermal infrared (TIR) imagery and 3D LiDAR ac-quisitions, together with a variety of ground data collected, for some of them, simultaneously to the flight. The ground dataset includes surface reflectance measured spectrally with ASD spectroradiometers and in six spectral bands spreading from shortwave to thermal infrared and for two viewing an-gles with a SOC410-DHR handheld reflectometer. It is com-pleted with LST and LSE retrieved from thermal infrared radi-ance acquired in six spectral bands with CIMEL radiometers. It also includes meteorological data coming from four radio soundings (one of which was taken during the flight), data routinely collected at the Blagnac airport reference station as well as air temperature and humidity acquired using instru-mented cars following two different itineraries. In addition, a link is provided to access the data routinely collected by the network of weather stations set up by Toulouse Metropole in the city and its surroundings. This data paper describes this new reference urban dataset which can be useful for many applications such as calibration/validation of at-surface radi-ance, L ST and L SE data products as well as higher level prod-ucts such as air temperature or comfort index. It also pro-vides valuable opportunities for other applications in urban climate studies, such as supporting the validation of micro -climate models. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Surgeon Factors Influencing Breast Surgery Outcomes: A Scoping Review to Define the Modern Breast Surgical Oncologist
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundModern breast surgical oncology incorporates many aspects of care including preoperative workup, surgical management, and multidisciplinary collaboration to achieve favorable oncologic outcomes and high patient satisfaction. However, there is variability in surgical practice and outcomes. This review aims to identify modifiable surgeon factors influencing breast surgery outcomes and provide a definition of the modern breast surgical oncologist.MethodsA systematic literature search with additional backward citation searching was conducted. Studies describing modifiable surgeon factors with associated breast surgery outcomes such as rates of breast conservation, sentinel node biopsy, re-excision, complications, acceptable esthetic outcome, and disease-free and overall survival were included. Surgeon factors were categorized for qualitative analysis.ResultsA total of 91 studies met inclusion criteria describing both modifiable surgeon factor and outcome data. Four key surgeon factors associated with improved breast surgery outcomes were identified: surgical volume (45 studies), use of oncoplastic techniques (41 studies), sub-specialization in breast surgery or surgical oncology (9 studies), and participation in professional development activities (5 studies).ConclusionsOn the basis of the literature review, the modern breast surgical oncologist has a moderate- to high-volume breast surgery practice, understands the use and application of oncoplastic breast surgery, engages in additional training opportunities, maintains memberships in relevant societies, and remains up to date on key literature. Surgeons practicing in breast surgical oncology can target these modifiable factors for professional development and quality improvement.

TI  - Effects of land-use changes on the conservation of re-introduced toads, <i>Nectophrynoides asperginis</i>
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC) are a global threat to biodiversity conservation including endemic species such as Kihansi spray toads (KST). This study assessed the LULCC of the Kihansi catchment (KC), a potential habitat for the KST and its adjacent areas. Remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) through Landsat imagery and ground truthing were used to classify and monitor LULCC for 25 years, from 1995 to 2020. In addition, the questionnaire survey assesses the opinion of local communities on LULCC forms in the study area. Settlements and agricultural land increased by 26.23% and 3.7%, respectively, while forested land decreased by a rate of 10%-20% per year due to the human population increase. According to this study, land use has changed substantially because of agriculture and habitation. Proper land-use planning is required in this scenario to ensure the long-term protection of the reintroduced KST while also enhancing the livelihoods of nearby residents.

TI  - A hybrid radioactive and fluorescence approach is more than the sum of its parts; outcome of a phase II randomized sentinel node trial in prostate cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the diagnostic accuracy of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Technetium-99 m(Tc-99m)-nanocolloid compared to sequential tracers of Tc-99m-nanocolloid and free-ICG in detecting tumor-positive lymph nodes (LN) during primary surgery in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.IntroductionImage-guided surgery strategies can help visualize individual lymphatic drainage patterns and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in PCa patients. For lymphatic mapping radioactive, fluorescent and hybrid tracers are being clinically exploited. In this prospective randomized phase II trial, we made a head-to-head comparison between ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (hybrid group) and Tc-99m-nanocolloid and subsequent free-ICG injection (sequential group).MethodsPCa patients with a >5% risk of lymphatic involvement according to the 2012 Briganti nomogram and planned for prostatectomy were included and randomized (1:1) between ultrasound-guided intraprostatic tracer administration of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (n = 69) or Tc-99m-nanocolloid (n = 69) 5 h before surgery. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were performed to define the locations of the SLNs. Additionally, all participants in the sequential group received an injection of free-ICG at time of surgery. Subsequently, all (S)LNs were dissected using fluorescence guidance followed by an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). The primary outcome was the total number of surgically removed (S)LNs and tumor-positive (S)LNs.ResultsThe total number of surgically removed (S)LN packages was 701 and 733 in the hybrid and sequential groups, respectively (p = 0.727). The total number of fluorescent LNs retrieved was 310 and 665 nodes in the hybrid and sequential groups, respectively (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the corresponding number of tumor-positive nodes among the groups (44 vs. 33; p = 0.470). Consequently, the rate of tumor-positive fluorescent LNs was higher in the hybrid group (7.4%) compared to the sequential group (2.6%; p = 0.002), indicating an enhanced positive predictive value for the hybrid approach. There was no difference in complications within 90 days after surgery (p = 0.78).ConclusionsThe hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid improved the positive predictive value for tumor-bearing LNs while minimizing the number of fluorescent nodes compared to the sequential tracer approach. Consequently, the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid enables the most reliable and minimal invasive method for LN staging in PCa patients.

TI  - Crisscrossing scapes in the global flow of elite mainland Chinese students
T2  - HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper applies Appadurai's notion of scapes in globalisation to study international student mobility. Thirty mainland Chinese students were interviewed; the majority of whom studied at prestigious institutions in the West before enrolling in their current PhD programmes at a research-intensive university in Hong Kong (HK) in the immediate aftermath of HK's large-scale social protests and amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. We seek to understand why these students relocated to HK to further their studies given these turbulent circumstances and how their mainlander identity and sojourns in the West influence their perceptions of HK's social movements from the perspectives of ethnoscape and ideoscape, respectively. Our findings reveal that HK represented the 'best' compromise for our participants, mitigating their nostalgia for home (i.e. mainland China) whilst offering a superior education to the Chinese mainland. Most participants perceived HK as a nationalistic ideoscape, wherein HK people's pursuit of autonomy is subordinated to the putative Chinese national interests. Moreover, ethnoscape and ideoscape dynamics were found to crisscross other scapes. Generous scholarships (i.e. financescape) provided additional incentives driving student relocations. The persistent consumption of Chinese social media (techno-mediascape) was found to have resulted in worldview conformity between our participants and the Chinese state.

T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimTo study the prevalence, birth, and clinical characteristics of children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP) in Norway compared with spastic quadriplegic CP and other spastic CP subtypes. MethodData on children born from 1996 to 2015 were collected from the Norwegian Quality and Surveillance Registry for Cerebral Palsy and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. ResultsOne hundred and seventy (6.8%) children had dyskinetic CP. The birth prevalence decreased during 1996 to 2015 from 0.21 to 0.07 per 1000 livebirths (p < 0.001). Dyskinetic CP was more often associated with term/post-term birth, and motor and associated impairments were more severe compared with spastic bilateral and unilateral CP, but less severe than spastic quadriplegic CP. On neuroimaging, grey matter injuries were most prevalent in dyskinetic CP (mainly basal ganglia/thalamus) and spastic quadriplegic CP (mainly cortico-subcortical), white matter injuries in spastic bilateral, and white and grey matter injuries were equally common in spastic unilateral CP. Normal neuroimaging and brain maldevelopment were present in 25% of children with dyskinetic CP. InterpretationThe decrease in birth prevalence of dyskinetic CP was probably due to improved antenatal and perinatal care. Potential sentinel events at term were more common in dyskinetic CP than other spastic CP subtypes. However, probable antenatal aetiologies were most prevalent. Motor and associated impairments were less severe in children with dyskinetic CP compared with spastic quadriplegic CP.

TI  - Probabilities of acquiring cloud-free and low-tide Landsat observations for mapping saltmarsh over south-eastern Bangladesh from 1980 to 2019
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - As is well-documented, cloud cover (CC) obscures the target object and water depth and turbidity impede optical remote sensing (RS). Therefore, Landsat imagery acquired under cloud-free (CFI) and low-tide (LTI) conditions are considered 'quality' observations when mapping tidal wetlands such as saltmarsh. Although it is essential to estimate probabilities of acquiring at least one CFI and LTI, previous studies rarely addressed in RS of saltmarsh land cover (SLC). In order to evaluate the probabilities of acquiring at least one CFI and LTI in a year, a month, a season, a pair of seasons, or a certain time interval within a year over south-eastern Bangladesh, all images acquired between 1988 and 2019 were examined. The results indicate that SLC applications are generally affected by CC and tide heights; an average yearly CF probability of 16% can be acquired under LT conditions. Seasonal variations in CFI are apparent and there is a significant shortage of clear observation during the monsoon. The higher number of CFI may not guarantee a higher probability of LTI due to tide dynamics. The availability of both CFI and LTI can be remarkably improved if the present 16-day interval time of Landsat's acquisition is increased.

TI  - Mapping nighttime PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Nanjing, China based on NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine inhalable particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the major air pollutants that affect human health and the environment. Detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of PM2.5 is meaningful for the prevention and control of air pollution. Satellite remote sensing has become an effective way to observe PM2.5 concentrations. However, most studies have focused on mapping PM2.5 concentrations from satellite-derived daytime aerosol optical depth (AOD), which cannot effectively depict the nighttime atmospheric environment. This paper aims to develop a method to derive nighttime PM2.5 concentrations in Nanjing, China, using the National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light remote sensing data during September-December 2020. The relationship between the satellite at-sensor radiance, PM2.5 concentrations and other environmental factors was first explored based on the nighttime radiative transfer equation. Taking into account the pixel direct radiation and the background scattered radiation, the spatial independent variables for estimating nighttime PM2.5 were determined. Five machine learning algorithms and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to develop models to estimate nighttime PM2.5 concentrations. The results showed that the MLR model had obviously lower accuracy than the machine learning models, and the RF model outperformed the other models, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.85 mu g.m(-3). Then, the developed model was applied to map the nighttime PM2.5 concentrations over Nanjing, which well characterized the nighttime atmospheric environment at a fine resolution. This paper proposes a method to map nighttime PM2.5 concentrations from nighttime light remote sensing data and provides references for monitoring nighttime atmospheric environments in other regions.

TI  - A remote sensing data transmission strategy based on the combination of satellite-ground link and GEO relay under dynamic topology
T2  - FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The low earth orbit (LEO) remote sensing satellite has a short communication time with the earth station (ES), and a large amount of remote sensing data cannot be transmitted back to the ES in time using the LEO-ES link during the communication period. Using relay satellites can indirectly increase the amount of data transmitted back from LEO. In this paper, we combine LEO-ES link and relay satellite offloading to study the problem of maximizing the amount of data transmitted back from LEO remote sensing satellites. Most of the existing methods do not consider the effect of topology change on policy. In this paper, we consider a three-layer satellite network architecture of geostationary earth orbit (GEO), LEO remote sensing satellite, and ES. We studied the problem of maximizing the amount of LEO transmitted back data under dynamic topology between layers, and proposed a transmission strategy based on a combination of LEO-ES link and GEO offload under dynamic topology. First, in order to reduce the number of link interruptions in each time slot, a Non-Uniform Time Slot Division Method (NUTSDM) based on visible relationships between layers is proposed based on discrete-time points, which helps to accurately determine the number and identity of LEOs competing under each time slot. Second, the relationship among GEOs, LEOs, and network administrators is modeled as a Stackelberg game model, and a Two-way Bargaining Game Scheme under Dynamic Topology (TWBGS-DT) is proposed to maximize the amount of data transmitted back from space. Compared with the existing methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of algorithm convergence speed, terms of pricing, GEO cache space allocation, and increase the data volume of LEO transmissions back by 11.5% and 8.2 times relative to the ISL-Aided strategy and GAA-FARR strategy, respectively.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An inversion method of subsurface thermohaline field based on deep learning and remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Seawater temperature and salinity are basic marine environmental parameters, which can be used to calculate other marine environmental parameters. However, most of the on-site observation data have the problems of uneven spatial distribution and time discontinuity, and it is difficult for remote sensing observation methods to obtain subsurface information. In this study, we proposed a deep learning model with combining remote sensing temperature and salinity as well as in-situ measured data by Argo profiles, and the nonlinear relationship was revealed. An effective and direct inversion method was realized for underwater three-dimensional thermohaline structure based on remote sensing temperature and salinity at accurate points on global scale. The SST data were obtained from the FY3C-VIRR daily sea surface temperature product, the SSS data were acquired from the SMAP Level 3 8-day running averages sea surface salinity product, and the Argo scatter data were got from the 'Global Ocean Argo Scatter Data Set'. Based on the temporal and spatial location information of the data, this paper matched the remote sensing data from 2016 to 2019 with the Argo data, 64751 valid pairing points were obtained. The deep learning model was constructed as a multilayer perceptron model with 5 hidden layers. The RMSE of temperature had a maximum value of 2.106 degrees C in 130 m depth and a minimum value of 0.367 degrees C in 1000 m with an average of 1.174 degrees C for validation dataset. And the RMSE of salinity had a maximum value of 0.356 psu in 0 m and a minimum value of 0.045 psu in 1000 m with an average of 0.202 psu. Compared with other methods based on fixed mesh products, this study realized a direct inversion method at any location in the global ocean and improved the inversion accuracy, which provides a reliable data support for refined marine monitoring.

TI  - Marine debris detection using a multi-feature pyramid network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Marine Debris is the submerged and floating litter that majorly consists of plastics or other manmade polymers that are either intentionally discarded or unknowingly lost along shores of beaches, rivers or other waterbodies. Significant water pollution is caused due to such untreated waste released into the oceans, specifically in the coastal regions. The recent years have seen an immense rise in marine debris, which has created a necessity to reduce the amount of human effort and led to an increase in the demand for automatic marine debris detection. This paper proposes a multi-feature pyramid network (MFPN) of three subnetworks feature extractor, feature pyramid and pooling block that are concatenated to form a single end-to-end network for the task of automatic marine debris detection from multispectral imagery. Further, the feature extractor network is initialized with the pre-trained weights of Resnet-101 to achieve high performance with lower computational resources and normalization is used to reduce the bias of the model. The proposed model is tested on the Sentinel-2-based marine debris benchmark dataset MARIDA and outperforms the state-of-the-art architectures in the field by reporting an mIOU, Pixel Accuracy and F1-Score of 0.71, 0.84 and 0.80, respectively.

TI  - Multicolor and multi-spot observations of Starlink's Visorsat
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides the results of simultaneous multicolor observations for the first Visorsat (STARLINK-1436) and the ordinary Starlink satellite (STARLINK-1113) in the U, B, V, g, r, i, RC, IC, z, J, H, and K-s bands to quantitatively investigate the extent to which Visorsat reduces its reflected light. Our results are as follows: (1) in most cases, Visorsat is fainter than STARLINK-1113, and the sunshade on Visorsat therefore contributes to the reduction of the reflected sunlight; (2) the magnitude at 550 km altitude (normalized magnitude) of both satellites often reaches the naked-eye limiting magnitude (<6.0); (3) from a blackbody radiation model of the reflected flux, the peak of the reflected components of both satellites is around the z band; and (4) the albedo of the near-infrared range is larger than that of the optical range. Under the assumption that Visorsat and STARLINK-1113 have the same reflectivity, we estimate the covering factor, Cf, of the sunshade on Visorsat, using the blackbody radiation model: the covering factor ranges from 0.18 <= C-f <= 0.92. From the multivariable analysis of the solar phase angle (Suntarget-observer), the normalized magnitude, and the covering factor, the phase angle versus covering factor distribution presents a moderate anti-correlation between them, suggesting that the magnitudes of Visorsat depend not only on the phase angle but also on the orientation of the sunshade along our line of sight. However, the impact on astronomical observations from Visorsat-designed satellites remains serious. Thus, new countermeasures are necessary for the Starlink satellites to further reduce reflected sunlight.y

TI  - Fine-scale landscape phenology revealed through time-lapse imagery: implications for conservation and management of an endangered migratory herbivore
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Climate change modifies plant phenology through shifts in seasonal temperature and precipitation. Because the timing of plant growth can limit herbivore population dynamics, climatic alteration of historical patterns of vegetation seasonality may alter population trajectories in such taxa. Thus, sound management decisions may depend on understanding how plant growth varies across a landscape within and among distinct management units or protected areas. Here, we examine spatial variation in the timing of spring plant growth, measured using a network of automated time-lapse cameras distributed across the range of endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae) in California, USA. We tracked greenness of individual plants across 2 years to compare spatial patterns of forage phenology in snowy and drought years. Green-up timing was derived for individual plants across the camera network and compared with local estimates of green-up timing from satellite data. Satellite-derived estimates of green-up timing showed strong correspondence with camera-derived estimates in areas with dense vegetation cover and weak correspondence in areas with sparse vegetation cover. Daily time-lapse imagery revealed consistent variation in green-up timing across elevation, both among latitudinal zones and among individual plant species. Green-up timing was earlier in 2020 than in 2019, reflecting differences in the end of the snowy season. Because bighorn forage seasonally on alpine species with a brief growing period, spring migration of bighorn may be linked to variation in snowmelt and plant growth across elevational gradients.

TI  - Deforestation detection using a spatio-temporal deep learning approach with synthetic aperture radar and multispectral images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is a global change driver that contributes to atmospheric carbon emissions, causes biodiversity loss and ecosystem services degradation. Usually, this process has been quantified and monitored using remote sensing. The development of deep learning algorithms, as well as satellite images with a higher spatial and temporal resolution has improved the capabilities to monitor deforestation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of a spatio-temporal deep learning algorithm, the U-Net 3D, with multispectral and synthetic aperture radar images to detect deforestation in a tropical rainforest in Southeast Mexico between 2019 and 2020. The U-Net 3D inputs were 147 squared areas with 256 pixels by side that contained, at least, one deforested area. These inputs consisted of: (1) four cloudless composites (Feb-Apr 2019, May-Sep 2019, Oct 2019-Jan 2020 and Feb-Apr 2020) with six bands each (four Sentinel-2 bands and two Sentinel-1), and (2) deforested area polygons delineated by visual interpretation. This classification had three classes: no deforestation, old-growth forest loss and secondary forest / plantation loss. The classification map obtained an overall accuracy of 0.97 and an average F1-score of 0.94. The corrected area estimates were 3 195.26 +/- 1 132.88 ha (0.48 +/- 0.17 %) for the old-growth forest loss and 4 234.85 +/- 1 912.01 ha (0.64 +/- 0.29 %) for the secondary forest / plantation loss. Most of the classification errors were found in borders between classes, caused by the confusion of secondary forest / plantation loss with herbaceous cover loss or associated with artifacts in the images.

TI  - Gene-environment interaction in the association of residential greenness and 25(OH) vitamin D
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing awareness for beneficial health effects of green space surrounding the home, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood and challenging to study given the correlation with other exposures. Here, the association of residential greenness and vitamin D including a gene-environment interaction is investigated. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured by electrochemiluminescence at ages 10 and 15 years in participants of two German birth cohorts GINIplus and LISA. Greenness was measured using the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in a 500 m buffer surrounding the home. Linear and logistic regression models were applied at both time points adjusted for several covariates (N10Y = 2,504, N15Y = 2,613). In additional analyses vitamin D-related genes, physical activity, time spent outdoors, supplements, and measurement season were investigated as potential confounders or effect modifiers. A 1.5-SD increase in NDVI was significantly associated with increased 25(OH)D values at ages 10 and 15 years (beta 10y = 2.41 nmol/l, p=<0.01; beta 15y = 2.03 nmol/l, p = 0.02). In stratified analyses, the associations were not seen in participants spending more than 5 h/day outside in summer, having a high physical activity level, taking supplements, or being examined during the winter season. In a subset (n =1,732) with genetic data, a significant gene-environment interaction of NDVI with CYP2R1, an upstream gene in 25(OH)D synthesis, was observed at age 10 years. When investigating 25(OH)D sufficiency, defined as values above 50 nmol/l, a 1.5-SD increase in NDVI was associated with significantly higher odds of having sufficient 25 (OH)D levels at age 10 years (OR = 1.48, 1.19-1.83). In conclusion, robust associations between residential greenness and 25 (OH)D levels were observed in children and adolescents independent of other confounders and additionally supported by the presence of a gene-environment interaction. Effects of NDVI were stronger in those having lower vitamin D levels at age 10 years due to their covariate profile or genetically lower 25(OH)D synthesis.

TI  - Monitoring and evaluation of gully erosion in China's largest loess tableland based on SBAS-InSAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is widespread in central China's ecologically fragile loess plateau. However, research on the monitoring and evaluation of large-scale erosion is scarce. Here, we collected 16 pairs of Sentinel-1A images from the rainy season, spanning April 5-October 26, 2019, subsidence is then quantified and its results can indirectly reflect the intensity of erosion on the largest loess plateau in China, the Dongzhiyuan tableland, using small baseline subset synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR). The results showed that, the average erosion rate was 9 mm/year, throughout the study area, Surprisingly, the average erosion rate in the gully reached 160 mm/year, the sides of the gully correspond to the most extensive and intense erosion. Heavy rainfall, slope gradients below 15 degrees, changes in groundwater levels due to freeze-thaw action and water infiltration during rainfall, and lack of vegetation due to continued gully side erosion, drive the intense erosion. These results demonstrate the reliable ability of the SBAS-InSAR method in accurately assessing large-scale gully erosion. The InSAR-calculated subsidence demonstrates a strong predictive capability for soil erosion and is generally consistent with previously observed levels of erosion, although much noise interference also occurs. Therefore, in the future InSAR-calculated sedimentation could be used as an indirect measure of erosion levels at multiple watershed scales.

TI  - Modelling time-series<i> Aedes</i><i> albopictus</i> abundance as a forecasting tool in urban environments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species that can maintain and transmit several arboviruses causing disease in humans. Understanding the determinants of its ecology and population dynamics to predict its abundance was the main objective of this study.Adult mosquitoes were captured weekly between 2009 and 2016 with BG sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure outdoors at a collection site within the urban area of Palermo (southern Italy). In parallel, between 2012 and 2016, we monitored the uninterrupted weekly abundance of Ae. albopictus at four additional sites nearby over an area of about two hectares. Catches were collected three times per week and mosquitoes were identified morphologically.To identify the determinants of mosquito abundance, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average and Poisson regression models were fitted to the weekly abundance of Ae. albopictus with a series of weather predictors that potentially modulate its activity and population dynamics. The time lag of the influence of predictors was analysed to identify the intergenerational environmental determinants of Ae. albopictus population dynamics. A cross-validation of the predictive accuracy of the different models was carried out to select the best predictive model. Over 7 years we captured 12,152 Ae. albopictus in the first trap and another 58,710 in four years of trapping in four additional traps. Aedes albopictus abundance was highly seasonal, with activity between mid-March and late December, highest abundances between July and September, and peak abundances in autumn. The predictive potential of the best model was further externally validated with four years of data from the other four traps, showing a high predictive capacity and a very good fit of seasonality and abundance peaks. Relative humidity, vapour saturation deficit and wind speed were identified as the main determinants of the weekly abundance of Ae. albopictus. The results obtained will allow accurate prediction of the abundance of this invasive mosquito in coastal Mediterranean areas and the design of ad-hoc measures for efficient and environmentally sustainable control.

TI  - [Spatio-temporal Variation in PM2.5 Concentration and Its Relationship with Vegetation Landscape Patterns in Typical Economic Zones in China from 2000 to 2020].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study explored the temporal and spatial variation in PM2.5 concentration and its relationship with the vegetation landscape pattern in three typical economic zones in China, which is of great significance for regional PM2.5pollution control and atmospheric environmental protection. In this study, the pixel binary model, Getis-Ord Gi* analysis, Theil-Sen Median analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple correlation analysis were used to explore the spatial cluster and spatio-temporal variation in PM2.5 and its correlation with the vegetation landscape index in the three economic zones of China on the basis of PM2.5 concentration data and MODIS NDVI data set. The results showed that PM2.5 in the Bohai Economic Rim was mainly dominated by the expansion of hot spots and the reduction in cold spots from 2000 to 2020. The proportion of cold spots and hot spots in the Yangtze River Delta showed insignificant changes. Both cold and hot spots in the Pearl River Delta had expanded. PM2.5 showed a downward trend in the three major economic zones from 2000 to 2020, and the magnitudes of increasing rates were higher in the Pearl River Delta, followed by those in the Yangtze River Delta and Bohai Economic Rim. From 2000 to 2020, PM2.5 exhibited a downward trend in the context of all vegetation coverage grades, and PM2.5 had most significantly improved within extremely low vegetation coverage in the three economic zones. On the landscape scale, PM2.5 values were mostly correlated with aggregation index in the Bohai Economic Rim, with the largest patch index in the Yangtze River Delta and Shannon's diversity in the Pearl River Delta, respectively. Under the context of different vegetation coverage levels, PM2.5showed the highest correlation with aggregation index in the Bohai Economic Rim, landscape shape index in the Yangtze River Delta, and percent of landscape in the Pearl River Delta, respectively. PM2.5 showed significant differences with vegetation landscape indices in the three economic zones. The combined effect of multiple vegetation landscape pattern indices on PM2.5 was stronger than that of the single vegetation landscape pattern index. The above results indicated that the spatial cluster of PM2.5 in the three major economic zones had changed, and PM2.5 showed a decreasing trend in the three economic zones during the study period. The relationship between PM2.5 and vegetation landscape indices exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity in the three economic zones.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of bio-fertilizer restoration in olive groves affected by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> subsp<i>. pauca</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca (Xfp), has attacked the olive trees in Southern Italy with severe impacts on the olive agro-ecosystem. To reduce both the Xfp cell concentration and the disease symptom, a bio-fertilizer restoration technique has been used. Our study applied multi-resolution satellite data to evaluate the effectiveness of such technique at both field and tree scale. For field scale, a time series of High Resolution (HR) Sentinel-2 images, acquired in the months of July and August from 2015 to 2020, was employed. First, four spectral indices from treated and untreated fields were compared. Then, their trends were correlated to meteo-events. For tree-scale, Very High Resolution (VHR) Pleiades images were selected at the closest dates of the Sentinel-2 data to investigate the response to treatments of each different cultivar. All indices from HR and VHR images were higher in treated fields than in those untreated. The analysis of VHR indices revealed that Oliarola Salentina can respond better to treatments than Leccino and Cellina cultivars. All findings were in agreement with in-field PCR results. Hence, HR data could be used to evaluate plant conditions at field level after treatments, while VHR imagery could be used to optimize treatment doses per cultivar.

TI  - Towards transparent deep learning for surface water detection from SAR imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water detection from SAR imagery has significant values, such as the flood monitoring and environmental protection. Nowadays, significant progress has been achieved in water detection using deep neural network (DNN) methods, but the blackbox behavior incurs many doubts in the performance of deep learning techniques, which undermines its trustworthiness in water detection from SAR imagery. By integrating SAR domain knowledge, DNN and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), an explainable DNN framework for surface water detection is proposed for the first time. This framework includes three parts: the water extraction network containing four backbone networks, the Local and Global Mixed Attribution (LGMA) module for performance evaluation of backbone network, and the Semantic Specific-class Activation Mapping (SSAM) module, which performs geo-visualization for the output layers of high-level features. In the experiment, SAR images from different resolutions and frequency-bands are utilized, which are from millimeter-wave and Sentinel-1 systems. The attribution maps and heatmaps of four backbone networks are assessed towards the final water extraction results. The experiment indicates that the proposed framework can glass-box the decision-making process of DNN in water detection and offer corresponding attribution analytics for given input SAR imagery. This work en-courages other scholars to conduct extensive research on the explanation of DNN in SAR domain, gradually establish the trustworthiness of DNN, and promote the development of DNN in SAR images analytics.

TI  - TRANCO: Thermo radiometric normalization of crop observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type maps are essential for a wide range of applications such as crop monitoring, and yield estimation. In addition, Earth Observation (EO) systems allow robust and timely mapping of the earth's surface, usually based on time-series. Yet, existing crop type maps are either global at coarse spatial resolution, or have a local or regional scope. The reasons for this gap can be linked to the scarcity of global crop type datasets at field level to train the models, their bias towards the Northern Hemisphere, as well as the limited transferability of existing crop type models across different regions. One of the main limitations on the transferability is driven by the phenological shift of the crops' radiometric time series detected by Earth Observation (EO) systems, which is mainly induced by the different climates across regions. In this study, we explore the normalization of EO-based wheat time series with the accumulation of Growing Degree Days (GDD): the Thermo-RAdiometric Normaliza-tion of Crop Observations (TRANCO) system. The TRANCO system is based on the assumption that crop phenology evolution is mainly driven by temperature accumulation, represented by the accumulated GDD from Start of Season (SOS) to End of Season (EOS) dates, derived from a crop calendar. We tested the proposed method to normalize wheat on a database of globally distributed samples, whose results show a great improvement of the GDD F1 score (0.90) compared to a simpler normalization approach based on Time windows defined from SOS calendars (0.87) and a baseline without normalization (0.83).

TI  - Integrating sleep health into resilience research
T2  - STRESS AND HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Sleep is a biological necessity that is a critical determinant of mental and physical well-being. Sleep may promote resilience by enhancing an individual's biological preparedness to resist, adapt and recover from a challenge or stressor. This report analyzes currently active National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants focussed on sleep and resilience, specifically examining the design of studies that explore sleep as a factor that promotes health maintenance, survivorship, or protective/preventive pathways. A search of NIH R01 and R21 research project grants that received funding in Fiscal Years (FY) 2016-2021 and focussed on sleep and resilience was conducted. A total of 16 active grants from six NIH institutes met the inclusion criteria. Most grants were funded in FY 2021 (68.8%), used the R01 mechanism (81.3%), were observational studies (75.0%), and measured resilience in the context of resisting a stressor/challenge (56.3%). Early adulthood and midlife were most commonly studied and over half of the grants focussed on underserved/underrepresented populations. NIH-funded studies focussed on sleep and resilience, or the ways in which sleep can influence an individual's ability to resist, adapt, or recover from a challenging event. This analysis highlights an important gap and the need to expand research focussed on sleep as a promotor of molecular, physiological, and psychological resilience.

TI  - Comparing carbon nanoparticles and indocyanine green for sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: A randomized-controlled single-center trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesTo compare the feasibility and diagnostic value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and indocyanine green (ICG) in endometrial cancer (EC). MethodsThis was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Between August 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022, patients with early-stage EC were assessed for enrollment. All patients underwent SLN mapping with ICG or CNPs +/- pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The detection rate (DR), its impact factors, the sensitivity and the negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN mapping were analyzed. ResultsIn total, 206 patients, with 103 per group, were included. The overall and bilateral DRs of the two groups were comparable without significant differences. There was no difference regarding the distribution of mapped SLNs. The sensitivity was 66.7% for both groups, and the NPVs were not significantly different. Furthermore, the sensitivity and NPV reached 100% when calculated either per hemipelvis or only in patients with bilateral SLN detection. ConclusionsSLN mapping by CNPs in EC is feasible with high DRs and diagnostic accuracy compared with ICG. CNPs might be an alternative to ICG for SLN mapping when near-infrared imaging equipment is lacking, especially in stage IA patients.

TI  - Chilling injury monitoring and intensity identification of dryland maize in Heilongjiang
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDAccurate and timely access to large-scale crop damage information provides an essential reference for responding to agricultural disaster prevention and mitigation needs and ensuring food production security. The present study aimed to reveal the new characteristics of low-temperature cold damage to maize in the context of climate warming. Heilongjiang, one of the provinces with the highest latitude, the most significant climate change and the largest maize production in China, was taken as the study area. We combined meteorological stations and MODIS remote sensing data to spatially identify the occurrence and intensity of cold damage to maize based on the growing season temperature distance level index, as well as to assess the extent of cold damage. RESULTSThe main findings are: (i) The frequency and intensity range of cold damage in the growing season (May to September) in Heilongjiang Province from 1991 to 2020 against climate warming showed a decreasing trend. The average temperature from 1991 to 2000 was 17.777 degrees C, with seven occurrences of maize cold damage years, of which 5 years comprised widespread cold damage and 2 years comprised regional cold damage. The average temperature from 2000 to 2010 was 18.137 degrees C, with cold damage three times, of which 2 years comprised regional cold damage and 1 year comprised widespread cold damage. The average temperature from 2010 to 2020 was 18.130 degrees C, with one maize cold damage year occurring, which comprised regional cold damage. The frequency of maize chilling injury decreased significantly from 1991 to 2020, from 0.23 in 1991-2000 to 0.1 in 2000-2010 and, finally, to 0.03 in 2010-2020. (ii) The good consistency between MODIS_LST data and temperature data from meteorological stations suggests that MODIS_LST data can be used to build a temperature remote sensing estimation model for spatially extensive cold damage monitoring and intensity discrimination. (iii) Taking 2009 as an example of a large-scale cold damage year, the spatial discrimination of maize cold damage intensity shows that the spatial distribution of chilling injury intensity has no obvious geographical features. The intensity of cold damage was mainly mild cold damage. According to administrative regions, the scope of chilling injury was the largest in Mudanjiang City, Heihe City, and Jixi City, accounting for 91.56%, 86.25%, and 84.91%, respectively. The areas with the most extensive range of severe chilling injuries were the Great Khingan Mountains region, Heihe City, Mudanjiang City, Yichun City, and Jixi City. CONCLUSIONIn the context of climate warming, the frequency and intensity range of maize cold damage showed a decreasing trend from 1991 to 2020 in Heilongjiang Province. The results of cold damage identification based on MODIS_LST data are accurate and can improve the spatial accuracy. The results of the present study provide a reference and guidance for dealing with the occurrence and defence of spatially refined cold damage. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nine remote sensing-based surface soil moisture (SSM) estimation models using images from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites were compared. To evaluate these models, we measured SSM at 179 locations in a 50-ha sunflower field . The result showed that the Water Cloud-based model, a semi-empirical regression model, which used the synergy of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 data, was the best model, with an R-2 of 0.73 and RMSE of 0.053 m(3)/m(3). In sum, with the integration of images from multiple satellites, soil moisture maps with suitable spatial resolutions were retrieved that may be used for irrigation planning.

TI  - A new fractal index to classify forest fragmentation and disorder
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextForest loss and fragmentation pose extreme threats to biodiversity. Their efficient characterization from remotely sensed data therefore has strong practical implications. Data are often separately analyzed for spatial fragmentation and disorder, but no existing metric simultaneously quantifies both the shape and arrangement of fragments.ObjectivesWe present a fractal fragmentation and disorder index (FFDI), which advances a previously developed fractal index by merging it with the Renyi information dimension. The FFDI is designed to work across spatial scales, and to efficiently report both the fragmentation of images and their spatial disorder.MethodsWe validate the FFDI with 12,600 synthetic hierarchically structured random map (HRM) multiscale images, as well as several other categories of fractal and non-fractal test images (4880 images). We then apply the FFDI to satellite imagery of forest cover for 10 distinct regions of the Romanian Carpathian Mountains from 2000-2021.ResultsThe FFDI outperformed its two individual components (fractal fragmentation index and Renyi information dimension) in resolving spatial patterns of disorder and fragmentation when tested on HRM classes and other image types. The FFDI thus offers a clear advantage when compared to the individual use of fractal fragmentation index and the Information Dimension, and provided good classification performance in an application to real data.ConclusionsThis work improves on previous characterizations of landscape patterns. With the FFDI, scientists will be able to better monitor and understand forest fragmentation from satellite imagery. The FFDI may also find wider applicability in biology wherever image analysis is used.

TI  - Conception of Human Being in Analytical Idealism: How Human and Cosmos are Interlinked Through Consciousness
T2  - HUMAN AFFAIRS-POSTDISCIPLINARY HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between human and cosmos is still quite a mystery. The ancient intuition about interconnectedness of human and cosmos was replaced by a worldview in which human is part of nature primarily through the continuity of the body with the outer nature. The mind is seen as a unique phenomenon mysteriously emerging from matter. To this mystery responds philosopher Bernardo Kastrup by proposing an ontology that turns the mind-matter relationship on its head: the matter is part of the mind, and not vice versa. This article briefly examines the historical evolution of understanding of the relationship between human and cosmos, introduces the ontology called analytical idealism by B. Kastrup and discusses how idealistic ontology can help us understand our relationship with the cosmos on a deeper level.

TI  - Application of SWAN model for wave forecasting in the southern Baltic Sea supplemented with measurement and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the research was to implement the SWAN wave model powered by meteorological data from the COSMO model in the Baltic area, with particular emphasis on the southern regions where the SWAN model is operational. In the validation of the model, the predictive performance of the formulas was assessed: West-huysen, Komen, Janssen, ST6. The verification of wave forecast quality, obtained with the spectral model, was carried out in two stages. The first step involved selecting the best formula using the adopted parameterizations based on short-term measurement data. After choosing the best physics formula (ST6), the model results were verified with multi-stream (measurement and satellite) data at two points representing the shallow and deep-water zones. In the open sea zone, the model calibrated based on ST6 physics obtained high correlation co-efficients, above 0.95 (only for SARAL they were smaller), and in the coastal zone, the correlation coefficient was above 0.75.

TI  - Time series analysis of the pre-seismic and post-seismic surface deformation of the 2017 Iran-Iraq earthquake derived from Sentinel-1 InSAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A strong earthquake of M-w 7.3 hit the border region between Iran and Iraq on November 12, 2017. Several InSAR-based coseismic inversion studies suggested that the earthquake occurred on a northeast dipping Mountain Front Fault within the Precambrian Arabian basement. In this study, we use multiple ascending and descending pass C-band Sentinel-1 images to study the earthquake's pre- and post-seismic surface displacements. We performed SBAS time series from June 2017 to March 2018 to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the displacement before and after the November event. The pre-seismic time series displacement values range as high as -89 mm in descending pass and -96 mm in ascending pass. The pre-seismic time series analysis reveals subsidence between 84 and 0 days before the earthquake, which might be due to excessive groundwater pumping. The post-seismic displacements showed logarithmic decay, indicating afterslip. Even though the earthquake occurred on a blind reverse fault, we highlight that the post-seismic afterslip is composed of horizontal and vertical deformation components, which can be inferred from the variation in the displacement values of the descending and ascending passes. We believe that the small magnitude earthquakes and the January 2018 Mandali earthquake sequence in the Zagros Mountain region affect the spatiotemporal evolution of the November event afterslip.
