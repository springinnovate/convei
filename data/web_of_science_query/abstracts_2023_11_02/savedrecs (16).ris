TI  - Suspended Particulate Matter Analysis of Pre and During Covid Lockdown Using Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing: A Case Study of Ukai Reservoir
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Presence of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in a waterbody or a river can be caused by multiple parameters such as other pollutants by the discharge of poorly maintained sewage, siltation, sedimentation, flood and even bacteria. In this study, remote sensing techniques were used to understand the effects of pandemic-induced lockdown on the SPM concentration in the lower Tapi reservoir or Ukai reservoir. The estimation was done using Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) having radiometric resolution (12-bit) and a spatial resolution of 30 m. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform was used in this study to generate the products. The GEE is a semi-automated workflow system using a robust approach designed for scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets. An algorithm was deployed, and a time-series (2013-2020) analysis was done for the study area. It was found that the average mean value of SPM in Tapi River during 2020 is lowest than the last seven years at the same time.

TI  - Clustering of Marine Oil-Spill Extent Using Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarimetric Scattering Spectrum
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills pose a significant threat to the maritime ecosystem. Identifying an oil spill is vital to assess its spread and drift to nearby coastal areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are viable for mapping and monitoring marine oil spills. This study proposes a new technique that utilizes the dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 SAR data. The method is based on projecting the 2 x 2 covariance matrix onto distinct random realizations of the normalized scattering configuration. We then obtain the dual-polarimetric spectrum of the scattering-type parameter, ODP. The ODP spectrum is then used in the unsupervised K-means clustering technique to segment oil spills from the rest. The cluster findings are then compared to the accuracies obtained using the standard scattering type parameters from the eigen-decomposition approach (VV, VII) intensities and Otsu thresholding of [H + alpha + A] parameter. We demonstrate the proposed approach by clustering marine oil-spill extent over parts of India, Kuwait, the UAE, and the Mediterranean Sea obtained by Sentinel-1 SAR images. We observed that the clustering accuracy of the proposed technique outperforms the ones obtained from the channel (i.e., VV and VII) intensities, Otsu thresholding of [H + alpha + A] parameter, and the eigendecomposition-based method. The proposed approach improves the overall accuracy by approximate to 8% and approximate to 20% , respectively, over different study areas.

T2  - SOPHIA-COLECCION DE FILOSOFIA DE LA EDUCACION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to critically reflect on the construction of the professional profile of arts and humanities teachers in Higher Education in Ecuador, in order to improve their employability in schools, colleges and institutes. For this reason, the research uses a qualitative, with an exploratory and descriptive nature, that promotes a philosophical and anthropological review to propose a reconceptualization of teaching-learning processes that occur in the subject 'Cultural and Artistic Education' (CAE) of the General Basic Education (GBE) curriculum. As a result, the pedagogical trends of the pre-Hispanic era, the colonial era and from the Republic of the 19th century to the present are described. The statistical estimates published by the Ministry of Education (2021) on the number of Ecuadorian educational institutions that train students in subjects related to the arts in both Basic Education and Unified General Baccalaureate, as well as in specialized institutions and that need teachers are shown. From a complex, transdisciplinary, decolonial and intercultural educational vision, the research proposes eight philosophical and anthropological principles derived from the Sumak Kawsay indigenous Quechua worldview, aimed at building an educational philosophy of teacher training that improves their pedagogical and artistic skills. To conclude, public policies and higher education curricula that guide the professional profile of students who will work as teachers are discussed.

TI  - IDEAS ABOUT MYSTICISM AND MAGIC AS AN EXPRESSION OF SPECIAL FEATURES OF PRIEST PAVEL FLORENSKY'S CHRISTIAN WORLDVIEW
T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines one of the most important features of the religious, philosophical and theological heritage of Priest Pavel Florensky. Despite the large amount of research literature, it remains insufficiently studied. In contrast to a number of other thinkers, elements of mysticism and mystical perceptions in Florensky's works are associated with his direct interest in those realities that pertain to the theory and practice of magic and occultism. The article gives a brief overview of the opinions expressed by the leading researchers of Florensky's legacy, who dealt with this topic. There is a lack of serious developments on this topic after the publication of all Florensky's texts by the early 2010s. The article focuses on the following three aspects. The first is Florensky's concepts, in which his views on mysticism and mystical experience found expression. We identify his beliefs, on the basis of which he considered the mystical experience universal for all periods of human history. The second aspect is the evidence of the mystical experience of Florensky himself. Remarks are made regarding his distinction between the genuine mysticism and false mysticism, as free and not free from the subjective "human factor". The third aspect provides evidence for Florensky's actual attitude to the realities of "magical" relationships in the world, as well as to the theory and practice of occult teachings. It is noted that Florensky was convinced that these realities themselves are spiritually neutral but can be used in various ways by those who have a knowledge of them. The main conclusion is that Florensky, as a Christian thinker, perceived mysticism as a "knowledge of the higher worlds" primarily in its soteriological aspect. The main danger of false mysticism, as well as the practice of "dark" magic and occultism, was, in his opinion, in the unconscious or conscious manifestation of human self-will and human subjectivity.

TI  - Concept of NORTH in Artistic Worldview of Chukotka Poet Victor Keulkut
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to model the concept of the North in Victor Keulkut's artistic worldview as part of the conceptual sphere of Arctic discourse. The authors of the article analyzed the poems of this Chukotka author. The study of artistic concepts enables the identification of the influence of cultural context on the perception of creative individuals. The relevance of this study lies in its inclusion in the paradigm of cognitive-linguistic research. The concept under investigation belongs to the category of discourse-forming concepts. The continuous sampling method was used to select 540 lexical markers, which were then distributed into nine lexical-semantic thematic groups (LSTG): 'Industry' (187 markers), 'Cold' (103), 'Fauna' (77), 'Landscape' (42), 'Climate' (42), 'Sea' (32), 'House' (27), 'Tundra' (18), and 'Flora' (12). The distribution of markers in LSTG was based on criteria of semantic and thematic similarity. Based on the study, a model of the artistic concept of the North in Victor Keulkut's poetry was constructed, with the core formed by the LSTG 'Industry' (187 markers), the near-nuclear zone containing LSTG 'Cold' (103 markers), and the close periphery containing LSTG 'Fauna', 'Landscape', and 'Climate', while the distant periphery was represented by LSTG 'Sea', 'House', and 'Tundra'. In analyzing the structure of the concept of the North, a specific component unique to northern linguistic culture was identified, called 'nordicity', expressing the idea of northern identity.

TI  - Research on the Reception of Darwinism in Slovakia around the Turn of the 19th and 20th Centuries.
T2  - HISTORICKY CASOPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study deals with the reception of Darwin ' s Theory of Evolution in the Slovak national movement around the turn of the 19th and the 20th centuries. The reception of Darwinism is analysed as a phenomenon overhanging the framework of scientific theory and as a component of the all-European discourse, encompassing the worldview, philosophical, sociocultural and political polemics of the second half of the 19th century. The starting point of the analysis is a definition of reception as one of the forms of circulation of knowledge, including not only positive receiving of new ideas, but also their modification or denial. The ideas coming out of Charles Darwin ' s theory were spread predominantly by texts with the character of popularization such as reviews, newspaper and journal articles, pamphlets or books. There was a lack of professional, scientific reception of Darwinism in Slovak publications up to the year 1918, a worldview character of reception was dominant. Authors usually did not limit themselves to factual explanation of evolutional theory and Darwin ' s observations, they combined scientific facts and hypothesis with affective philosophical speculations in efforts to provide universal answers to the questions about the secrets of the origin and the essence of the existence of human beings and nature. The reception of the Slovak intelligentsia was focused on various "Darwinisms", in which Darwin ' s Theory of evolution inspired concepts like the monism of Ernst Haeckel or social Darwinism. The reception of evolutionary theory also influenced political practice and rhetoric. Instrumentalization and ideologization was an accompanying feature of the reception of Darwinian evolutionary theory throughout the European intellectual circles, including those active in the processes of national emancipation, as in the case of the Slovak intelligentsia.

T2  - The Canadian journal of urology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse events in urologic procedures are poorly studied. This study analyzes the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Root Cause Analysis (RCA) data for patient safety adverse events during urologic procedures performed in a VHA operating room (OR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VHA National Center for Patient Safety RCA database was queried for fiscal years 2015-2019 using urologic terms including vasectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, cystectomy, cystoscopy, lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, urethral, TURBT, etc. RCAs for events outside a VHA OR were excluded. Cases were categorized based on type of event.RESULTS: Sixty-eight RCAs were identified for 319,713 urologic procedures. The most common pattern identified was equipment or instrument issue, including broken scopes or smoking light cords, with 22 cases. Eighteen RCAs involved a sentinel event, including 12 retained surgical items (RSI) (surgical sponge, retained guidewire) and 6 wrong site surgeries (WSS) (incorrect laterality, wrong procedure) representing a serious safety event rate of 1 in 17,762 procedures. In addition, 8 RCAs pertained to medical or anesthesia events (incorrect dosing, postoperative myocardial infarction), 7 to pathology errors (missing or mislabeled specimen), 4 to incorrect patient information or consent, and 4 to surgical complications (hemorrhage, duodenal injury). In 2 cases there was inappropriate work up. One case caused a delay in treatment, one case had an incorrect count, and one case identified lack of credentialing.CONCLUSIONS: RCAs of patient safety adverse events occurring during urologic OR procedures highlight the need for targeted quality improvement projects to prevent WSS events, prevent RSI events, and maintain properly functioning equipment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are common in much of the world, this is due to different factors among which climate change and land use stand out. In Mexico they happen every year in different entities. Tabasco is an entity that is periodically flooded, causing losses and negative consequences for the rural, urban, livestock, agricultural and service industries. Consequently, it is necessary to create strategies to intervene effectively in the affected areas. Therefore, different strategies and techniques have been developed to mitigate the damage caused by this phenomenon. Satellite programs provide a large amount of data on the earth's surface as well as geospatial information processing tools that are useful for environmental and forest monitoring, climate change impacts, risk analysis, natural disasters, among others. This paper presents a strategy for the classification of flooded areas using satellite images radar of synthetic aperture and the U-NET neural network. The study area is centered on Los Ri & PRIME;os, region of Tabasco, Mexico. The partial results show that U-NET performs well despite the limited amount in the training samples. As training data and epochs increased, its accuracy increased.

TI  - THE CHANGES OF COASTAL ECOSYSTEM IN EAST SERAM DISTRICT, MALUKU PROVINCE, INDONESIA AND ITS IMPACT ON THE JULUNG-JULUNG FISH<i> (Hemirhamphus</i> sp) RESOURCES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sub-district of East Seram (SBT) is the oldest district in the East Seram Regency, Maluku Province, Indonesia. Ninety percent of this area is covered by the sea with 3 unique tropical coastal ecosystems, namely mangroves, seagrass, and coral reefs. This high productivity ecosystem provides various goods and environmental services in fisheries, tourism, and other industries. One of them is coastal resources such as Julung-julung fish (Half-beak, Hemirhamphus spp) that use this ecosystem for their primary habitat. Unfortunately, little is known about the interaction between Julung-julung and their habitat. This paper aims to assess the changes of the coastal ecosystem of the SBT and their impact on Julung-julung resources. Two satellite images of Landsat-7 ETM+ (2001) and Sentinel-2A (2018) were analyzed to monitor the condition changes of mangrove and seagrass. Six habitat classes of sea, land vegetation, mangrove, dense, medium, and sparse seagrass were classified using isocluster analysis, validated using ground truth data collected during intensive field survey, and then the areas of each habitat class were calculated. From the period of 2001 to 2018, the areas of mangrove and seagrass have decreased from 1401.5 to 1118.8 ha, and from 3183.8 to 2509.4 ha, respectively. The decrease of mangroves was due to mangrove cutting for firewood that use to smoke Julung-julung, one of the famous fish products from the SBT, while mining dead coral for building materials in seagrass beds decreased their areas. Interview with experienced SBT's fishers in catching Julung-julung showed that the population of this fish has decreased by about 30-50% within 20 years, which was most likely due to the impact of their habitat degradation. In contrast, the decrease of Julung-julung stocks in other province was mostly due to overfishing. Thus, maintaining, conserving, and revitalizing the mangrove and seagrass ecosystems in the SBT as the important habitat for the early life history of Julungjulung is inevitable, as well as it is necessary to immediately conduct in-depth study on biological and population dynamics of this fish, whose data is still lacking, so that the Julungjulung stocks can manage sustainably.

TI  - Neo-paganism in Alain de Benoist: analysis of an ideological restructuring of the european radical right
T2  - POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the growth of the contemporary radical right in Europe, this article seeks to carry out an-in-depth and contextualised analysis of one of the most relevant ideological structures of today, the neo-pagan vision postulated by the French philosopher and founder of the Nouvelle Droite, Alain de Benoist. After exposing the theoretical intertwining of paganism with the articulation of the worldview of the post-World War II radical right, we proceed to an analysis of the main theses defended in the articulation of paganism. In this sense, special attention is paid not only to the exposition of the theses, but also to the justification and the thread of thought that leads Alain de Benoist to his conclusions. It is concluded that this author's pagan approach represents a conscious and revolutionary attempt to restructure the radical right ideologically after 1945, unifying a good part of the classical thinkers of the radical right under a new perspective in pursuit of the creation of a new moral ethic that aims to serve as the basis for the constitution of a society based on hierarchy, communitarianism and the defence of particular cultures in the face of multiculturalism. Finally, the great relevance of the approaches of paganism in shaping the worldview of the European radical right is presented.

TI  - Towards Unified Online-Coupled Aerosol Parameterization for the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM): Aerosol-Cloud Microphysical-Radiation Interactions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we report the ongoing implementation of online-coupled aerosol-cloud microphysical-radiation interactions in the Brazilian global atmospheric model (BAM) and evaluate the initial results, using remote-sensing data for JFM 2014 and JAS 2019. Rather than developing a new aerosol model, which incurs significant overheads in terms of fundamental research and workforce, a simplified aerosol module from a preexisting global aerosol-chemistry-climate model is adopted. The aerosol module is based on a modal representation and comprises a suite of aerosol microphysical processes. Mass and number mixing ratios, along with dry and wet radii, are predicted for black carbon, particulate organic matter, secondary organic aerosols, sulfate, dust, and sea salt aerosols. The module is extended further to include physically based parameterization for aerosol activation, vertical mixing, ice nucleation, and radiative optical properties computations. The simulated spatial patterns of surface mass and number concentrations are similar to those of other studies. The global means of simulated shortwave and longwave cloud radiative forcing are comparable with observations with normalized mean biases <= 11% and <= 30%, respectively. Large positive bias in BAM control simulation is enhanced with the inclusion of aerosols, resulting in strong overprediction of cloud optical properties. Simulated aerosol optical depths over biomass burning regions are moderately comparable. A case study simulating an intense biomass burning episode in the Amazon is able to reproduce the transport of smoke plumes towards the southeast, thus showing a potential for improved forecasts subject to using near-real-time remote-sensing fire products and a fire emission model. Here, we rely completely on remote-sensing data for the present evaluation and restrain from comparing our results with previous results until a complete representation of the aerosol lifecycle is implemented. A further step is to incorporate dry deposition, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging, sedimentation, the sulfur cycle, and the treatment of fires.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolutions of Ecological Environment Quality and Ecological Resilience Pattern in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological environment quality and resilience assessment is an important prerequisite for ensuring the coordination and stability of socio-economic development and eco-environment protection. Remote sensing technology has provided new approaches for quantitatively evaluating regional ecological environment quality and resilience rapidly, accurately, and objectively. Taking the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREBML) as an example, to assess ecological environment quality, this study calculated the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the Google Earth Engine using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with a spatial resolution of 500 m during 2000-2020. An evaluation index to assess ecological resilience and its spatial pattern based on the RSEI of 2000-2020 was then constructed. The evaluation index was constructed from two dimensions, including the sensitivity and adaptability of the RSEI. Finally, this study identified key factors that affect ecological residence based on a structural equation model. The results showed that the overall RSEI was at moderate and good levels in the YREBML during 2000-2020, accounting for more than 85% of the total area. Its spatial characteristics showed that the RSEI was higher in the middle reaches than in the lower reaches of the YREB, and higher in the south than in the north. The overall RSEI in the YREBML showed a decreasing trend during 2000-2020, with 54.36% of the region improving and 45.64% declining. Areas with declining RSEI were concentrated in Anhui, while the increasing RSEI was observed in Zhejiang. In addition, the spatial pattern of ecological resilience was characterized by high resilience in the north and east, and low resilience in the south and west. High resilience areas accounted for 40.48% of the YREBML, mainly contributed by Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. The driving factors analysis results indicated that economic development, natural disaster risk, and environmental pollution would further affect ecological resilience of urban systems. This study provides more scientific and effective data support for ecological environment monitoring and governance.

TI  - PSCF-Net: Deeply Coupled Feedback Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening tasks are the fusion of a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Recently, the pansharpening method based on deep learning (DL) has received widespread attention because of its powerful fitting ability and efficient feature extraction. Since there is currently no method to make full use of different levels of feature information of PAN images to deeply fuse with MS images, we propose a new end-to-end deeply coupled feedback network to achieve high-quality image fusion at the feature level and this network named PSCF-Net. First, features are extracted from PAN images and MS images by different feature extraction blocks. Then, these features are deeply fused through two subnetworks composed of coupled feedback blocks, which can achieve high-quality fusion of features of different levels and images through coupling and feedback mechanisms. Finally, the feature maps of the two subnetworks are output as the final HRMS image through a channel integration layer. To make full use of the spatial information of PAN images and the spectral information of LRMS images, the extracted features include the features of MS images and the low- and high-level features of PAN images, and the low-level features of PAN images are injected with spectral information before being input to the subnetwork. At training time, we use SmoothL1 combined with structural similarity as the loss function in the network, and we experiment on the IKONOS and WorldView-2 datasets, respectively. The experimental results of reduced- and full-scale show that the deeply coupled feedback network we propose is superior to some of the current popular traditional methods and DL-based methods.

TI  - Coseismic Deformation and Fault Inversion of the 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms 7.0 Earthquake: Constraints from Steerable Pyramid and InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 8 August 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake was generated in the transition zone between the Tazang fault, Huya fault, and Minjiang fault, all being part of the East Kunlun fault system. In this study, two pairs of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data from Sentinel-1 satellite were used to derive the surface displacement observations along the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) directions using the differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) method. A steerable pyramid filtering method (i.e., a method for a linear multiscale, multidirectional decomposition and filtering technology) was proposed to optimize and enhance the geological features from interferometric image and coseismic deformation field. The 3D deformation was derived under the constraint of the combined D-InSAR and MAI method. The small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) time series method was used to obtain the cumulative deformation across the fault system. Fault slip inversion results from interferogram of InSAR indicate that the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake was dominated by left-lateral slip, the surface movement was dominated by horizontal deformation, the vertical deformation was small, and the coseismic deformation variable in the east-west direction was the largest, with a maximum deformation of 0.2 m to the east and 0.14 m to the west. The maximum slip is about 77 cm, which is located at a depth of 9 km. The moment magnitude obtained by inversion is Mw 6.6, and the seismic fault is the Huya fault.

TI  - Estimating the Water Deficit Index of a Mediterranean Holm Oak Forest From Landsat Optical/Thermal Data: A Phenomenological Correction for Trees Casting Shadow Effects
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (Ts) integrated in contextual evapotranspiration models can be used to derive the water stress level of forests. One difficulty of such models implemented over forests is related to the impact of trees casting shadows on the remotely sensed Ts, which potentially hide the water stress signature. Until now, there has been no method to correct for this effect at the spatial resolution of current (Landsat) thermal sensors. This study investigates the impact of the solar zenith angle as a proxy of trees casting shadows on the water deficit index (WDI), using Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 data over a 21-km(2) area partially covered by a holm oak forest in South-eastern France, for 7 successive summers (2015 to 2021). Results are compared to in situ evaporative fraction (EF) measurements. First, a calibration of the correction of WDI for shadow effects correlates the WDI error (WDI minus 1-EF) with the solar zenith angle. The correction improves the correlation (R) and slope between WDI and 1-EF, from R=0.32 to R=0.62 and slope=0.21 to slope=0.63, for non-corrected and corrected WDI respectively. Second, a calibration of the correction method that does not rely on in situ measurements, evaluates the linear relationship between remotely sensed WDI and the solar zenith angle in dry conditions. The correction improves the correlation and slope between WDI and 1-EF, from R=0.32 to R=0.57 and slope=0.21 to slope=0.50, for non-corrected and corrected WDI respectively.

AB  - Arboviral surveillance is a critical step in any effective mosquito control program. Surveillance aids in the early detection of pathogen transmission as well as establishes a baseline of transmission activity. Two of the most practical forms of arboviral surveillance is through the use of testing mosquito pools for the presence of pathogen and screening sentinel chickens for pathogen exposure. This chapter describes the process for each of these methods for West Nile virus.

TI  - Mapping threatened canga ecosystems in the Brazilian savanna using U-Net deep learning segmentation and Sentinel-2 images: a first step toward conservation planning
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Canga ecosystems are iron-rich habitats and pose a challenge for conservation and environmental governance in Brazil. They support high levels of biodiversity and endemism and, at the same time, have suffered intense losses and degradation due to large-scale iron ore mining. The Peixe Bravo River Valley in the Brazilian savanna is one of the last natural canga areas that has yet to face the irreversible impacts of mining. However, there are vast gaps in data on the vegetation cover, location, spatial distribution, and area of occurrence of this ecosystem. Therefore, more information is needed on the appropriate scale, without which it is difficult to establish conservation planning and strategies to prevent, mitigate or compensate for impacts on canga ecosystems. In this study, we provide the first map of canga ecosystems in Brazil using the U-Net deep learning model and Sentinel-2 images. In addition, we estimate the degree of direct threat faced by ecosystems due to the spatial overlap of the mapped cangas and the location of mining concession areas for iron ore exploitation. The deep learning algorithm identified and segmented 762 canga patches (overall accuracy of 98.5%) in an area of 30,000 ha in the Peixe Bravo River Valley, demonstrating the high predictive power of the mapping approach. We conclude that the direct threat to canga ecosystems is high since 99.6% of the observed canga patches are included in mining concession areas. We also highlight that the knowledge acquired about the distribution of cangas through the application of an effective method of artificial intelligence and the use of open-source satellite images is especially important for supporting conservation strategies and environmental public policies.

TI  - Monitoring sedimentary areas from mine waste products with Sentinel-2 satellite images: A case study in the SE of Spain
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Torrential rainfall regimes, among others, are the origin of accelerated soil erosion. The Spanish southeastern Mediterranean region is characterised by an arid climate regime affected by extreme erosion episodes with an important loss of sediments. Soil erosion effects are even more noticeable in areas where soil has been anthropically degraded, as in the mining district of Sierra Minera de Cartagena. The present research focuses on monitoring and mapping the changes in the sediment distribution of iron oxides and hydroxyl (OH-) bearing minerals caused by a cold drop known in Spanish as 'DANA' in September 2019 on the Rambla del Beal. This short rambla is fed by sediments from its drainage basin and by mining residues, irrigating a wide agricultural area. When discharges overflow the rambla channel, residues spread over its floodplain and reach the ecological protected coastal lagoon Mar Menor. The objective of the study was mapping the mineral distribution of the mining materials eroded from the source areas and sedimented in Rambla del Beal during a DANA. The study was carried out using a pre- and a post-DANA image from the Sentinel-2 satellite. After masking vegetation, urban areas and water bodies, different band ratios (B4/B3, B11/B12, B8A/B6) and a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classification were applied. Sediment deposits were identified in wider areas after the DANA. Iron oxides increased their extension by 11.08% in the central area (B3/B4 with R-2 of 0.84) and hydroxyl-bearing minerals increased by 8.95% in the Rambla del Beal's headwaters (B11/B12 with R-2 of 0.71). The SAM classification (with a 0.1 rad threshold and an overall accuracy of 87.33%) allowed the differentiation and classification of two ferric iron oxides (haematite and goethite) and one iron hydrous sulphate mineral (jarosite). Additionally, band ratio images were spatially overlaid with the soil land uses map layer of the cadastre in order to plot the land uses most affected by the transported sediments during the DANA. These results highlighted agricultural land as the areas (land uses) most affected by iron oxides deposition, as oxidation processes occur more rapidly in these areas. However, grassland and scrubland were the areas with the highest content of hydroxyl-bearing minerals, as water is accumulated in these places, which favours hydrolysis reactions.

TI  - The Orchestra of Life Presents the Relationship Between Subjectivity and Mathematics Teaching: Pedagogical Practice in the New Stage of Remote Teaching
T2  - ABAKOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article, developed from the research of a dissertation, aimed to describe the lines of force that run through mathematics teachers looking for connections that link remote teaching to their subjectivity, that is, the experiences lived by the research subjects and had an impact on their pedagogical practice. The research is motivated by the following question: How can the lines of force influence the pedagogical practice of a group of mathematics teachers, during the period of remote teaching? To achieve the proposed objective, we chose to use the cartography of subjectivity, which was inspired by studies presented by Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, Suely Rolnik, among others, which allows mapping the lines of force that affect the subject, using different methods. To de-scribe the lines of force of a group of mathematics teachers, during the pandemic period, we used a questionnaire developed on Google Forms, composed of open questions and an unstructured interview. After carrying out the data collection procedures, it was possible to perceive that the period of remote teaching provided learning, but also many difficulties that very often vary from teacher to teacher. As subjects, they live and are influenced by different family and social environments, although they share the same educational context, in the sense of having students who share the same worldview, subjectivized by behaviors and particularities that differ from other generations.

AB  - The state of the vegetation cover at six hydrocarbon fields of the Parabel district of the Tomsk Region has been studied relying on satellite data. An example of the practical application of the procedure developed for the quantitative assessment of the state of vegetation cover at oil-and-gas producing territories on the basis of the values of vegetation indices obtained using the satellite data MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is shown. It is established that changes in the values of vegetation index EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) over the 12-year period (2011-2022) have a positive trend, with the maximum values recorded in 2020. This may indicate the restoration of vegetation and improvement of the environmental situation.

TI  - Intraplate Volcanism of the Alba Guyot: Geodynamic Formation Models of the Magellan Seamounts in the Pacific Ocean for 100 million years
T2  - RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report data on 9 samples of basaltic rocks and a spinel lherzolite xenolith collected during dredging in the area of Alba Guyot (Magellan Seamounts, Pacific Ocean). The data include Ar-40-Ar-39 ages of five samples and mineral chemistry of rock-forming and accessory minerals and glasses, with implications for the formation conditions of Ti-amphibole in basaltic melts. The upper slope parts at Alba Guyot and its satellite Oma Vlinder at sea depths of 3600 to 2200 m, are composed of similar to 1400 m thick basaltic rocks that formed within the 112 to 86 Ma interval (Ar-40-Ar-39 plateau ages). Later, in its 60 Myr history postdating the Cretaceous volcanism, the guyot was exposed to erosion, which produced a plateau-like flat top, and underwent another pulse of volcanism in the Cenozoic. Miocene (<20 Ma) eruptions of basanitic magma on the Alba Gyot plateau were associated with petit-spot volcanoes. Judging by the absence of hyaloclastic deposits around those volcanoes and the age of the lavas, the Cenozoic eruptions occurred in subaerial conditions before the guyot submerged below the sea level. The Alba volcanics have greater contents of incompatible elements than typical oceanic island basalts (OIB), apparently, because they formed by low-degree partial melting of different sources: pargasite-bearing spinel peridotite of the metasomatized oceanic lithosphere, mainly for Cretaceous basaltic rocks, and/or garnet peridotite for Miocene petit-spot basanites. Multiple eruptions at Alba Guyot for 100 Myr may have been maintained either by the Southern Pacific Superplume in the region of the South Pacific Thermal and Isotopic Anomaly (SOPITA) in the Mesozoic or by translithospheric faulting originated at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in the Cenozoic.

T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to estimate the wood volume of a Pinus taeda L. plantation using variables extracted from the Sentinel-1 active sensor and the Sentinel-2 passive sensor. To do so, data from a forest inventory with rectangular plots of 550 m2 were used to estimate the stand volume. We derived and adapted average vegetation indices per plot from images obtained by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors. The data were then correlated with the volume per plot based on the forest inventory. The Modified Radar Forest Degradation Index (mRDFI) showed the highest correlation for Sentinel-1 data, while the Difference Vegetation-Index (DVI) performed best for Sentinel-2. Results: The regression models were built using Stepwise modeling, demonstrating that the models fit with only the Sentinel-2 indices performed better than the others (indices adapted for Sentinel-1 and a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data), with an R2 adjusted between 0.51 to 0.40 and a standard error (Syx%) of 3.66 to 8.97. According to the statistical analyses, we found no significant differences between the volume estimated by the forest inventory (12.56 +/- 1.17) and the remote sensing techniques used (Sentinel-2 with 12.56 +/- 1.03 and Sentinel-1 with 12.56 +/- 0.94). However, further tests should be conducted with other active sensors operating in different spectral bands and polarization modes for other forest species. Conclusion: We found no significant differences between the volumetric estimates derived from remote sensing data and forest inventory techniques.

TI  - Spatial and temporal assessment of human-water interactions at the Inle Lake, Myanmar: a socio-hydrological DPSIR analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater resources as a key aspect of socio-economic development, provide a large number of services in human and environmental systems. Nevertheless, human appropriation of these water resources and the modification of landscapes lead to potential threats on water availability and quality from local to global scales. The Inle Lake in Myanmar is an economically, traditionally, and ecologically important freshwater ecosystem that faced severe degradation from the 2000s. In its catchment area, a Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework is applied for an assessment period of 30 years from 1990 to 2020. The analysis results are complemented with a socio-hydrological survey, water quality assessment, a land use classification based on ground truth and satellite data, and hydrologic models. The resulting land use changes, - 13% forest, + 13% agriculture, and + 5% urban areas, lead to increased water yield, decreased evapotranspiration, and increased sediment yield. Together with other drivers and pressures such as climate change and anthropogenic pollution, these human activities are major threats for freshwater resources and the ecosystem. However, the existing awareness of the local population for the environmental degradation is obstructed by national and international crises and responses to negative developments can accelerate degradation if they are unplanned and short-term solutions. Our study shows that environmental degradation processes have a complex nature and can only be tackled in a coordinated way with a long-term perspective. DPSIR is a suitable approach to assess human-water dynamics and disentangle the complex interconnectedness of social and environmental systems in freshwater ecosystems, even in data-scarce regions.

AB  - The economy of Vietnam relies mainly on agriculture and the Mekong Delta contributes a crucial part. The region is facing to decline in water resources together with the demand for economic development. Land use changes and policies in agriculture have been implemented in response to natural risks. The study applied a mixed- approach, using both quantitative and qualitative data to explore relations between the status of land use (LU) changes and the implementation of agricultural policies. Multi-temporal Landsat image data including Landsat- 5, 7, 8 collected from Google Earth Engine (GEE) database. LU change classification using the Random Forest (RF) method to examine changes in LU in An Giang province from 2000 to 2021. The qualitative data were gathered from individual and group discussions with local authorities, officers and farmers. The results expressed that LU in An Giang province has been changed toward reducing rice areas. Linkages existed between the agricultural policies and the types of LU related to policies of agricultural restructuring. Inappropriate areas for rice have been replaced by upland crops and fruit trees throughout the province. Ecological conditions and specificities of the region contribute to the difference from LU in the province. For agricultural development, value chain and cooperation are necessary to build adaptive and efficient agriculture.

TI  - Application of the Research on Spatio-Temporal Differentiation of a Vegetation Index in Evaluating Sunflower Hybrid Plasticity and Growth-Regulators in the Steppe Zone of Ukraine
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study was to establish dependence of sunflower productivity on hybrid plasticity under the climatic conditions of the Steppe zone and effectiveness of growth-regulators on the basis of the analysis of differentiation of a vegetation index. The research on the development and productivity of different sunflower hybrids under the natural-climatic conditions of the Steppe zone of Ukraine was conducted in the years of 2019 (medium-wet), 2020 (dry) and 2021 (wet). Spatio-temporal differentiation of the vegetation of sunflower hybrids was established on the basis of calculation of a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using the data of the decoded space images of Sentinel 2. Cartographic and grapho-analytical materials reflecting the reaction of plants to natural-climatic conditions and multifunctional growth-regulators were obtained. The dependence of the reaction of sunflower hybrids to multifunctional growth-regulators on their plasticity in response to the natural -climatic conditions of the Steppe zone was established. There was a weak reaction to application of growth -regulators of the sunflower hybrids Oplot and P64HE133 which are characterized by a high level of plasticity in response to the natural-climatic conditions of the Steppe zone. It was proven that the application of the biological preparation Helafit Combi exceeded the level of agrocenoses productivity in comparison with the chemical prepa-ration ArchitectT\M by 1.1-5.4%. It was established that foliar treatment with growth-regulators led to a decline in water uptake by the sunflower hybrids by 1.2-10.0% in the dry year, by 3.8-8.6% in the medium-wet year and by 3.7%-21.9% in the wet year. There was a significant reduction in the level of water uptake by the hybrid Hector - by 7.7-10.0% and the hybrid 8KH477KL - by 1.2-21.9%.The research results are the basis for forecasting the development of sunflower hybrid crops with further measurement of the crop productivity that allows establishing a probable level of efficiency of sunflower hybrid production by agricultural producers under the climatic condi-tions of the Steppe zone.

TI  - Metaphysics Matters Towards Semiotic Causation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The return of interest in panpsychism reflects a shift towards process metaphysics. To propose that qualia are present throughout nature is a radical break with the mechanistic worldview inherited from the nineteenth century. That break is much needed as it is becoming clear that the values implicit in that worldview have helped create a serious ecological crisis. Here, following Bohm and Peirce, an elaboration of process metaphysics is proposed based on a semiotic view of causation. This in turn, taken together with insights from biosemiotics, is used to propose a worldview of unbroken whole-ness in which consciousness is ubiquitous and exists at scales well beyond the range of human experience. It is suggested that this will help to recover some of the ecological sensitivies found in pre-scientific traditions, which are lost in a purely mechanistic worldview.

TI  - Surface Shortwave Radiative Fluxes Derived from the US Air Force Cloud Depiction Forecast System World-Wide Merged Cloud Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a global-scale evaluation of surface shortwave (SW down arrow) radiative fluxes as derived with cloud amount information from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Cloud Depiction Forecast System (CDFS) II World-Wide Merged Cloud Analysis (WWMCA) and implemented in the framework of the NASA Land Information System (LIS). Evaluation of this product is done against ground observations, a satellite-based product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and several reanalysis outputs. While the LIS/USAF product tends to overestimate the SW down arrow fluxes when compared to ground observations and satellite estimates, its performance is comparable or better than the following reanalysis products: ERA5, CFSR, and MERRA-2. Results are presented using all available observations over the globe and independently for several regional domains of interest. When evaluated against ground observations over the globe, the bias in the LIS/USAF product at daily time scale was about 9.34 W m(-2) and the RMS was 29.20 W m(-2) while over the United States the bias was about 10.65 W m(-2) and the RMS was 35.31 W m(-2). The sample sizes used were not uniform over the different regions, and the quality of both ground truth and the outputs of the other products may vary regionally. It is important to note that the LIS/USAF is a near-real-time (NRT) product of interest for potential users and as such fills a need that is not met by most products. Due to latency issues, the level of observational inputs in the NRT product is less than in the reanalysis data. Significance StatementWe evaluate a current scheme to produce surface radiative fluxes in the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework as driven with cloud amount information from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Cloud Depiction Forecast System (CDFS) II World-Wide Merged Cloud Analysis (WWMCA). The LIS/USAF product is provided at near-real time and as such, fills a need that is not met by most products. Information used for evaluation are ground observations, MODIS satellite-based estimates, and independent outputs from several reanalysis. Since the various LIS products are used by the hydrometeorology community, this manuscript should be of interest to the users of the LIS/USAF information on surface radiative fluxes.

TI  - Assessment of weed infestation of wheat crops according to geobotanical, ground-based spectrometric and satellite data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the possibility of using land spectrometry data and high-resolution satellite images of the PlanetScope grouping to assess weediness of cereal crops. The objects of monitoring were on the territory of the Kras-noyarsk Agricultural Research Institute of Federal Research Center "Krasnoyarsk Science Center of SB RAS" (Middle Siberia, Krasnoyarsk region). For interpretation satellite images, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) vegetation index was used. Biological assessment of the degree of crops weediness was determined on a four-level scale. As the result of monitoring wheat crops the influence of weed vegetation on the value of NDVI of agricultural crops was revealed. The average NDVI for wheat planting with a low degree of weediness is higher than the NDVI of wheat plantings with a high degree of weediness. As the result of the analysis of the spectra of cultural and weed vegetation on July 09, 2019, a difference in the value of the spectral brightness coefficient in the near-infrared region was noted, which is mainly connected with different structure of plants. For wheat planting with a strong degree of weediness (3 level) in the near-infrared region, the spectral brightness coefficient reaches 50%, while with a weak degree of weediness (1 level) below 40%. The NDVI analysis of wheat plantings with different levels of weediness during the whole vegetation period showed the same dynamics. However, for fields with a low degree of weediness, the NDVI value reaches 0.5 in the middle of the growing season, while for fields with a high degree of weediness, the NDVI value reaches only 0.35. According to the satellite data, spatial distribution maps of NDVI were constructed in different time of growing season (July 09, 2019 and August 02, 2019). The areas of wheat plantings with different degrees of weediness are reliably revealed on them.

TI  - Inferences from COVID-19 post-exposure risk assessment of health care workers in the pre-vaccination era at a major COVID sentinel center, Sri Lanka.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Despite the hospital triage system trying to prevent COVID-19 patients from getting admitted to wards other than isolation/quarantine units, COVID-19 patients were accidentally being discovered time to time from non-COVID-19 wards due to atypical or asymptomatic presentations. Consequently, post-exposure risk assessment was carried out for the relevant health care workers (HCW) and the other patients to assess their risk level of acquiring COVID-19, and to quarantine them if concluded as high risk. Hence, the objective of the study was to assess the outcome and the adequacy of COVID-19 post-exposure risk assessment of health care workers which would be useful in future outbreaks. We studied all events of accidental detection of COVID-19 patients happened in non-COVID-19 wards which were leading to subsequent risk assessment using the 5-questions based tool adapted from the WHO recommendations. The 5 questions discussed the protective measures during face to face meetings or in physical contacts, protective measures during aerosol generating procedures, splashes onto the face, and hand hygiene measures. A retrospective cross-sectional study carried out in the Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle, Sri Lanka, for 4 months covering the second wave of the pandemic. Hospital data base of risk assessments was accessed anonymously and the "yes" or "no" responses to the 5-questions assessment tool were analysed. There were 62 events involving 891 health care workers who underwent post-exposure risk assessment. From the responses the highest score of "yes" was recorded against question 3 (25.7% of total "yes" answers for all questions and 5.8% of total answers for the question number 3) revealing inadequate precautions taken by HCWs in aerosol generating procedures. Hundred and sixty two (18.2%) HCWs were quarantined as high risk and only one became positive for COVID-19 during the quarantine period. Though the 5-question based risk assessment tool effectively helps to identify breaches in infection control during an exposure to a positive COVID-19 patient, it may not be adequate at times as the only tool in deciding the assessee's risk level.

TI  - Estimation of Internal Wave Parameters in the Arctic Based on Synthetic Aperture Satellite Radar Data
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The work is aimed at developing a technique for calculating the solitary internal wave parameters (solitons generated by a semi-diurnal tide) based on their manifestations on the ocean surface in the presence of ice.Methods and Results. Sequential soundings of the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B radar satellites west of the deep-sea part of the Fram Strait in August, 2018 were analyzed. Identification of the internal waves' surface manifestations on the radar satellite images is reduced to finding thin bright bands elongated along the wave crests. Bright pixels, the distance between which is less than the visual width of the ridges, are united into the clusters. The clusters whose sizes exceed the threshold value and for which the anisotropy (the ratio of the semi-axes of the approximating ellipse) is also high, are considered to correspond to the internal waves (in contrast to ice). For each such cluster, the interpolated spatial coordinates are calculated along the corresponding wave extremum. Based on the proposed method, the horizontal size ("wavelength" similar to 1.5 km) and the phase speed (similar to 1 m/s) of solitary internal waves are assessed. The repetition period of solitons was similar to 24 min. The leading wave propagation speed appeared to be 10 % higher than that of the next one. During the time between soundings (similar to 48 min), this leads to a "wavelength" increase (red shift) between them - from 1.3 to 1.6 km. The curvature radii' values of each wave front are also calculated. The information on spatial position of the fronts' curvature centers permits to assume the place of generation of the analyzed internal waves, namely the underwater bank (80 degrees 45' N, 8 degrees 30' W), the depth above which is less than 20 m.Conclusions. The proposed method for identifying internal waves can be used to assess their kinematic and dynamic characteristics.

T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to gain our initial experience in one-step nucleic acid amplifi cation (OSNA) for detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis as compared to standard pathological staging in patients with breast cancer. Fifteen patients with preoperatively confi rmed early breast cancer eligible for breast-saving therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were enrolled in the study. Lymphatic mapping and SLNs detection were performed through the magnetic method. Excised SLNs were intraoperatively examined through OSNA and frozen-section methods. All lymph nodes were postoperatively examined through histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The results of latter methods were correlated. Our initial experience proved OSNA to be a sensitive and effi cient alternative to intraoperative assessment of metastases in SLN in breast cancer patients. Moreover, the information obtained by the OSNA method provides the surgeon with the possibility of assessing a more accurate prognosis during the initial surgery (Tab. 4, Fig. 3, Ref. 36).

TI  - SAR Data for Detecting Landslide Phenomena: The November 26, 2022 Landslide of the Ischia Island (Southern Italy)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, several change detection techniques based on satellite SAR data acquired by Cosmo-SkyMed Second Generation missions have been evaluated aiming at detecting the landslide-mudflow phenomenon triggered by the strong flooding event that hit Ischia Island in November 2022. It severely impacted on Casamicciola Terme area causing damages and collapses of many buildings and unfortunately also casualties. Experimental results show how both single-polarimetric (SP) and dual-polarimetric (DP) techniques are able to detect the main landslide occurring along the northern flank of Mt. Epomeo and in some cases also connected phenomena such as mud accumulation. Additional analyses have been performed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of all of them showing, as in this case, DP techniques outperform the SP ones. The outcomes are then discussed taking into account both the features of each technique and the investigated scenario. Detecting and mapping this kind of phenomenon is important for the evaluation of the affected area, especially for complex scenarios such as Ischia island, and can be very useful to support both the stakeholders for first aid and the civil protection for the post-crisis management.

TI  - Automated Recognition of Tree Species Composition of Forest Communities Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the species composition of a forest is necessary for assessing biodiversity in a particular region and making economic decisions on the management of forest resources. Recognition of the species composition, according to the Earth's remote sensing data, greatly simplifies the work and reduces time and labor costs in comparison with a traditional inventory of the forest, conducted through ground-based observations. This study analyzes the possibilities of tree species discrimination in coniferous-deciduous forests according to Sentinel-2 data using two automated recognition methods: random forest (RF) and generative topographic mapping (GTM). As remote sensing data, Sentinel-2 images of the Raifa section of Volga-Kama State Reserve in the Tatarstan Republic, Russia used: six images for the vegetation period of 2020. The analysis was carried out for the main forest-forming species. The training sample was created based on the cadastral data of the forest fund. The recognition quality was assessed using the F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy metrics. The RF method showed a higher recognition accuracy. The accuracy of correct recognition by the RF method on the training sample reaches 0.987, F1-score = 0.976, on the control sample, accuracy = 0.764, F1-score = 0.709.

TI  - How to DP-fy ML: A Practical Guide to Machine Learning with Differential Privacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine Learning (ML) models are ubiquitous in real-world applications and are a constant focus of research. Modern ML models have become more complex, deeper, and harder to reason about. At the same time, the community has started to realize the importance of protecting the privacy of the training data that goes into these models.Differential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard for making formal statements about data anonymization. However, while some adoption of DP has happened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are still few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical guidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and the difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility computation trade-offs for ML models. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers or stored in the heads of practitioners, particularly with respect to the challenging task of hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the literature seems to present conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural adjustments and which components are "safe" to use with DP. In this survey paper, we attempt to create a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the field of DP ML. We aim to assemble information about achieving the best possible DP ML model with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers and practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a clear overview of current advances and areas for improvement. We also include theory-focused sections that highlight important topics such as privacy accounting and convergence. For a practitioner, this survey provides a background in DP theory and a clear step-by-step guide for choosing an appropriate privacy definition and approach, implementing DP training, potentially updating the model architecture, and tuning hyperparameters. For both researchers and practitioners, consistently and fully reporting privacy guarantees is critical, so we propose a set of specific best practices for stating guarantees.With sufficient computation and a sufficiently large training set or supplemental non private data, both good accuracy (that is, almost as good as a non-private model) and good privacy can often be achievable. And even when computation and dataset size are limited, there are advantages to training with even a weak (but still finite) formal DP guarantee. Hence, we hope this work will facilitate more widespread deployments of DP ML models.

TI  - Cranioplasty in the deployed environment: experience for host-country nationals.
T2  - Journal of neurosurgery
M3  - Review
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is the definitive neurosurgical treatment for managing refractory malignant cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension due to combat-related severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, the long-term outcomes and sequelae of this procedure on host-country national (HCN) populations during Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq, 2003-2011), Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan, 2001-2014), and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (Afghanistan, 2015-2021) have not been described, specifically the process and results of delayed custom synthetic cranioplasty. The Joint Trauma System's Clinical Practice Guidelines (JTS-CPG) for severe head injury counsels surgeons to discard the cranial osseous explant when treating coalition service members. Ongoing political and healthcare system instabilities often preclude opportunities for delayed cranioplasty by host-country assets. Various surgical options (such as hinge craniectomy) are inadequate in the setting of complicated cranial comminution from blast or missile injuries, severe cerebral edema, grossly contaminated wounds, complex polytrauma, and tissue devitalization. Delayed cranioplasty with a custom synthetic implant is a viable but logistically challenging alternative. In this retrospective review, the authors present the first patient series describing delayed custom synthetic cranioplasty in an HCN population performed during active military conflict.METHODS: Patients were identified through the Joint Trauma System/Theater Medical Data Store, and subgroup analyses were performed to include mechanisms of injury, surgical complications, and clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent DC between 2012 and 2020 to treat penetrating, blast, and high-energy closed head injuries per JTS-CPG criteria. The average time from injury to surgery was 1.4 days, although 6 patients received delayed care (3-6 days) due to protracted evacuation from local hospitals. Delayed care correlated with an increased rate of intracranial abscess and empyema. The average time to cranioplasty was 134 days due to a lack of robust mechanisms for patient follow-up, tracking, and access to NATO hospitals. HCN patients who recovered from DC demonstrated overall benefit from custom synthetic cranioplasty, although formal statistical analysis was impeded by a lack of long-term follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that cranioplasty with a custom synthetic implant is a safe and feasible treatment for vulnerable HCN patients who survive their index DC surgery. This unique paradigm of care highlights the capabilities of deployed neurosurgical healthcare teams working in partnership with the prosthetics laboratory at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

In this study, Landsat satellite images of pre- and post-fire vegetation cover from 2020 were used to first map burn severity (low, moderate, high fraction) patterns on the CZU Fire landscape in and around Big Basin Redwoods State Park (BBRSP). For mapping of live regrowing versus currently dead forest stands, changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 10-m resolution Sentinel satellite imagery (post-CZU Fire) were transformed into a new assessment metric called the Recovery-Regrowth-Green-Index (RRGI). The RRGI result derived from Sentinel NDVI change from October 2020 to July 2022 showed that just 24% of the burned forest cover in BBRSP was still alive and regrowing to a moderate level of new green canopy cover. Field surveys in BBRSP in July 2022 showed that trees not having attained a RRGI class level of 3 or greater, with sprouting of new green foliage on most of their horizontal limbs two years after the CZU Fire, were no longer alive and growing back. The unprecedented intensity of the CZU Fires together with two successive years (2021 and 2022) of extreme drought and summer heat has inflicted severe damage on the majority of old-growth trees in BBRSP.

AB  - Google Earth (GE) has been very popular since 2005 amongst remote-sensing science enthusiasts as well as administrators for its ease of use and the large archive of multiresolution temporal data covering the entire globe. With time, Google Earth has evolved to publish layers of imagery with spatial resolution estimated to be better than 30 centimeters(since GE does not publish any information related to accuracy of the imagery). Many scholars have studied the positional accuracy of Google Earth imagery from 2008 till 2018. Improvements in the positional accuracy(absolute as well as relative) were reported by many.In this study,it was attempted to understand if the CRS of Google Earth(GE) is contributing to positional inaccuracies when its imagery is assessed using reliable satellite reference data or GPS surveyed data. Relative assessment of GE location coordinates of ground check points was done using Sentinel-2B satellite imagery. Test imagery over regions of Africa, Canada, India and Australia were used and RMSE values were reported. The radial RMSE for the image check points was computed as 12.5 metres; min-max values in Easting direction were [-23.48 m,8.26 m] while min-max values in Northing direction were [-5.77m, 17.26m]. The paper focuses on planimetric mislocation/accuracy between Google Earth and Sentinel-2B and explores direct or indirect relationship between increasing UTM zone numbers and mislocation values. The paper attempts to emphasize that there is a need for the end-user/consumer to understand that, though Google Earth is undeniably the best go-to-resource with open access and high usability rating, it has its own quality issues and should be used with caution in applications where quality and reliability are at stake. GE is indeed an excellent source of ancillary information but it is expected that the end-user be aware of inherent accuracy issues of Google Earth imagery when consuming in applications ranging from as small as a geo-spatial survey by a school community to larger projects requiring high accuracy and precision like mapping, autonomous navigation, control point surveying or satellite calibration.

TI  - Impact of extreme weather events on cropland inundation over Indian subcontinent
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclonic storms and extreme precipitation lead to loss of lives and significant damage to land and property, crop productivity, etc. The "Gulab" cyclonic storm formed on the 24th of September 2021 in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), hit the eastern Indian coasts on the 26th of September and caused massive damage and water inundation. This study used Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) satellite precipitation data for daily to monthly scale assessments focusing on the "Gulab" cyclonic event. The Otsu's thresholding approach was applied to Sentinel-1 data to map water inundation. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was employed to analyze the precipitation deviation compared to the 20 years mean climatology across India from June to November 2021 on a monthly scale. The water-inundated areas were overlaid on a recent publicly available high-resolution land use land cover (LULC) map to demarcate crop area damage in four eastern Indian states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Telangana. The maximum water inundation and crop area damages were observed in Andhra Pradesh (similar to 2700 km(2)), followed by Telangana (similar to 2040 km(2)) and Odisha (similar to 1132 km(2)), and the least in Chhattisgarh (similar to 93.75 km(2)). This study has potential implications for an emergency response to extreme weather events, such as cyclones, extreme precipitation, and flood. The spatio-temporal data layers and rapid assessment methodology can be helpful to various users such as disaster management authorities, mitigation and response teams, and crop insurance scheme development. The relevant satellite data, products, and cloud-computing facility could operationalize systematic disaster monitoring under the rising threats of extreme weather events in the coming years.

AB  - Satellite image water body identification is an important part of scientific progress. Because of factors such as aquatic vegetation, the unique lake or river hues, sediments along the bank, and so on, it can be difficult to determine where one body of water ends and another begins. To improve the process of extracting water bodies from satellite photos, both the variety of characteristics and the information they provide about their meaning need to be expanded. It may be utilized in a variety of contexts, such as forecasting the occurrence of natural catastrophes and identifying the presence of drought and flooding. As it relates to the study of remote sensing and image interpretation, automatically extracting water bodies from many satellite images with varying complexity targets is a crucial and challenging job. Mostly in the area of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, convolutional neural networks, often known as CNNs, have emerged as a popular option in recent years. When it comes to executing water body segmentation, however, generic CNN models face a number of challenges. In this paper, in order to locate the bodies of water, we utilized the MSAA-Net deep CNN that was hosted on TensorFlow. The dataset downloaded from Kaggle was used to train the model that was suggested here. It may be broken down into two categories: water bodies and masks. There are a total of 2841 photos captured by the Sentinel-2 satellite, along with 2841 associated masks. The findings indicate that our technique provides the highest possible level of segmentation performance, outperforming both the traditional and more contemporary methods. In addition, the technology that we have presented is resilient in difficult extraction circumstances, including aquatic bodies.

TI  - SHORT-TERM COASTAL LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION IN CIREBON BAY USING COASTLINE ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape of Java's north coast is dominated by a mild slope covered by soft sediment, which faces many environmental issues. These issues have been identified, and the simple technique of overlaying Landsat imagery shows the evolution of the landscape along the coast. Survey campaigns in 2006 and 2018 verified the Landsat overlay, and the 210Pb dating analysis aids in describing the sedimentation rate along the coast. The results demonstrate that accretion evolution dominates exclusively in Cirebon's coastline landscape, with coastal gains reaching 1463.88 ha over four decades and the sediment rate from 1977-1997 estimated at 0.27-0.33 cm/year. Compared to the earlier decade, the recent two periods from 1998 to 2018 demonstrate a more extensive desire for progressive accretion affected by the longshore sediment transport. Hence, special attention should be paid to the northern coast of Java to estimate the sedimentation rate and the advanced coast.

TI  - Not all brownfields are equal: A typological assessment reveals hidden green space in the city
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - While the role of urban green space in mitigating environmental hazards and enhancing urban resilience is widely recognised, the current or potential contribution of brownfield land to urban green infrastructure and ecosystem services has been largely overlooked by planning legislation. The perception of brownfield as low value spaces has instead driven a focus on brownfield-first redevelopment, and thus, this dynamic resource is quickly being lost. This research, based on GIS and remote sensing data, develops a novel hierarchical brownfield classification methodology to understand the nature and distribution of brownfield, using k-means clustering of several physical attributes, which can be used for a range of objectives and is widely applicable to post-industrial cities. Application of the methodology to the case study, Greater Manchester, UK, produced a typology of twenty-six brownfield types with distinct characteristics and differing spatial patterns across the city. Land cover analysis reveals that over half (51%) of brownfield land is vegetated (comprising 27% trees and shrubs, 24% grass and herbaceous vegetation), highlighting the significant 'hidden' green space present on brownfield. Brownfield sites traditionally perceived as difficult to develop (e.g. those with uneven topography, irregular shapes, or a water body), are particularly highly vegetated. Predominantly pervious types are widely distributed across the conurbation, including in built-up areas, which are a principal target for redevelopment, and thus highly vegetated brownfields are likely being lost undetected. Brownfield land is evidently a valuable dynamic resource in post-industrial cities and redevelopment should be planned at the city-scale to ensure careful strategic se-lection of sites for redevelopment, greening, or interim use based upon their characteristics and location.

TI  - Simulation of ecosystem fluxes with the SCOPE model: Sensitivity to parametrization and evaluation with flux tower observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of carbon, water and energy fluxes between the Earth surface and the atmosphere are crucial for enhancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions. Such estimates can be made by combining remote sensing derived land surface parameters with climate reanalysis data. We analysed to what degree generic (plant functional type (PFT)-independent) satellite-derived vegetation properties and climate reanalysis data can explain land surface fluxes and to what extent the PFT-specific information extends the flux simulations. For this purpose, we used the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer in plant leaves and vegetation canopies with photosynthesis and energy balance in a single model representation of the vegetation. We evaluated the performance of SCOPE in simulating fluxes by comparison to 63 eddy covariance sites representing 10 PFTs. We varied the sources of maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax25) and BallBerrySlope values (default vs literature), the seasonality of V-cmax25 and the meteorological forcing (locally measured and climate reanalysis). The average performance of daily flux in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 2.3 +/- 0.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (R-2 = 0.74 +/- 0.12) for gross primary productivity (GPP), 24 +/- 8 W m(-2) (R-2 = 0.68 +/- 0.16) for latent heat flux (lambda E) and 50 +/- 15 W m(-2) (R(2)0.47 +/- 0.17) for sensible heat flux (H). The inter-site variability of the annual accumulated GPP flux was captured well with seasonally varying PFT-specific V-cmax25 (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 308 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and bias = -68 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The annual accumulated evapotranspiration (ET) was overestimated (R-2 = 0.31, RMSE = 101 mm yr(-1) and bias = 37 mm yr(-1)), mainly in the ecosystems with subtropical Mediterranean climate, for which the soil resistance to evaporation from porous space (r(ss)) had to be constrained from soil moisture content (SMC) or land surface temperature (LST). Overall, the study demonstrates that SCOPE model can simulate ecosystem flux with high accuracy without site-specific calibration of its parameters.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood disasters occur frequently in Indonesia and can cause property damage and even death. This research aimed to provide rapid flood mapping based on remote sensing data by using a cloud platform. In this study, the Google Earth Engine cloud platform was used to quickly detect major floods in the Barito watershed in South Kalimantan province, Indonesia. The data used in this study were Sentinel-1 images before and after the flood event, and surface reflectance of Sentinel-2 images available on the Google Earth Engine platform. Flooding is detected using the threshold method. In this study, we determined the threshold using the Otsu method and statistical sampling thresholds (SST). Four SST scenarios were used in this study, combining the mean and standard deviation of the difference backscatter of Sentinel-1 images. The results of this study showed that the second SST scenario could classify floods with the highest accuracy of 73.2%. The inundation area determined by this method was 4,504.33 km2. The first, third and fourth SST scenarios and the Otsu method could reduce the flood load with an overall accuracy of 48.37%, 43.79%, 55.5% and 68.63%, respectively. The SST scenario is considered to be a reasonably good method for rapid flood detection using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery. This rapid detection method can be applied to other areas to detect flooding. This information can be quickly produced to help stakeholders determine appropriate flood management strategies.

T2  - Politics and the life sciences : the journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - People vary in climate change skepticism and in their views on disaster cause and prevention. For example, the United States boasts higher rates of climate skepticism than other countries, especially among Republicans. Research into the individual differences that shape variation in climate-related beliefs represents an important opportunity for those seeking ways to mitigate climate change and climate-related disasters (e.g., floods). In this registered report, we proposed a study examining how individual difference in physical formidability, worldview, and affect relate to attitudes about disaster and climate change. We predicted that highly formidable men would tend to endorse social inequality, hold status quo defensive worldviews, report lower levels of empathy, and report attitudes that promote disaster risk accumulation via lesser support for social intervention. The results of an online study (Study 1) support the notion that men's self-perceived formidability is related to disaster and climate change beliefs in the predicted direction and that this relationship is mediated by hierarchical worldview and status quo defense but not empathy. An analysis of a preliminary sample for the in-lab study (Study 2) suggests that self-perceived formidability relates to disaster views, climate views, and status quo maintaining worldviews.

TI  - Assessment of ecosystem service value variation over the changing patterns of land degradation and land use/land cover
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used time series Landsat TM and IRS LISS III data and ecosystem services coefficients for Indian ecosystems during 1995-2015 to estimate the influences of degraded lands over land use change on ecosystem services (ES) in parts of Haryana (west), where both socioeconomic progress and the semi-arid environment have considerably affected land-use change. The results show that degraded lands constitute 9.7% of total geographic area for the year 2015. A total of 1501.44 sq. km. area remains degraded in 2015 which declined significantly from 3001.44 sq. km. in 1995 to 1910.04 sq. km. in 2005. Although a progressive decline is found in degraded areas over the study area, the dynamicity of degraded land category is a concern. The degraded lands also aid in declining the ecosystem service value of associated land as illustrated in the paper. The EVF (equivalent value factor) method used for ESV calculation revealed that the ESV for agriculture increased over the land use while the ESV for grasslands was found to decrease drastically. The study is unique to co-relate degraded lands with its corresponding land use to determine the ecosystem service value pertaining to degraded lands over land use category. The obtained accuracy was 90.4% and 93.3% for identified LULC and LDD categories respectively. The ESV for agriculture more or less remained (approx. 80%) same while ESV for grasslands declined gradually over the years (6.72% in 1995 to 2.64% in 2015). The net ecosystem service value (ESV) loss from degraded lands was about 22,738 USD/ha/y for 1995-2005, while, the net ESV profit was about 699,459 USD/ha/y for 2005-2015. These findings are important for maintaining the integrity and sustainability of degraded lands and land use.

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - PURPOSE: The sentinel reference for antibiotic prophylaxis for radical cystectomy with ileal conduit in the AUA Guidelines reports data from 2003-2013 and has not been updated in the interim. Here, we assess adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines among patients undergoing radical cystectomy with ileal conduit for bladder cancer using a large national database. As a secondary objective, we assess the association between antimicrobial use and postoperative infection during the index admission following cystectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Premier Healthcare Database was queried for all patients undergoing cystectomy with ileal conduit with diagnosis of bladder cancer between 2015 and 2020. Antibiotics used and the duration of use was determined by charge codes and grouped as guidelines-based or not according to 2019 AUA Guidelines. Association with infectious complications was assessed by logistic mixed effects regression models.RESULTS: Among 6,708 patients undergoing cystectomy with ileal conduit, only 28% (1,843/6,708) were given prophylaxis according to AUA guidelines; 1.8% (121/6,708) of patients received an antifungal and 37% (2,482/6,708) received extended duration prophylaxis beyond postoperative day 1. Patients who received guidelines-based prophylaxis were less likely to be diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (21% vs 24%, P = .04), pyelonephritis (5.1% vs 7.7%, P < .001), bacterial infection (24% vs 27%, P = .03), or pneumonia (12% vs 17%, P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in clostridium difficile infection between guidelines-based and nonguidelines-based prophylaxis (3.2% vs 3.7%, P = .32). In a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, race, insurance, and hospital and provider characteristics, nonguideline antibiotic prophylaxis (OR 1.27 [1.12, 1.43], P < .001) was associated with an increased odds of infectious events, whereas a robotic approach (OR 0.82 [0.73, 0.92], P < .001) was associated with lower odds.CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-three percent of patients fail to receive guideline-based antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing radical cystectomy with conduit, which was largely driven by extended duration antibiotic use. Despite the shorter duration of antibiotics, we found that guideline-based prophylaxis was associated with a 25% decrease in the odds of infectious complications. While residual confounding is possible, these data support current AUA guidelines and suggest a need for outreach to improve guideline adherence.

TI  - Thermal infrared remote sensing data downscaling investigations: An overview on current status and perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from moderate resolution or downscaled from coarse thermal infrared (TIR) data is one of key environment parameters. Over the last four decades, most advanced remote sensing sensors/systems can acquire TIR data at a low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution. However, per different application purposes, both high spatial and temporal resolution TIR data are needed. Given that many investigations on downscaling LST (DLST) processes have been done and findings have been reported in the literature, it necessitates to have an updated review on DLST investigations of the status, trends, and challenges and to rec-ommend future directions. An overview is provided on various polar orbits and geostationary or-bits' satellite TIR sensors/systems and on scaling factors' determination and selection techniques/ methods suitable for DLST processes. Existing various techniques/methods for DLST processes are presented and assessed, and limitations and future research directions are identified and rec-ommended. In this review, several concluding remarks were made, including (1) most investiga-tions on DLST processes used coarse spatial resolution but high temporal resolution MODIS TIR data; (2) compared to fusion-based method, the kernel-driven processes are the most frequently used thermal downscaling methods; (3) machine-learning methods have demonstrated their ex-cellent performance and robustness in improving DLST accuracy; (4) more advanced spatiotem-poral fusion-based methods consider synergic powers by combining a kernel-driven process with a fusion-based process method. The three future research directions for DLST processes are rec-ommended: further reducing uncertainties of DLST results, developing novel DLST models and al-gorithms, and directly reducing the spatial scaling effect in DLST processes.

TI  - PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND CONSUMER HABITS OF CROATIAN STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
T2  - SOCIOLOGIJA
M3  - Article
AB  - Some studies that observed lifestyle changes during COVID-19 lockdown measures report positive implications for the environment. However, others warn that these pro-environmental changes may have only been temporary and that negative effects could outweigh the positive ones. In this paper, we examine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced pro-environmental changes in the lifestyle and consumer habits of students in Croatia. The research was conducted between the end of 2020 and the start of 2021, using an online survey method, with a convenience sampling of N=1245 students from three Croatian Universities in Osijek, Split, and Zagreb. We looked at a range of lifestyle and consumer habits, such as mobility, shopping frequency and extent, food self-provisioning, as well as recycling and household savings, to see whether there were significant changes that can be classified as environmentally friendly. The results show that the pandemic did not have a significant long-term effect on pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Those who practiced PEB before the pandemic continued to do so, primarily motivated by environmental worldview and prioritizing environmental protection. For others, there were either no changes in PEB during the pandemic, or it was only short-term, connected to the limiting circumstances of the pandemic on their usual lifestyle.

TI  - Image Texture as Quality Indicator for Optical DEM Generation: Geomorphic Applications in the Arid Central Andes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) through stereogrammetry of optical satellite images has gained great popularity across various disciplines. For the analysis of these DEMs, it is important to understand the influence of the input data and different processing steps and parameters employed during stereo correlation. Here, we explore the effects that image texture, as well as the use of different matching algorithms (Block Matching (BM) and More Global Matching (MGM)), can have on optical DEMs derived from the flexible, open-source Ames Stereo Pipeline. Our analysis relies on a similar to 2700 km(2) clip of a SPOT6 tristereo scene covering the hyperarid, vegetation-free Pocitos Basin and adjacent mountain ranges in the northwestern Argentine Andes. A large, perfectly flat salt pan (paleolake bed) that covers the center of this basin is characterized by strong contrasts in image texture, providing a unique opportunity to quantitatively study the relationship between image texture and DEM quality unaffected by topography. Our findings suggest that higher image texture, measured by panchromatic variance, leads to lower DEM uncertainty. This improvement continues up to similar to 10(3) panchromatic variance, above which further improvements in DEM quality are independent of local image texture but instead may have sensor or geometric origins. Based on this behavior, we propose that image texture may serve as an important proxy of DEM quality prior to stereo correlation and can help to set adequate processing parameters. With respect to matching algorithms, we observe that MGM improves matching in low-texture areas and overall generates a smoother surface that still preserves complex, narrow (i.e., ridge and valley) features. Based on this sharper representation of the landscape, we conclude that MGM should be preferred for geomorphic applications relying on stereo-derived DEMs. However, we note that the correlation kernel selected for stereo-matching must be carefully chosen depending on local image texture, whereby larger kernels generate more accurate matches (less artifacts) at the cost of smoothing results. Overall, our analysis suggests a path forward for the processing and fusion of overlapping satellite images with suitable view-angle differences to improve final DEMs.

TI  - Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification Algorithms for Mangrove Forest Mapping in Sembilang National Park, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sembilang National Park, one of the best and largest mangrove areas in Indonesia, is very vulnerable to disturbance by community activities. Changes in the dynamic condition of mangrove forests in Sembilang National Park must be quickly and easily accompanied by mangrove monitoring efforts. One way to monitor mangrove forests is to use remote sensing technology. Recently, machine-learning classification techniques have been widely used to classify mangrove forests. This study aims to investigate the ability of decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) machine-learning algorithms to determine the mangrove forest distribution in Sembilang National Park. The satellite data used are Landsat-7 ETM+ acquired on 30 June 2002 and Landsat-8 OLI acquired on 9 September 2019, as well as supporting data such as SPOT 6/7 image acquired in 2020-2021, MERIT DEM and an existing mangrove map. The pre-processing includes radiometric and atmospheric corrections performed using the semi-automatic classification plugin contained in Quantum GIS. We applied decision tree and random forest algorithms to classify the mangrove forest. In the DT algorithm, threshold analysis is carried out to obtain the most optimal threshold value in distinguishing mangrove and non-mangrove objects. Here, the use of DT and RF algorithms involves several important parameters, namely, the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference soil index (NDSI), near-infrared (NIR) band, and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The results of DT and RF classification from Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images show similarities regarding mangrove spatial distribution. The DT classification algorithm with the parameter combination NDMI + NDSI + DEM is very effective in classifying Landsat-7 ETM+ image, while the parameter combination NDMI + NIR is very effective in classifying Landsat-8 OLI image. The RF classification algorithm with the parameter Image (6 bands), the number of trees = 100, the number of variables predictor (mtry) is square root (& RADIC;k), and the minimum number of node sizes = 6, provides the highest overall accuracy for Landsat-7 ETM+ image, while combining Image (7 bands) + NDMI + NDSI + DEM parameters with the number of trees = 100, mtry = all variables (k), and the minimum node size = 6 provides the highest overall accuracy for Landsat-8 OLI image. The overall classification accuracy is higher when using the RF algorithm (99.12%) instead of DT (92.82%) for the Landsat-7 ETM+ image, but it is slightly higher when using the DT algorithm (98.34%) instead of the RF algorithm (97.79%) for the Landsat-8 OLI image. The overall RF classification algorithm outperforms DT because all RF classification model parameters provide a higher producer accuracy in mapping mangrove forests. This development of the classification method should support the monitoring and rehabilitation programs of mangroves more quickly and easily, particularly in Indonesia.

TI  - Assessment of Small-Extent Forest Fires in Semi-Arid Environment in Jordan Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat Sensors Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the separability potential of Sentinel-2A (MultiSpectral Instrument, MSI) and Landsat (Operational Land Imager, OLI and Thermal Infrared Sensor, TIRS) derived indices for detecting small-extent (<25 ha) forest fires areas and severity degrees. Three remote sensing indices [differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differenced Normalized Different Vegetation Index (dNDVI), and differenced surface temperature (dTST)] were used at three forest fires sites located in Northern Jordan; Ajloun (total burned area 23 ha), Dibbeen (burned area 10.5), and Sakeb (burned area 15 ha). Compared to ground reference data, Sentinel-2 MSI was able to delimit the fire perimeter more precisely than Landsat-8. The accuracy of detecting burned area (area of coincidence) in Sentinel-2 was 7%-26% higher that Landsat-8 OLI across sites. In addition, Sentinel-2 reduced the omission area by 28%-43% and the commission area by 6%-38% compared to Landsat-8 sensors. Higher accuracy in Sentinel-2 was attributed to higher spatial resolution and lower mixed pixel problem across the perimeter of burned area (mixed pixels within the fire perimeter for Sentinel-2, 8.5%-13.5% vs. 31%-52% for Landsat OLI). In addition, dNBR had higher accuracy (higher coincidence values and less omission and commission) than dNDVI and dTST. In terms of fire severity degrees, dNBR (the best fire index candidate) derived from both satellites sensors were only capable of detecting the severe spots "severely-burned" with producer accuracy >70%. In fact, the dNBR-Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for classifying fire severity degree were less than 70% across the studied sites, except for Sentinel-dNBR in Dibbeen (72.5%). In conclusion, Sentinel-dNBR and Landsat promise to delimitate forest fire perimeters of small-scale (<25 ha) areas, but further remotely-sensed techniques are require (e.g., Landsat-Sentinel data fusion) to improve the fire severity-separability potential.

TI  - Uncertainties in MODIS-Derived <i>Ulva Prolifera</i> Amounts in the Yellow Sea: A Systematic Evaluation Using Sentinel-2/MSI Observations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainties are an integral part of remote sensing data products in order to quantify changes, yet due to patchiness and spatial heterogeneity, it is difficult to use field measurements to estimate uncertainties in the satellite-derived Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera, also called green tides) amounts in the Yellow Sea. This is perhaps why such estimates are missing in nearly all remote sensing literature on U. prolifera mapping. Here, by comparing all available data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra/Aqua satellites and the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on the Sentinel-2A/2B satellites for the period of 2015-2022, we evaluate uncertainties in the MODIS-derived U. prolifera amounts. The relative uncertainties are found to decrease with increasing Ulva amounts in individual images, ranging from 58.8% for Ulva areal coverage (after pixel unmixing) of <50 km(2) to 8.7% for Ulva areal coverage of >200 km(2). Such uncertainties decrease in the monthly composite data products because of the increased number of observations, reducing to 3% in the total Ulva amount during the peak months. Such uncertainty estimates, in relative terms, are expected to serve as a reference when interpreting temporal changes in long-term Ulva estimates derived from satellite data.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Temperature Over the Tibetan Plateau Based on Sentinel-3 SLSTR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a crucial role in the energy and water cycles of the Earth's climate system. The uncertainty of LST retrieval from satellites is a fundamental and long-standing issue, especially in plateau areas [such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP)], due to its high altitude, unique hydrometeorological conditions, and complex underlying surfaces. To improve the accuracy of LST retrieval over the TP, different methods, including the single channel (SC) algorithm, the split-window (SW) algorithm, and four machine learning (ML) models, were used to retrieve the LST based on sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) data in this study. The validation results indicated that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the LSTs retrieved by the SC and SW algorithms were 3.48 and 2.64 K, respectively, which shows a better performance than the official SLSTR LST products (5.23 K). In addition, the random forest model has the highest accuracy among the four ML models, with an RMSE of 3.26 K. By comparing the performance of various methods, the SW algorithm is more stable and reliable for LST retrieval over the TP. In addition, the accurate spatiotemporal distribution of the LST based on the SW algorithm was also analyzed, which would benefit the understanding of the physical processes of energy and water cycles over the TP.

AB  - As a main element of China second generation of geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun 4B(FY-4B), which was launched on Jun. 03, 2021, the Geostationary High-speed Imager (GHI) is the first round the clock high-frequency imaging instrument working on the international geo-stationary orbit. It can continuously observant and imagine for 2000kmx2000km regions with spatial resolution up to 250m in 1 minute interval. The challenge of GHI thermal design was that the sun intrusion of the optic system would induce destabilization of the internal temperature field. It conflicted with the target of the GHI thermal system, which should ensure small temperature difference between two sides of scanner shrouds (less than 3K), the low temperature gradient of optical mounting platform (less than 2K), and high precision temperature control (+/- 0.1K) of blackbody. This paper described the control strategy and requirements of the GHI thermal system, which successfully performs all phases of the mission. The on-orbit data showed that the instrument maintained a stable internal thermal environment when optical system exposed to external heat flux disturbances in mid-night.

TI  - SelfS2: Self-Supervised Transfer Learning for Sentinel-2 Multispectral Image Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multispectral image captured by the Sentinel-2 satellite contains 13 spectral bands with different resolutions, which may hider some of the subsequent applications. In this article, we design a novel method to super-resolve 20- and 60-m coarse bands of the S2 images to 10 m, achieving a complete dataset at the 10-m resolution. To tackle this inverse problem, we leverage the deep image prior expressed by the convolution neural network (CNN). Specifically, a plain ResNet architecture is adopted, and the 3-D separable convolution is utilized to better capture the spatial-spectral features. The loss function is tailored based on the degradation model, enforcing the network output obeying the degradation process. Meanwhile, a network parameter initialization strategy is designed to further mine the abundant fine information provided by existing 10-m bands. The network parameters are inferred solely from the observed S2 image in a self-supervised manner without involving any extra training data. Finally, the network outputs the super-resolution result. On the one hand, our method could utilize the high model capacity of CNNs and work without large amounts of training data required by many deep learning techniques. On the other hand, the degradation process is fully considered, and each module in our work is interpretable. Numerical results on synthetic and real data illustrate that our method could outperform compared state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Attention-based encoder-decoder framework has been currently utilize for image description. Many methods are to keep visual attention dynamic for each produced word. But the decoder does not need to obtain any visual information from the picture to forecast non-visual words at every moment. In addition, the development of non visual vocabulary may mislead and reduce the overall effectiveness of visual signals in generating guidelines.So we provides a new model AoANet++ to solve the above problems. At each time step, the model decides when to display the picture and when the language model generates the next word to produce a better sentence.The experimental results on MSCOCO dataset prove the effectiveness of this method, which improves the best CIDEr-D and SPICE scores of the initial report by 8.6% and 4.7% respectively.

AB  - The cooling effects of blue-green spaces on the urban heat island effect are complex and different. The purpose of this study is to simulate how the cooling effect of blue-green space changes with its size and shape. The cooling effects of 53 green patches and 28 water bodies in Changsha were extracted based on Landsat images. A surface fitting model was used to quantitatively reveal the relationship between the cooling effect of blue-green space and its size and shape. The results show that the cooling effects of blue-green spaces were enhanced with the increasing size, and then would become stable after a certain range (threshold). Certain thresholds were identified between the blue and green space areas (2.98 ha and 3.15 ha, respectively) and the cooling distance, and between the blue and green space areas (4.84 ha and 4.92 ha, respectively) and the cooling magnitude. In addition, the green space with an area of 9.08 ha and landscape shape index (LSI) of 2.97 could achieve a better cooling distance (413.46 m); and the blue space with an area of 29.4 ha and LSI of 1.75 could achieve a better cooling magnitude (5.17 °C). These findings provide useful guidelines for urban planning and improving urban livability in other regions with terrain and climate conditions similar to Changsha.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence, known to have occurred in many parts of Gulf Coast of the United States (GC) as a consequence of complex geological conditions, high-intensity resource exploitation and land use. This subsidence has caused extensive damage to buildings and other infrastructures. By exploiting 1650 images from 33 ALOS-1 paths during 2007-2011 using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) techniques, we have constructed, for the first time, a deformation map over 500,000 km2 of the 1900-km-long GC, with an RMSE of <10 mm/yr. The GC is generally stable, but numerous land deformation zones have been discovered, including at least 30 subsidence patterns and 14 uplift features. The maximum rate of subsidence measured is about 56 mm/yr at Stratton Ridge Oil Field, Texas. Most of the identified ground instabilities are newly discovered as a result of this study. The land deformation along GC is caused by both regional geological conditions and human activities that have influenced natural surroundings and consequentially exacerbated ground instability. Depressurization of petroleum reservoirs and aquifer compaction related to groundwater withdrawal are the principal impactors on observed subsidence. Other processes, including wastewater injection, sulfur/salt mining, dewatering, oxidation, and construction work, also contributed to the InSAR-mapped ground instability. Our large-scale deformation mapping will help the scientific community and relevant agencies better understand land deformation rates and extents, identify the processes responsible for the coastal deformation, and provide a critical dataset for hazard prediction and mitigation in the GC.

AB  - Thu Duc City (TDC), a sub-city of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, has undergone rapid transformation in land use - land cover (LULC) over the past few decades. Flooding is one of the biggest challenges to the sustainable development of the city. Quantifying excess runoff induced by urbanization and climate change is essential for developing an efficient flood risk management strategy. This research aims to evaluate the effects of the impervious surface expansion (a key indicator of urbanization) and the rainfall increase caused by climate change on the excess runoff depth in TDC. The dataset derived from LANDSAT satellite images was used to explore the spatial-temporal dynamics of impervious surface areas from 1985 to 2020. The EPA-SWMM urban rainfall-runoff model was employed to investigate the effects of increased impervious surface and climate change on excess runoff depth. The satellite data showed that TDC has 24% of the impermeable surface area currently, much lower than 75.6% in areas located in the central districts such as Nhieu Loc - Thi Nghe (NL-TN) basin, and that impermeable areas have expanded rapidly in the north-south and west-east directions since 2010. The simulated results indicated that impervious surface development increased excess runoff depth by 14.0mm between 1985 and 2020. It also showed that increasing rainfall due to climate change could raise the average excess runoff depth by 18.2%, 64.0%, and 49.4%, respectively, at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the century compared to the current stage. It suggests mainstreaming stormwater retention and detention systems into urban development plans for adapting to the future uncertainties of urbanization and climate change. It also recommends that the impervious surface areas must be maintained within design thresholds to control runoff and mitigate floods in practice. The research findings could assist policymakers and stakeholders in formulating a long-term vision to propose an efficient urban stormwater management strategy in TDC and similar growing cities.

TI  - Calibration of Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance for Water Quality Modelling in Binh Dinh's Coastal Zone of Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are critically important ecosystems that are closely tied to human activities, such as tourism, urbanization, transport, and aquaculture. However, managing and monitoring sea water in the coastal areas is often challenging due to the diversity of the pollution sources. Traditional approaches of onsite measurement and surveys have limitations in terms of cost, efficiency and productivity compared with modern remote sensing methods, particularly for larger and longer observations. Optical remote sensing imagery has been proven to be a good data source for water quality assessment in general and for seawater studies in particular with the use of advanced techniques of data processing such as machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, optical remote sensing data also have their own disadvantages as they are much affected by climatic conditions, atmospheric gas and particles as a source of noise in the data. This noise could be reduced, but it is still unavoidable. This study aims to model seawater quality parameters (total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll-a (chla), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and dissolved oxygen (DO)) along a 134 km sea coastal area of the Binh Dinh province by applying the current robust machine learning models of decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and Ada boost regression (ABR) using Sentinel-2 imagery. To reduce the atmospheric effects, we conducted onsite measurements of sea surface reflectance (SSR) using the German RAMSES-TriOS instrument for calibration of the Sentinel-2 level 2A data before inputting them to the ML models. Our modeling results showed an improvement of the model accuracy using calibrated SSR compared with the original Sentinel-2 level 2A SSR data. The RF predicted the most accurate seawater quality parameters compared with in situ field-measured data (mean R-2 = 0.59 using original Sentinel-2 level 2A SSR and R-2 = 0.70 using calibrated SSR). The chla was the most precise estimate (R-2 = 0.74 when modelled by the RF model) flowing by DO, COD and TSS. In terms of seawater quality estimation, this accuracy is at a good level. The results of the seawater quality distributions were strongly correlated with coastal features where higher values of TSS, chla, COD, and DO are near the river mouths and urban and tourist areas. These spatial water quality data could be extremely helpful for local governments to make decisions when the modelling is continuously conducted (using big data processing), and it is highly recommended for more applications.

AB  - This study aims to use cloud computing and Sentinel-2 satellite data to map mangrove forests in Vietnam. To distinguish mangroves from other areas, it is necessary to rely on biological properties: water and vegetation cover. This study develops a method by analyzing the time series of water and vegetation cover in specific areas to determine criteria for accurate mangrove extraction. For more detail, 5 criteria canopy, greenness, NDVI > 0.6, NDVI < 0.2, and LSWI > 0.45 are extracted. These 5 indices are considered to correlate with annual mean NDVI to set thresholds for mangroves. Besides, terrain elevation data is also considered to filter out the mixed vegetation close to mangrove. This approach is applied to coastal areas of Vietnam to produce a mangrove forests map in 2020 using Google Earth Engine. Then 47 mangrove-reference points are used to check the mangrove map with an accuracy of about 85%. Finally, the mangrove map in 2020 is overlaid with the mangrove map in 2011 generated from Landsat images to determine the change of mangroves over 9 years. The results show that after 9 years, 95,000 ha of mangrove was preserved, approximately 120,000 ha disappeared, and approximately 67,000 ha of new forests.

TI  - An Investigation on the Damping Ratio of Marine Oil Slicks in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The damping ratio has recently been used to indicate the relative internal oil thickness within oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. However, there exists no well-defined and evaluated methodology for calculating the damping ratio. In this study, we review prior work regarding the damping ratio and outline its theoretical and practical aspects. We show that the most often used methodology yields damping ratio values that differ, in some cases significantly, for the same scene. Three alternative methods are tested on multifrequency datasets of verified oil slicks acquired from DLR's F-SAR instrument, NASA's unmanned aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar, and Sentinel-1. All methods yielded similar results regarding relative thickness variations within slick. The proposed damping ratio derivation methods were found to be sensitive to the proportion of oil covered pixels versus open water pixels in the azimuth direction, as well as to the scene size in question. We show that the fully automatable histogram method provides the most consistent results even under challenging conditions. Comparisons between optical imagery and derived damping ratio values using F-SAR data show good agreement between the relatively thicker oil slick areas for the two different types of sensors.

TI  - Current management of patients with cutaneous melanoma with a positive sentinel lymph node.
T2  - Medicina
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) performed in patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) cutaneous melanoma is not associated with improved melanoma specific survival versus active surveillance (AS) using nodal ultrasound. Clinical practice experience and outcomes of AS and adjuvant therapy is now starting to be published in literature.METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with a positive-SLNB between June/2017-February/2022. Impact of management on any-site recurrence free survival (RFS), isolated nodal recurrence (INR), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was evaluated.RESULTS: From 126 SLNB, 31 (24.6%) were positive: 24 received AS and 7 CLND. Twenty-one (68%) received adjuvant therapy (AS, 67% and CLND, 71%). With a median follow-up of 18 months, 10 patients developed recurrent disease with an estimated 2-yr RFS of 73% (CI95%, 0.55-0.86) (30% in AS group vs. 43% in dissection group; P = 0.65). Four died of melanoma with an estimated 2-yr MSS of 82% (CI 95%, 0.63-0.92) and no differences between AS and CLND groups (P = 0.21). Estimated 2-yr DMFS of the whole cohort was 76% (CI 95%, 0.57-0.88) with no differences between groups (P = 0.33).CONCLUSION: Active surveillance strategy has been adopted for most positive-SLNB cutaneous melanoma patients. Adjuvant therapy without immediate CLND was delivered in nearly 70% of patients. Our results align with outcomes of randomized control trials and previous real-world data.
AB  - Introduccion: La linfadenectomia inmediata (LI) realizada en pacientes con biopsia de ganglio centinela (BGC) positivo por melanoma cutaneo no esta asociada a mejoria en la supervivencia libre de enfermedad vs. vigilancia activa (VA). Resultados oncologicos y experiencia en la practica clinica con dicha conducta asociados a tratamiento adyuvante comienzan a ser publicados en la literatura. Metodos: Analisis retrospectivo incluyendo pacientes con BGC-positiva por melanoma cutaneo entre junio/2017-febrero/2022. Se evaluo impacto del manejo en: supervivencia libre de recurrencia (SLR), recurrencia ganglionar aislada (RGA), supervivencia libre de metastasis a distancia (SLMD) y supervivencia libre de enfermedad (SLE). Resultados: De 126 pacientes, 31 (24.6%) fueron positivos: en 24 se realizo VA y en 7 LI. Veintiun pacientes (68%) recibieron tratamiento adyuvante (VA, 67% y LI, 71%). Con una media de seguimiento de 18 meses, 10 pacientes presentaron recurrencia de la enfermedad con una SLR estimada a 2 anos del 73% (CI95%, 0.55-0.86) (30% en VA vs. 43% en LI; P = 0.65). Cuatro murieron de melanoma con una SLE a 2 anos del 82% (CI 95%, 0.63-0.92); sin diferencia entre ambos grupos (P = 0.21). La SLMD a 2 anos de toda la cohorte fue de 76% (CI 95%, 0.57-0.88; P = 0.33). Conclusion: La vigilancia activa se ha adoptado como conducta para la mayoria de los pacientes con BGCpositivo. El tratamiento adyuvante sin linfadenectomia inmediata se realizo en cerca del 70% de nuestra serie. Los resultados de nuestra serie son similares a los reportados en la literatura.

TI  - Animals indistinct, animals mute (Natural motifs in Ivan Strpka's poetry)
T2  - SLOVENSKA LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article, applying the lens of pantheism and ecocriticism to the reading of the poetry of Ivan Strpka (b. 1944), looks into ways in which the poet handles natural motifs, esp. the animal. With regards to Strpka's early collections, the authors look at the way the poet employed the figure of the parrot in his critique of rhetorical emptiness of the socialist society. In the poetry published in the 1980s, on the other hand, it pertains that Strpka used natural and animal motifs to portray erotic relationships and urban atmosphere. From his later poetry, the article focuses on the poems that demonstrate the poet's pantheistic worldview and shows that Strpka's writing also offers a fruitful ground for ecocritical reading. The last section of the paper looks at the collections he published after 1997. Nature is most often tied with civilizational contexts and dark, enigmatic, and sombre tones anticipating a catastrophic vision of the world prevail in these late poems. The article is thus both a contribution to the understanding of the development of the poet's oeuvre and to the ways in which Slovak literature represents and constructs the animal and nature.

TI  - A Consistent Land Cover Map Time Series at 2 m Spatial Resolution-The LifeWatch 2006-2015-2018-2019 Dataset for Wallonia
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem accounting is based on the definition of the extent and the status of an ecosystem. Land cover maps extents are representative of several ecosystems and can therefore be used to support ecosystem accounting if reliable change information is available. The dataset described in this paper aims to provide land cover information (13 classes) for biodiversity monitoring, which has driven two key features. On one hand, open areas were described in more details (5 classes) than in the other maps available in the study area in order to increase their relevance for biodiversity models. On the other hand, monitoring means that the time series must consist of comparable layers. The time series integrate information from existing high quality land cover maps that are not fully comparable, as well as thematic products (crop type, road network and forest type) and remote sensing data (25 cm orthophotos, 0.8 pts/m(2) LIDAR and Sentinel-1&2 data). Because of the high spatial resolution of the data and the fragmented landscape, boundary errors could cause a large proportion of false change detection if the maps are classified independently. Buildings and forests were therefore consolidated across time in order to build a time series where these changes can be trusted. Based on an independent validation, the overall accuracy was 93.1%, 92.6%, 94.8% and 93.9% +/-1.3% for the years 2006, 2015, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The specific assessment of forest patch change highlighted a 98% +/-2.7% user accuracy across the 4 years and 85% of forest cut detection. This time series will be completed and further consolidated with other dates using the same protocol and legend.

TI  - The Civilizational Choice of Ukraine: Questioning the Conceptual Roadmap
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern Ukraine is a post-colonial, post-totalitarian state in which decolonization, de -communization, and de-russification have not yet been fully implemented. This article sets itself the goal of reviewing the agenda of the processes of civilizational transit of Ukraine and developing theoretically grounded vectors of the said process. The important fact that the current stage of development of the "worldview gravity" of Ukrainian society is characterized by an eclectic system of stereotypes is also of significant importance: here coexist both old stereotypes of consciousness and behavior, which have largely ceased to fulfill their functions, and new ones that are unstable and ambiguous. The series of ideas regarding the Ukrainian civilizational choice was already discovered in a monograph, "Civilizational crossroads of modern society," and presented for Ukrainian readers a few years ago. The current article offers a revision of the previously presented ideas for the international audience of the journal readers, taking into account the current Ukrainian socio-cultural situation, at the center of which are the challenges produced by the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The policy of new realism can become an effective tool for social modernization. The given word combination is not accidental: the realism of this type of politics insists on the need for the adequate perception of reality in all its essential aspects, and the novelty emphasizes the need to operate not with the laws and features of the socio-political status quo "in general," but taking into account the latest dynamics, trends, threats, and problematic challenges. The people and the country need not only (and sometimes not so much) a thorough understanding of their cultural-civilizational, geopolitical, and economic-economic prospects but an indomitable character that guarantees the realization of their potential in spite of anything and against anything. On the difficult path of establishing a civilizational choice, Ukrainians will need not only the awareness of the incomplete state of political modernization, the limited, post-totalitarian (post-colonial, etc.) status, but also to work at the individual level to accelerate evolutionary processes. These processes can catalyze political decisions, not at the declarative level but at the practical level, to fill the steps for the approval of the civilizational choice with content. Step-by-step changes in favor of a new worldview horizon will require significant changes at the personal level through the rejection of destructive post-colonial (post-totalitarian, etc.) narratives in social practice in favor of the development of Ukrainian national identity, which will be preceded by the rational assimilation of the perspectives of civilizational choice, which is a fruitful combination of the European civilizational project and heritage of Ukrainian culture.

TI  - Comparison between Laparoscopic and Robotic Approach for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Carcinoma Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Robotic surgery has been approved as an alternative to laparoscopy to improve surgical outcomes. There is neither a consensus nor a systematic assessment of the literature about the superiority of the robotic approach over the laparoscopic one for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in endometrial carcinoma (EC) women. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare the laparoscopic and robotic approaches for SLN biopsy in EC patients. Five electronic databases were queried from their inception to May 2022 for peer-reviewed studies, comparing such approaches in SLN biopsy in EC patients. The rate of detected SLN, dissected SLN, intraoperative and postoperative complications, conversion to laparotomy, number of dissected SLN, and SLN identification and dissection time were compared between the laparoscopic and robotic approaches for SLN biopsy in EC patients. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated when possible. Two studies with 660 EC women (364 who had undergone laparoscopy, and 296 who had robotic surgery) were included. No assessed outcome showed significant differences between the two approaches. In conclusion, the laparoscopic and robotic approaches for SLN biopsy in EC patients appeared to not differ, in terms of SLN detection, intraoperative and postoperative complications, conversion to laparotomy, number of dissected SLN, and SLN identification and dissection time.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being a historically significant and biologically diverse protected area in Bangladesh, Bhawal National Park (BNP) has been the victim of anthropogenic activities that have challenged its sustainability. This study aims to determine the extent of landscape change and forest area depletion within BNP territory from 2005 to 2020, as land use change is the most visible indicator of human footprint liable to biodiversity loss and land degradation. Landsat satellite images from four sensors are used in this research (MSS, TM, OLI, and TIRS). The complex spatial composition of Bhawal National Park was characterized using a supervised classification technique using ArcMap version 10.8. The findings show a steady decline in the dense and degraded forest classifications, but an increase in the other classed classes. Waterbody, settlement, and chala/baid are found to increase by approximately 105, 369, and 650% respectively from 2005 till 2020, while, the area of dense and degraded forest decreased by about 47 and 51%. Within 16 years, nearly 1000 ha of dense forest cover has been depleted. Comparing the latest classified image of BNP with the relevant map, Bhabanipur, B.K. Bari, and Boupara beat are identified to be the most degraded areas. The conclusion can be drawn from this study that owing to most suppressing factors, namely settlement and chala/baid, a forest cover of nearly 2284 ha has been depleted from this national park which is almost 49% of the total possessed forest cover in 2005.

TI  - River dynamics - a geospatial analysis of <i>Jamuna</i> (<i>Brahmaputra</i>) River in Bangladesh during 1973-2019 using Landsat satellite remote sensing data and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is designed to illuminate the dynamics of the Jamuna River in Bangladesh for 46 years, from 1973 to 2019. About 240 km of the Jamuna River course was assessed using remote sensing and GIS. Landsat remote sensing imageries were processed, and bank lines were extracted and analysed using GIS. The main objective of the study was to understand the pattern of bed movement of the Jamuna River. The river dynamics were assessed based on bank erosion, accretion, bank line shifts, channel width, and river course and confluence shift. Area vulnerable to erosion was assessed using historical erosion rate and trend analysis. The result revealed that the river area increased by about 48% over 46 years. The total eroded area was about 1038 km(2), with 35.40% more erosion on the left bank than on the right. Due to higher erosion than deposition, the river widened. The average width of the river increased by about 56.40% during the period. The average rate of shifting was higher on the left bank than on the right, indicating the eastward movement of the river. Impact analysis showed that overall, a total of 822 km(2) and 390 km(2) of croplands and settlements were eroded during the period 1973-2019. The width of the confluence at the Padma River junction decreased by about 28%. The straight shift of the confluence was 9.27 km towards the southeast. The vulnerable area assessment anticipated that there would be more erosion on the left bank than on the right, and that Kurigram, Tangail and Jamalpur are the districts most susceptible to future left bank erosion. And, the lower reach of the right bank of the Padma River is at high vulnerable to erosion at the confluence. The methods and analysis adopted in this study can be applied to any other braided river to monitor the dynamics of the river and to formulate an action plan to protect the river from erosion.

TI  - Prediction of Plant Diversity Using Multi-Seasonal Remotely Sensed and Geodiversity Data in a Mountainous Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity measurement and monitoring are required for reversing biodiversity loss and ensuring sustainable management. Traditional methods have been using in situ measurements to build multivariate models connecting environmental factors to species diversity. Developments in remotely sensed datasets, processing techniques, and machine learning models provide new opportunities for assessing relevant environmental parameters and estimating species diversity. In this study, geodiversity variables containing the topographic and soil variables and multi-seasonal remote-sensing-based features were used to estimate plant diversity in a rangeland from southwest Iran. Shannon's and Simpson's indices, species richness, and vegetation cover were used to measure plant diversity and attributes in 96 plots. A random forest model was implemented to predict and map diversity indices, richness, and vegetation cover using 32 remotely sensed and 21 geodiversity variables. Additionally, the linear regression and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to assess the relationship between the spectral diversity, expressed as the coefficient of variation in vegetation indices, and species diversity metrics. The results indicated that the synergistic use of geodiversity and multi-seasonal remotely sensed features provide the highest accuracy for Shannon, Simpson, species richness, and vegetation cover indices (R-2 up to 0.57), as compared to a single model for each date (February, April, and July). Furthermore, the strongest relationship between species diversity and the coefficient of variation in vegetation indices was based on the remotely-sensed data of April. The approach of multi-model evaluations using the full geodiversity and remotely sensed variables could be a useful method for biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - India is a civilization, not just a country, nation, or government. Taking over the leadership of G20 by India, at a time when the world is battling pandemics, war, energy and climate crisis, and resource restriction is not just appropriately suited politico-economically but socio-culturally as well. COVID-19 proved that the unbelievably diverse world was too complex to be packed into a utopian hold-all one size fits all ideas. However, the fact is that COVID-19 may only have uncovered the crisis, which had been in the making for the latter part of the last century and extending into the current. India's leadership of G20 is therefore a window of opportunity for a more sustainable worldview as the ideas are coming from a civilization with a long history of acceptance of the entire world as one family- Vasudaiva Kutumbakam.

TI  - Semi-field evaluation of a novel controlled release device using transfluthrin as spatial repellent to prevent entry of mosquitoes into military tents
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN PARASITOLOGY & VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquitoes can impact military operational readiness by transmission of disease-causing pathogens or through secondary effects, e.g., annoyance and bites. The focus of this research was to determine if an array of novel controlled release passive devices (CRPD) utilizing the spatial repellent, transfluthrin (TF), as the active ingredient could prevent entry of mosquitoes into military tents for up to 4 weeks. The TF-charged CRPDs were spaced along six strands of monofilament and hung across the tent entrance. Efficacy was evaluated with caged Aedes aegypti to indicate knockdown/mortality effects, and four species of free-flying mosquitoes, Ae. aegypti, Aedes taeniorhynchus, Anopheles quadrimaculatus and Culex quinquefasciatus, to indicate repellent effects. Bioassay cages containing Ae. aegypti were hung vertically at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m above ground level at designated locations inside of the tents. Knockdown/mortality counts were made every 15 min for the first hour, then at 2, 4 and 24 h post exposure. Free fliers were recaptured in BG traps operated from 4 to 24 h post-exposure. Knockdown/mortality was gradual until 4 h post-exposure. This increased to near 100% by 24 h in the treated tent but was < 2% in the control tent. There was a significant reduction in the recapture rates of all free-flying species in the treated tent compared with the control tent. Results indicate that TF-charged CRPDs can significantly reduce the numbers of mosquitoes entering military tents and that the four species were affected similarly by the TF. The needs for additional research are discussed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Deforestation due to unplanned developmental activities leading to the loss of carbon sequestration capability and the release of stored carbon to the atmosphere has been a prime mover of global warming, with changes in the climate evident from the spatio-temporal changes in the rainfall, increase in temperature, and higher instances of vector-borne diseases. Unregulated land cover changes have necessitated prioritizing ecologically sensitive regions to develop location-specific management strategies. This entails estimating spatio temporal LULC changes using multi-resolution spatial data to understand landscape dynamics, which helps in the prudent management of natural resources. Methodology: accounts for land use transitions in the Belgaum district, part of central Western Ghats, through classifying spatial data over a temporal scale using a supervised classifier. Ecologically sensitive regions are prioritized by integrating bo-geo-climatic, ecological, hydrologic, and social parameters. The current communication Results: Temporal land use analyses reveal a loss of forest cover by 2.99% (90.29 sq km) with an increase in the built-up area during two decades (1989 to 2019 and a decline of contiguous interior forests from 16.26% to 6.77%. Geo-visualisation of likely land uses through a hybrid Fuzzy MCE AHP MCA modeling indicates a further decrease of forest cover of 5.6% by 2029. Hence, it necessitates the conservation of ecologically sensitive regions (ESR) at disaggregated levels. Impacts of Land Use changes Reduction in forest cover Change in forest structure Forest Fragmentation Disturbacne of micro-climate Belgaum District: Ecological Sensitive Regions LULC Change Investigation & Modeling Remote Sensing Data Analysis Interpretation: (ESR2), 52% (99 grids) are high to moderate sensitive (ESR3), and the rest 6% (12 grids) are minimal sensitive (ESR4). Prioritization of the region based on its ecological sensitiveness would facilitate decision-makers in the implementation of effective conservation policies focusing on maintaining the ecological integrity through prudent management of natural resources to support livelihood with the sustenance of natural resources. Edge Effect Modeling Likely Land Use through Hybrid Fuzzy AHP MCA Spatial Pattern Analysis Conservation Strategies Regions with exceptionally high sensitivity (ESR1) cover 15% of the spatial extent of the district, 27% (52 grids) cover higher sensitivity

TI  - A Multimodal Data Fusion and Deep Neural Networks Based Technique for Tea Yield Estimation in Pakistan Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving food security has become a major challenge for society. Crop yield estimation is essential for crop monitoring to ensure food security. Manual crop yield estimation is cumbersome and inaccurate and becomes infeasible when scaled up. Machine learning algorithms trained using remotely sensed data have played a vital role in estimating the yield of different crops. Furthermore, to enrich the data provided to a machine learning algorithm, multiple modalities can be combined to improve the predictive performance of these algorithms. In this research, we propose to combine data from multiple modalities, i.e., agrometeorological and remote sensing data, to predict the tea yield at the farm level. The dataset employed in this study is acquired from tea fields of the National Tea and High-Value Crop Research Institute (NTHRI), Mansehra, Pakistan. The remote sensing data of the Landsat-8 satellite is converted to farm-level NDVI statistics through geocoding. Before being used for regression modeling, the final dataset is subjected to some further preprocessing steps, including the selection of features and the optimization of feature sets. This preprocessed data is used to train the three classes of machine learning regression algorithms. Conventional regression algorithms, including Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Multiple Linear Regression applied with and without interaction terms and stepwise feature inclusion with various kernels. Moreover, the following three variants of the ensemble learning methods have also been applied: random forest, gradient boosting, and XgBoost. Finally, this study proposed a neural architecture for tea yield estimation using Landsat imagery. This deep neural network is built using neural architecture search via Bayesian optimization and have three hidden layers, which can perform complex non-linear modeling. Experimental evaluation is performed through 10-fold cross-validation, and the proposed Deep neural network regression model provided the best predictive performance. The model provided a coefficient of determination (R-squared) of 0.99 with a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 108.17 kg/ha, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 10.87 kg/ha, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.26 kg/ha and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.92.

TI  - New Composite Nighttime Light Index (NCNTL): A New Index for Urbanization Evaluation Research
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article employs the 2018 National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) and Luojia_01 nighttime light imagery to construct a New Composite Nighttime Light Index, which is NCNTL. The reliability of NCNTL is verified based on the analysis of urban road network, population, and Landsat normalized difference vegetation index auxiliary data. The research found some differences between the NPP/VIIRS and the Luojia_01 nighttime light imagery in detecting urban areas by comparing and analyzing the urban area factor of the Xinjiang region. Therefore, NCNTL was developed to solve this issue. First, a more significant improvement of correlation was found between NCNTL and the city-related factors than that in a single nighttime light imagery source. Second, the conformation of the NCNTL integration of the characteristics of multisource nighttime light was achieved to a certain extent by using NPP/VIIRS and Luojia_01 to extract urban area features. Third, NCNTL outperformed the single-source data in extracting small- and medium-sized cities in southern Xinjiang. With the application of the new nighttime index, researchers can now fuse nighttime light imagery easily to perform urban analysis. Although the quality of NCNTL is similar to nighttime light imagery processed using multisource auxiliary data, it can greatly reduce the workload in urban analysis and decrease the complex task requirement of collecting data from multiple sources.

TI  - The Status and Influencing Factors of Surface Water Dynamics on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau During 2000-2020
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is rich in water resources with numerous lakes, rivers, and glaciers, and, as a source of many rivers in Central Asia, it is known as the Asian Water Tower. Under global climate change, it is critical to understand the current influencing factors on surface water area in this region. Although there are numerous studies on surface water mapping, they are still limited by temporal/spatial resolution and record length. Moreover, the complicated topographic condition makes it challenging to map the surface water accurately. Here, we proposed an automatic two-step annual surface water classification framework using long time-series Landsat images and topographic information based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results showed that the producer accuracy (PA) and user accuracy (UA) of the surface water map in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2020 were 99% and 90%, respectively, and the Kappa coefficient reached 0.87. Our dataset showed high consistency with high-resolution images, indicating that the proposed large-scale water mapping method has great application potential. Furthermore, a new annual surface water area dataset on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2020 was generated, and its relationship with climate, vegetation, permafrost, and glacier factors was explored. We found that the mean surface water area was about 59 481 km(2), and there was a significant increasing trend (=322 km(2)/year, p < 0.01) during 2000-2020 in the plateau. Greening, warming, and wetting climate conditions contributed to the increase of surface water area. Active layer thickness and permafrost types may be the most related to the decrease of surface water area. This study provides important information for ecological assessment and protection of the plateau and promotes the implementation of sustainable development goals related to surface water resources.

It performs several typical preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojecting and resizing data acquired on a specified time period. All processing parameters can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users can select which layers of the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, which additional quality indicators should be extracted from aggregated MODIS quality assurance layers and, in the case of surface reflectance products, which spectral indexes should be computed from the original reflectance bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files allowing access to the entire time series as a single file are also created. Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options file is also possible, allowing users to automatically update time series related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.

TI  - Integration of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 dataset to extract geological lineaments in complex formations of Tepal mountain area, Shahrood, north Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the detection and extraction of geological lineaments have become an essential analytical technique to find relationships between the characteristics and occurrence of hydrogeology, and tectonic studies. The use of remote sensing, with the progressive devel-opment of image enhancement techniques, provides an opportunity to produce more reliable and comprehensive lineament maps. In this paper, semi-automatic approach based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 radar data is proposed for lineaments extraction and validation. The combined method of linear filtering and automatic line module ensures a high degree of accuracy resulting in a lineament map. Based on identified lineaments, Sentinel1 is more capable of detecting edges than Landsat8, but the primary orientation lineaments extracted from Landsat8 and Sentinel1 were different. So, by combining band6 of Landsat8, and VV and VH polarization of Sentinel1, the area linea-ments were extracted with high accuracy. Rose diagram showed the extracted lineaments' orientation is in good compliance with the region's existing faults. Also, the formations' lineament length density has good consistent with the density of the faults in the geological map.& COPY; 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Contoured beams are widely used for fixed satellite and broadcast satellite services from geostationary earth orbits (GEO). They provide uplink receive and downlink transmit beams from a single antenna where they are shaped to fit close to the geographic coverage region. This paper presents Gaussian beam analysis to predict the minimum coverage area directivity without running time-consuming RF analysis. This analysis is shown to predict antenna directivity values close to more accurate analysis through TICRA software. The analysis is applicable for both contoured beam and spot beam antenna directivity predictions.

TI  - A Generalized Geodesic Distance-Based Approach for Analysis of SAR Observations Across Polarimetric Modes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Present and future sensors are diversifying from traditional quad polarimetric mode of synthetic aperture radar acquisition. Thus, an approach that is interpretative in nature and applicable across polarimetric modes is required. In this context, the geodesic distance (GD)-based approach within the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) literature is seen as an eigenvalue-decomposition free approach to interpret and analyze quad PolSAR data. This approach is highly adaptive toward applications due to its ability to compare the SAR observation with a known scatterer/model, or with another SAR observation in general providing a means for direct interpretation. In this work, we show that the GD (originally defined for the quad polarization mode) is generalizable across any arbitrary SAR polarimetric mode while retaining its simple form for ready computation. We show that the GD-based approach provides level ground for comparison of different polarimetric modes given a fixed application. We demonstrate it using change detection as the chosen application. In addition, we show how the behavior of the three roll-invariant GD-based parameters change under different polarimetric modes (e.g., quad, dual, and compact polarization modes). We also discuss how the GD-based approach can also be adapted to ground range detected (GRD) product data, which is presently available from Sentinel-1 and widely used in many applications. However, in this case, we show that only one of the three GD-derived parameters can be defined. We believe this work will make the GD-based approach important for present and future PolSAR applications cutting across sensors and its available polarimetric modes.

TI  - Proactive Detection (PROTECT) and Safety Planning to Shorten Emergency Department Stays for Psychiatric Patients
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A literature gap exists for interventions to decrease average length of stay (ALOS) for patients with psychiatric presentations at the emergency department (ED). Long ALOSs are often related to sequential assessments of patients with high suicide risk or patients awaiting an inpatient bed. Safety planning may provide opportunities for diverting patients to the community and for reducing ED ALOS. This study reports on the impact of a safety-planning approach based on the PROTECT (proactive detection) framework for suicide prevention.Methods: A complex intervention (comprising leadership, governance, and innovation) was instrumental in embedding a new clinical culture of proactive detection and positive risk management through safety planning at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Practice as usual continued at a comparator nonintervention site (NIS). In total, 24,515 psychiatric presentations over 24 months were grouped into monthly averages for key outcomes, providing a sample size of 24 at each site. A difference-in-differences analysis across sites, preintervention (January-November 2019) and postimplementation (December 2019-December 2020), was used to estimate the intervention's impact.Results: ED ALOS for psychiatric presentations, patients with an ALOS >12 hours, patients with an ALOS >24 hours, and inpatient psychiatric admissions decreased significantly compared with NIS (p<0.01) pre- and postimplementation of the safety-planning intervention.Conclusions: Embedding a recovery-oriented culture of safety significantly reduced ED ALOS for psychiatric evaluations. Leadership, governance, and innovative practices that shift the focus of assessment and care from a mindset of risk prediction to one of prevention through collaborative safety planning as outlined in the PROTECT framework may have far-reaching benefits for patient care.

TI  - Epidemiological Patterns of Seasonal Respiratory Viruses during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Madagascar, March 2020-May 2022
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Three epidemic waves of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) occurred in Madagascar from March 2020 to May 2022, with a positivity rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of 21% to 33%. Our study aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiology of seasonal respiratory viruses (RVs) in Madagascar. We used two different specimen sources (SpS). First, 2987 nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens were randomly selected from symptomatic patients between March 2020 and May 2022 who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and were tested for 14 RVs by multiplex real-time PCR. Second, 6297 NP specimens were collected between March 2020 and May 2022 from patients visiting our sentinel sites of the influenza sentinel network. The samples were tested for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. From SpS-1, 19% (569/2987) of samples tested positive for at least one RV. Rhinovirus (6.3%, 187/2987) was the most frequently detected virus during the first two waves, whereas influenza predominated during the third. From SpS-2, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV accounted for 5.4%, 24.5%, and 39.4% of the detected viruses, respectively. During the study period, we observed three different RV circulation profiles. Certain viruses circulated sporadically, with increased activity in between waves of SARS-CoV-2. Other viruses continued to circulate regardless of the COVID-19 situation. Certain viruses were severely disrupted by the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underline the importance and necessity of maintaining an integrated disease surveillance system for the surveillance and monitoring of RVs of public health interest.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Unmanned Aerial Systems in Geomatics (UASG)

AB  - Algal blooms are commonly grown in the aquatic environment due to the excessive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) present in ponds and reservoirs. Harmful algal blooms can produce toxic compounds that can contaminate the water and cause serious and harmful effects on aquatic life. Along with algal blooms the presence of other organic matter also makes huge gallons of water unfit for consumption. Remote Sensing is one of the efficient and well-established technologies that is used for the detection of phytoplankton present in the water. Monitoring the rapid growth of algal blooms continuously requires high-resolution spatial and temporal satellite data sets that are costly and hard to get. The images acquired through Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) produce high spatial resolution information to continuously monitor the algal bloom growth variation cost-effectively. In this proposed work, the algal bloom presented in the Waddeaplly Lake (Warangal, India) was captured by using a multispectral sensor mounted in DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. RGB images were acquired and pre-processed in Pix4D Mapper Pro to develop the orthomosaic image. NGRDI, NGBDI, GNDVI, and ExGI indices are used in this proposed work to extract the algal bloom matter present in the lake and the data is compared with the Sentinel-2A images for validation purposes. UAV plays an important role in continuously monitoring the algae biomass and developing the precautionary warning system accurately.

TI  - CHRISTIAN SECTARIANS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE IN 1909-1914: ON THE ISSUE OF THE ADMISSION OF MENNONITES AND MOLOKANS TO THE POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH SERVICE
T2  - VOLGOGRADSKII GOSUDARSTVENNYI UNIVERSITET-VESTNIK-SERIYA 4-ISTORIYA REGIONOVEDENIE MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The relevance of the research topic is due to the weak elaboration in the works of modern historians of the problem of participation in civil service in the Russian Empire at the beginning of the twentieth century of representatives of non-Orthodox Christian denominations (Mennonites and Molokans). Methods and materials. The article presents correspondence of the Main Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire on the issue of admission to the postal and telegraph service of Molokans and Mennonites in 1909-1914. This set of documents reflects the practical implementation of the principle of freedom of conscience in the Russian Empire during the period of gradual abandonment of civil rights and freedoms declared in the course of the Revolution of 1905. The documents also record the transformations that took place in the worldview of Mennonites and Molokans. The research uses historical-comparative, problem -chronological methods, methods of archeography and historical source studies. Analysis. The purpose of the article was to identify the attitude of state bodies to the admission to the civil service (on the example of the postal and telegraph department) of candidates from among sectarians (Mennonites and Molokans) after the revolution of 1905-1907. An active liberal reform of the Russian religious legislation there was in 1905-1912. However, the religious factor continued playing a role in entering the civil service. The documents reflect the negative attitude towards the admission of sectarians (primarily Molokans) to the civil service of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Department for Foreign Confessions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They focused on the anti-state tenets of the Molokan creed. The management of the Main Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs in 1914 decided to ban Molokans from taking positions in the postal and telegraph department. It is noted that in the Mennonite ethnoconfession, a revision of the attitude to family and marriage, to the role of women, to civil service begins. Molokans at the beginning of the twentieth century also rejected some tenets of faith, in particular, pacifism and denial of the state oath. Authors' contribution. O.Yu. Redkina identified and prepared archival documents for publication, conducted a historical source and archeographic description. T.P. Nazarova considered the transformation in the worldview of Mennonites and Molokans at the beginning of the twentieth century, their attitude to civil service, to the position of women in the family and society.

AB  - Marine mesoscale phenomena are relevant oceanographic processes that impact on fishery, biodiversity and climate variation. In previous literature, their analysis has been tackled by processing instantaneous remote sensing observations and returning a classification of the observed event. Indeed, these phenomena occur within an extended time range, thus an analysis including time dependence is desirable. Mesoscale Events Classifier (MEC) is an algorithm devoted to the classification of marine mesoscale events in sea surface temperature imagery. By processing time series of satellite temperature observations MEC recognizes the considered area of interest as the domain of one out of a given number of possible events and returns the corresponding label. Objective of this work is to discuss the performance of the MEC pipeline in terms of its capability of correctly capturing the nature of the observed mesoscale process. The evaluation process exploited satellite remote sensing data collected in front of the Portuguese coast.

AB  - Sea observation through remote sensing technologies plays an essential role in understanding the health status of marine fauna species and their future behaviour. Accurate knowledge of the marine habitat and the factors affecting faunal variations allows to perform predictions and adopt proper decisions. This is even more relevant nowadays, with policymakers needing increased environmental awareness, aiming to implement sustainable policies. There is a connection between the biogeochemical and physical processes taking place within a biological system and the variations observed in its faunal populations. Mesoscale phenomena, such as upwelling, countercurrents and filaments, are essential processes to analyse because their arousal entails, among other things, variations in the density of nutrient substances, in turn affecting the biological parameters of the habitat. This paper concerns the proposal of a classification system devoted to recognising marine mesoscale events. These phenomena are studied and monitored by analysing Sea Surface Temperature images captured by satellite missions, such as Metop and MODIS Terra/Aqua. Classification of such images is pursued through dedicated algorithms that extract temporal and spatial features from the data and apply a set of rules to the extracted features, in order to discriminate between different observed scenarios. The results presented in this work have been obtained by applying the proposed approach to images captured over the south-western region of the Iberian Peninsula.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Level PM2.5 Measured by Low-Cost Sensor and Satellite-Based Column Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over Kathmandu
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - A low-cost PurpleAir PA-II sensor was installed, in 2020 at the Institute of Engineering (IOE) Pulchowk Campus, TU located in Kathmandu valley, Nepal, to measure particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). The observation shows that hourly averaged PM2.5 fluctuates bimodally in four seasons (Winter: December, January, and February; Spring: March-May; Summer: June-September; and Autumn: October-November), with the highest levels occurring during morning and evening rush hours. PurpleAir records PM2.5 with a maximum average of 101 +/- 26.31 mu g m-3, in winter, 55.58 +/- 11.42 mu g m-3, in spring, 45.46 +/- 12.16 mu g m-3, in autumn, and a minimum of 22.78 +/- 3.23 mu g m-3, in the summer. Due to rain and diffusion in the vertical atmosphere, PM2.5levels are lowest during the summer. The +/- number for each season represents the standard deviation from the hourly average. AOD550nm data collected by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard two NASA satellites, Terra and Aqua, are compared with simultaneously observed PM2.5. With humidity correction factor f(RH), R2 increases from 0.413 to 0.608 (in winter), 0.426 to 0.508 (in spring), and 0.083 to 0.293 (in autumn). The summer AOD data and PM2.5 are not compared due to a lack of AOD observations. By comparing the column-integrated aerosol data with the surface-level aerosol concentration, this study illustrates the relevance of atmospheric parameters while investigating the reliability of PurpleAir measurements. A cluster analysis of five-day back trajectories of air masses arriving at different altitudes in different seasons indicates that long-range transport of air pollution contributes to MODIS's column integrated AOD by adding aerosol population.

AB  - Deep learning techniques have been evolving at a faster pace offering a common framework for developing models for various applications using remote sensing data. Availability of high resolution LiDAR point cloud and multispectral imagery offers structural and spectral features vital for identifying different crops exhibiting similar spectral similarities. Our work explores the potential of deep machine learning approach for the fusion of ground based terrestrial LiDAR point cloud and satellite-based multispectral imagery for three important horticulture crops, viz cabbage, eggplant and tomato at three different nitrogen (N) levels. The core idea is evaluating the discrimination potential of the crops considering the inherent nature of nutrient effects on the crop growth. The challenges in this study are (i) horticulture crops are relatively lower in height and lack sturdy geometric profiles, (ii) crop identification of a single crop at three N levels requires discernible self-derived features in the Deep Learning (DL) based model. Contrasting with the results obtained network (LiDAR and multispectral), the deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) exhibits substantially higher discrimination performance on the fused dataset when sensitivity to N level is not considered. Considering the sensitivity to N level, results from using LiDAR point cloud alone are comparable with the fused dataset.

TI  - Quantifying Temperate Forest Diversity by Integrating GEDI LiDAR and Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed estimates of forest diversity have become increasingly important in assessing anthropogenic and natural disturbances and their effects on biodiversity under limited resources. Whereas field inventories and optical images are generally used to estimate forest diversity, studies that combine vertical structure information and multi-temporal phenological characteristics to accurately quantify diversity in large, heterogeneous forest areas are still lacking. In this study, combined with regression models, three different diversity indices, namely Simpson (lambda), Shannon (H '), and Pielou (J '), were applied to characterize forest tree species diversity by using GEDI LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery in temperate natural forest, northeast China. We used Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) to assess the importance of certain variables including monthly spectral bands, vegetation indices, foliage height diversity (FHD), and plant area index (PAI) of growing season and non-growing seasons (68 variables in total). We produced 12 forest diversity maps on three different diversity indices using four regression algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Lasso Regression (LR). Our study concluded that the most important variables are FHD, NDVI, NDWI, EVI, short-wave infrared (SWIR) and red-edge (RE) bands, especially in the growing season (May and June). In terms of algorithms, the estimation accuracies of the RF (averaged R-2 = 0.79) and SVM (averaged R-2 = 0.76) models outperformed the other models (R-2 of KNN and LR are 0.68 and 0.57, respectively). The study demonstrates the accuracy of GEDI LiDAR data and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in estimating forest diversity over large areas, advancing the capacity to monitor and manage forest ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluation of river water quality in a tropical South Sumatra wetland during COVID-19 pandemic period
T2  - AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak affected the world badly in this 21st century leading to the closure of all types of anthropogenic activities. It is declared that there was an environmental betterment in names of water quality and air quality during the COVID-19 period. In this study, we analyzed the improvement in water quality by evaluating the suspended particulate matter (SPM) using the remote sensing technique in a tropical South Sumatra wetland i.e., Musi River in Southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The SPM values were estimated from Landsat 8 images Level-2 product. A quantitative and spatial analyses of before (20th May 2019), during (22nd May 2020), and after COVID-19 (28th May 2022) periods were also calculated. Results revealed that the mean SPM values during COVID-19 period (4.56 mg/L) were lower than that before COVID-19 period (8.33 mg/L). Surprisingly, SPM showed an increase of 54% in SPM values after COVID-19 period, compared with during COVID-19 period. The role of human activities including industrial and domestic wastes during the restriction period was the main reason for alteration of pollution loads in the river. Outputs of this study can be used to arrange policies for the sustainable management of aquatic environments and water resources.

TI  - Mapping Chini Lake (Pahang, Malaysia) using Sentinel-2 images to determine the effect of acid mine drainage in the pre- to post-COVID-19 restriction period
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities in the Chini Lake catchment area have been extensive for several years, contributing to acid mine drainage (AMD) events with high concentrations of iron (Fe) and other heavy metals impacting the surface water. However, during the restriction period due to the COVID-19 outbreak, anthropogenic activities have been suspended, which clearly shows a good opportunity for a better environment. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the variation of AMD-associated water pollution in three main zones of the Chini Lake catchment area using Sentinel-2 data for the periods pre-movement control order (MCO), during MCO, and post-MCO from 2019 to 2021. These three zones were chosen due to their proximity to mining areas: zone 1 in the northeastern part, zone 2 in the southeastern part, and zone 3 in the southern part of the Chini Lake area. The acid mine water index (AMWI) was a specific index used to estimate acid mine water. The AMWI values from Sentinel-2 images exhibited that the mean AMWI values in all zones during the MCO period decreased by 14% compared with the pre-MCO period. The spatiotemporal analysis found that the highest polluted zones were recorded in zone 1, followed by zone 3 and zone 2. As compared with during the MCO period, the maximum percentage of increment during post-MCO in all zones was up to 25%. The loosened restriction policy has resulted in more AMD flowing into surface water and increased pollution in Chini Lake. As a whole, our outputs revealed that Sentinel-2 data had a major potential for assessing the AMD-associated pollution of water.

AB  - Reciprocity amongst Maori peoples and the natural world is the foundation of the Maori worldview and natural resource management. Autonomy over resource management and the associated practices is an essential component of Maori wellbeing. This paper investigates the cultural, spiritual, historical, and ecological dimensions of mutton-bird harvesting, to gain a better understanding of the relational approach of Maori natural resource management. Resource management in Aotearoa New Zealand currently lacks the relational approach seen in Maori customary harvests. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the key values that underpin this cultural practice. Semi-structured interviews identified three key themes: harvesting practices, kaitiakitanga (resource management based on a Maori worldview), and whanaungatanga (kinship between people). Harvest practices had a bottom-up governance approach creating diverse harvesting techniques that adapt to local environments. Kaitiakitanga identified mana whenua rights to decision-making power in natural resource management as a requirement for success. Whanaungatanga also identified relationships and collaboration as a vital component. To optimize the best outcomes for the environment, we advocate for a genuine cross-cultural and relational approach and the inclusion of these practices and values in the governance of natural resources in Aotearoa New Zealand.

TI  - Introducing F-Scan to the Concurrent Imaging Mode
T2  - 2023 24TH INTERNATIONAL RADAR SYMPOSIUM, IRS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Radar Symposium (IRS)
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The concurrent imaging mode is a recently proposed technique to increase the imaging capability and flexibility of SAR systems. It allows for simultaneous acquisitions of two areas by increasing the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and interleaving the transmission and the reception of two modes in a pulse-to-pulse manner. Due to intrinsic system limitations, this technique applied to current operational systems, such as the German SAR satellite TerraSAR-X, comes along with strong trade-offs in terms of limited swath width and increased ambiguity levels. For future X-band missions, the frequency scanning (F-Scan) technique is one of the most promising methods to improve these performance parameters. Therefore, this paper derives timing and interference analyses for the integration of F-Scan with the concurrent imaging concept. Additionally, it will be shown that F-Scan can improve the main critical performance parameters of the concurrent mode.

TI  - A Feedforward Neural Network Approach for the Detection of Optically Thin Cirrus From IASI-NG
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of optically thin cirrus is crucial for their accurate parameterization in climate and Earth's system models. This study exploits the characteristics of the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer-new generation (IASI-NG) to develop an algorithm for the detection of optically thin cirrus. IASI-NG has been designed for the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) polar system second-generation program to continue the service of its predecessor IASI from 2024 onward. A thin-cirrus detection algorithm (TCDA) is presented here, as developed for IASI-NG, but also in parallel for IASI to evaluate its performance on currently available real observations. TCDA uses a feedforward neural network (NN) approach to detect thin cirrus eventually misidentified as clear sky by a previously applied cloud detection algorithm. TCDA also estimates the uncertainty of "clear-sky" or "thin-cirrus" detection. NN is trained and tested on a dataset of IASI-NG (or IASI) simulations obtained by processing ECMWF 5-generation reanalysis (ERA5) data with the s-IASI radiative transfer model. TCDA validation against an independent simulated dataset provides a quantitative statistical assessment of the improvements brought by IASI-NG with respect to IASI. In fact, IASI-NG TCDA outperforms IASI TCDA by 3% in probability of detection (POD), 1% in bias, and 2% in accuracy, and the false alarm ratio (FAR) passes from 0.02 to 0.01. Moreover, IASI TCDA validation against state-of-the-art cloud products from Cloudsat/CPR and CALIPSO/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) real observations reveals a tendency for IASI TCDA to underestimate the presence of thin cirrus (POD = 0.47) but with a low FAR (0.07), which drops to 0.0 for very thin cirrus.

TI  - Comparison of Three Different Random Forest Approaches to Retrieve Daily High-Resolution Snow Cover Maps from MODIS and Sentinel-2 in a Mountain Area, Gran Paradiso National Park (NW Alps)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Alpine environment, snow plays a key role in many processes involving ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and human wellbeing. Due to the inaccessibility of mountain areas and the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the snowpack, satellite spatio-temporal data without gaps offer a unique opportunity to monitor snow on a fine scale. In this study, we present a random forest approach within three different workflows to combine MODIS and Sentinel-2 snow products to retrieve daily gap-free snow cover maps at 20 m resolution. The three workflows differ in terms of the type of ingested snow products and, consequently, in the type of random forest used. The required inputs are the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global dataset at 500 m and the Sentinel-2 snow dataset at 20 m, automatically retrieved through the recently developed revised-Let It Snow workflow, from which the selected inputs are, alternatively, the Snow Cover Extent (SCE) map or the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) map, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of consistent resolution with Sentinel-2 imagery. The algorithm is based on two steps, the first to fill the gaps of the MODIS snow dataset and the second to downscale the data and obtain the high resolution daily snow time series. The workflow is applied to a case study in Gran Paradiso National Park. The proposed study represents a first attempt to use the revised-Let It Snow with the purpose of extracting temporal parameters of snow. The validation was achieved by comparison with both an independent dataset of Sentinel-2 to assess the spatial accuracy, including the snowline elevation prediction, and the algorithm's performance through the different topographic conditions, and with in-situ data collected by meteorological stations, to assess temporal accuracy, with a focus on seasonal snow phenology parameters. Results show that all of the approaches provide robust time series (overall accuracies of A1 = 93.4%, and A2 and A3 = 92.6% against Sentinel-2, and A1 = 93.1%, A2 = 93.7%, and A3 = 93.6% against weather stations), but the first approach requires about one fifth of the computational resources needed for the other two. The proposed workflow is fully automatic and requires input data that are readily and globally available, and promises to be easily reproducible in other study areas to obtain high-resolution daily time series, which is crucial for understanding snow-driven processes at a fine scale, such as vegetation dynamics after snowmelt.

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Above-Ground Carbon Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Approach in Loh Buaya, Komodo National Park, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide numerous valuable ecosystem services and can sequester a large volume of carbon that can help mitigate climate change impacts. Modeling mangrove carbon with robust and valid approaches is crucial to better understanding existing conditions. The study aims to estimate mangrove Above-Ground Carbon (AGC) at Loh Buaya located in the Komodo National Park (Indonesia) using novel Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) analyses integrating multiple sources of remote sensing (optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) data. Several steps were conducted to assess the model's accuracy, starting with a field survey of 50 sampling plots, processing the images, selecting the variables, and examining the appropriate machine learning (ML) models. The effectiveness of the proposed XGB-GA was assessed via comparison with other well-known ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. Our results show that the hybrid XGB-GA model yielded the best results (R-2 = 0.857 in the training and R-2 = 0.758 in the testing phase). The proposed hybrid model optimized by the GA consisted of six spectral bands and five vegetation indices generated from Sentinel 2B together with a national DEM that had an RMSE = 15.40 Mg C ha(-1) and outperformed other ML models for quantifying mangrove AGC. The XGB-GA model estimated mangrove AGC ranging from 2.52 to 123.89 Mg C ha(-1) (with an average of 57.16 Mg C ha(-1)). Our findings contribute an innovative method, which is fast and reliable using open-source data and software. Multisource remotely sensed data combined with advanced machine learning techniques can potentially be used to estimate AGC in tropical mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - Modeling of land subsidence induced by groundwater withdrawal using Artificial Neural Network (A case study in central Iran)
T2  - GEOPERSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Subsidence due to the groundwater over-exploitation is a significant problem in some areas which experience urbanization and expansion of agriculture and industry. In this study, the land subsidence of the Aliabad plain of Iran has been modeled using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. In this regard, a multi-layer perceptron has been used to model the land subsidence measured from Sentinel-1 images from 2015 to 2016. Groundwater dropdown, the thickness of alluvial sediments, the aquifer sediments' transmissivity, and elasticity modulus have been considered as four ANN model's inputs variables and land subsidence as a single output. The results show that the ANN model has the ability to predict Aliabad subsidence with good accuracy (R2= 0.74, R=0.94, RMSE= 0.02 m, MSE = 0.0006). Then a sensitivity analysis was performed in order to determine the impact of input parameters and the results indicate groundwater fluctuations as the most effective one. Model validation was achieved by comparing the ANN results with the calculated land deformation by DInSAR technique. An unused dataset including the four specified input parameters have been used, to assess the generalization of the ANN model. The model produces a proper prediction of land deformation with the new dataset.

This study analyses the potential use of high-resolution satellite imagery, provided by the WorldView-2 satellite, in order to assess its viability for monitoring riparian ecosystems. It is performed by calculating the riparian strip quality index (RSQI) and calibrating it with the riparian quality index (QBR). The methodology was implemented in the Umia River, which is characterised by elevated anthropogenic pressures (located in the northwest of Spain). The results obtained by the method have a 92% of veracity and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. The average quality value obtained for the RSQI index was 71.57, while the average value for the QBR was 55.88. This difference could be attributed to the fact that the former does not differ between autochthonous and non-autochthonous vegetation. The areas with more accurate mapping corresponded to stretches of vegetation with optimal cover (80-50%), with good connectivity with the adjacent forest ecosystem and few or no presence of invasive plants. The worst-scoring sites had the next characteristics: low connectivity (< 10%), low forest cover (< 10%) and a higher presence of invasive plants. The degradation of vegetation could be explained by the presence of agriculture and deficient land use rationing caused by the type of ownership of the study area. The application of this index through satellite images will facilitate the environmental governance of multiple ecosystems and in special riparian ecosystems, obtaining a quick and objective methodology, easily replicable in other basins.

TI  - Large-area, 1964 land cover classifications of Corona spy satellite imagery for the Caucasus Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical land use strongly influences current landscapes and ecosystems making maps of historical land cover an important reference point. However, the earliest satellite-based land cover maps typically date back to the 1980s only, after 30-m Landsat data became available. Our goal was to develop a methodology to automatically map land cover for large areas using high-resolution panchromatic Corona spy satellite imagery for 1964. Specifically, we a) conducted a comprehensive analysis on the feature selection and parameter setting for largearea classification processes for 2.5-m historical panchromatic Corona imagery for a full suite of land cover classes, b) compared the pixel-based and object-oriented methods of classifying the land cover, and c) examined the benefits of adding a digital elevation model for the pixel-based and object-oriented land cover classifications. We mapped land cover in parts of the Caucasus Mountains (158,000 km2), a study area with great variability in land cover types and illumination conditions. The overall accuracies of our pixel-based and object-oriented land cover maps were 63.0 & PLUSMN; 5.0% and 67.3 & PLUSMN; 4.0%, respectively, showing that object-oriented classifications performed better for Corona satellite data. Incorporating the digital elevation model improved the overall accuracy to 75.3 & PLUSMN; 3.0% and 78.7 & PLUSMN; 2.5%, respectively. The digital elevation model was especially useful for differentiating forest and snow-and-ice from lakes in mountainous areas affected by cast shadows. Our results highlight the feasibility of accurately and automatically classifying land cover for large areas based on Corona spy satellite imagery for the 1960s. Such land cover maps predate the earliest 30-m Landsat land cover classifications by two decades, and those from high-resolution satellite imagery by four decades. As such, we demonstrate here that Corona imagery can make important contributions to global change science.

TI  - On the Interplay between Desert Dust and Meteorology Based on WRF-Chem Simulations and Remote Sensing Observations in the Mediterranean Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate a series of Saharan dust outbreaks toward the Mediterranean basin that occurred in late June 2021. In particular, we analyze the effect of mineral dust aerosols on radiation and cloud properties (direct, semi-direct and indirect effects), and in turn, on meteorological parameters. This is achieved by running the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) over a domain covering North Africa and the Central Mediterranean Basin. The simulations were configured using a gradual coupling strategy between the GOCART aerosol model and the Goddard radiation and microphysics schemes available in the WRF-Chem package. A preliminary evaluation of the model performances was conducted in order to verify its capability to correctly reproduce the amount of mineral dust loaded into the atmosphere within the spatial domain considered. To this purpose, we used a suite of experimental data from ground- and space-based remote sensing measurements. This comparison highlighted a model over-estimation of aerosol optical properties to the order of 20%. The evaluation of the desert dust impact on the radiation budget, achieved by comparing the uncoupled and the fully coupled (aerosol-radiation-clouds) simulation, shows that mineral dust induces a net (shortwave-longwave) cooling effect to the order of -10 W m(-2). If we consider the net dust radiative forcing, the presence of dust particles induces a small cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere (-1.2 W m(-2)) and a stronger cooling at the surface (-14.2 W m(-2)). At the same time, analysis of the perturbation on the surface energy budget yields a reduction of -7 W m(-2) when considering the FULL-coupled simulation, a positive perturbation of +3 W m(-2) when only considering microphysics coupling and -10.4 W m(-2) when only considering radiation coupling. This last result indicates a sort of "superposition" of direct, indirect and semi-direct effects of dust on the radiation budget. This study shows that the presence of dust aerosols significantly influences radiative and cloud properties and specifically the surface energy budget. This suggests (i) that dust effects should be considered in climate models in order to increase the accuracy of climate predictions over the Mediterranean region and (ii) the necessity of performing fully coupled simulations including aerosols and their effects on meteorology at a regional scale.

TI  - Tissue Biomarkers Predicting Lymph Node Status in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a severe neoplasm that shows early invasiveness of the lymph nodes draining the primary site, with increased risk of distant metastases and recurrence. The tissue biomarker identification could be a new frontier to predict the risk of early lymph node invasiveness, especially in cases considered by current guidelines to be at low risk of lymph node involvement and not requiring evaluation of the sentinel lymph node (SLN). For this reason, we present a narrative review of the literature, seeking to provide an overview of current tissue biomarkers, particularly vascular endothelium growth factors (VEGF), Tetraspanin CD9, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1), D2-40, and gene expression profile test (31-GEP). Among these, 31-GEP seems to be able to provide a distinction between low or high risk for positive SLN classes. VEGF receptor-3 and CD9 expression may be independent predictors of positive SLN. Lastly, LYVE-1 and D2-40 allow an easier assessment of lymph vascular invasion, which can be considered a good predictor of SLN status. In conclusion, biomarkers to assess the lymph node status of cutaneous melanoma patients may play an important role in those cases where the clinician is in doubt whether or not to perform SLN biopsy.

TI  - Exploring and Validating Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals with Solar System Analog Observations
T2  - PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar system observations that serve as analogs for exoplanet remote sensing data can provide important opportunities to validate ideas and models related to exoplanet environments. Critically, and unlike true exoplanet observations, solar system analog data benefit from available high-quality ground- or orbiter-derived "truth" constraints that enable strong validations of exoplanet data interpretation tools. In this work, we first present a versatile atmospheric retrieval suite, capable of application to reflected light, thermal emission, and transmission observations spanning a broad range of wavelengths and thermochemical conditions. The tool-dubbed rfast-is designed, in part, to enable exoplanet mission concept feasibility studies. Following model validation, the retrieval tool is applied to a range of solar system analog observations for exoplanet environments. Retrieval studies using Earth reflected light observations from NASA's EPOXI mission provide a key proof of concept for exo-Earth direct imaging concept missions under development. Inverse modeling applied to an infrared spectrum of Earth from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer achieves good constraints on atmospheric gases, including many biosignature gases. Finally, retrieval analysis applied to a transit spectrum of Titan derived from the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer provides a proof of concept for interpreting more feature-rich transiting exoplanet observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. In the future, solar system analog observations for exoplanets could be used to verify exoplanet models and parameterizations, and future exoplanet analog observations of any solar system worlds from planetary science missions should be encouraged.

T2  - CO-HERENCIA
M3  - Article
AB  - An authentic political theology, a religious analysis of politics, is manifested in the works of Gomez Davila. This article examines the theological sources of modern thought from the perspective of Gomez Davila, to understand secularization as a distinctive political phenomenon of modernity. First, we must explain the significance of the 13th century as a period of ruptures in the Catholic worldview influenced by Averroes. Furthermore, it demonstrates how Averroist ideas find resonance within Pascal and Romanticism, thereby positioning Gomez Davila within the Averroist debate. Finally, a conclusion is presented with the main point being that, for Gomez Davila, only a medieval mystic and fideist is truly reactionary since the modern conception of politics underlies the Thomistic dialogue between faith and reason.

TI  - Mapping the Accumulation of Invasive Aquatic Plants in the Guadiana River, Spain, Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing is very effective for the detection of different types of land cover. Satisfactory results have been obtained in the task of monitoring different types of vegetation covers using satellite images, including areas conquered by invasive aquatic plants such as water hyacinth. Several countries around the world are suffering from negative effects caused by the quick spread of these plants. For instance, several strategies have been carried out for their control and elimination in the Guadiana River, Spain. In this letter, we develop a new methodology capable of automatically finding the geolocation of the most frequent areas of accumulation of invasive aquatic plants in the Guadiana River. Our strategy exploits multispectral time series acquired by European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite. Once the invasive plants have been detected using deep learning [a convolutional neural network (CNN)], a subsequent analysis is carried out using geographic information systems (GIS) to map the areas where water hyacinth patches are most frequently found. In this way, we demonstrate that the management of invasive aquatic plants in the Guadiana River can be successfully carried out.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Distribution of Invasive Aquatic Plants in the Guadiana River, Spain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of invasive aquatic plants is a challenge in many regions worldwide. One of the most invasive species on Earth is the water hyacinth. These plants are harmful to biodiversity and create negative impacts on society and economy. The Guadiana river (one of the most important ones in Spain) has suffered from this problem since the early 2000s. Several efforts have been made to mitigate it. However, invasive plants, such as the water hyacinth, are still present in seed banks at the bottom of the river and can germinate even more than a decade after. In this article, we propose an automatic methodology, based on remote sensing and deep learning techniques, to monitor the water hyacinth in the Guadiana river. Specifically, a multitemporal analysis was carried out during two years using images collected by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite, analyzed with a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that, with our strategy, the river can be monitored every few days, and we are able to automatically detect the water hyacinth. Three experiments have been carried out to predict the presence of water hyacinth from a few scattered training samples, which represent invasive plants in different phenological stages and with different spectral responses.

M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral images collected by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite offer a powerful resource for accurately and efficiently mapping areas affected by the distribution of invasive aquatic plants. In this work, we use different spectral indices to detect invasive aquatic plants in the Guadiana river, Spain. Our methodology uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the baseline classifier and trains it using spectral indices calculated using different Sentinel-2 band combinations. Specifically, we consider the following spectral indices: With two bands, we calculate the normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and normalized difference infrared index. With three bands, we calculate the red-green-blue composite and the floating algae index. Finally, we also use four bands to calculate the bare soil index. In our results, we observed that CNNs can better map invasive aquatic plants in the considered case study when trained intelligently (using spectral indices) as compared to using all spectral bands provided by the Sentinel-2 instrument.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coherent ocean reflections collected at grazing angles by Spire Global's CubeSats are explored to retrieve sea-level anomalies (SLAs) over the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) carrier phase estimations are derived from the 50-Hz I and Q samples generated onboard the low Earth orbit (LEO) CubeSats. The first-order ionospheric phase advancement, troposphere delay, and precise orbit solutions for GPS satellites and CubeSats mitigate the range measurement errors. Comparisons between the collocated specular reflection tracks from various Spire CubeSats and GPS satellite configurations demonstrate the self-consistency of the resulting SLA solutions. The Spire retrievals are then validated against conventional altimetry SLA products. There is a root-mean-square (RMS) difference of similar to 20 cm between the Spire and the gridded model mesoscale SLAs, unless the reflected elevations are very low. To better evaluate the performance of the Spire retrievals, they are examined over sharp ocean topography. About 40% of coherent reflections with elevations above 12 degrees detected the signature of the energetic loop current during the 2020-2021 period. The Spire retrievals were also compared with the collocated Sentinel-3 tracks. One track with elevations above 12(?) demonstrated high correlation and agreement with the Sentinel-3 retrievals. The other two low-elevation tracks showed large magnitude discrepancies, but similar trends after applying appropriate scaling factors. The study demonstrates the potential for GNSS reflectometry's application to SLA mapping while also highlighting where significant improvements in error mitigations are needed. A particularly large error source is the troposphere error for signals with lower elevations.

AB  - Remote-sensing ocean colour studies have already been used to determine coastal water quality, coastal biodiversity, and nutrient availability. In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors, originally designed for agriculture applications, have also enabled water-quality studies of coastal waters. However, since the sea surface is constantly changing, commonly used photogrammetric methods fail when applied to UAV images captured over water areas. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of a five-band multispectral sensor mounted on a UAV to derive scientifically valuable water parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and total suspended solids (TSS), including a new Python workflow for the manual generation of an orthomosaic in aquatic areas exclusively based on the sensor's metadata. We show water-quality details in two different sites along the Maltese coastline on the centimetre-scale, improving the existing approximations that are available for the region through Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery at a much lower spatial resolution of 300 m. The Chl-a and TSS values derived for the studied regions were within the expected ranges and varied between 0 to 3 mg/m(3) and 10 to 20 mg/m(3), respectively. Spectral comparisons were also carried out along with some statistics calculations such as RMSE, MAE, or bias in order to validate the obtained results.

TI  - The Correlation between Proximal and Remote Sensing Methods for Monitoring Soil Water Content in Agricultural Applications
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water shortages have increasingly become a global issue due to the acceleration of climate change. The consumption of freshwater can be reduced to a minimum using water irrigation techniques that are based on conservative methods. For example, one of these is precision irrigation, or PI, which uses advanced digital technology to regulate the amount of water used. The aim is to use the least amount of water necessary for a given purpose. This approach keeps consumption to a minimum while the amount remains effective for its purpose. It is also important to note that the variability which occurs in soil and crops will create different types of conditions. These different conditions will need to be studied so as to determine the correct and adequate dynamics for a water management approach that is efficient. In this study, three investigation methods were developed and compared. The first evaluation was performed on outputs from the geoelectric reading of Automatic Resistivity Profiling (ARP). A second evaluation was performed in real time via a sensor network placed in the soil for the duration of two growing seasons of two different crops. The last evaluation was carried out by using maps of spectral indices obtained by the Sentinel 2 satellites. The correlations between the three methods were evaluated to verify if satellite information may have significant potential in the use of water management in varying conditions. From the results obtained, some correlations have been found from the observations of the three systems under study. This has given a positive input towards using satellite maps which are integrated with simplified proximal sensor networks. The outcome of this technique can improve the efficiency of how to manage water distribution on cultivated land.

TI  - Land use change by the NAICM construction in Texcoco, Mexico State
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mexico's New International Airport megaproject was announced for the first time in 2001 and canceled in 2019; however, most of its construction progress took place during 2012-2018. With its announcement and cancellation there was a land use change and speculation regarding the land value. This study evaluates the impact that the airport construction and cancellation had over land use change in the municipality of Texcoco and neighboring municipalities in Mexico State, and the perception of key players concerning its effects. High-resolution images from the Sentinel-2 satellite were processed for the years 2016 to 2021. Geographic information systems were used to carry out a supervised classification with spectral indices and generate thematic maps of land use with four classes: bare soil, vegetated soil, urban land and water bodies. Interviews were applied to key players for a qualitative analysis of the appreciation of changes and ef fects derived from the airport project. Results show a higher growth rate of urban land from 2016 to 2017, mainly close to the airport building, replacing mostly bare soil. The airport caused discontent in the population by its environmental ef fects and social consequences, such as problems due to freight vehicles traffic. As a result of the airport cancellation, there is bare ground caused by mine exploitation and vehicular insecurity due to incomplete roads.

TI  - Daoist Eco-Humanism and the Authenticity of Natural Life beyond Deontological Ethics
T2  - ASIAN STUDIES-AZIJSKE STUDIJE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, much work has been put into the scholarly understanding and interpretation of the complexities of the Daoist tradition. This includes a critical exploration of its con-tribution to contemporary environmental issues. In this paper, the author reflects on the intersection of Daoist humanism and ecology and highlights the theoretical and histori-cal implications associated with the Daoist approach to the environment. These starting points can tell us much about how Daoist philosophical thought can be successfully con-nected to humanism and the sciences of ecology and the environment. The article points to the possibility of an alternative worldview that can help us, in our limited time and space, nonetheless find the possibility of living some kind of sustainable yet here-and -now moment. In doing so, the author starts from some key questions found in classical texts. Through her analyzes, she examines the potential applicability of classical Daoist thought and practice in China and in the West, both in relation to the modern ecological crisis and to the role and place of human beings within nature and society.

TI  - Data from: Divergent ecological responses to typhoon disturbance revealed via landscape-scale acoustic monitoring
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Abstract Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events across the globe. Understanding the capacity for ecological communities to withstand and recover from such events is critical. Typhoons are extreme weather events that are expected to broadly homogenise ecosystems through structural damage to vegetation and longer-term effects of salinization. Given their unpredictable nature, monitoring ecological responses to typhoons is challenging, particularly for mobile animals such as birds. Here, we report spatially variable ecological responses to typhoons across terrestrial landscapes. Using a high temporal resolution passive acoustic monitoring network across 24 sites on the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, we found that typhoons elicit divergent ecological responses among Okinawa's diverse terrestrial habitats, as indicated by increased spatial variability of biological sound production (biophony) and individual species detections. This suggests that soniferous communities have a diversity of pathways through which they respond to typhoons. That is, spatial insurance effects among local ecological communities provide resilience to typhoons at the landscape scale. Even though site-level typhoon impacts on soundscapes and bird detections were not particularly strong, the data resolution afforded to us by monitoring at scale (high temporal resolution, broad spatial extent) nevertheless enabled detection of spatial heterogeneity in typhoon responses. Further, species-level responses mirrored those of acoustic indices, underscoring the utility of such indices for revealing insight into fundamental questions concerning disturbance and stability. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of landscape-scale acoustic sensor networks to capture the understudied ecological impacts of unpredictable extreme weather events. Methods The dataset contains processed passive acoustic monitoring data from the OKEON-Churamori Project in Okinawa, Japan. This includes processed acoustic indices and individual bird species detections (detected via Kaleidoscope Pros automatic species detection algorithm) from 24 field sites. Data also include GIS data of Okinawa's land use from a LandSat image (see full manuscript for details). The acoustic indices and bird species detections produce time series at each field site, from which we calculated several measures of ecological stability.

TI  - Drought Propagation in Brazilian Biomes Revealed by Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought events have been reported in all Brazilian regions every year, evolving slowly over time and large areas, and largely impacting agriculture, hydropower production, and water supplies. In the last two decades, major drought events have occurred over the country, such as the 2010 and 2015 events in the Amazon, the 2012 event in the Pampa, and the 2014 event in the Cerrado biome. This research aimed to understand drought propagation and patterns over these biomes through joint analysis of hydrological, climatic, and vegetation indices based on remote sensing data. To understand the drought cascade propagation patterns, we assessed precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture (at surface and sub-surface), terrestrial water storage, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and gross primary productivity. Similar drought patterns were observed in the 2015 Amazon and 2012 Pampa droughts, with meteorological and agricultural droughts followed by a hydrological drought, while the 2014 event in the Cerrado was more associated with a hydrological drought. Moreover, the 2015 Amazon drought showed a different pattern than that of 2010, with higher anomalies in precipitation and lower anomalies in evapotranspiration. Thus, drought propagation behaves differently in distinct Brazilian biomes. Our results highlight that terrestrial water storage anomalies were able to represent the hydrological drought patterns over the country. Our findings reveal important aspects of drought propagation using remote sensing in a heterogenous country largely affected by such events.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Assessment of Remotely Sensed Autumn Grass Senescence across Climatic and Topographic Gradients
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and topography are influential variables in the autumn senescence of grassland ecosystems. For instance, extreme weather can lead to earlier or later senescence than normal, while higher altitudes often favor early grass senescence. However, to date, there is no comprehensive understanding of key remote-sensing-derived environmental variables that influence the occurrence of autumn grassland senescence, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Meanwhile, knowledge of the relationship between autumn grass senescence and environmental variables is required to aid the formulation of optimal rangeland management practices. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the spatial autocorrelations between remotely sensed autumn grass senescence vis-a-vis climatic and topographic variables in the subtropical grasslands. Sentinel 2 ' s Normalized Difference NIR/Rededge Normalized Difference Red-Edge (NDRE) and the Chlorophyll Red-Edge (Chlred-edge) indices were used as best proxies to explain the occurrence of autumn grassland senescence, while monthly (i.e., March to June) estimates of the remotely sensed autumn grass senescence were examined against their corresponding climatic and topographic factors using the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), the Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and the Random Forest Regression (RFR) models. The RFR model displayed a superior performance on both proxies (i.e., RMSEs of 0.017, 0.012, 0.056, and 0.013, as well as R(2)s of 0.69, 0.71, 0.56, and 0.71 for the NDRE, with RMSEs and R(2)s 0.023, 0.018, 0.014 and 0.056, as well as 0.59, 0.60, 0.69, and 0.72 for the Chlred-edge in March, April, May, and June, respectively). Next, the mean monthly values of the remotely sensed autumn grass senescence were separately tested for significance against the average monthly climatic (i.e., minimum (T-min) and maximum (T-max) air temperatures, rainfall, soil moisture, and solar radiation) and topographic (i.e., slope, aspect, and elevation) factors to define the environmental drivers of autumn grassland senescence. Overall, the results indicated that T-max (p = 0.000 and 0.005 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively), T-min (p = 0.021 and 0.041 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively), and the soil moisture (p = 0.031 and 0.040 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively) were the most influential autumn grass senescence drivers. Overall, these results have shown the role of remote sensing techniques in assessing autumn grassland senescence along climatic and topographic gradients as well as in determining key environmental drivers of this senescence in the study area

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Malignant Melanoma of the Head and Neck: A Single Center Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the characteristics of patients with head and neck (H&N) melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) and assessed the clinical course of patients categorizing subjects according to SLNB status and melanoma location (scalp area vs. non-scalp areas). Methods: Patients undergoing SLNB for melanoma of H&N from 2015 to 2021 were prospectively characterized according to sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. SPECT/CT had been previously performed. Patients were followed until the first adverse event to evaluate progression-free survival. Results: 93 patients were enrolled. SLNB was negative in 75 patients. The median Breslow index was higher for patients with positive SLNB compared with patients with negative SLNB. In addition, the Breslow index was higher for melanoma of the scalp compared with non-scalp melanoma. The median follow-up was 24.8 months. Progression occurred at the systemic level in the 62.5% of cases. There was a significant association between positive SLNB and progression (p-value < 0.01) of disease, with lower progression-free survival for patients with melanoma of the scalp compared with those with melanoma at other anatomic sites (p-value: 0.15). Conclusions: Scalp melanomas are more aggressive than other types of H&N melanomas. Sentinel lymph node status is the strongest prognostic criterion for recurrence.

TI  - Ideology in Postmodern Time in Russia
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - In strict texts, the general rhetoric of past and present can acquire certain specific meanings. Their choice is determined by the historical size of events and time intervals. In our case, we can talk about the maximum distances, up to the ideologies of postmodernity and even the search for a way out of postmodernity into the hypothetical perspective of Supernovae. If in the great history of civilization Modern is considered the time of ideologies, then Russia has also turned out to be a globally chosen place for the practical and forceful implementation of total megaprojects. These super-large and revealing works of the ideological introduced Soviet Russia into the category, if not the leaders, of all the life-giving pathos of the New Age and the High Modern in particular. The Russian paradox is the unconditional triumph of Marxism as a state, institutionalized worldview, but based on absolute criticism of the ideological one. These features require a consistent distinction between ideology as a system of ideas and a system of institutions. Like the constitution of politics by Carl Schmitt through the binary opposition friend - enemy, ideology is constituted in the opposition faith - knowledge, in the spectrum between almost religion and near philosophy. If the task of philosophy is to reveal the non-obviousness of the allegedly obvious, then the mission of ideology is the manual or mass production of obviousness. Overcoming narrowly political reductionism opens up ideology in its ultimate expansion, distinguishes between systems of ideas and systems of institutions, as well as formats of shadow, latent, diffuse, penetrating, etc. ideology.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT'S ABILITY TO RESIST INFORMATION INFLUENCES
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the problem of development of student's ability to resist information influences at the level of an educational institution. According to the results of the analysis of theoretical sources, it was found that in the conditions of the multiplicity of existing and potentially possible information threats in society, the need to reduce the negative impact of information resources on young people is increasing. In the conditions of military aggression by the rf and its waging of a hybrid war, there is a risk under the influence of information to become a target for manipulation, not to recognize information attacks and become a tool in the hands of the enemy, spreading dubious content and fakes. To identify the practical state of development of the problem, a survey was conducted and its analysis was presented. The analysis confirmed the authors' expectations regarding the trustworthiness of youth to information content and the fragmentation of young people's ideas about the possible negative impact of information technologies, computer applications, social networks and services on their worldview. According to the results of the study of the opinion of teachers/lecturers regarding the ability of young people to resist informational influences and the content analysis of scientific sources, the concept of "ability to resist informational influences" was specified at the level of skills (the ability to take a responsible attitude to the consumption of informational content; the ability to counteract destructive influences based on emotional coloring (psychological manipulations, propaganda, disinformation, etc.); the ability to verify media products for their critical evaluation; the ability to protect one's own information space). The need to develop methodical tools for their formation (forms, methods and means of formation of each skill) is substantiated. The results of a pedagogical experiment to confirm the effectiveness of the developed methodical tools are presented. Statistical analysis was based on the application of the non-parametric sign test. According to the results of the experiment, it was found that the ability to counteract destructive influences based on emotional coloring and the ability to protect one's own information space under the influence of appropriate methodological tools are developed to a greater extent than the ability to take a responsible attitude to the consumption of information content and the ability to verify media products for their critical evaluation. The developed methodical tools can be adapted to curricula of various specialties and integrated into educational disciplines for mastering digital technologies and tools. The development and implementation of information hygiene courses on the basis of the described methodical tools is considered

TI  - Informativeness of the Long-Term Average Spectral Characteristics of the Bare Soil Surface for the Detection of Soil Cover Degradation with the Neural Network Filtering of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term spectral characteristics of the bare soil surface (BSS) in the BLUE, GREEN, RED, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 Landsat spectral bands are poorly studied. Most often, the RED and NIR spectral bands are used to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the soil cover; in our opinion, it is outmoded and seems unreasonable. The study of multi-temporal spectral characteristics requires the processing of big remote sensing data based on artificial intelligence in the form of convolutional neural networks. The analysis of BSS belongs to the direct methods of analysis of the soil cover. Soil degradation can be detected by ground methods (field reconnaissance surveys), modeling, or digital methods, and based on the remote sensing data (RSD) analysis. Ground methods are laborious, and modeling gives indirect results. RSD analysis can be based on the principles of calculation of vegetation indices (VIs) and on the BSS identification. The calculation of VIs also provides indirect information about the soil cover through the state of vegetation. BSS analysis is a direct method for analyzing soil cover heterogeneity. In this work, the informativeness of the long-term (37 years) average spectral characteristics of the BLUE, GREEN, RED, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands of the Landsat 4-8 satellites for detecting areas of soil degradation with recognition of the BSS using deep machine learning methods was estimated. The objects of study are the spectral characteristics of kastanozems (dark chestnut soils) in the south of Russia in the territory of the Morozovsky district of the Rostov region. Soil degradation in this area is mainly caused by erosion. The following methods were used: retrospective monitoring of soil and land cover, deep machine learning using convolutional neural networks, and cartographic analysis. Six new maps of the average long-term spectral brightness of the BSS have been obtained. The information content of the BSS for six spectral bands has been verified on the basis of ground surveys. The informativeness was determined by the percentage of coincidences of degradation facts identified during the RSD analysis, and those determined in the field. It has been established that the spectral bands line up in the following descending order of information content: RED, NIR, GREEN, BLUE, SWIR1, SWIR2. The accuracy of degradation maps by band was determined as: RED-84.6%, NIR-82.9%, GREEN-78.0%, BLUE-78.0%, SWIR1-75.5%, SWIR2-62.2%.

TI  - New Built Land Threat of Martapura River-Implementation of Environmental Sustainability in Banjarmasin City, South Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The threat of environmental degradation of the Martapura River as a result of an increase in built-up land has become a serious problem, so it is important to implement a new method using the integration of calculations of changes in built-up land and the sustainability of river area environmental management. This study aimed to calculate the change in built-up land directly integrated through Rap-RiverBuiltUp quantitative analysis on the environmental sustainability of the Martapura river area, Banjarmasin City. The research method used is the technique of spatial analysis of ETM/Landsat 8 OLI satellite landsat images and analysis of ecological, social and economic sustainability with Rap-RiverBuiltUP analysis. The results of the analysis of built-up land around the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City, have increased by 2.31% over the last 12 years, followed by a growth in population density of f1.5% annually. The implementation of sustainable environmental management needs to be prioritized with the efforts to periodically revise regional spatial planning regulations, especially the boundaries of built-up land to reduce the development of built-up land around the Martapura River. The sustainability status of the built-up area around the Martapura river is currently not sustainable. The ecological dimension indicates a less sustainable status, while the economic and social dimensions indicate a fairly sustainable status. Increasing the sustainability index value of the Martapura river from each dimension in the future is by making the lever factor an input for the management policy of the Martapura river, Banjarmasin City.

TI  - The Ground to Space CALibration Experiment (G-SCALE): Simultaneous Validation of UAV, Airborne, and Satellite Imagers for Earth Observation Using Specular Targets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the Ground to Space CALibration Experiment (G-SCALE) is to demonstrate the use of convex mirrors as a radiometric and spatial calibration and validation technology for Earth Observation assets, operating at multiple altitudes and spatial scales. Specifically, point sources with NIST-traceable absolute radiance signal are evaluated for simultaneous vicarious calibration of multi- and hyperspectral sensors in the VNIR/SWIR range, aboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), manned aircraft, and satellite platforms. We introduce the experimental process, field site, instrumentation, and preliminary results of the G-SCALE, providing context for forthcoming papers that will detail the results of intercomparison between sensor technologies and remote sensing applications utilizing the mirror-based calibration approach, which is scalable across a wide range of pixel sizes with appropriate facilities. The experiment was carried out at the Rochester Institute of Technology's Tait Preserve in Penfield, NY, USA on 23 July 2021. The G-SCALE represents a unique, international collaboration between commercial, academic, and government entities for the purpose of evaluating a novel method to improve vicarious calibration and validation for Earth Observation.

TI  - A method to produce a flexible and customized fuel models dataset
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation of vegetation fires very often resorts to fire-behavior models that need fuel models as input. The lack of fuel models is a common problem for researchers and fire managers because its quality depends on the quality/availability of data. In this study we present a method that combines expert-and research-based knowledge with several sources of data (e.g. satellite and fieldwork) to produce customized fuel models maps. Fuel model classes are assigned to land cover types to produce a basemap, which is then updated using empirical and user-defined rules. This method produces a map of surface fuel models as detailed as possible. It is reproducible, and its flexibility relies on juxtaposing independent spatial datasets, depending on their quality or availability. This method is developed in a ModelBuilder/ArcGis toolbox named FUMOD that integrates ten sub-models. FUMOD has been used to map the Portuguese annual fuel models grids since 2019, supporting regional fire risk assessments and suppression decisions. Datasets, models and supplementary files are available in a repository ( https://github.com/anasa30/PT _ FuelModels ). & BULL; FUMOD is a flexible toolbox with ten sub-models included that maps updated Portuguese fuel models.

TI  - LIBERALISM AND RELIGIOUS MODERATION: THE DILEMMA IN INDONESIA
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - Liberalism was born from European society's con-dition that was oppressed by feudalism. It is a paradigm that is easily accepted due to its principle of freedom and its em-phasis on the human ratio. In its development, liberalism in-fluenced various aspects of the Eastern world, including Is-lam as the religion of the majority of Indonesians. The two basic problems of this research are: (1) how does liberalism influence Islam and (2) what efforts are required to prevent liberalism's influence on Islam. This research used the quali-tative method with the literary and historical approaches. Re-sults showed that liberalism is currently the mainstream para-digm of thought and culture in the world. The atmosphere of thought as well as the constellation of contemporary humani-ty are dominated by this paradigm. One of the important ef-forts to prevent liberalism and extremism is to strengthen the scholarly system of Islam through religious moderation that still strongly holds on to the Qur'an and Hadits, making peo-ple knowledgeable and religious. Serious studies on Islamic thoughts should be conducted to be placed from the Islamic worldview perspective. There should be the development of science using the Islamic concept and perspective, rather than using Western methods to assess Islamic concepts.

TI  - Change Detection of Surface Water of Atfih Spring by Integrated Effect of Rainfall Storms and Geological Structures using Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern border of the Nile valley south of Cairo is distinguished by numerous springs and associated surface water bodies, e.g. Ain El-Sira, Helwan, and Atfih. Except the latter, all of them were disseminated in urban areas, and were hardly detected by remote sensing data. Thus, studying the surface water of Atfih spring is key to understanding the nature of the east Nile spring system. Change in this surface water has been detected based on the integration between the spatiotemporal analysis of the multi-spectral satellite images and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) rainfall data from 1987 to 2019, and the field investigation. The normalized differential water index analysis reveals an increase in the surface area of the Atfih water body by two to three times during the years 2016-2017. The results clarified the relationship between the appearance of the surface water of Atfih spring and rainfall amounts. Another factor controlling the Atfih water body treated in this work is the geological structures. A field survey aided by the processed satellite data revealed the presence of three fault populations: WNW-ESE, E-W to ENE-WSW, and NNE-SSW. The E-W to ENE-oriented faults are the main faults and have a right-lateral strike-slip sense of movement. This fault pattern and Pliocene shale have a substantial impact on the appearance of the Atfih water body. These faults act as a horizontal channel that allows lateral movement of meteoric water through Eocene carbonate, and water recharge occurs at the highly fractured strike-slip transfer zones.

AB  - Problems Statement and Purpose. Libya is the fourth-largest country in Africa and the seventeenth-largest country in the world with area of 1,759,540 sq. km. Most of Libya is located in the Sahara Desert and known for being the driest and most remote regions with limited accessibility. In the 1970s, the Industrial Research Center in Libya began to create geological maps of all Libyan lands derived from analog (hard-copy) aerial photographs and geological field trips to some accessible places. Recently, remote sensing and data integration techniques using GIS are crucial to geological survey and mapping, which provides a useful tool for studying and investigating the geology of remote regions without having to physically access them. The purpose of this study is mapping lithological unites and structural lineaments in the region of Abu Ghaylan -Kiklah -Tighrinna, northwest Libya, using integrated remote sensing data and spatial analysis.Data and Methods. Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT 5), European Remote-Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), geologic maps, and aeromagnetic data were used to map and analyze the lithological and structural lineaments in the study area. Various fused images and IHS transformations were tested for lithological units recognizing. On the basis of spectral characteristics and topographic forms, lithological and structural lineaments were recognized and mapped. The extracted rasters and vectors data were integrated using remote sensing and GIS data integration techniques.Ground Truthing. The purpose of the ground truthing was to validate the DEM-based structural mapping and identify any landslides, streams, or valleys that may appear as edges in the DEM data. Also, determining the locations of the artificial lines, that appears in the processed images as geological lineaments and edges.Results and Discussion. The results indicate that remote sensing data were very useful in distinguishing between various rock units and recognizing geological lineaments in the study area. The generated lithologic map shows fifteen geological formations with apparent and accurate boundaries. The results exposed new geological lineaments in the study area. The direction of the extracted geological lineaments is dominantly NW-SE. The magnetic data reveal the boundary of sedimentary basin in the study area. The basement's depth within the basin varies from 122 meters to 4.5 kilometers. The extracted geological lineaments were analyzed and interpreted to provide more information about the main structural trends affecting the study area. The methods used in this study for remote sensing image analysis and field geological surveys can be used successfully in similar regions of Libya.

TI  - Study of integrated optical and synthetic aperture radar-based temporal indices database for specific crop mapping using fuzzy machine learning model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For specific crop mapping, temporal data is used to handle the spectral overlap between classes. But a number of times, availability of temporal optical remote sensing data is not consistent with the requirements. In this study, a medicinal crop, psyllium husk, was mapped in Jalore district of Rajasthan, India while trying to integrate optical temporal data with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Vegetation indices derived from optical and SAR data, i.e., modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2 (MSAVI2) and radar vegetation index (RVI), respectively, were used to prepare temporal indices databases. Three different temporal layer combinations of MSAVI2 and RVI layers, corresponding to different phenological stages of the target crop, were studied to determine the efficacy of different sensors for crop mapping. The outputs were assessed on the basis of classification efficiency with mean membership difference and variance for determining the effect of heterogeneity in the mapped fields. The results were compared with those obtained using only optical temporal data. From the results obtained, it was observed that the introduction of SAR-based vegetation index as a temporal layer gave good results for fully vegetated and harvest stages of the target crop. The variance within mapped fields was observed as low as 0.0003.

AB  - This study aims to determine the coastal changes in and around the Baku International Sea Trade Port (BISTP) located on the coast of the Caspian Sea for the last thirty years with the integration of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems. For this purpose, Landsat 5 TM dated 18.07.1992 and Landsat 9 OLI dated 30.08.2022 images of the study region were used. The land and sea area was determined by applying the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to the relevant images, then spatio-temporal changes were examined in the study area. In the last stage, Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) and End Point Rate (EPR) methods were applied using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool of ArcGIS 10.3 software. We generated transects along the shoreline at 20m and 400m intervals. The analyses by the SCE method revealed that the most remarkable change in the shoreline during the 30 years was 1253 m at transect 11, east of the port, and the slightest change was 1.8 m to the seaward at transect 23, 11.5 km south of the port. When the results of the EPR method were examined, the most significant change was found in the transect number of 11 - 41.61 meters/year, and the lowest difference was found in the transect number of 23 - 0.06 meters/year. The areal difference between the extracted shorelines of different years was calculated, and an increase of 633 ha for the land area as a result of coastline filling.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote Sensing and Meteorological parameters for Yield Prediction of Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) Crop
T2  - BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Agriculture sector, the farmers need a reliable estimation for pre-harvest crop yield prediction to decide their import-export policies. The present work aims to assess the impact of remote sensing-based derived products with Climate data on the accuracy of a prediction model for the sugarcane yield. The regression method was used to develop an empirical model based on VCI, Historical Sugarcane Yield, and Climatic Parameters of 75 districts of six major sugar-producing states of India. The MOD13Q1 product of MODIS on Board Terra Satellite at 16-day intervals was accessed during the growing season of sugarcane crop with 36 meteorological parameters for experimentation. The accuracy of the model was evaluated using R2, Root Mean square Metric (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and mean square error (MSE). The preliminary results concluded that the proposed methodology achieved the highest accuracy with (R2 =0.95, MAE=5.18, MSE=34.5, RMSE=5.87). The conclusion of the study highlighted that the coefficient of determination can be improved significantly by incorporating maximum and minimum temperature parameters with Remote sensing derived vegetation indices for the sugarcane yield.

AB  - The existence of forests is crucial to the sustainability of life on earth. Automatic forest mapping is necessary to obtain accurate information about the deforestation rate, quantifying, monitoring and mapping. Such information is essential for various schemes to save forest. European satellite Sentinel-2 provide data at thirteen spectral band along with three different spatial resolution level. This satellite data is freely available having medium spatial resolution and faster revisit time, which makes it suitable choice for forest mapping. The objective of this study is automatic mapping of Deciduous and Evergreen Forest by using Sentinel-2 imagery (single date data) in district Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. Two efficient Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been used for the classification i.e., Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Sentinel-2 satellite spectral bands (10 m spatial resolution) namely Near-infrared (NIR), visible light band (Blue, Green and Red) are stacked for classification. In this study, overall classification accuracy attained by RF and k-NN is 81.52% (kappa value of 0.759) and 80.84% (kappa value of 0.751) respectively. Results indicates that both classifiers performed well, however, RF achieved slightly higher (+0.68%) accuracy as compared to k-NN classifier. It is found that RF obtained User Accuracy (UA) and Producer Accuracy (PA) 77.53% and 82.85% respectively for Deciduous Forest. Whereas, for Evergreen Forest UA and PA is 82.26% and 77.95% respectively. On the other hand, k-NN achieved UA of 77.33% and PA of 82.25%. For Evergreen Forest attained UA and PA of 81.81% and 76.95% respectively. Results demonstrated that Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite data is highly suitable for mapping of forests.

AB  - Shared needles are a possible iatrogenic and hematogenous inanimate vector of African Swine Fever virus (ASFV) in farm conditions. To evaluate that possible transmission, sixty, 4-week-old pigs were procured from an ASF free herd free. Upon arrival, pigs were randomly divided into two sets. Set 1 served as seeder pigs, and were randomly allocated to 4 groups. The other pigs were divided into 8 groups, and served as sentinels. Seeder pigs were oronasally challenged with ASFV at high (108 copy numbers/mL), moderate (106 copy numbers/mL) or low (101 copy numbers/mL) challenge titer, except a subgroup that remained unchallenged (negative control). At 7days post challenge (peak viremia), all four seeder groups were intradermally and intramuscularly (IM) injected with a vaccine adjuvant (Diluvac Forte, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) using a needle-free device (IDAL 3G, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands) and conventional needles, respectively. The same needle or needle-free device was then used to inject the same volume of adjuvant into set 2 (n=48) pigs. All pigs were observed for clinical disease daily and assayed for the presence of ASFV DNA by quantitative PCR. All seeder groups developed viremia (except the control pigs). ASFV viremia was detected in all sentinel groups injected via the intramuscular route. Transmission rate from the IM route via conventional needles was positively correlated with virus titer in blood circulation of seeders. Sentinels intramuscularly exposed to needles from high titer challenged seeders displayed more severe and acute clinical disease compared to that of exposed to low titer challenged seeders. No viremia nor clinical signs were observed in the sentinel groups injected via the intradermal route. This study confirmed the hematogenous transmission of ASFV between pigs through needle-sharing.

AB  - Slope stability is highly sensitive to soil moisture variation, especially in the case of highway slopes of central MS, typically constructed on expansive clay. Traditional borehole monitoring techniques do not offer a complete picture of the soil moisture variation throughout the slopes. In contrast to high-altitude, satellite-based remote sensing data, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) with optical cameras and thermal sensors offer higher resolution, data-loaded pixels. Furthermore, UAV flights can be precisely timed to provide ambient sunlight exposure, and the freedom to acquire photos when desired is an added advantage. These advantages make the UAV-based imagery particularly suited for capturing reliable soil moisture variation data within the vadose zone of highway slopes. To this end, in this study, a UAV equipped with FLIR's Zenmuse XT2 dual-sensor payload unit was used to capture temporally spaced optical and TIR images for a highway slope in central Mississippi (MS). The radiometric thermal infrared (TIR) images were post-processed, and pixel temperature values (degrees F) were obtained across the slope's soil surface. The surface temperature readings were then correlated with ground truth soil moisture content (SMC). The ground truth SMC data were obtained through near-surface soil sampling and in situ moisture sensors in the vadose zone. A single-parameter regression model was developed to predict soil moisture from diurnal land surface temperature (LST) variations. Similarly, red, blue, and green (RGB) pixel values were extracted from the optical images and calibrated to obtain an RGB vs. SMC model with suitable fitting parameters. The results of this study are promising and set the stage to implement a time-efficient and non-contact site characterization method to capture soil moisture content variations within the vadose zone.

TI  - Cosmological Methodological Prism of the Conceptual Demarcation of Culture and Civilization
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most expressive definitions of philosophy equates it with the field of knowledge about meaningful demarcation of the semantic boundaries of objects, phenomena and trends. In this context, the conceptual distinction between culture and civilization is quite logical, natural, and even irreplaceable. Nevertheless, such a research and interpretive approach acquired fundamental features only at the beginning of the 20th century and mainly within the limits of the German worldview, semantic and axiological hierarchy. The remaining socio-cultural forms of worldview stylistics continued to prefer the symbiotic and synonymous interpretation of social reality's cultural and civilizational components. The meaningful distinction between culture and civilization has a characteristic feature - a surge of further efforts in this direction is always a consequence of crisis trends in the global world order. In particular, this was the case at the beginning of the 20th century, when the exhaustion of the previous resources of civilizational development and the deepening of contradictions between the main centers of power caused by this factor led to a resolution in the form of the First World War. The second wave of careful attention to the meaningful demarcation of culture and civilization occurred in the 1930s when the tendency of the inability or unwillingness to resolve existing global contradictions led to the situation slipping into the maelstrom of the Second World War. Currently, there is an unequivocal awareness of the inappropriateness of the illusions associated with the global world order formed on the ruins of the Berlin Wall according to the patterns of neoliberalism. The world at the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century feels confused about its inability to respond to the challenges of modernity convincingly and promptly. This state of affairs once again objectively and logically actualizes the interest in a meaningful demarcation of culture and civilization since it is precise with these tools that the answers to the crisis status quo and the prospects for overcoming it are connected. An important task for concretizing this research goal is the cosmological prism of the conceptual demarcation of culture and civilization.

TI  - The Impact of Public Health, Socioeconomic, and Environmental Factors on SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Mortality Rates in Peru: Exploring the Role of Obesity
T2  - NUTRICION CLINICA Y DIETETICA HOSPITALARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Although several factors contributed to the rates of infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, obesity seemed to have played a larger role than most within the first several months of the pandemic. In addition, both preexisting health conditions and poor environmental condi-tions seemed to have added to higher levels of infection and mortality in several regions of the country. This study aimed to explore the impact of public health, socio-economic and environmental factors on the rate of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 on gender and age groups in Peru.Methods: We explored the relationships, using Pearson's correlation and stepwise linear regression, between the in-fection and mortality cases per 100,000 individuals with pub-lic health data (obesity prevalence, total number of health in-frastructure, hypertension prevalence, active smokers, tuberculosis cases freely available from the Ministry of Health of Peru), socio-economic data (health needs not met, child-hood malnutrition, access to potable water, access to chlori-nated water system from National Institute of Statistics and Informatics of Peru) and environmental data (NO2 concen-tration from the Sentinel-2 satellite) in Peru. We used con-firmed cases from the 26 department level jurisdictions from 2020, before known variants were registered within the country and focused on gender and age groups, as well as case-fatality rate.Results: Multiple linear regression models indicate obe-sity, air quality, access to chlorinated water system, and prevalence of smoking are influential factors in the distribu-tion of infection and mortality for middle-age and elderly fe-male and male groups, but prevalence of TB and health needs not met were more important for children and young adults in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with NO2 concentration.Conclusions: Obesity, exposure to poor air quality, and so-cio-economic conditions are significant factors in the morality of individuals above the age of 40 for both men and women, while other health factors appear to be more important to those younger than 40. The combination of these factors played a significant role during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Peru in 2020.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing in Lithological Mapping of Umm Tawat Precambrian Rock Assemblage, North Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Precambrian rock assemblages of Umm Tawat area in the North Eastern Desert of Egypt have a distinctive ENE-trending exposure of Hammamat sediments (HS) between the Gebel Gattar granitic pluton and the volcanoclastic succession of Gebel El Dokhan. The present work applies the Landsat-8 data and image processing techniques such as spectral signature, principal component analysis, decorrelation stretch, and band ratios to map the various Precambrian rock units and the lithofacies of the HS and their geological contacts. The recognized mappable units of this assemblage are fully identified by their spectral signature, field verification, lineament analysis, and petrographic description. The resultant high-resolution lithological map based on the maximum likelihood algorithm demonstrates ten fully discriminated mappable units of younger granitoid and HS lithofacies units besides the Dokhan volcanics and metagabro-diorite rock units. The identified five HS lithofacies units are brownish gray conglomerate and sandstone HSf1, a green conglomerate with dominant volcanic fragments HSf2, fine-grained sediments of graywacke and silty-mudstone HSf3, interbedded conglomerates and siltstone with uranium enrichments related to the intrusive contact HSf4, and thermally metamorphosed pelitic sediments HSf5. Remote sensing techniques have been applied for the first time to reveal detailed facies variation of the Hammamat sediments of Umm Tawat. Finally, the results aforementioned above are imported to the Arc GIS database to update the geologic map with precise rock unit boundaries.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study stems from the necessity to refine the methods of medium-term flood forecasts when sufficient hydrometeorological data are not available. The purpose of the work is to assess probable application of spatially distributed precipitation models to forecast runoff volume of flood, to develop stochastic models for predicting flood volume and its maximum discharge using hydrometeorological observation data, distributed precipitation datasets from reanalysis and remote sensing data of high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods include geoinformation, complex geographical and hydrometeorological analysis, statistical methods (correlation and regression analysis). Results. The Chumysh basin moistening was estimated due to the data from spatially distributed precipitation models and hydrometeorological observation data; the relationship of total precipitation with runoff volume and maximum flood discharge was analyzed. A comparative evaluation of the obtained dependencies made it possible to identify key predictors for deriving the multiple linear regression equation. The statistical model was developed for predicting volumes and maximum discharges of Chumysh flood at Talmenka settlement using hydrometeorological observation data and reanalysis ones of high spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - Remote sensing provides ample scope to map the species of mangroves of swampy and hostile habitats with good accuracy. Our study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two classification approaches - pixel-based and object-based using a standard and yet robust, supervised, machine learning ensemble classifier - Random Forest on two multispectral satellite images; very high- resolution Worldview-2 (WV2) and medium-resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) of Gorai Creek, West Coast of India, acquired in the same season. A multiresolution segmentation algorithm is used for object-based image analysis (OBIA) based on Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (G1), Gray Level Difference Vectors (G2), and a few non-textural features. Random Forest (RF) classifier is applied to their dimensionality-reduced components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Pixel-based RF classification is also performed on the selection of homogeneous patches of regions of interest (ROIs) based on Jeffries- Matusita (JM) Distance. The accuracy report for the classification shows that S-2 imagery performs better than WV-2 for pixel- based classification but for objectbased classification, WV-2 was able to extract species information better than S-2.

TI  - Delimitation of burned areas in Chile based on dNBR thresholds adjusted according to region and land cover
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The delimitation of burned areas is an important step for the study of forest fires, and the use of satellite remote sensing allows a scalable methodology. Previous studies use a dNBR threshold to determine the presence of burned areas, but this threshold is affected by vegetation variability determined by the geography of the study area and land use coverage. For them, the difference in the normalized index of burned areas (dNBR) was used to study the mega fires that affected the central zone of Chile in the summer of 2017. An automated methodology was developed that, based on satellite images and polygons of the burned areas provided by the National Forestry Corporation of Chile (CONAF) generates a set of dNBR thresholds differentiated by administrative region and land use. The application of differentiated dNBR thresholds significantly improves the accuracy of the burnt area delimitation model, although it does not achieve satisfactory results for all land uses. This methodological advance will make it possible to improve the design and control of policies for the prevention, conservation and restoration of ecosystems affected by forest fires.

TI  - URBAN AFFORESTATION AND ITS RELATION TO TEMPERATURES AND THERMAL DISCOMFORT ZONES IN THE CAMPINAS NEIGHBORHOOD- GOIANIA (GO)
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work sought to understand the relationship between the deficit of afforestation with heat islands and with the zones of thermal comfort and discomfort in the neighborhood of Campinas. From the methodological processes, the research included an analysis through the collection of temperature data; through the treatment of thermal images obtained by the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Satellite of the years 2016 and 2020, and through the comparison with the Land Use and Land Cover map. To understand the perception of people who work and/or live in the neighborhood, about the relationship of vegetation deficit with thermal comfort, anonymous questionnaires were applied via social networks. The participation of the population -a step scheduled in the schedule of the work plan of the Extension Project (Mapping Collaborative: mapping of urban afforestation and its relationship with heat islands and thermal comfort zones in Goiania (GO)) -in the identification of these areas provided the community the possibility of participating effectively in the process of characterization of these places, in addition to the indication of ways to mitigate the effects of the phenomenon studied. The results showed (a) variations between maximum and minimum temperatures reaching 4.4 degrees C; (b) the years 2016 and 2020 presented three points (2, 7 and 9) with high temperatures, affirming the observations of the interviewees and (c) the indication of October 24th Avenue as the place of greatest thermal sensation.

TI  - The necropopulist violence of the Bolsonaro government and the attack on the constitutionalproject of social and democratic social welfare state in Brazil
T2  - QUAESTIO IURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this work is to demonstrate the necropopulist character of the Bolsonaro government's narratives and political actions and the potential for violence contained in them against the constitutionalized project of social and democratic welfare state. In the first place, the article demonstrates the ideological bases of the social democracy that was affirmed in the constitutional text through a model of the welfare state. Then, from a typology of violence, it analyzes the possibility of considering as violence government actions that, apparently, can be considered as political options based on a particular worldview. Finally, it seeks to unveil the character of objective violence (systemic, structural and symbolic) that is ingrained in the speeches, interviews and actions of the Bolsonaro government, which directly affect and aim to disrupt the civilizatory-constitutional advance that represented the positivization of the Social and Democratic Welfare State in the Constitution of the Republic of 1988.

TI  - Per-Pixel Uncertainty Quantification and Reporting for Satellite-Derived Chlorophyll-a Estimates via Mixture Density Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixture density networks (MDNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for estimating water-quality indicators, such as chlorophyll-a (Chla) from multispectral imagery. This study validates the use of an uncertainty metric calculated directly from Chla estimates of the MDNs. We consider multispectral remote sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs) for three satellite sensors commonly used in aquatic remote sensing, namely, the ocean and land colour instrument (OLCI), multispectral instrument (MSI), and operational land imager (OLI). First, a study on a labeled database of colocated in situ Chla and R-rs measurements clearly illustrates that the suggested uncertainty metric accurately captures the reduced confidence associated with test data, which is drawn for a different distribution than the training data. This change in distribution maybe due to: 1) random noise; 2) uncertainties in the atmospheric correction; and 3) novel (unseen) data. The experiments on the labeled in situ dataset show that the estimated uncertainty has a correlation with the expected predictive error and can be used as a bound on the predictive error for most samples. To illustrate the ability of the MDNs in generating consistent products from multiple sensors, per-pixel uncertainty maps for three near-coincident images of OLCI, MSI, and OLI are produced. The study also examines temporal trends in OLCI-derived Chla and the associated uncertainties at selected locations over a calendar year. Future work will include uncertainty estimation from MDNs with a multiparameter retrieval capability for hyperspectral and multispectral imagery.

TI  - Assessing Local Climate Change by Spatiotemporal Seasonal LST and Six Land Indices, and Their Interrelationships with SUHI and Hot-Spot Dynamics: A Case Study of Prayagraj City, India (1987-2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - LST has been fluctuating more quickly, resulting in the degradation of the climate and human life on a local-global scale. The main aim of this study is to examine SUHI formation and hotspot identification over Prayagraj city of India using seasonal Landsat imageries of 1987-2018. The interrelationship between six land indices (NDBI, EBBI, NDMI, NDVI, NDWI, and SAVI) and LST (using a mono-window algorithm) was investigated by analyzing correlation coefficients and directional profiling. NDVI dynamics showed that the forested area observed lower LST by 2.25-4.8 degrees C than the rest of the city landscape. NDBI dynamics showed that the built-up area kept higher LST by 1.8-3.9 degrees C than the rest of the city landscape (except sand/bare soils). SUHI was intensified in the city center to rural/suburban sites by 0.398-4.016 degrees C in summer and 0.45-2.24 degrees C in winter. Getis-Ord G(i)* statistics indicated a remarkable loss of areal coverage of very cold, cold, and cool classes in summer and winter. MODIS night-time LST data showed strong SUHI formation at night in summer and winter. This study is expected to assist in unfolding the composition of the landscape for mitigating thermal anomalies and restoring environmental viability.

TI  - Rasulan as a Javanese Slametan Tradition <i>on Compromising the Changing of Society</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN CULTURE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rasulan is a tradition in Java; it's one form of Javanese Slametan (a ritual meal). This research aims to describe the Rasulan, explains the role of the worldview and how the elements of culture, religion and the spirit of the nationality are compromised and changed therein. This research is a mix of library and field studies, utilizing the theory of worldview. Results show that Rasulan is not a religious tradition, but a harvest celebration, taking the form of gratitude in the agrarian society. It consists of world views of space, time, causality and self-other relationships, which constructs how people practice Rasulan within community life. Compromise in the values of tradition, religion and social life occurs with the incorporation of religious events on respecting and appreciating religious groups in the community. This study contributes to the strengthening of the view that Rasulan is not a religious ritual, but a cultural activity.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF FEMALE IMAGES IN THE I.A. GRINEVSKAYA'S WORKS OF THE 1890s-1900s
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the evolution of female images in the literary and critical writings of I.A. Grinevskaya in 1890s-1900s. The analysis focuses on early works of the author, which reproduce different female types, their life and experiences. In the 1890s Grinevskaya describes recognizable situations in the home and family and women in their traditional roles. By the 1900s her attention shifts to serious social problems, which affects on her interest towards certain types of women, men and their relationships. In the play "Bab" (1903), the main characters, the prophet Bab and his follower Khuret, depart from traditional gender patterns of behavior. One of the main storylines is the women's movement led by Khuret, which touches upon issues relevant to women at the beginning of the 20th century: women's education, prejudice against the age, appearance and behavior of women. The play "Bab" marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of Grinevskaya's creativity and worldview. In the late 1900s she herself becomes a member of the women's movement, and the problems identified in the play will be discussed in her lectures in the 1900s.

T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Abstact: The article focuses on the analysis of the main trends and approaches to understanding the role of Orthodoxy in the historical past, state and public life, which developed and were used by the academic intelligentsia of the Ukrainian SSR in the second half of the 1980s. It was during this period that those approaches to understanding the role of the Church and religion in the life of the country were formed, which later found its embodiment in the state policy and public rhetoric of the independent Ukraine. Modern historiography emphasises the need for a comprehensive analysis of the Soviet religious narrative, identifying internal factors of Soviet society that determined the direction and nature of secular trends of the late Soviet period. However, the number of specific case studies of the Ukrainian late Soviet narrative is very limited. The present work is intended to fill a historiographical gap in this context. Based on the analysis, it was found out that the understanding of the role of Orthodoxy in public life among the late Soviet scientifi c and public intelligentsia of the Ukrainian SSR was characterised by an interweaving of complex and contradictory trends. On the one hand, it was characteristic of a rather strong desire to preserve atheistic ideological narratives when considering church-historical and religious issues. On the other hand, there is a clear tendency to a critical understanding of atheistic ideology, which, however, very rarely went beyond the protection of "true" Marxism-Leninism. Based on the materials of scientifi c and non-fi ction periodicals, the process of ideological formation of atheist religious scholars as the advanced intelligentsia is traced. The increased interest in national issues in church history and culture was combined with the use of old methodological tools in relation to religion. Church periodicals were characterised by a significant influence of the historical features of Perestroika on the worldview of the clergy and church-related authors.

TI  - Wintertime Polynya Structure and Variability From Thermal Remote Sensing and Seal-Borne Observations at Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica's ice shelves play a critical role in modulating ice loss to the ocean by buttressing grounded ice upstream. With the potential to impact ice-shelf stability, persistent polynyas (open-water areas surrounded by sea ice that occur across multiple years at the same location) at the edge of many ice-shelf fronts are maintained by winds and/or ocean heat and are locations of strong ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. However, in situ observations of polynyas are sparse due to the logistical constraints of collecting Antarctic field measurements. Here, we used wintertime (May-August) temperature and salinity observations derived from seal-borne instruments deployed in 2014, 2019, and 2020, in conjunction with thermal imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) to investigate spatial, temporal, and thermal structural variability of polynyas near Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Across the three winters considered, there were 176 anomalously warm ( $3\sigma $ from background) seal dives near the PIG ice front, including 26 dives that coincided with MODIS images with minimal cloud cover that also showed a warm surface temperature anomaly. These warm surface temperatures correlated with ocean temperatures down to 150 m depth or deeper, depending on the year, suggesting that MODIS-derived surface thermal anomalies can be used for monitoring polynya presence and structure during polar night. The finer spatial resolution (100 m) of TIRS wintertime thermal imagery captures more detailed thermal structural variability within these polynyas, which may provide year-round insight into subice-shelf processes if this dataset is collected operationally.

TI  - Assessment of changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of farmlands of Stavropol Territory, Russia, during the period of active vegetation in 2020 based on medium spatial resolution images
T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. Assess changes in the NDVI of agricultural land in Stavropol Territory under the influence of weather and climate conditions. Methods. Based on earth remote sensing data, the spectral/vegetation index NDVI was calculated. We used data from the Meteor-M satellite with a spatial resolution of 60 m for the active vegetation period of 2020 (May to September), which made it possible to calculate the NDVI value at different times of the active vegetation period of the main types of agricultural land in the Stavropol Territory. To explain the spatial and temporal variability of NDVI, an analysis of the conditions of heat and moisture supply was carried out using Walter's climatograms at weather stations located in the steppe and semi-desert landscapes of Stavropol Territory.Results. In 2020, the period of active vegetation in the steppe and semi desert landscapes of Stavropol Territory began in the first ten days of April, when the air temperature rose above +10 & DEG;C, and ended in mid-October. In accordance with the change in heat and moisture supply, the NDVI value changed: in general, maximum values were observed in spring and early summer and, as aridity increased, the areas corresponding to low NDVI values increased everywhere. In the steppe zone, where the main crops of winter wheat are located, the NDVI value decreased from 0.45-0.3 at the beginning of the active vegetation period to 0.15 at the end. NDVI values of 0.15-0.30, corresponding to different types of herbaceous vegetation, prevailed at the end of the active vegetation period.Conclusion. The spatial and temporal distribution of the NDVI value over the territory of the Stavropol Territory reflects, first of all, changes in the conditions of heat and moisture supply. The timing of the course of the phenological phases of natural and cultivated vegetation depends on the latter. 2020 was characterized by sufficient moisture at the beginning of active vegetation, as reflected in the high density of seedlings, and, accordingly, a large area of NDVI, corresponding not only to herbaceous, but also to shrubby vegetation within the steppe landscapes. The increase in moisture deficit and harvesting in the second half and end of summer leveled the differences between the steppe and semi-desert landscapes, since the maximum areas were occupied by territories with NDVI values of 0.15-0.3.

AB  - The northwestern margin of the Red Sea is developed as several rift-related fault blocks. These fault blocks comprise two mega tectono-stratigrahicsuccessions; the Pre-riftsuccessioncould be sub-divided intothe Precambrian Basement rocks and theUpperCretaceous-Lower Eocenedeposits,whilst the Syn-rift sequence includesthe Oligocene to Quaternary deposits. Lithologic differentiation of these rock units being encountered in thestudied area is accomplishedutilizing different remote sensing imagery enhancement techniques of the OLI data (Landsat-8) aided with field verification. Spectral signature analysis of different rock units, false-color composite, band-ratio, principle component analysis, minimum noise fraction, and independent component analysis are powerful tools in discrimination of the main rock units.The maximum likelihood distance supervised classificationtechnique is a robust tool in the identification of the contact between the different rock units. Radiometrically terrain corrected (RTC) DEM data extracted from PALSAR with a spatial resolution of 12.5m is utilized for the construction of a 3D perspective view image of the studied area. The present study offers a unique method for lithologic discrimination of main rock unitsutilizing OLI images, and introduces an enhanced high-resolution structural map of the studied area aided with field verification.

TI  - Integrating Unordered Time Frames in Neural Networks: Application to the Detection of Natural Oil Slicks in Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we explore the use of novel neural-network architectures to distinguish natural seepages from artificial slicks in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. They exploit a distinctive property of natural seepages, which is their temporal recurrence in the same geographical area. This information can be captured in different SAR images acquired at the same location over time, but not necessarily at a regular time frequency. The proposed neural-network architectures are then built as specific block layers, which efficiently treat the unordered temporal information, followed by more conventional neural-network layers, which are widely used for image classification. Different block layers for unordered temporal information are compared on Sentinel-1 images acquired in the Aegean Sea. Following data augmentation steps, our dataset contains a consistent subset of images gathered among 16000 time-patches. We demonstrate that nonlinear time-based block layers and block layers that avoid information bottlenecks are most efficient to discriminate between natural and artificial oil spills. Compared with standard neural-networks which use single time frames, the integration of unordered temporal information increases the overall accuracy (OA) from 82% to 92% on our dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - AROSICS is a python package to perform automatic subpixel co-registration of two satellite image datasets based on an image matching approach working in the frequency domain, combined with a multistage workflow for effective detection of false-positives. It detects and corrects local as well as global misregistrations between two input images in the subpixel scale, that are often present in satellite imagery. The algorithm is robust against the typical difficulties of multi-sensoral / multi-temporal images. Clouds are automatically handled by the implemented outlier detection algorithms.

AB  - AROSICS is a python package to perform automatic subpixel co-registration of two satellite image datasets based on an image matching approach working in the frequency domain, combined with a multistage workflow for effective detection of false-positives. It detects and corrects local as well as global misregistrations between two input images in the subpixel scale, that are often present in satellite imagery. The algorithm is robust against the typical difficulties of multi-sensoral / multi-temporal images. Clouds are automatically handled by the implemented outlier detection algorithms.

TI  - Analysis of COVID-19 Lockdown Effects on Urban Air Quality: A Case Study of Monterrey, Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several millions of deaths and forced the world population to a new normality. This study aims to analyze the air quality variation of several gaseous pollutants (CO, NO2, SO2, O-3, PM10, and PM2.5) during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock period in the city of Monterrey using ground-based measurements. In this research, we proposed to use a control period of previous years to identify parameter variation due to local climate. The results showed a drastic decrease in measured contaminants during the lockdown period as follows: SO2 (-41.9%) > PM10 (-30.5%) > PM2.5 (-25.6%) > NO2 (-14.9%) > CO (-9.8%) compared to the control period (2017-2019). The O-3 was the only air pollutant that showed an opposite trend, increasing during lockdown (+15%) and unlock (+2.2%), whereas CO (-16.6%) and NO2 (-30.6%) were further decreased. Moreover, using OMI/AURA satellite data, we detected a NO2 tropospheric column reduction by -1.9% during lockdown concerning the same period in the control interval. Moreover, we found a significant improvement in the Air Quality Index (AQI) due to the lockdown. Our findings indicate an association between air pollutants and economic activity and can be used in future strategies to improve urban air quality.

TI  - Geospatial availability of breast cancer treatment modalities and hypothetical access improvement in Ghana: A nationwide survey.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Breast cancer in Ghana is a growing public health problem with increasing incidence and poor outcomes. Lack of access to comprehensive treatment in Ghana may be a contributing factor to its high mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the availability of treatments nationwide and systematically identify high yield areas for targeted expansion. We conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide hospital-based survey from November 2020-October 2021. Surveys were conducted in person with trained research assistants and described hospital availability of all breast cancer treatments and personnel. All individual treatment services were reported, and hospitals were further stratified into levels of multi-modal treatment modeled after the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Framework treatment recommendations for low-resource settings. Level 3 included Tamoxifen and surgery (mastectomy with axillary lymph node sampling); Level 2 included Level 3 plus radiation, aromatase inhibitors, lumpectomy, and sentinel lymph node biopsy; Level 1 included Level 2 plus Her2 therapy and breast reconstruction. Hospitals were identified that could expand to these service levels based on existing services, location and personnel. The distance of the total population from treatment services before and after hypothetical expansion was determined with a geospatial analysis. Of the 328 participating hospitals (95% response rate), 9 hospitals had Level 3 care, 0 had Level 2, and 2 had Level 1. Twelve hospitals could expand to Level 3, 1 could expand to Level 2, and 1 could expand to Level 1. With expansion, the population percentage within 75km of Level 1, 2 and 3 care would increase from 42% to 50%, 0 to 6% and 44% to 67%, respectively. Multi-modal breast cancer treatment is available in Ghana, but it is not accessible to most of the population. Leveraging the knowledge of current resources and population proximity provides an opportunity to identify high-yield areas for targeted expansion.

TI  - Annual biomass data (2001-2021) for southern California: above- and below-ground, standing dead, and litter
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Biomass estimates for shrubland-dominated ecosystems in southern California have, to date, been limited to national or statewide efforts which can underestimate the amount of biomass; are limited to one-time snapshots; or estimate aboveground live biomass only. We developed a consistent, repeatable method to assess four vegetative biomass pools from 2001-2021 for our southern California study area (totaling 6,441,208 ha), defined by the Level IV Ecoregions (Bailey 2016) that intersect with USDA Forest Service lands (Figure 1). We first generated aboveground live biomass estimates (Schrader-Patton and Underwood 2021), and then calculated belowground, standing dead, and litter biomass pools using field data in the peer-reviewed literature (Schrader-Patton et al. 2022) (Figure 2). Over half (52.3%) of the study area is shrubland, and our method accounts for three post-fire shrub regeneration strategies: obligate resprouting, obligate seeding, and facultative seeding shrubs. We also generate biomass estimates for trees and herbs, giving a total of five life form/life history types. These data provide an important contribution to the management of shrubland-dominated ecosystems to assess the impacts of wildfire and management activities, such as fuel management and restoration, and for monitoring carbon storage over the long term. The biomass data are a key input into the online web mapping tool SoCal EcoServe, developed for US Department of Agriculture Forest Service resource managers to help evaluate and assess the impacts of wildfire on a suite of ecosystem services including carbon storage. The tool is available at https://manzanita.forestry.oregonstate.edu/ecoservices/ and described in Underwood et al. (2022). REFERENCES Bailey, R.G. 2016.

The study area, totaling 6,441,208 ha, is defined by the 42 Level IV Ecoregions (Bailey 2016) that intersect the four southern US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Forests in southern California (Figure 1). We created biomass raster layers (30m spatial resolution) by modeling a set of covariates (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], precipitation, solar radiation, actual evapotranspiration, aspect, slope, climatic water deficit, elevation, flow accumulation, landscape facets, hydrological recharge and runoff, and soil type) to predict AGLBM using 766 field plots of biomass from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); the Landfire Reference Database (LFRDB) plot data; and other research plots. The dates of field data spanned 2001-2012. The NDVI raster data were derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI multispectral satellite data (onboard Landsat 5, 7, and 8, respectively). NDVI data were composited from all available Landsat images for the months of July and August for each year 2001-2021. We also downloaded annual precipitation data for each water year (October 1 - September 30) 2001-2021 from PRISM (http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/). For each field plot, we extracted the raster values for all covariates; NDVI and precipitation data were matched to the year of plot visit. We predicted AGLBM using the set of 17 covariates (Random Forest [RF] algorithm in R statistical computing software). To create an AGLBM raster surface for each year 2001-2021, we used NDVI and precipitation raster data specific to each year in the RF (using predict function in the R raster module) (see Schrader-Patton and Underwood 2021 for details). To estimate other shrubland biomass pools (standing dead, litter, and below ground) we employed a multi-step process: 1) First, we segregated the study area by community type using the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CWHR) data (Mayer and Laudenslayer 1988). The wildland vegetation of the study area (excluding agricultural, urban, water, and barren classes) contains 45 CWHR classes, 14 of which are [greater than]=0.75% of the wildland vegetation in the study area. We divided these 14 classes into shrubland dominated versus non-shrubland dominated types (annual grass, oak, conifer, mixed hardwood) (Table 1). Table 1. The Community types (WHR class) that are [greater than]= 0.75% of all wildland vegetation in the study area and their % area of the southern California ecoregion Community type (WHR class) Vegetation type Percent of wildland vegetation in study area Mixed Chaparral Shrub 29.2 Annual Grassland Annual grass 15.9 Desert Scrub Shrub 12.7 Coastal Scrub Shrub 12.5 Coastal Oak Woodland Oak 6.4 Chamise-Redshank Chaparral Shrub 6.0 Pinyon-Juniper Conifer 2.5 Montane Hardwood Mixed hardwood 2.3 Blue Oak Woodland Oak 2.0 Sierran Mixed Conifer Conifer 1.2 Juniper Conifer 1.1 Montane Hardwood-Conifer Mixed hardwood-conifer 1.1 Montane Chaparral Shrub 1.0 Sagebrush Shrub 0.9 2) Second, for the shrubland types we determined the per pixel proportion of biomass by three plant life forms: tree, shrub, and herb. We further subdivided the shrub life form into three life history classes based on shrub post-fire regeneration strategies: Obligate Resprouters (OR), obligate seeders (OS), and facultative seeders (FS), providing five plant types in total. We created rasters depicting the proportion of biomass in each of the five plant types by first calculating the proportion of biomass in each type for the plots used in Schrader-Patton and Underwood (2021). The plot data contained individual plant species, crown width and height measurements. Using these measurements, we estimated the biomass for each individual plant within the plot by applying published allometric equations (see Schrader-Patton and Underwood 2021 for details). The individual plants in the plots were classified into the five plant types and the proportion of biomass in each type were calculated for each plot. A multinomial model was used to relate these proportions to a suite of geophysical and remote sensing variables which, in turn, was applied to raster surfaces of these predictors. The final outputs were raster maps of the proportion of biomass by life form (tree, shrub, herb) and, for shrubs, the proportion of biomass by life history type (OR, OS, and FS) (Underwood et al. in review). 3) Third, we estimated the standing dead, litter, and below ground biomass pools by either applying fractions of AGLBM gleaned the available published Copyright: MIT License Open Access

For each field plot, we extracted the raster values for all covariates; NDVI and precipitation data were matched to the year of plot visit. We predicted AGLBM using the set of 17 covariates (Random Forest [RF] algorithm in R statistical computing software). To create an AGLBM raster surface for each year 2001-2021, we used NDVI and precipitation raster data specific to each year in the RF (using predict function in the R raster module) (see Schrader-Patton and Underwood 2021 for details). To estimate other shrubland biomass pools (standing dead, litter, and below ground) we employed a multi-step process: 1) First, we segregated the study area by community type using the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships (CWHR) data (Mayer and Laudenslayer 1988). The wildland vegetation of the study area (excluding agricultural, urban, water, and barren classes) contains 45 CWHR classes, 14 of which are [greater than]=0.75% of the wildland vegetation in the study area. We divided these 14 classes into shrubland dominated versus non-shrubland dominated types (annual grass, oak, conifer, mixed hardwood) (Table 1). Table 1. The Community types (WHR class) that are [greater than]= 0.75% of all wildland vegetation in the study area and their % area of the southern California ecoregion Community type (WHR class) Vegetation type Percent of wildland vegetation in study area Mixed Chaparral Shrub 29.2 Annual Grassland Annual grass 15.9 Desert Scrub Shrub 12.7 Coastal Scrub Shrub 12.5 Coastal Oak Woodland Oak 6.4 Chamise-Redshank Chaparral Shrub 6.0 Pinyon-Juniper Conifer 2.5 Montane Hardwood Mixed hardwood 2.3 Blue Oak Woodland Oak 2.0 Sierran Mixed Conifer Conifer 1.2 Juniper Conifer 1.1 Montane Hardwood-Conifer Mixed hardwood-conifer 1.1 Montane Chaparral Shrub 1.0 Sagebrush Shrub 0.9 2) Second, for the shrubland types we determined the per pixel proportion of biomass by three plant life forms: tree, shrub, and herb. We further subdivided the shrub life form into three life history classes based on shrub post-fire regeneration strategies: Obligate Resprouters (OR), obligate seeders (OS), and facultative seeders (FS), providing five plant types in total. We created rasters depicting the proportion of biomass in each of the five plant types by first calculating the proportion of biomass in each type for the plots used in Schrader-Patton and Underwood (2021). The plot data contained individual plant species, crown width and height measurements. Using these measurements, we estimated the biomass for each individual plant within the plot by applying published allometric equations (see Schrader-Patton and Underwood 2021 for details). The individual plants in the plots were classified into the five plant types and the proportion of biomass in each type were calculated for each plot. A multinomial model was used to relate these proportions to a suite of geophysical and remote sensing variables which, in turn, was applied to raster surfaces of these predictors. The final outputs were raster maps of the proportion of biomass by life form (tree, shrub, herb) and, for shrubs, the proportion of biomass by life history type (OR, OS, and FS) (Underwood et al. in review). 3) Third, we estimated the standing dead, litter, and below ground biomass pools by either applying fractions of AGLBM gleaned the available published Copyright: MIT License Open Access

AB  - Electronic health record (EHR)-derived data can be linked to geospatially distributed socioeconomic and environmental factors to conduct large-scale epidemiologic studies. Ambient NO2 is a known environmental risk factor for asthma. However, health exposure studies often rely on data from geographically sparse regulatory monitors that may not reflect true individual exposure. We contrasted use of interpolated NO2 regulatory monitor data with raw satellite measurements and satellite-derived ground estimates, building on previous work which has computed improved exposure estimates from remotely sensed data. Raw satellite and satellite-derived ground measurements captured spatial variation missed by interpolated ground monitor measurements. Multivariable analyses comparing these three NO2 measurement approaches (interpolated monitor, raw satellite, and satellite-derived) revealed a positive relationship between exposure and asthma exacerbations for both satellite measurements. Exposure-outcome relationships using the interpolated monitor NO2 were inconsistent with known relationships to asthma, suggesting that interpolated monitor data might yield misleading results in small region studies.

TI  - Understanding Internal Cluster Variability Through Subcluster Metric Analysis in a Geophysical Context
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clustering algorithms are commonly used for inspecting the behavior of clouds in both model and satellite data sets. Often overlooked in cluster analysis is the variability that occurs within any clusters generated. This is particularly important in the geophysics where clusters are often generated with a focus on interpretability over mathematical optimization. Two metrics, the Davies-Bouldin index and the subsom entropy, are used to identify clusters with large internal variability. These metrics are applied to an example set of clusters from prior research that were generated using cloud top pressure-cloud optical thickness joint histograms from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data set. Applying these metrics to the clusters identifies one cluster in particular as a major outlier. Examining the calculations behind these metrics in more detail provides further information about the internal variability of the clusters. The clusters are also examined over several geographic regions showing mostly consistent behavior. There are, however, some large anomalies such as the behavior of the clear sky cluster or the behavior of several different clusters over the Arctic Ocean. To aide our interpretation of these results, two clusters are chosen for a detailed analysis of their subclusters. The geographic distributions and radiative properties of these subclusters are examined and clearly identify that subclusters have physically distinct behavior. This result illustrates that these metrics are capable of determining when a cluster contains physically distinct subclusters. This demonstrates the potential utility of these metrics if they were applied to other geophysical data sets.

TI  - An Empirical Bayesian Approach to Quantify Multi-Scale Spatial Structural Diversity in Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape structure is as much a driver as a product of environmental and biological interactions and it manifests as scale-specific, but also as multi-scale patterns. Multi-scale structure affects processes on smaller and larger scales and its detection requires information from different scales to be combined. Herein, we propose a novel method to quantify multi-scale spatial structural diversity in continuous remote sensing data. We combined information from different extents with an empirical Bayesian model and we applied a new entropy metric and a value co-occurrence approach to capture heterogeneity. We tested this method on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data in northern Eurasia and on simulated data and we also tested the effect of coarser pixel resolution. We find that multi-scale structural diversity can reveal itself as patches and linear landscape features, which persist or become apparent across spatial scales. Multi-scale line features reveal the transition zones between spatial regimes and multi-scale patches reveal those areas within transition zones where values are most different from each other. Additionally, spatial regimes themselves can be distinguished. We also find the choice of scale need not be informed by typical length-scales, which makes the method easy to implement. The proposed multi-scale approach can be applied to other contexts, following the roadmap we pave out in this study and using the tools available in the accompanying R package StrucDiv.

TI  - Marine pollution effects on the reproduction process of Perinereis cultrifera (Annelida, Polychaeta) in Algeria
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is one of the busiest areas worldwide in terms of maritime activity and faces considerable anthropogenic disturbances, such as pollution by hydrocarbons and heavy metals. This study evaluated the environmental status of three sites on the Algerian coast using the annelid polychaete Perinereis cultrifera as a biomonitoring sentinel species. It included different reproductive parameters such as oocyte diameter, frequency distributions, sexual maturity index, biochemical quantitative parameters represented by the vitellogenins and vitellins, and a histological study of the coelome during the reproductive period. The results showed that the females collected from El-Kala (healthy site) have the highest diameter 304.1 +/- 24.3 mu m during April but the values were increased in Annaba 290.0 +/- 21.0 mu m and Skikda 245.3 +/- 26.7 mu m. Significant differences were observed between worms from the three study sites during the three months of the study. Moreover, the size-frequency indicated that a relatively high proportion of females containing mature oocytes was found in April in females collected at El-Kala 52.4%, 46.4% in females collected at Annaba and 36.7% in females collected at Skikda. In addition, regarding the sexual maturity index, the highest values were recorded in April (3.8, 2.9, and 1.9) at the El-Kala, Annaba, and Skikda study sites. However, the biochemical analysis demontrated that the highest mean concentration of vitellogenin was in females of El-Kala (5.3 +/- 0.3 mu g/mg of coelomic fluid) in April, and the lowest mean concentration was measured in females of Skikda (1.5 +/- 0.2 mu g/mg of coelomic fluid). Therefore, the highest mean concentration of vitellin was measured in females of El-Kala (4.4 +/- 0.2 mu g/mg of oocytes) in April, while the lowest mean concentration of vitellin was measured in females of Skikda (1.02 +/- 0.2 mu g/mg of oocytes) in May. Significant differences were observed between worms from the three sites during the three months of the study. Furthermore, histological observations revealed that oogenesis was asynchronous, with oocytes at different stages of vitellogenesis simultaneously present. The structure of the oocytes of females collected at El-Kala showed intense vitellogenic activity due to the presence of very dense yolk cells. In contrast, the oocytes of the females collected from the two polluted sites (Annaba and Skikda) were small, vitellogenesis presented low intensity, and yolk cells were less frequent at the periphery and less uniform at the cytoplasmic mass; the nucleus was smaller, indicating a slower vitellogenic activity. These observations confirm the previously obtained results.

AB  - We aimed to characterise cutaneous melanoma in the elderly and determine its association with poorer prognosis. We studied a prospective cohort of the melanoma population in Catalonia between 2012 and 2016. We compared young patient group (<75 years old) with elderly patient group (≥75 years old). We included 3009 patients (52.5% women) from 14 centres, with a mean age at diagnosis of 61.1 years. In the ≥75-year-old group there was a predominance of men (53.9% vs. 45.5%, P  < 0.001), melanoma was more frequently located in the head and neck area (37.7% vs. 15.5%, P  < 0.001) and lentigo maligna melanoma subtype was significantly more frequent (31.4% vs. 11.6%, P  < 0.001), as were nodular melanoma and acral lentiginous melanoma ( P  < 0.001). In older people, Breslow index, the presence of ulceration and mitotic rate were higher than in younger people. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed longer melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and melanoma-free survival (MFS) in <75-year-old group compared to the elderly group. Cox regression models demonstrated reduced MSS in patients ≥75 years regardless of gender, location, IB, ulceration and lymph node status at diagnosis (HR 1.54, P  = 0.013) whereas MFS was not independently associated with elderly when head and neck location was considered. Age appears to be an independent risk factor for MSS but not for MFS. Worse melanoma prognosis in elderly could be explained by factors unrelated to the tumour, such as age-related frailty and comorbidities that limit the access to systemic treatments and, eventually, age-related immune dysfunction.

TI  - Social welfare and scientific racism in modern Japan: discriminated Buraku and the philanthropist Toyohiko Kagawa
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the latter half of the nineteenth century, knowledge about human beings, which had previously been sought in a variety of fields, was articulated with the theory of evolution, and a new civilized worldview was formed. Notably, through these interdisciplinary studies and controversies, the perception that human qualities are determined by heredity became widespread and accepted as a basis for eugenic restructuring of modern society. Even in Japan at the same time, knowledge about heredity was widely introduced through criminology and psychiatry, and eventually became an important reference framework when discussing national institutions and policies. Toyohiko Kagawa (1888-1960) is one of the intellectuals who worked on many social projects while taking in such scientific knowledge and influenced the field. In this study, taking Kagawa's social work and his discourse as an example, it is clarified that the interpretation frame that links heredity with poverty, crime, and illness has permeated Japanese society.

TI  - The problem of land ownership in the attitudes of mind Siberian peasantry in the second half of the 19th century
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the author reviews the problem of land ownership in Siberia in the views of peasants in the second half of the XIX century. The purpose of the study is to determine the mental settings on the issue of ownership of land by peasants. The sources of the research are periodicals, namely, "Siberian newspaper", the magazine "Russian conversation", which reflects the views of the peasants on this issue. To study the regulatory framework the study uses the Complete collection of laws of the Russian Empire (vol. 36, vol. 41), which published the laws of February 19, 1861, and of November 24, 1866, which define the land right of peasants. The literature for the article are the works of M. K. Churkin, M. V. Dorofeev, V. N. Khudyakov, A. A. Khramkov and others who made a huge contribution to the study of this problem. In the views of peasants, the land belonged to the entire society, and the one who cultivate it has a right to it. The norms of customary law were deeply ingrained in the minds of peasants and have become fundamental in their lives. The state's lack of seriousness with regard to legal customs led to controversy, as the law was different for peasants. The reform carried out in 1861 did not grant land ownership to the peasants. The right of ownership was left to the State, the right of disposal was given to the community, and the right to use remained with the peasants. The decree of November 24, 1866, which extended to the peasants of European Russia, could not be implemented in Siberia, since the land was not demarcated. Land arrangement works had been carried out carelessly for a long time and did not lead to significant results. The inflow of immigrants caused by shortage of land as a result of the reform of February 19, 1861, led to establishing of special forms of land use in Siberia. For a long time, the dominant form after the `zaimochnaya' was the capture form, based on the fact that the peasant owned the land as long as it was cultivated, and if he abandoned it, anyone could take it. The concepts of legal ownership of land and actual ownership of land were identified in the minds of peasants. As long as there was a lot of land, there was an uncontrolled disposal of it in Siberia. With the inflow of migrants, the situation was changing, and the process of transition to community-based equalization of land ownership was long and uneven. Thus, the worldview of the peasants on the issue of land ownership was based on the norms of customary law, which did not correspond to the government's course and led to a huge gulf between them. It is worth noting that the issue of extending the decree of November 24, 1866 to the territory of Siberia was the subject of the work of the Commission of Baron M. N. Medem, which considered the possibility of its implementation. However, it was necessary to carry out land arrangement works immediately, as the boundaries of the actual ownership of the peasants in many ways did not coincide with the plans issued to the peasants for their allotment. The reluctance of government officials to take into account the views of peasants in this matter and to undertake the necessary reforms led to the definitive establishment of land ownership by the State under the Act of May 23, 1896.

T2  - ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the major factors affecting the ecological condition and urban thermal comfort of cities, particularly in developing countries like Sri Lanka. This study explores the impact of vegetation cover, built-up density, and land surface temperature on urban thermal comfort and ecological condition in Colombo, Sri Lanka using multi-temporal remotely sensed data. Landsat 8 satellite images from 2014 to 2023 were used to assess the spectral indices such as NDVI, NDBI, LST and UTFVI in Colombo. The results show that ecological condition and thermal comfort are fluctuating throughout the study period. Specifically, between 2020 and 2022, Covid-19 pandemic is one of the major influencing factors for the good ecological condition since the air quality was controlled by limited human activities due to lockdown. After people adapted to live with Covid-19 and continued their day-to-day activities, industrial activities returned to their normal conditions again in 2023; a pattern leading to ecological condition going back to worst was identified. So, these findings highlight the importance of incorporating green spaces and built-up density in urban planning to mitigate the adverse effects of surface temperature on ecological condition and thermal comfort.

TI  - Improving the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Evapotranspiration Model Using the Forcing and Normalizing Operation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration modeling is providing useful information for researchers and resource managers in agriculture and water resources around the world. The performance of models depends on the accuracy of forcing inputs and model parameters. We developed an improved approach to the parameterization of the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model using the Forcing and Normalizing Operation (FANO). SSEBop has two key model parameters that define the model boundary conditions. The FANO algorithm computes the wet-bulb boundary condition using a linear FANO Equation relating surface temperature, surface psychrometric constant, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The FANO parameterization was implemented on two computing platforms using Landsat and gridded meteorological datasets: (1) Google Earth Engine (GEE) and (2) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Science Processing Architecture (ESPA). Evaluation was conducted by comparing modeled actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates with AmeriFlux eddy covariance (EC) and water balance ETa from level-8 Hydrologic Unit Code sub-basins in the conterminous United States. FANO brought substantial improvements in model accuracy and operational implementation. Compared to the earlier version (v0.1.7), SSEBop FANO (v0.2.6) reduced grassland bias from 47% to -2% while maintaining comparable bias for croplands (11% versus -7%) against EC data. A water balance-based ETa bias evaluation showed an overall improvement from 7% to -1%. Climatology versus annual gridded reference evapotranspiration (ETr) produced comparable ETa results, justifying the use of climatology ETr for the global SSEBop Landsat ETa that is accessible through the ESPA website. Besides improvements in model accuracy, SSEBop FANO increases the spatiotemporal coverage of ET modeling due to the elimination of high NDVI requirements for model parameterization. Because of the existence of potential biases from forcing inputs and model parameters, continued evaluation and bias corrections are necessary to improve the absolute magnitude of ETa for localized water budget applications.

TI  - A Comprehensive Benchmarking of the Available Spectral Indices Based on Sentinel-2 for Large-Scale Mapping of Plastic-Covered Greenhouses
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic-covered greenhouses (PCG) have been extensively used in agricultural practices around the world. Remote sensing based on spectral indices is a key asset to monitor the spatial distribution of these structures on a large scale. The primary objective of this research was to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of the available spectral indices based on Sentinel-2 data for large-scale PCG mapping. For that, eight PCG indices were thoroughly analyzed by systematically investigating their optimal thresholds in five study sites located in Almeria (Spain), Antalya (Turkey), Agadir (Morocco), Weifang (China), and Nantong (China), including also different growing seasons. The experimental results demonstrated that the Plastic GreenHouse Index (PGHI) achieved the best PCG mapping accuracy in almost all study sites and growing seasons tested. From the visual analysis carried out on the PGHI mapping results, it was made out that the main misclassification between PCG and background classes took place in water bodies and industrial building land covers, particularly in the Weifang and Nantong study areas. Based on this fact, the original version of PGHI was modified by adding two processes aimed at masking water bodies and industrial buildings. This new composite index, called Improved PGHI (IPGHI), attained better accuracy results in all study sites, especially in Chinese PCG areas. The average F1 score calculated for all the study cases improved from 86.05% using PGHI to 90.51% applying IPGHI. The new approach provided a significant and robust improvement in PCG large-scale mapping for several types of PCG sites, even considering different growing seasons.

TI  - Unraveling Segmentation Quality of Remotely Sensed Images on Plastic-Covered Greenhouses: A Rigorous Experimental Analysis from Supervised Evaluation Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) segmentation represents a significant challenge for object-based PCG mapping studies due to the spectral characteristics of these singular structures. Therefore, the assessment of PCG segmentation quality by employing a multiresolution segmentation algorithm (MRS) was addressed in this study. The structure of this work is composed of two differentiated phases. The first phase aimed at testing the performance of eight widely applied supervised segmentation metrics in order to find out which was the best metric for evaluating image segmentation quality over PCG land cover. The second phase focused on examining the effect of several factors (reflectance storage scale, image spatial resolution, shape parameter of MRS, study area, and image acquisition season) and their interactions on PCG segmentation quality through a full factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) design. The analysis considered two different study areas (Almeria (Spain) and Antalya (Turkey)), seasons (winter and summer), image spatial resolution (high resolution and medium resolution), and reflectance storage scale (Percent and 16Bit formats). Regarding the results of the first phase, the Modified Euclidean Distance 2 (MED2) was found to be the best metric to evaluate PCG segmentation quality. The results coming from the second phase revealed that the most critical factor that affects MRS accuracy was the interaction between reflectance storage scale and shape parameter. Our results suggest that the Percent reflectance storage scale, with digital values ranging from 0 to 100, performed significantly better than the 16Bit reflectance storage scale (0 to 10,000), both in the visual interpretation of PCG segmentation quality and in the quantitative assessment of segmentation accuracy.

TI  - Probabilistic Evaluation of Drought Propagation Using Satellite Data and Deep Learning Model: From Precipitation to Soil Moisture and Groundwater
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of drought events has increased with climate change, making it vital to monitor and predict the response to drought. In particular, the relationship among meteorological, agricultural, and groundwater droughts needs to be characterized under different drought conditions. In this study, a probabilistic framework was developed for analyzing the spatio-temporal propagation of droughts and applied to South Korea. Three drought indices were calculated using satellite data and a deep learning model to determine the spatial and temporal extents of drought. The average propagation times were calculated. The time from meteorological to agricultural drought (MD-to-AD) was 2.83 months, and that from meteorological to groundwater drought (MD-to-GD) was 4.34 months. Next, the joint distribution among three drought types based on the best-fit copula functions was constructed. The conditional probabilities of drought occurrence were calculated on temporal and spatial scales. For instance, the probabilities of MD-to-GD propagation under light, moderate, severe, and extreme meteorological drought conditions were 38%, 43%, 48%, and 53%, respectively. The propagated drought occurrence probability was confirmed to be the highest under extreme antecedent drought conditions. The results of this study provide insight into the spatio-temporal drought propagation process from a probabilistic viewpoint. The use of satellite data and a deep learning model is expected to increase the efficiency of drought management practices such as vulnerability assessment and early warning system development.

TI  - POETIC TRANSLATION AS A HERMENEUTIC DIALOGUE OF A TRANSLATOR WITH THE SOURCE TEXT (ON THE ANALYSIS OF MULTI-TEMPORAL TRANSLATIONS OF M.Yu. LERMONTOV'S "COSSACK CRADLE SONG")
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the comparative hermeneutic analysis of the semantic-derivational worldview of the translators who render the classical poetic text in different historical periods. The relevance of the study is stipulated by the increased attention to the sociocultural determination of meaning generation within the framework of the cognitive-and-discursive paradigm that dominates in the modern community of linguists and translators. Cossack Cradle Song and its five translations into German carried out in different periods served as the practical material. The article aims to establish the features of multi-temporal Russian-German translations of the poem and the source text as a single semantic space that reflects the worldview of the author of the original text, variably explicated by different translators through the language of the target text. According to the research hypothesis, poetic translation reflects the translator's hermeneutic interaction with the original text, which generates the personal meaning of the translated text. The findings of the linguo-stylistic analysis of the Cossack Cradle Song at the semantic, meta-semiotic, and meta-metasemiotic levels, reveal that the compensation technique plays the leading role in the process of translating the poetic text studied in this article, contributing to the achievement of expressive and impressive equivalence of the original and the translation in the process of explication of invariant content -factual and content-conceptual meanings, as well as the subjective-personal determinism of translation decisions, which does not contradict the intentions implied by the author of the source text.

TI  - Multifidelity Gaussian Process Emulation for Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric radiative transfer models (RTMs) are widely used in satellite data processing to correct for the scattering and absorption effects caused by aerosols and gas molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. As the complexity of RTMs grows and the requirements for future Earth Observation missions become more demanding, the conventional lookup-table (LUT) interpolation approach faces important challenges. Emulators have been suggested as an alternative to LUT interpolation, but they are still too slow for operational satellite data processing. Our research introduces a solution that harnesses the power of multifidelity methods to improve the accuracy and runtime of Gaussian process (GP) emulators. We investigate the impact of the number of fidelity layers, dimensionality reduction, and training dataset size on the performance of multifidelity GP emulators. We find that an optimal multifidelity emulator can achieve relative errors in surface reflectance below 0.5% and performs atmospheric correction of hyperspectral PRISMA satellite data (one million pixels) in a few minutes. Additionally, we provide a suite of functions and tools for automating the creation and generation of atmospheric RTM emulators.

TI  - Future Fracture Risk in Upper Extremity Fracture and Non-Fracture Patients.
T2  - Hand (New York, N.Y.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper extremity (UE) fragility fractures are common and strong predictors of subsequent fractures. To investigate the relative importance of an UE fragility fracture in determining future fracture risk, we conducted a cross-sectional study to compare future fracture risk between patients presenting for osteoporosis evaluation after an UE fragility fracture and a similarly aged cohort of patients without an UE fracture.METHODS: In all, 129 UE fracture patients seen in our bone health clinic (BHC) and 114 non-fracture UE fracture patients seen in an UE clinic completed clinic intake surveys assessing for fracture risk factors. Prefracture fracture risk (PFFR) and fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) scores estimated the future fracture risks at the timepoint before and after the UE fragility fracture event, respectively. The primary study outcome was the 10-year risk of future fracture.RESULTS: The 10-year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fractures were significantly higher among the BHC group when estimated with FRAX. When estimated with PFFR score, there was no difference in the 10-year probability of hip fracture between the groups. Prevalence of secondary osteoporosis and glucocorticoid use was higher in the BHC group, and prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was higher in the UE clinic group.CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of an UE fragility fracture in determining the risk of future fracture. A fragility fracture of the UE should be considered a sentinel event and physicians who evaluate these patients should recognize them as a high-risk group for future hip fracture.

TI  - A Semiempirical Approach for Decomposition of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index Into Overstory and Understory Components Over Russian Forests
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest is a multilayered canopy, where overstory and understory implement different biogeochemical cycles, phenology, and functional role. Remote sensing products typically estimate forest total leaf area index (LAI), while few quantify its components. The theoretical understanding of foliage distribution between layers is still quite limited. In this study, we have developed a semiempirical model for decomposition of forest total LAI between layers. Decomposition was implemented over the full extent of Russian forests, exhibiting a wide dynamic range of the forest total LAI. This article addresses both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem. In terms of theory, we formalized the principles of forest layers "biological/ radiometric coupling into a parametric model allowing to analyze the relationship between overstory/understory LAI and overstory crown fraction. The model captures various features of layers of foliage growth, including the "understory seasonal dip effect." In terms of practical aspects, we generated time series of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-layered LAI product for 2001-2020 at the spatial resolution of 230 m over Russian forests. We calculated the mean layered LAI of species and contrasted with typical values from the literature surveys. According to our estimates, the relative contribution of understory LAI increases from South to North-28% of forest pixels have understory LAI, which exceeds that of overstory, and those pixels are located in the northern part of the eastern Siberia and occupied by larch forests. The layered LAI product was intercompared/validated with multiple ground and remote sensing data.

TI  - PEDAGOGICAL POTENTIAL OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF ATHEISTIC EXISTENTIALISM AND HUMANISTIC PSYCHOANALYSIS
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assesses the relevance of developing the worldview of modern pedagogy and presents the main crite-ria that can be followed when choosing philosophical con-cepts and pedagogical teachings. The authors conduct an aca-demic analysis of the current state of philosophy associated with the postmodern approach to equalizing subjectively sig-nificant aspects. Based on the analysis of philosophical works of the 20th century, they substantiate the French atheistic exis-tentialism and existential (humanistic) psychoanalysis as philosophical concepts that form a productive worldview of modern people. It is concluded that atheistic existentialism and humanistic psychoanalysis are among the most important trends in philosophy, especially in the 20th century. The above-mentioned philosophical concepts can influence edu-cation by promoting a more holistic approach to teaching and learning that considers the intellectual, emotional, and ethical aspects of human experience. These perspectives can help educators create a learning environment that promotes per-sonal growth, self-awareness, and critical thinking, as well as foster the development of more empathetic, responsible, and engaged citizens.

AB  - Climate change worldwide is a huge challenge, and urban heat island (UHI) is being explored as one of the contributors to this challenge. UHI is an urban or rural area with a temperature variance than its neighbouring areas. Researchers can model the UHI data and predict the temperature change using various relative parameters of UHI. The land surface temperature (LST) data and its co-related parameter of the study area, i.e. Srinagar City, JK, India, has been extracted from satellite imageries. LST data of the study area is assessed to understand the evolution to help analyse the UHI effect and its variance. The LST data was extracted through MODIS Satellite, from 2001 to 2020, with an 8-day revisit time/peak month of the season. In having a voluminous dataset, i.e. 16 sampled LST data/each km(2)/year measured in Kelvin(k), various machine learning algorithms were applied on LST data to establish relations for UHI modelling. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms were used on continuous LST data to define clusters and further standardized/compared with existing scientific classifications of the study area. The number of clusters was tweaked to determine the best-case scenario. Additionally, correlation and regression were applied to determine if there is multicollinearity amongst the LST data. The outcome of two analyses was used to build a UHI framework on a structured UHI dataset. Performance of algorithms in predicting UHI parameters like urban, vegetation and wetlands zones varied considerably. Naive Bayes and support vector machine did considerably well in predicting wetlands but failed to perform impressive accuracy for urban and vegetation zones. Random forest, gradient boost tree and probabilistic neural networks failed in predicting wetlands. Neural networks have performed worst in predicting wetlands, having a prediction accuracy of around meagre 5%, while the decision tree algorithm has performed well in all three zones.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)
CL  - Vasavi Coll Engn, Dept Informat Technol, Hyderabad, INDIA
AB  - Integrated nutrient management (INM) is a widely used practice to enhance crop productivity where bio-organic amendments coupled with chemical fertilizers are used. Therefore, a field experiment is performed to assess the productivity enhancement of wheat through the combined application of bio-fertilizer and chemical fertilizers including Phosphorus (P), Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Boric Acid (B), and Zinc Sulphate (Zn). The drone multispectral & optical data along with the Landsat-8 OLI data are collected, where various vegetation indices are computed to deeply analyze crop growth. Google Earth data is also used to estimate crop height, which gives important insights into the crop's health. To validate the experimental results, several yield agronomic traits are recorded, such as plant height, grains/spike, number of tillers/m2, grain weight, straw yield, and grain yield per hectare. Moreover, the percentage concentration of N, P, and K in grain and straw are estimated using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The wheat grain yield is recorded as 4.3 tonnes ha(-1) by the INM approach, which is 26% more than the farmer's practice. This study shows that INM has great potential for supplying plant nutrients and making wheat more productive in a sustainable way.

TI  - AN ANALYSIS OF THE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE CHANGES AS AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL PLANNING (CASE STUDY: LATIAN DAM WATERSHED)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of modifications or conception in the landscape could possibly, be a procedure relative to its natural and non-disturbance process; and it could be hastened by the occurrence of disturbance regimes. The objective of this research is to survey the changes in a landscape structure, over a period of 30 years, to attain information, as to the current conditions of land use, utilizing landscape metrics in the watershed area of the Latian Dam, so as to analyze the results and the voids present, towards obtaining a specified sustainable regional planning for the abovementioned watershed. Land use was identified and reviewed by means of four Landsat satellite images for 1987, 1998, 2007, and 2017; and in this watershed, it was classified into four classes, (a) build-up areas, (b) vegetated areas, (c) bare lands and (d) water bodies. Subsequently, by taking advantage of 7 metrics at the landscape level and 8 metrics at the class level, the landscape structure in this watershed was quantified by utilizing the Fragstats 4.2 Software. The survey results illustrated an increment in the number of patches (NP), decrementing the mean area of the patches (AREA-MN), and increasing the Interspersion & Juxtaposition Index (IJI) signifies amplified fragmentation at the landscape level in this watershed. Similarly, the NP has also incremented at the class level, and thus, the fragmentation of patches and fragmentation in the entire three classes of land use, namely, build-up areas, bare lands, and vegetated areas has occurred. The amount of patchiness for the build-up class, with due attention to the increment in the mean area of patches (AREA-MIN), which demonstrates the fact that, this class is inclined and has a tendency towards a coarse-grained structure and a metric decrement in the AREA-MIN in the vegetated areas, illustrates that this class is prone to the fine-grained structure.

M3  - Article
AB  - Topics such as the image of religious minorities (Coptic and Jewish) and coexistence in Ibn Daniyal's trilogy have not been sufficiently studied. These minorities had a significant social, economic and intellectual impact during the period of the Mamluk sultans. This paper studies and offers a translation of the passages related to this subject. The methodology of the study is inspired by certain theoretical postulates: carnival, parody and humour, using ideas frequently highlighted in contemporary literary criticism. The results reveal that Ibn Daniyal's text is not only a high-flying literary text, but also a document about the socio-political and cultural atmosphere that must be read in context in order to understand the situation of minorities in that period. The systematic examination of the translated episodes also reveals the decisive presence of popular culture and folklore, impregnated with the carnival worldview, which lives in the shadow of official culture and is supported by oral tradition and everyday reality.

AB  - Urban microclimate has posed a detrimental effect on the life of the urban population. This research drives with an aim of identifying environmentally conscious factor vis-a-vis urban planning which leads to the vicious cycle of urban climate change. The vicious cycle is inclusive of many urban dynamics' parameters, which are complicated to understand. This research emphasizes on using Remote Sensing Big Data on Google Earth Engine as an advancement to study Climate Vulnerability leading to Urban Climate Gentrification. Temporal data of Landsat for the past 30 years has been taken into consideration for the study. Three cities with diverse geographical and terrain characteristics have been selected for the study, to understand the modern decisive planning is in coherence with the Sustainable Development Goals. Understanding spatial and temporal information of Urban hotspots using High-Resolution Satellite data is just not enough to suffice the need to decrease the temperature by 2- 3 degrees C. The present study is a toll on how the reasons for microclimate change vary along with the terrain, spatial location, and urban growth pattern of the city.

TI  - Fusion and Classification of SAR and Optical Data Using Multi-Image Color Components with Differential Gradients
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a gradient-based data fusion and classification approach for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical image. This method is used to intuitively reflect the boundaries and edges of land cover classes present in the dataset. For the fusion of SAR and optical images, Sentinel 1A and Sentinel 2B data covering Central State Farm in Hissar (India) was used. The major agricultural crops grown in this area include paddy, maize, cotton, and pulses during kharif (summer) and wheat, sugarcane, mustard, gram, and peas during rabi (winter) seasons. The gradient method using a Sobel operator and color components for three directions (i.e., x, y, and z) are used for image fusion. To judge the quality of fused image, several fusion metrics are calculated. After obtaining the resultant fused image, gradient based classification methods, including Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, are used for the final classification. The classification accuracy is represented using overall classification accuracy and kappa value. A comparison of classification results indicates a better performance by the Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier.

TI  - A Burned Area Extracting Method Using Polarization and Texture Feature of Sentinel-1A Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire not only seriously affects the stability of the forest ecosystem but also threatens the safety of human life and property. The previously burned areas extracting method mainly focuses on optical images, susceptible to cloud and fog objective environmental factors. Although there are related studies on the threshold segmentation of single SAR feature types, further information mining for SAR image data, e.g., backscattering intensity, polarization decomposition, texture, and other features, is still insufficient. Therefore, this letter proposes a burned area extracting method using polarization and texture features of Sentinel-1A images to combine and comprehensively mine various SAR feature change information caused by forest fires with a random forest (RF) model. For validation purposes, we compared the burned areas' extracted results with the reference data acquired based on Sentinel-2A optical imagery. The comparative results show that the SAR extraction results highly agree with the reference data, with an accuracy of 87.12%, and the commission and omission errors were 20.44% and 12.88%, respectively. The proposed machine learning method helps extract fire areas covered by thick smoke or persistent clouds and provides a reference to related research.

TI  - Shoreline Change Assessment in the Coastal Region of Bangladesh Delta Using Tasseled Cap Transformation from Satellite Remote Sensing Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh is a global south hotspot due to climate change and sea level rise concerns. It is a highly disaster-prone country in the world with active deltaic shorelines. The shorelines are quickly changing to coastal accretion and erosion. Erosion is one of the water hazards to landmass sinking, and accretion relates to land level rises due to sediment load deposition on the Bay of Bengal continental shelf. Therefore, this study aimed to explore shoreline status with change assessment for the three study years 1991, 2006, and 2021 using satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) approaches. Landsat 5, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI satellite imageries were employed for onshore tasseled cap transformation (TCT) and land and sea classification calculations to create shore boundaries, baseline assessment, land accretion, erosion, point distance, and near feature analysis. We converted 16,550 baseline vertices to points as the study ground reference points (GRPs) and validated those points using the country datasheet collected from the Survey of Bangladesh (SoB). We observed that the delta's shorelines were changed, and the overall lands were accredited for the land-increasing characteristics analysis. The total accredited lands in the coastal areas observed during the time periods from 1991 to 2006 were 825.15 km(2), from 2006 to 2021 was 756.69 km(2), and from 1991 to 2021 was 1223.94 km(2) for the 30-year period. Similarly, coastal erosion assessment analysis indicated that the results gained for the period 1991 to 2006 and 2006 to 2021 were 475.87 km(2) and 682.75 km(2), respectively. Therefore, the total coastal erosion was 800.72 km(2) from 1991 to 2021. Neat accretion was 73.94 km(2) for the 30-year period from 1991 to 2021. This research indicates the changes in shorelines, referring to the evidence for the delta's active formation through accretion and erosion processes of 'climate change' and 'sea level rise'. This research projects the erosion process and threatens land use changes toward agriculture and settlements in the coastal regions of Bangladesh.

TI  - Coseismic deformation of the 2022 Luding <i>M</i><sub>S</sub>6.8 earthquake and seismic potential along adjacent major faults
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2022 Luding (Sichuan) M6.8 earthquake occurred on the Moxi segment of the Xianshuihe fault, one of the most seismically active faults in the mainland of China. Since 1900, six moderate to strong earthquakes (> M6.5) have ruptured different sections of the Xianshuihe fault. This Moxi segment has a complex tectonic setting as it forms an intersection zone of the Anninghe, Daliangshan, Xiaojin, and Longmenshan faults. In this study, we investigated the distribution of coseismic deformation of the 2022 Luding earthquake in order to improve understanding of the seismogenic fault and gain insight into the kinematic behaviors of regional faults and seismogeneity of future strong earthquakes. We collected continuous global positioning system (GPS) and strong motion data within 200 and 50 km from the epicenter, respectively, and performed high-precision processing to extract the coseismic deformation field of this earthquake. We also collected Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) ScanSAR model descending data covering the epicenter area, and processed these data using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) technology. The GPS measurements confirm that deformation from this earthquake occurred as far as 200 km from the fault. This coseismic deformation was distributed in four quadrants, indicating that the focal mechanism of the Luding earthquake was leftlateral strike-slip. A strong motion station 16 km from the epicenter recorded a significant displacement waveform; peak ground displacement was 14 cm and the permanent coseismic displacement was 12 cm. InSAR deformation maps show significant coseismic deformation in a 30 kmx30 km area along the fault. The maximum line-of-sight displacement reached 15 cm to the west of the fault. In addition, significant local deformation (> 15 cm) was observed near the Wajiao township. Field investigations suggest that surface ruptures developed along the fault segment between Ertaizi and Aiguocun. However, it is difficult to identify rupture information from the InSAR maps owing to a loss of coherence in the near-field of the seismogenic fault. Detailed field investigations are needed to determine if coseismic slip reached the surface. Finally, we inverted interseismic coupling along the northeastern boundary faults of the Sichuan-Yunnan block, and quantitatively calculated the seismic moment budget on these faults. Based on the historical earthquake distribution of the past 300 years and present-day fault locking conditions along the Xianshuihe fault, the Luding earthquake accommodated clockwise vertical-axis rotation of the expanding Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau relative to the South China Block. The earthquake fully released the strain accumulated on the Moxi segment since the 1786 Moxi M73/ 4 earthquake; as such, it is unlikely that large earthquakes will occur on the Moxi segment in the near future. However, we also performed a comprehensive investigation of seismic hazard along the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault system based on the mapped seismic gap, asperity distribution, seismic moment deficit, and Coulomb failure stress caused by surrounding earthquakes. We found that the seismic moment accumulated on the Anninghe, Zemuhe, Daliangshan, and southern Longmenshan faults can be balanced by Mw7.0-7.7 earthquake. The Luding earthquake caused significant Coulomb stress loading (> 0.01 MPa) on the Daliangshan, Anninghe, and southern Longmenshan faults, bringing those faults closer to failure.In particular, Coulomb stress loading at the northern end of the Anninghe fault exceeded the conventional triggering threshold (0.1 MPa) for earthquakes; therefore, the risk of future strong earthquakes on the Anninghe fault deserves special attention.

TI  - Book as reconstruction of author's life: "Technical French-Russian Mevius (to 200th of author's birth)
T2  - RUKOPYSNA TA KNYZHKOVA SPADSHCHYNA UKRAINY-MANUSCRIPT AND BOOK HERITAGE OF UKRAINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the work: to carry out a source analysis of the "Technical French -Russian Dictionary" of the mining engineer Apollon Mevius through the prism of the author's biography. For forty years, from the first to the second edition of the dic-tionary, its author gained invaluable experience and implemented numerous projects that found their reproduction both in the book and in the entire Ukrainian industrial history of the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The research me-thodology is based on a set of historical methods (historical-comparative, synchro-nous, diachronic), as well as methods of biographical and source analysis (critical method, historical and linguistic elements of text interpretation, analysis and inter-pretation of biographical material). Scientific news. For the first time in Ukrainian historiography, a historical-source analysis of the "Technical French-Russian Dic-tionary" by the mining engineer Apollon Mevius was carried out. It is shown how the events from the author(sic)s life are marked on the contents of the dictionary. Atten-tion is focused on the fact that the book is a kind of "dictionary reproduction" of the era of capitalist transformations of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries, a time of fundamental changes in the economy, economic innovations, industrial changes and technical discoveries. Conclusions. "Technical French-Russian Dic-tionary" is a unique phenomenon in itself, as is its author - Apollon Fedorovych Mevius. The adjectives "technical" and "French" are a definition of the main orienta-tion of the economic formation of the Ukrainian lands at that time in the direction of accelerated industrial development and the active involvement of Western European investments and innovations. The name and surname of the author testify to the com-bination of many national cultures in one person, and therefore the understanding of pan-European processes. Mevius' worldview was based on high ideals of "pro-gress", "development", "mission of industry". Noble ideas carried out by the "first Ukrainian professor of metallurgy" Apollon Mevius resulted in a folio dictionary, on which more than one generation of domestic engineers was formed.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Generative Adversarial Network for Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping With Multispectral Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution mapping (SRM) can effectively predict the spatial distribution of land cover classes within mixed pixels at a higher spatial resolution than the original remotely sensed imagery. The uncertainty of land cover fraction errors within mixed pixels is one of the most important factors affecting SRM accuracy. Studies have shown that SRM methods using deep learning techniques have significantly improved land cover mapping accuracy but have not coped well with spectral-spatial errors. This study proposes an end-to-end SRM model using a spectral-spatial generative adversarial network (SGS) with the direct input of multispectral remotely sensed imagery, which deals with spectral-spatial error. The proposed SGS comprises the following three parts: first, cube-based convolution for spectral unmixing is adopted to generate land cover fraction images. Second, a residual-in-residual dense block fully and jointly considers spectral and spatial information and reduces spectral errors. Third, a relativistic average GAN is designed as a backbone to further improve the super-resolution performance and reduce spectral-spatial errors. SGS was tested in one synthetic and two realistic experiments with multi/hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery as the input, comparing the results with those of hard classification and several classic SRM methods. The results showed that SGS performed well at reducing land cover fraction errors, reconstructing spatial details, removing unpleasant and unrealistic land cover artifacts, and eliminating false recognition.

TI  - Gap Filling of the ESA CCI Soil Moisture Data Using a Spatiotemporal Attention-Based Residual Deep Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential climate variable, soil moisture (SM) exerts an indispensable influence on numerous disciplines. However, various degrees of data gaps exist in current microwave SM products. Therefore, this article proposed a spatiotemporal attention-based residual deep network (STARN) to reconstruct gaps of the daily SM data from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI) over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) during unfrozen seasons (May to September) from 2001 to 2021. The developed model is an end-to-end residual network embedded with three attention modules to comprehensively consider the potential relationship between SM and surface variables. Evaluation results revealed that the proposed model could well reconstruct SM gaps with an overall median R and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) values of 0.52 and 0.054 m(3)/m(3), while the overall median R and ubRMSE values for the ESA CCI SM were 0.41 and 0.058 m(3)/m(3). Besides, comparison with five baseline methods (e.g., the artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, extreme gradient boosting, long-short term memory, and DCT-PLS model) indicated that the STARN model had certain advantages over the five baseline models with higher correlation and more reasonable distribution patterns. The R/ubRMSE values for the five models were 0.38/0.057, 0.34/0.058, 0.40/0.058, 0.41/0.056, and 0.41/0.058, respectively. The pretraining using the ERA5-Land SM data could further improve the accuracy of generated seamless SM data since the ERA5-Land and ESA CCI SM complemented each other to a certain extent on the QTP. In summary, by leveraging the spatiotemporal information and attention modules, the STARN model showed great potentials in SM gap filling.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with T1a cutaneous malignant melanoma: A multicenter cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is not routinely recommended for T1a cutaneous melanoma due to the overall low risk of positivity. Prognostic factors for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN1) in this population are poorly characterized.Objective: To determine factors associated with SLN1 in patients with T1a melanoma. Methods: Patients with pathologic T1a (\ 0.80 mm, nonulcerated) cutaneous melanoma from 5 highvolume melanoma centers from 2001 to 2020 who underwent wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy were included in the study. Patient and tumor characteristics associated with SLN1 were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Age was dichotomized into #42 (25% quartile cutoff) and[42 years.Results: Of the 965 patients identified, the overall SLN1 was 4.4% (N = 43). Factors associated with SLN1 were age #42 years (7.5% vs 3.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.14; P =.03), head/neck primary tumor location (9.2% vs 4%; OR, 2.75; P =.04), lymphovascular invasion (21.4% vs 4.2%; OR, 5.64; P =.01), and $2 mitoses/mm2 (8.2% vs 3.4%; OR, 2.31; P =.03). Patients \ 42 years with $2 mitoses/mm2 (N = 38) had a SLN1 rate of 18.4 %Limitations: Retrospective study.Conclusion: SLN1 is low in patients with T1a melanomas, but younger age, lymphovascular invasion, mitogenicity, and head/neck primary site appear to confer a higher risk of SLN1.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics and Driving Forces of NPP in Shanxi Province from 2000 to 2020 Based on Geodetector
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, as an indispensable element in carbon cycle studies, characterizes plant growth status. This study applied MODIS NPP products from 2000 to 2020 and multi-source data on elevation, slope, precipitation, temperature, land use, and population density in Shanxi province. We used trend analysis, correlation analysis, and geographic probes to explore the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and driving factors of NPP in Shanxi province and its national planned coal-mining areas. The results showed that: 1 the overall NPP exhibited a fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2020, with an average rate of increase (in terms of C) of 6.7 g.(m(2).a)-(1). The total NPP varied significantly among different land types, with arable land > forest land > grassland > construction land > water area > unused land. 2 The spatial heterogeneity of NPP changes was obvious, with lower NPP values in the western and northern regions and higher average NPP values in the eastern and southern regions; the NPP comparison of three major coal bases showed that Jindong coal base > Jinzhong coal base > Jinbei coal base. 3 The correlation between NPP and precipitation was high, with 62.2% of regions having a significant correlation (rho<0.05), mainly in central and eastern Shanxi province. The relationship between NPP changes and temperature was weak, with only 1.10% of regions having a significant correlation (rho<0.05). 4 The comparison of the q-means of each factor in different years based on geographic probes showed that precipitation (0.165) > land use (0.124) > population density (0.085) > slope (0.080) > elevation (0.064) > air temperature (0.024), further indicating that precipitation was the dominant driver of NPP changes over the years. 5 The influence of the two-factor interaction was significantly higher than that of the single factor, and the influence of anthropogenic factors was gradually increasing. From 2000 to 2020, the interaction factor precipitationnpopulation density (0.275) with the highest explanatory power replaced precipitationntemperature (0.385) as the interaction factor precipitation with the highest explanatory power.

TI  - Extracting Remotely Sensed Water Quality Parameters from Shallow Intertidal Estuaries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 imagery is potentially ideal for providing a rapid assessment of the ecological condition of estuarine water due to its high temporal and spatial resolution and coverage. However, for optically shallow waters, the problem of isolating the effect of seabed reflectance from the influence of water properties makes it difficult to use the observed surface reflectance to monitor water quality. In this study, we adopt a methodology based on Lyzenga's model to estimate water quality properties such as the dominant wavelength and diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) of shallow estuarine waters. Lyzenga models the observed reflectance (R) using four parameters: total water depth (z), sea-bed reflectance (R-b), water reflectance (R-w) and K-d. If R-b is known a priori and multiple observations of R are available from different total water depths, we show that Lyzenga's model can be used to estimate the values of the remaining two parameters, K-d and R-w. Observations of R from different water depths can either be taken from the same image at different proximal locations in the estuary ("spatial method") or from the same pixel observed at different tidal stages ("temporal method"), both assuming homogeneous seabed and water reflectance properties. Tests in our case study estuary show that K-d and R-w can be estimated at water depths less than 6.4 m. We also show that the proximity restriction for the reflectance correction with the temporal method limits outcomes to monthly or seasonal resolution, and the correction with the spatial method performs best at a spatial resolution of 60 m. The K-d extracted from the blue band correlates well with the observed K-d for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (r(2) = 0.66) (although the relationship is likely to be estuary-specific). The methodology provides a foundation for future work assessing rates of primary production in shallow estuaries on large scales.

TI  - Using Optimized Three-Band Spectral Indices and a Machine Learning Model to Assess Squash Characteristics under Moisture and Potassium Deficiency Stress
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Moisture and potassium deficiency are two of the main limiting variables for squash crop performance in many water-stressed places worldwide. If major output decreases are to be avoided, it is critical to detect signs of crop stress as early as possible in the growth cycle. Proximal remote sensing can be a reliable technique for offering a rapid and precise instrument and localized management tool. This study tested the ability of proximal hyperspectral remotely sensed data to predict squash traits in two successive seasons (spring and fall) with varying moisture and potassium rates. Spectral data were collected from drip-irrigated squash that had been treated to varied rates of irrigation and potassium fertilization over both investigated seasons. To forecast potassium-use efficiency (KUE), chlorophyll meter (Chlm), water-use efficiency (WUE), and seed yield (SY) of squash, different commonly used and newly-introduced spectral index values for three bands (3D-SRIs), as well as a Decision Tree (DT) model, were evaluated. The results revealed that the newly constructed three-band SRIs based on the wavelengths of the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and red-edge regions were sensitive enough to measure the four tested parameters of squash in this study. For instance, NDI558,646,708 presented the highest R-2 of 0.75 for KUE, NDI744,746,738 presented the highest R-2 of 0.65 for Chlm, and NDI670,628,392 presented the highest R-2 of 0.64 for SY of squash. The results further demonstrated that the principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated the ability to distinguish moisture stress from potassium deficiency stress at the flowering stage onwards. Combining 3D-SRIs, DT-based bands (DT-b), and the aggregate of all spectral characteristics (ASF) with DT models would be an effective strategy for estimating four observed parameters with appropriate accuracy. For example, the model's approximately 30 spectral characteristics were extremely important for predicting KUE. Its outputs with R-2 were, for the training and validation datasets, 0.967 (RMSE = 0.175) and 0.818 (RMSE = 0.284), respectively. For measuring Chlm, the DT-DT-b-20 model demonstrated the best. In the training and validation datasets, the R-2 value was 0.993 (RMSE = 0.522) and 0.692 (RMSE = 2.321), respectively. The overall outcomes showed that proximal-reflectance-sensing-based 3D-SRIs and DT models based on 3D-SRIs, DT-b, and ASF could be used to evaluate the four tested parameters of squash under different levels of irrigation regimes and potassium fertilizer.

TI  - Characterizing Topographic Influences of Bushfire Severity Using Machine Learning Models: A Case Study in a Hilly Terrain of Victoria, Australia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography plays a significant role in determining bushfire severity over a hilly landscape. However, complex interrelationships between topographic variables and bushfire severity are difficult to quantify using traditional statistical methods. More recently, different machine learning (ML) models are becoming popular in characterizing complex relationships between different environmental variables. Yet, few studies have specifically evaluated the suitability of ML models in predictive bushfire severity analysis. Hence, the aim of this research is twofold. First, to determine suitable ML models by assessing their performances in bushfire severity predictions using remote sensing data analytics, and second to identify and investigate topographic variables influencing bushfire severity. The results showed that random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) models had their distinct advantages in predictive modeling of bushfire severity. RF model showed higher precision (86% to 100%) than GB (59% to 72%) while predicting low, moderate, and high severity classes. Whereas GB model demonstrated better recall, i.e., completeness of positive predictions (56% to 75%) than RF (49% to 61%) for those classes. Closer investigations on topographic characteristics showed a varying relationship of severity patterns across different morphological landform classes. Landforms having lower slope curvatures or with unchanging slopes were more prone to severe burning than those landforms with higher slope curvatures. Our results provide insights into how topography influences potential bushfire severity risks and recommends purpose-specific choice of ML models.

TI  - Identification of risk factors and mosquito vectors associated with dengue virus infection in American Samoa, 2017.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The first outbreak of dengue in American Samoa was reported in 1911. Sporadic outbreaks have been reported since, as were outbreaks of other pathogens transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes including Ross River, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. During an outbreak of dengue virus-type 2 (DENV-2) in 2016-2018, we conducted household-based cluster investigations to identify population-specific risk factors associated with infection and performed entomologic surveillance to determine the relative abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We contacted dengue patients who had tested positive for DENV infection and offered them as well as their household members participation in household-based cluster investigations. For those that accepted participation, we also offered participation to residents of households within a 50-meter radius of each case-patient's home. Questionnaires were administered and serum specimens collected for testing by RT-PCR and anti-DENV IgM ELISA. Adult female mosquitoes were aspirated from inside and outside participating households and tested by RT-PCR. We analyzed characteristics associated with DENV infection in bivariate analyses. A total of 226 participants was enrolled from 91 households in 20 clusters. Median age of participants was 34 years (range: <1-94), and 56.2% were female. In total, 7 (3.2%) participants had evidence of DENV infection by IgM ELISA (n = 5) or RT-PCR (n = 2). Factors significantly associated with DENV infection were reporting a febrile illness in the past three months (prevalence ratio: 7.5 [95% confidence interval: 1.9-29.8]) and having a household septic tank (Fisher's Exact Test, p = 0.004). Of 93 Ae. aegypti and 90 Ae. polynesiensis females collected, 90% of Ae. aegypti were collected inside homes whereas 83% of Ae. polynesiensis were collected outside homes. DENV nucleic acid was not detected in any mosquito pools. Sequencing of the DENV-2 from patient specimens identified the Cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2 and was most closely related to virus detected in the Solomon Islands during 2016.CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrated that dengue is a continuing risk in American Samoa. Increased frequency of infection among residents with a septic tank suggests a need to investigate whether septic tanks serve as larval habitats for mosquito vectors of DENV in American Samoa. Future efforts should also evaluate the role of Ae. polynesiensis in DENV transmission in the wild.

TI  - Using Landsat satellite imagery to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of aquatic weed extent in Lakes Chivero and Manyame, located in an urban catchment of Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantified the spatial and temporal variation of aquatic weeds in two lakes in an urban catchment of Zimbabwe using the automatic water extraction index (AWEI) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat satellite data from 1986 to 2020. Extent of aquatic weeds estimated using AWEI in Lake Chivero increased from less than 1 km(2) (4%) in 1986 to 7 km(2) (27%) in 2020. NDVI-based aquatic weed estimation gave the least spatial extent in the first few years. Similarly, in Lake Manyame aquatic weeds occupied similar to 62 ha (<1% in 1986) before reaching a peak extent of 60 km(2) (similar to 70%) in 1995, based on AWEI estimates. NDVI-derived aquatic weed extent ranged from less than 2 km(2) in 1997 to a maximum of 56.12 km(2) in 1994. Although AWEI and NDVI estimated similar extents, NDVI had higher estimates than AWEI. A non-significant positive trend in aquatic weed extent was detected for Lake Manyame based on AWEI (Mann-Kendal tau = 0.139, s = 69, p = 0.27) and NDVI (Mann-Kendal tau = 0.129, s = 64, p = 0.307). In Lake Chivero, a non-significant negative trend was observed in aquatic weed extent based on NDVI (Mann-Kendal tau = -0.06, s = -30,p = 0.6382), while a positive trend was detected using AWEI (tau = 0.0036, s = 18, p = 0.7827). Results of the regression analysis indicate that phosphorus (R-2 = 0.7957, p = 0.00122) and nitrogen (R-2 = 0.8992, p = 0.0011) significantly explained variations in aquatic weed infestation in Lake Chivero. These results suggest that phosphorus and nitrogen enrichment are key drivers of aquatic weed proliferation in the two lakes. Thus, sustainable management of water resources in the catchment hinges on reducing the amount of nutrients released into the lakes from sewage treatment plants and croplands.

TI  - Trophic Status Mapping of Inland Water Bodies Using Normalized Difference Indices Derived from Sentinel 2 MSI Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic state index (TSI) is generally accepted as an indicator of the trophic status of inland water bodies. Regular monitoring of the trophic status of a water body is vital for understanding the health and functioning of its ecosystem. The band ratios (BR) and normalized difference (ND) indices are customarily used for classifying the land uses, but their capacity for quality monitoring of a water body has not been fully explored. The present study explores the possibility of using ND and BR of the bands of Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery (MSI) (S2) imagery for mapping the TSI of an inland water body. The data of Milford Lake, Kansas, were used to derive TSI. Three atmospherically corrected data sets obtained from Case 2 regional coast color processor (C2RCC), Acolite, and Sentinel 2 Correction (Sen2Cor) were used to derive ND and BR indices. The results of the correlation analyses of these indices with TSI reinforced the importance of atmospheric correction on any algorithm. TSI derived from turbidity measurements was observed to be well correlated to ND and BR indices of green (B3) and red bands (B4, B5, and B6) derived from the C2RCC data set (correlation coefficient > 0.8). Thresholds of BR and ND indices of green and red bands for delineating the hypereutrophic areas from the total area of interest were also identified. The regression relations and threshold criteria were validated with the data from five other lakes in the US and one lake in India to verify the compliance of these relations to other areas. TSI could be estimated with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9% from these lakes by using ND34, ND35, and ND45. The threshold criteria for BR34, BR46, and BR56 for delineating hypereutrophic areas were also validated for these lakes. The validations confirm that these computationally simple indices could be utilized for quality monitoring in areas of different geographic and climatic characteristics.

TI  - The Concept of the "Apple Savior" in the Novel by I. S. Shmelev "The Summer of the Lord"
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The research study aims to reveal the ways in which the concept of "Apple Savior" is artistic embodiment in the novel by I. S. Shmelev " The Summer of the Lord." The concept of "Apple Savior" is considered in the context of the writer's value and semantic attitudes, which have undergone significant changes compared to his pre-Revolution creative period. In the author's artistic consciousness, the image of the garden appears as the metaphorical source and beginning of human life. The narrative structure of the chapter is two-dimensional: it contains the discourse of the child hero and the mature narrator. Within the framework of children's worldview, the image of the garden is inseparable from the image of the family house, the categories of love, beauty and God's grace. The image of the garden is connected with the idea of Moscow as a garden and Holy Russia as a garden. In the novel "The Summer of the Lord" there is a generalized image - a symbol of the world transformed by God's presence and the power of the author's grateful love. The theme of transfiguration closely approaches the motifs of return and memories, which acquire a pronounced nostalgic tinge and lyrical tonality. The images of temples, the city of Moscow and Russia are associated with the motifs of transfiguration, sacrali-sation, spirituality, deification and eternity. In recreating the concept of the "Apple Savior" by I. S. Shmelev, the artistic method of "spiritual realism" fully manifested itself. The chronotope of the real world in the novel " The Summer of the Lord" appears in close connection with the existential sphere, is comprehended by God's world. The theme of memory and grateful love establishes the discourse of a mature narrator. The world of childhood and Homeland is recognized as a lost biblical paradise, and becomes the subject of persistent thoughts and reflections of the author.

TI  - Intertextuality as a way of embodiment of the author's worldview in the poetry of A. Podgornova
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article reveals the role of intertextuality in the embodiment of the poetic worldview of Alina Podgornova. The subject of the research is the methods of intertextuality in her poems.Objective: to reveal the functions of intertextuality techniques in the lyrics of A. Podgornova; to determine the specifics of the author's poetic self-expression.Research materials: poems by A. Podgornova included in the collections "Except Rhymes", "The Thought".Results and novelty of the research: as a result of the study, we come to the conclusion that an important feature of the postmodern poetry of A. Podgornova is intertextuality, which gives the work a semantic layering, forming a dialogic relationship between the author and her predecessors. The "communication" of the poetess with the classics, the reception of the world cultural space, historical and literary facts are conscious in nature. They are conditioned by the author(sic)s desire to reveal the contradictory realities of modern reality through them, to comprehend the issues of existential content. The intertextual dialogue in her lyrics is saturated with irony and mockery characteristic of the aesthetics of postmodernism, aimed not so much at the desacralization of cultural codes as at the explication of the author's reflection of the disharmonious world. The intertextual field of A. Podgornova's poems is created through a palette of various techniques - quotations in the form of epigraphs, reminiscences, allusions, references to cultural archetypes, socio-historical realities. Intertextuality in her lyrics is multifunctional, it becomes a conceptual, meaning-forming, structure-forming, subtextual, evaluative, symbolic category, a mechanism for expression of the author's poetic consciousness and creative worldview. The intertext evokes cultural, figurative, motif, psychological associations of a reader. It involves him in a kind of intellectual game, the main purpose of which is the decoding of cultural and symbolic signs. Intertextuality testifies to the inclusion of the poetess's work in the dialogue of cultures, communication of different eras, confirms the intellectual nature of her lyrics. The scientific novelty of the article is determined by the fact that it explores for the first time the intertextual field of A. Podgornova's poetry.

TI  - Calibration of the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Instrument (GMI) Based on a Digital Calibration Field Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Instrument (GMI), carried by Gaofen 5 (GF5-01), and the Hyperspectral Observation Satellite (GF5-02) were successfully launched on 9 May 2018, and September 7, 2021, respectively, and are the only passive greenhouse gas payloads in China that can regularly obtain effective detection data in-orbit at this stage. Before launch, the research team carried out much laboratory calibration work and designed an on-board calibration system based on solar radiation sources which guarantees the quantitative accuracy of the payload data to the greatest extent. In order to more effectively meet the high frequency calibration requirements over the whole life cycle of the payload, the research team carried out research using the on-track site calibration method based on digital calibration field network technology, and the obtained calibration coefficient effectively complements the laboratory and on-board calibration results. The working principle of the GMI is quite different from that of a traditional imaging payload. Spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS) is used to detect the absorption spectrum of greenhouse gases, has a large field of view and is non-imaging and hyperspectral. The existing fixed-site alternative calibration methods cannot fully meet the requirements of calibration tasks. In this paper, we propose a set of global digital calibration radiation field screening criteria that can meet the characteristics of the GMI and design a method to calculate the site calibration coefficients of non-absorption spectral channels according to the characteristics of hyperspectral data. Based on the historical observation data of the GMI, the initial calibration calculation of the payload launch was carried out, and the calibration results of four spectral channels of the GMI were obtained: The calibration coefficient range of the O-2 channel is 1.05-1.15, the mean value is 1.10 and the standard deviation is 2.72%; the calibration coefficient of the CO2-1 channel is 1.05-1.13, the mean value is 1.09 and the standard deviation is 2.64%; the calibration coefficient of the CH4 channel is 1.08-1.10, the mean value is 1.11 and the standard deviation is 2.73%; the calibration coefficient of the CO2-2 channel is 1.09-1.14, the mean value is 1.12 and the standard deviation is 2.93%. The above results show that the radiation performance of each channel of the GMI shows no significant attenuation during this period, that the site calibration coefficient has no significant fluctuation and that the in-orbit operation state is stable.

TI  - Estimation of Arctic Winter Snow Depth, Sea Ice Thickness and Bulk Density, and Ice Freeboard by Combining CryoSat-2, AVHRR, and AMSR Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on snow depth on sea ice and bulk sea ice density is required to convert CryoSat-2 radar freeboard (F-r) into sea ice thickness (SIT). It is difficult to obtain their information on an Arctic basin scale; therefore, most CryoSat-2 SIT products largely rely on the distributions of snow depth and bulk sea ice density derived from parameterizations, which are based on sea ice type and climatological values. Several observational studies have found that the distributions of parameterized variables are inaccurate compared to the actual distributions. This study aims to develop a new type of retrieval algorithm for snow depth, SIT and bulk density, and ice freeboard in the Arctic winter by synergizing active CryoSat-2 with passive microwave and infrared measurements. Two parameterizations for the snow-ice thickness ratio and bulk sea ice density were combined with the hydrostatic balance and radar wave speed correction equations. Consequently, solutions for the four target variables were obtained and applied to different CryoSat-2 F-r, derived from empirical and waveform-fitting (WF) retracker algorithms. The retrieved thickness-related parameters based on F-r from the Lognormal WF retracker algorithm showed good agreement with the airborne snow depth, total freeboard, and mooring ice draft measurements. The retrieved multiyear sea ice bulk density was significantly higher than the value of 882 kg center dot m(-3), which was used in the previous density parameterization, showing a higher agreement with values from in situ measurements. The spatial and interannual variabilities of SIT increased when the results from this study were compared with those based on previous parameterizations.

TI  - South Florida estuaries are warming faster than global oceans
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - title From extensive evaluations, it is found that, of all satellite data products of sea surface temperature (SST), MODIS SST is the most appropriate in assessing long-term trends of water temperature in the South Florida estuaries. Long-term SST data show significant warming trends in these estuaries during both daytime (0.55 degrees C/decade) and nighttime (0.42 degrees C/decade) between 2000 and 2021. The warming rates are faster during winter (0.70 degrees C/decade and 0.67 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime, respectively) than during summer (0.48 degrees C/decade and 0.28 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime, respectively). Overall, the South Florida estuaries experienced rapid warming over the past two decades, 1.7 and 1.3 times faster than the Gulf of Mexico (0.33 degrees C/decade and 0.32 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime), and 6.9 and 4.2 times faster than the global oceans (0.08 degrees C/decade and 0.10 degrees C/decade for daytime and nighttime).

TI  - Complex Optical Remote-Sensing Aircraft Detection Dataset and Benchmark
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft detection in remote-sensing images is significant in both military and civilian fields, such as air traffic control and battlefield dynamic monitoring. Deep-learning (DL) methods can achieve promising detection performance with sufficient and labeled samples. However, current aircraft datasets are mainly from a single data source and lack diverse scenes and targets, making it difficult to train a robust and generalized detector. Therefore, we manually label and construct a complex optical remote-sensing aircraft target detection dataset from Google Earth and multiple satellites such as WorldView-2, WorldView-3, Pleiades, Jilin-1, and IKONOS. It contains 7337 images covering typical airports and various rare scenes, including the aircraft carrier, ocean, and land with flying aircraft. The dataset consists of 32285 civil and military aircraft instances, including bombers, fighters, and early warning aircraft. These targets range from 4 x 4 to 240 x 240 pixels and are all labeled with both horizontal bounding box (HBB) and oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations. The various scenes and sufficient instances can fully support the training and evaluation of data-driven algorithms. Meanwhile, based on the constructed dataset, we train and evaluate several detectors to provide a benchmark and help promote the development of aircraft detection techniques.

TI  - LADSDIn: LiCSAR-Based Anomaly Detector of Seismic Deformation in InSAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Manual analysis of LiCSAR deformation data in tectonic zones and timely detection of pre-earthquake anomalous activity are very time-consuming. To solve this problem, an LiCSAR-based anomaly detector of seismic deformation in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (LADSDIn) is constructed in this article. LADSDIn can automatically detect and extract anomalous activity and seismic deformation in tectonic zones. LADSDIn is modeled by learning the spatiotemporal characteristics of MTInSAR time series deformation data to detect abnormal deformation. The detector considers transients that deviate from the "predicted" deformation, which are considered "anomalous." For earthquake-prone regions, "anomalies" with outlier characteristics in spatial and temporal properties are usually the deformations caused by seismic activities. We successfully applied LADSDIn to January 8, 2022, Menyuan Mw 6.7 earthquake in China, and LADSDIn successfully detected the extent of ground deformation induced by this seismic activity. The results show that the deformation range of the ascending track is -350-87 mm, and the deformation range of the descending track is -127-132 mm. The detector successfully detected the "anomalous deformation" signs before the earthquake (November 2021). In addition, LADSDIn supports parallel processing in chunks to reduce computation time. The characteristics of LADSDIn facilitate cluster deployment and use for automatic detection and extraction of seismic deformation in global tectonic zones. This work provides theoretical support for the automation and refinement study of global seismic activity.

TI  - Fast Mapping of Large-Scale Landslides in Sentinel-1 SAR Images Using SPAUNet
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate mapping of large-scale landslides is crucial for postdisaster prevention and risk analysis. This research introduces a new method named synthetic aperture radar (SAR) pixel-attention UNet (SPAUNet) to address the challenges of noise and information redundancy when utilizing SAR amplitude data for landslide detection. This process is based on constructing a UNet model and incorporating a pixel-attention mechanism. This study uses pre- and postdisaster SAR amplitude images as input data, generates seven pairs of dual-band combinations through registration, and inputs them into the model in sequence to automatically explore the best polarization amplitude combination, achieving rapid per-pixel mapping of large-scale landslides. Empirical analysis of landslide events in Milan and Papua New Guinea shows that SPAUNet outperforms the baseline models, improving the F1 score by 17% in Milan and 19% in Papua New Guinea. Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of choosing the appropriate polarization combination for the region. The results indicate that SPAUNet, along with the appropriate polarization amplitude combination, improves the accuracy and reliability of landslide mapping, aiding disaster assessment and recovery work. This improvement holds significant implications for landslide disaster assessment and postdisaster recovery, providing a valuable direction for further enhancing landslide monitoring capabilities.

TI  - A fast Fourier convolutional deep neural network for accurate and explainable discrimination of wheat yellow rust and nitrogen deficiency from Sentinel-2 time series data.
T2  - Frontiers in plant science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: Accurate and timely detection of plant stress is essential for yield protection, allowing better-targeted intervention strategies. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning have shown great potential for rapid non-invasive detection of plant stress in a fully automated and reproducible manner. However, the existing models always face several challenges: 1) computational inefficiency and the misclassifications between the different stresses with similar symptoms; and 2) the poor interpretability of the host-stress interaction.Methods: In this work, we propose a novel fast Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FFDNN) for accurate and explainable detection of two plant stresses with similar symptoms (i.e. Wheat Yellow Rust And Nitrogen Deficiency). Specifically, unlike the existing CNN models, the main components of the proposed model include: 1) a fast Fourier convolutional block, a newly fast Fourier transformation kernel as the basic perception unit, to substitute the traditional convolutional kernel to capture both local and global responses to plant stress in various time-scale and improve computing efficiency with reduced learning parameters in Fourier domain; 2) Capsule Feature Encoder to encapsulate the extracted features into a series of vector features to represent part-to-whole relationship with the hierarchical structure of the host-stress interactions of the specific stress. In addition, in order to alleviate over-fitting, a photochemical vegetation indices-based filter is placed as pre-processing operator to remove the non-photochemical noises from the input Sentinel-2 time series.Results and discussion: The proposed model has been evaluated with ground truth data under both controlled and natural conditions. The results demonstrate that the high-level vector features interpret the influence of the host-stress interaction/response and the proposed model achieves competitive advantages in the detection and discrimination of yellow rust and nitrogen deficiency on Sentinel-2 time series in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks is important in establishing greenhouse gas reduction plans. In this study, we estimate the spatial distribution of forest carbon stocks using machine learning techniques based on high-resolution remote sensing data and detailed field survey data. The high-resolution remote sensing data used in this study are Landsat indices (EVI, NDVI, NDII) for monitoring vegetation vitality and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data for describing topography. We also used the forest growing stock data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) for estimating forest biomass. Based on these data, we built a model based on machine learning methods and optimized for Korean forest types to calculate the forest carbon stocks per grid unit. With the newly developed estimation model, we created forest carbon stocks maps and estimated the forest carbon stocks in South Korea. As a result, forest carbon stock in South Korea was estimated to be 432,214,520 tC in 2020. Furthermore, we estimated the loss of forest carbon stocks due to the Donghae-Uljin forest fire in 2022 using the forest carbon stock map in this study. The surrounding forest destroyed around the fire area was estimated to be about 24,835 ha and the loss of forest carbon stocks was estimated to be 1,396,457 tC. Our model serves as a tool to estimate spatially distributed local forest carbon stocks and facilitates accounting of real-time changes in the carbon balance as well as managing the LULUCF part of greenhouse gas inventories.

TI  - Improving Soil Texture Digital Mapping Using Landsat 8 Satellite Imageries in Calcareous Soils of Southern Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last three decades, there has been a general tendency for changing research methods on soil resource management from conventional and mainly qualitative methods to quantitative ones based on spatial correlation models, which are called Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). The present study was carried out in Shabankareh Plain (15,000 ha) with different physiographic units, in Bushehr Province, southern Iran. The target sites (172 points) were selected for soil sampling at depths of 0-30 cm. Soil texture classes DSM was produced by two methods. The first method was Conventional DSM, in which data of soil particles was obtained from laboratory analysis for each sampling point along with their geographical location. Also, the study area boundary was added to ArcGIS software in UTM format and was analyzed by operating Kriging or IDW estimators. The map produced by this method was a low quality digital map containing extra and scattered texture classes with unrealistically sharp boundaries. The second method used CoKriging of L8 multispectral imagery data (OLI bands) and soil samples analysis was operated. Results showed that using B1 band (0.433-0.453 mu m) of Landsat 8 satellite imageries of the study area in April 2020 produced high quality digital maps. In this method, soil textures were the same as the ones in the study area. Salt accumulation and water content of surface soil were possible reasons indicating why satellite imageries in the other periods of year were not suitable for DSM. The highest and the lowest ranges of influence among soil texture parameters were 684 meters and 388 meter for clay and sand particles, respectively.

AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), light detection and ranging (lidar), and instrumentation have been tools in the geotechnical engineer's toolbox for decades. However, these technologies have experienced improvements and cost reductions on vastly different timelines; therefore, engineers have generally employed these technologies separately for evaluations and long-term monitoring. Individually, these technologies provide unique benefits for a given project, but combined these technologies provide a holistic view of a geotechnical asset. Satellite InSAR systems, such as the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1, provide a nearly temporal continuous picture of past and present movements in many discrete locations on and around an asset. Tripod-mounted lidar provides a spatially continuous 3D point cloud of assets at discrete points in time using the laser time-of-flight principle. Lastly, instrumentation, such as tiltmeters and shape arrays, provides automated continuous monitoring of movement on an asset at specific locations. Here, we present an example of a vertically integrated workflow using InSAR, lidar, and instrumentation for monitoring retaining wall performance. This study includes monitoring of several mechanically stabilized highway retaining walls in the southern region of the United States. The proposed workflow combines the three technologies to overcome their individual limitations and provide spatially and temporally continuous asset monitoring. For example, the long-standing challenge of locating a few high quality tiltmeters in the most significant areas of concern is partially answered by identifying wall locations that exhibit geometric anomalies in the lidar point clouds. Additionally, evaluating regional historical and ongoing InSAR trends and local automated instrumentation data helps inform the frequency of subsequent lidar scanning. When vertically integrated, these tools allow for the data-driven selection of the frequency and extent of future monitoring and inspections. This approach allows engineers to tailor the monitoring program to each asset's performance and enables owners to allocate limited inspection and maintenance resources more efficiently.

TI  - Absolute Radiometric Calibration of PMS2 Onboard Jilin-1 GP02 Satellite Using the Moon
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate radiometric calibration is very important for remote sensing optical sensors. Numerous astronomical measurements and model analyses have shown that the Moon is extremely stable in reflectance properties and can serve as a great absolute reference source. Jilin-1 satellite has made long-period observations of the Moon over a wide range of phase angles. However, the spectra displayed fluctuations after radiometric calibration with the provided coefficients. This is inconsistent with the lunar reflectance spectra, which are smooth and generally no sharp absorption. In this study, we conducted radiometric calibration for PMS2 onboard Jilin-1 Guangpu02 (GP02) satellite using the Moon as the calibration source. The calibration results were validated based on different lunar geological terrain, i.e., maria and highlands. The lunar phase curve obtained through the application of the lunar calibration coefficients derived in this study show good agreement with the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and PLEIADES data. The results indicate that: 1) the spectra become much smoother after lunar calibration, consistent with the characteristics of lunar spectra; 2) the lunar calibration results demonstrate exceeding linearity, with average linear fit uncertainty of 0.69% and goodness-offit (R-2) of 0.9997 for the calibration coefficients; and 3) the average relative difference between the phase curves of PMS2 and SeaWiFS is 3.6% and 4.66% with PLEIADES. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of our lunar calibration method. Although this method was specifically applied to the PMS2, the lunar calibration method is expected to be applicable to other Earth-orbiting satellites.

AB  - In an agriculturally-dominant economy such as India, gross crop production and adequate land use constitute essential variables to contemplate, when assessing the socioeconomic well-being of all societal segments. Indubitably, agriculture growth relies on climatic factors and the availability of natural resources to suffice the demand-supply chain. Drought, a natural hazard, grievously impairs land conditions and water availability determinants, bringing in a crisis in agriculture productivity and several other interlinked spheres. In this paper, we demonstrate the effective implementation of Linear Regression, a widely favored Machine Learning (ML) - based model, to capture the short-term drought severity, incorporating two datasets comprising NOAA/AVHRR satellite-data-derived Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and VHI+Rainfall readings as the features. The Karnataka state of India is selected as the Region of Interest (ROI), and the compiled dataset spans the period 1981 through 2021. A thorough comparison of the proposed model with several anointed reference models is proffered. The model is further evaluated on datasets for various timescales, and the outcomes are documented. The proposed ML model outperforms the other conventional models as validated through the performance metrics, inclusive of coefficient of determination (R2), mean squared error, and mean absolute error, obtaining values of 0.98, 0.0076, and 0.048 for the VHI dataset and 0.97, 0.0148, and 0.067 for VHI+Rainfall datasets respectively on the selected ROI.

TI  - The Cheptsa River in the rituals and beliefs of the Northern Udmurts
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the Cheptsa River has a significant economic , social role in the history and culture of the Northern Udmurts since the ancient times. However, special studies on meaning of the Cheptsa River in the life of the Udmurts have not yet been conducted. An exception is the author's work on the role of the Cheptsa Region in the formation of the Northern Udmurt population. Indirect data about the river are contained in the works on the archaeological sites of the Cheptsa River basin, the Cheptsa heroes' legends, as way as the calendar and family ceremonies held near the river.Objective: to define the role and significance of the Cheptsa River in the traditional religious and mythological worldview of the Northern Udmurts.Research materials: author's field materials of the late XX - early XXI centuries, archeological, folklore and ethnographic literature of the late XIX - early XX centuries.Results , novelty of the research: for the first time, the role and significance of the Cheptsa River in the traditional religious and mythological worldview of the Northern Udmurts is analyzed. It is revealed that the Cheptsa River's valley is understood (perceived) as a common (general) ethnic, family and tribal territory. It is traced that the Cheptsa River performs not only real economic, cultural, but also metaphysical, irrational functions in the life of the Northern Udmurts. The semantics of the Cheptsa River is characterized as a symbol of the homeland, a road in real and mythological dimensions, a border between worlds, a means of getting rid of diseases, as a sacred value of the local Udmurts. General cultural (stadial and typological) and original (specific) features in the veneration of the river are revealed. Peculiarities of the Northern Udmurts worldview are the developed ideas about the creatures of the water world, the presence of a whole system of rituals and special places associated with cult of the owners of the water element. It is determined that the anthropomorphic image of the water sphere master occupied a more significant position in the Udmurt beliefs, archaic female personifications of these rivers spirits and other images of water creatures faded into the background. The author comes to the conclusion that the Cheptsa River is an important economic, landscape, cultural and mythological object for the Northern Udmurts.

TI  - A Novel Algorithm of Haze Identification Based on FY3D/MERSI-II Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2013, frequent haze pollution events in China have been attracting public attention, generating a demand to identify the haze areas using satellite observations. Many studies of haze recognition algorithms are based on observations from space-borne imagers, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). Since the haze pixels are frequently misidentified as clouds in the official cloud detection products, these algorithms mainly focus on recovering them from clouds. There are just a few studies that provide a more precise distinction between haze and clear pixels. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer II (MERSI-II), the imager aboard the FY-3D satellite, has similar bands to those of MODIS, hence, it appears to have equivalent application potential. This study proposes a novel MERSI haze mask (MHAM) algorithm to directly categorize haze pixels in addition to cloudy and clear ones. This algorithm is based on the fact that cloudy and clear pixels exhibit opposing visible channel reflectance and infrared channel brightness temperature characteristics, and clear pixels are relative brighter, and as well as this, there is a positive difference between their apparent reflectance values, at 0.865 mu m and 1.64 mu m, respectively, over bright surfaces. Compared with the Aqua/MODIS and MERSI-II official cloud detection products, these two datasets treat the dense aerosol loadings as certain clouds, possible clouds and possible clear pixels, and they treat distinguished light or moderate haze as possible clouds, possible clear pixels and certainly clear pixels, while the novel algorithm is capable of demonstrating the haze region's boundary in a manner that is more substantially consistent with the true color image. Using the PM2.5 (particle matter with a diameter that is less than 2.5 mu m) data monitored by the national air quality monitoring stations as the test source, the results indicated that when the ground-based PM2.5 >= 35 mu g/cm(3) is considered to be haze days, the samples with the recognition rate that is higher than 85% accounted for 72.22% of the total samples. When PM2.5 >= 50 mu g/cm(3) is considered as haze days, 83.33% of the samples had an identification rate that was higher than 85%. A cross-comparison with similar research methods showed that the method proposed in this study had better sensitivity to bright surface clear and haze areas. This study will provide a haze mask for subsequent quantitative inversion of aerosol characteristics, and it will further exert the application benefits of MERSI-II instrument aboard on FY3D satellite.

TI  - From Kyiv to Brisbane: Evgenii Vodolazkin's reflections on spiritual identity in the context of space
T2  - WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with cultural identification and perception of space in the novel Brisbane (2018, Eng. trans. 2022) by Evgenii/Eugene Vodolazkin. The writer presents controversial problems of Russian and Ukrainian relations placing the question of cultural identification of the hero in the centre of his reflections. Despite the fact that the novel depicts many important events from the history of today's Ukraine, in some sense showing the author's attitude to them, the core of Vodolazkin's narration is to expose the issue of particular cultural formation, created in the period of medieval Rus, whose spiritual capital was located in Kyiv. Employing the methods of contemporary research in terms of the geopoetics of place, this article scrutinizes many structural elements of the novel, which as an effect of reading in special code opens the field for analyses of such problems as autobiographical place, symbol of the home, opposition of space and place, and descriptions of the landscape. This study makes it possible to conclude that places depicted in Vodolazkin's work define the hero not only in the geographical aspect but mainly in the spiritual one, as a man who belongs to the world of Kyivan Rus culture and who finds signposts for understanding complicated questions of the present in the enduring medieval worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape says the anthropogenic impacts that affect water courses by land use and cover, and the analysis of its change in a watershed is a strategic tool to assess the quality of surface waters. The research aims to analyze the changes of the landscape in three watersheds between the years 2006 and 2016, relating to environmental quality assessed in loco. We investigated the watershed of the island of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis -SC, namely the rivers: Ratones, Itacorubi and Tavares. The LandSat satellite images from 2006 to 2016 were used for landscape analysis and associated to the application of the Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP). It was noted that urban spots in the areas investigated had an increase of 319% basin River Tavares, 105% of the river Ratones and 8% in River Itacorubi, and changes in environmental quality. In these basins, we found factors that cause the degradation of water, including urbanization, deforestation of riparian forests, inefficiency of the treatment of domestic wastewater and solid waste disposal. The landscape analysis will serve to understand the future trend of this environmental quality forward to the changes proposed by the government.

TI  - Landsat data respond to variations in the structure of Caatinga plant communities along a successional gradient.
T2  - Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Plant community succession is generally approached with phytosociological methods, but field surveys are time-consuming, expensive, and limited to several of sites. Remote sensing offers an efficient and economical way to analyze vegetation on large extensions and in inaccessible areas. Most studies addressing remote sensing and tree community succession refer to forest physiognomies. We investigated whether structural changes that occur in non-forest physiognomies are identified by multispectral sensor images (OLI-Landsat). Thirteen 0.1-ha plots were set up in Caatinga fragments aging 10-15, 20-25, 30-35, 40-45 and >50 years to calculate the total density of individuals (TD), mean canopy height (H), total basal area (G) and total aboveground biomass (AGB). We performed correlation analyses between these structural descriptors and eight remote sensing variables (reflectance data and spectral indices) obtained from Landsat images at the end of the rainy season and during the dry season. Blue and short-wave infrared reflectances were negatively correlated with mean height, basal area and biomass, regardless of the analyzed scene (coefficients between -0.58 and -0.79). The litter layer (a non-photosynthetic vegetation component) and the soil exposure are important factors influencing the spectral data.

TI  - Overstrength of I-Shaped Shear Links for EBF Design
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Past experimental research on EBF indicated that the link overstrength, particularly that for short (i.e., shear) links, could be much higher than that specified in the AISC Seismic Provisions, thus potentially leading to an unsafe design of beams, columns, and gusset connections per the capacity design requirements. This study aims to identify key factors contributing to the high overstrength and to derive an expression to predict the overstrength of short links. Available experimental data were first collected, and main parameters affecting the overstrength were identified from the database and used for a multi-variate regression analysis. It was found that the following two parameters affect the link overstrength the most: (1) the Fu/ Fy ratio between the actual tensile strength and yield stress and (2) Kw, a factor that represents the contribution of localized bending of link flanges. The link length, to a lesser extent, also affects the overstrength. A predictive overstrength equation based on these three parameters was proposed for capacity design of EBF with short links.

TI  - Improved Ocean-Fog Monitoring Using Himawari-8 Geostationary Satellite Data Based on Machine Learning With SHAP-Based Model Interpretation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean-fog is a type of fog that forms over the ocean and has a visibility of less than 1 km. Ocean-fog frequently causes incidents over oceanic and coastal regions; ocean-fog detection is required regardless of the time of day. Ocean-fog has distinct thermo-optical properties, and spatially and temporally extensive ocean-fog detection methods based on geostationary satellites are typically employed. Infrared (IR) channels of Himawari-8 were used to construct three machine-learning models for the continuous detection of ocean-fog. In contrast, visible channels are valid only during the daytime. As control models, we used fog products from the National Meteorological Satellite Center (NMSC) and machine-learning models trained by adding a visible channel. The extreme gradient boosting model utilizing IR channels corrected ocean-fog perfectly day and night, with the highest F1 score of 97.93% and a proportion correct (PC) of 98.59% throughout the day. In contrast, the NMSC product had a probability of detection of 87.14%, an F1 score of 93.13%, and a PC of 71.9%. As demonstrated by the qualitative evaluation, the NMSC product overestimates clouds over small and coarsely textured ocean-fog regions. In contrast, the proposed model distinguishes between ocean-fog, clear skies, and clouds at the pixel scale. The Shapley additive explanation analysis demonstrated that the difference between channels 14 and 7 was very useful for ocean-fog detection at night, and its extremely low values contributed significantly to distinguishing nonfog during the daytime. Channel 15, affected by water vapor absorption, contributed most to ocean-fog detection among atmospheric window channels. The research findings can be used to improve operational ocean-fog detection and forecasting.

TI  - Application of the LSTM Models for Baltic Sea Wave Spectra Estimation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes to apply long-short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models to transform Sentinel-1 A/B interferometric wide (IW) swath image data into the wave density spectrum. Although spectral wave estimation methods for synthetic aperture radar data have been developed, similar approaches for coastal areas have not received enough attention. Partially, this is caused by the lack of high-resolution wave-mode data, as well as the nature of wind waves that have more complicated backscattering mechanisms compared to the swell waves for which the aforementioned methods were developed. The application of the LSTM model has allowed the transformation of the Sentinel-1 A/B IW one-dimensional image spectrum into wave density spectra. The best results in the test dataset led to the mean Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.85 for the comparison of spectra and spectra. The result was achieved with the LSTM model using $VV$ and $VH$ polarization spectra fed into the model independently. Experiments with LSTM neural networks that classify images into wave spectra with the Baltic Sea dataset demonstrated promising results in cases where empirical methods were previously considered.

TI  - WIANet: A Wavelet-Inspired Attention-Based Convolution Neural Network for Land Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - General convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process the data in the spatial domain and lack efficacy in modeling the spectral context in multispectral image processing task. To address this limitation, in this letter, we propose a wavelet-inspired attention-based convolution neural network (WIANet) architecture that combines the modeling of the spatio-spectral resolution of multispectral remote sensing (RS) images with a wavelet convolution and attention unit into a single deep learning architecture for land cover classification. Our aim is to add the characteristics of both wavelet transform (WT) and attention mechanism into an UNet-based architecture to better exploit the spectral and texture information for distinguishing classes with high similarity in the spectral signatures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a multilabel multispectral Sentinel-2 dataset. The experiment shows that the proposed approach performs better than the reference methods in different conditions on the number of training samples.

CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - Expanding needs for using UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles) remote sensing approaches, such as terrain-following aerial mapping applications using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) in catastrophic applications. New extracts in UAV mapping still contain a limited number of studies for analyzing finescale mapping accuracy in UAV remote sensing methods-terrain-following aerial mapping for UAVs based on external airborne LiDAR integrated with the flight controller. We introduce the UAV system for the terrain after mapping the high-rise area by circumventing obstacles around it, expanding it so that UAVs flying at low altitudes can collect high-quality ground information while protecting them from all kinds of obstacles up and down. A more informative map is prepared to speed up the rescue and relief operations of the devastated area. Then on-destructive techniques have been surveyed and explored Solani riverbank sites of the high undulating area in Roorkee, Haridwar district in the Indian state of Uttrakhand. This work aims to critically analyze fine-scale remotely sensed data for mapping using LiDAR and UAV obtained the structure from motion photogrammetry. This work outlines the approaches applied to remote sensing data to reveal potential sensitivities, reflecting the close visual methods of the catastrophic region.

T2  - ECOLOGY OF HIMALAYAN TREELINE ECOTONE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - A landscape-level assessment on status of livestock population and impact of pastoral practices on timberline vegetation of the western Himalaya was conducted. We used a combination of field survey and remote sensing data (Landsat, Sentinal and Cartosat & LISS-IV merged) to quantify the cumulative impacts of livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction and other anthropogenic pressures on forest cover around tourist impacted and camping site areas. There are over 26,950 bovines, horses and mules of local and migratory communities graze across the timberline region >2700 masl in the western Himalaya. Grazing, fuelwood and fodder collection jointly have created about 4503.5 ha of artificial grasslands (kharak) in the timberline zone. The artificial grasslands are more in the enclosing or island timberline areas. The change analysis of artificial grasslands around the temporary huts where there is frequent grazing and tourist activities indicates a steady increase in the area of grazing land at the cost of forest cover around camping site. There was loss of forests about 30.3 ha during 1976-1990 (14 years), 53.67 ha during 1990-2005 (15 years) and 30.9 ha during 2005-2018 (13 years). It is also observed that many of the isolated camping sites are now connected due to loss of vegetation. Phytosociological analysis indicates that the conversion of regenerating individuals to mature tree around the cattle camping site is very low, leading to expanse in the gap areas at an alarming rate in the timberline ecotone.

TI  - Incorporation of the 40-Gene Expression Profile (40-GEP) Test to Improve Treatment Decisions in High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) Patients: Case Series and Algorithm
T2  - CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has become a significant public health issue due to its rapidly rising incidence and an estimated 1.8 million newly diagnosed cases annually. As with other cancers, treatment decisions for patients with cSCC are based primarily on a patient's risk for poor outcomes. There has been improvement in clinicopathologic factor-based risk assessment approaches, either through informal methods or ever evolving staging approaches. However, these approaches misidentify patients who will eventually have disease progression as low-risk and conversely, over classify patients as high-risk who do not experience relapse. To improve the accuracy of risk assessment for patients with cSCC, the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test has been validated to show statistically significant stratification of a high-risk cSCC patient's risk of nodal or distant metastasis, independent of currently available risk-assessment methods. The 40-GEP test allows for a more accurate classification of metastatic risk for high-risk cSCC patients, with the aim to influence appropriate allocation of clinician time and therapeutic resources to those patients who will most benefit. The objective of this article is to present a treatment algorithm in which clinicians can easily integrate the results of the 40-GEP test into their current treatment approaches to tailor patient care based on individual tumor biology. The following modalities were considered: surveillance imaging, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), adjuvant radiation therapy (ART), and clinical follow-up. The authors have contributed their own cases for discussion as to how they have seen the beneficial impact of 40-GEP test results in their own practice. Overall, clinicians can identify risk-aligned treatment pathway improvements with the use of the 40-GEP test for challenging to manage, high-risk cSCC patients.

TI  - Evaluating automated endmember extraction for classifying hyperspectral data and deriving spectral parameters for monitoring forest vegetation health
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral remote sensing datasets possess high capability in differentiating the spectrally similar features, and thus, they are immensely important in various forestry activities, especially vegetation classifications. But extracting endmembers for data training is a challenging task. The present study is focused on the use of automated endmember extraction technique for deriving endmembers during the unavailability of ground spectra. We used the Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) method on EO-1 Hyperion data for endmember extraction in the Barkot forest range of Dehradun district, Uttarakhand which were used for classification of the study area using support vector machine (SVM). Further, we estimated the vegetation health of the region by assigning the threshold weights for various derived environmental variables such as NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), CRI (Carotenoid Reflectance Index), Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI), Modified Simple Ratio (MSR), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI) and WBI (Water Band Index). Then, to further validate the health of the forest types, we correlated it with the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from LANDSAT 5 ETM + data. The results showed a high classification accuracy of 89.13%. The healthy vegetation area coverage of the area was about 78.6% with most healthy class as Tectona grandis and Shorea robusta and its correlation with LST showed lower temperature range in healthy vegetation areas and vice versa. The study was useful in determining the superiority of SMACC automated endmember extraction and estimating the vegetation health.

AB  - Cloud detection is an essential pre-processing step to delineate cloud-affected regions for many applications involving optical remote sensing data. This paper presents a deep learning segmentation approach using attention-based U-net architecture, which is used to detect clouds for the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Resourcesat series Advance Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) imagery. The network can identify cloud cover from the top-of-atmosphere reflectance scene using an Encoder and Decoder along with an attention mechanism. The attention mechanism optimizes the computational resources by minimizing activations, and the Decoder can pay attention only to the relevant part of the scene. This approach results in an overall accuracy of 87.3%. The result demonstrates that the proposed method can be considered a benchmark for AWiFS imagery.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important geological features of any area in the present times. During the study, the information regarding the land surface temperature is calculated using the Arc-GIS software. The LANDSAT 8 (2022) and LANDSAT 4-5 (2001 and 2011) satellite images are used for the calculation of LST. From the LST maps of years 2001 and 2011, a significant rise is noticed; this is due to the rapid increment in the population of the said area. A gradual increment in the LST is present between the second period of 2011-2022. A connection between the LST and the specific humidity has also been drawn in this aspect. The specific humidity in the region has seen a significant increment in the concerned time period. Overall, it is observed that the LST of the area has increased rapidly from the-12 & DEG;C minimum temperature in 2001 to 27 & DEG;C in 2022; this is because of the human activity in the area, which has ultimately catered towards the degradation of the climatic condition and environment like LST.

M3  - Article
AB  - There is a widespread opinion in Russian and foreign literature about the religious essence of Marxism-Leninism. Based on the analysis of the main aspects of this ideology, the article concludes that it did not have 'religious' characteristics due to its lack of transcendent characteristics, as well as of unstable dogmatism and 'sacralization' of leaders. Communist ideology and religion were completely combined in the worldview of the inhabitants of the USSR. Soviet ideological and political practices were also not a 'religion', and the 'religious motives' that existed in them were a substitution or replacement of religious rites in order to form a new, Soviet identity.

TI  - Human ELISA Detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Cats: Seroprevalence and Risk Factors for Virus Spread in Domestic and Stray Cats in Bulgaria
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The aim of the study was to verify whether the human DR-ELISA for the detection of antibodies against the agent of COVID-19 can be applied in cats, as well as to assess the risk factors that determine the spread of the virus among the cat population in Bulgaria. Therefore, 92 serum samples collected from 68 domestic and 24 stray cats were analyzed and compared with a multi-species ELISA kit. The results showed 83.33% positive results in stray cats and 41.18% in domestic cats, respectively, by both assays. Cats under 7 years had a five times higher risk than those over 7 years. The risk was seven times higher for stray cats than for domestic cats. Additionally, the results indicate the highest risk for cats in villages. This study demonstrates that human DR-ELISA may be helpful in monitoring the circulation of the virus in cats. The aim of this study was to verify whether the human DR-ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be applied in cats, and to assess the risk factors that determine the spread of the virus among the cat population in Bulgaria. The study included 92 serum samples collected from 68 domestic and 24 stray cats aged from 3 months to 20 years of age in the period of January-June 2021. The samples originated from three regions in Bulgaria and from three places of inhabitance. DR-ELISA based on peroxidase-labeled SARS-CoV-2 N protein was employed to detect IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies in the samples. Subsequently, the results were compared with a commercially available multi-species ELISA kit. There was high seroprevalence (83.33%) in stray cats and 41.18% in domestic cats, confirmed by the human and veterinary ELISA kit. The positive cases in the regional cities were 42.86%, in small towns 50% and in villages 78.26%. Cats under 7 years had a five times higher risk than those over 7 years (p = 0.001). The risk was seven times higher for stray cats than for domestic cats (p = 0.001). In addition, the results indicate that the risk was the highest for cats in villages (p = 0.006) compared to cats in other places of inhabitance. This study demonstrates that human DR-ELISA may be successfully applied to monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and other susceptible species. Cats might serve as sentinel animals for tracking the virus in nature and in inhabited areas (strays) and to discover asymptomatic cases in humans/owners.

TI  - The Kyoto School of Philosophy and Nihilism: Nishitani Keiji
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The article presents brief analysis of the main points of the philosophical con-cept of representation of the Kyoto school Nishitani Keiji (1900-1990), one of the pupils of the eminent Japanese thinker, Nishida Kitaro. Nishitani's main lifework What is Religion (English variation Religion and Nothingness) is devoted to the problem of Nihilism. His interest in this trend of social thought arose among the Japanese scientist under the influence, first of all, of the ideology of Friedrich Nietzsche (in whose person nihilism acquired self-consciousness) as well as the worldview ideas of Dostoevsky. A large place in the works of Nishitani is given to the work of Jean Paul Sartre. One can state the two-vector nature of the Kyoto school's ideological principles: on the one hand, reliance on the Buddhist and Taoist traditions of metaphysics, and on the other hand, the use of the conceptual apparatus of Western epistemology. Hence, syncretism in an effort to create an authentic national philosophy. It is no coincidence that Nishitani Keiji devoted his work to the development of the aesthetic and reli-gions areas of philosophy as the most fully expressing the ideological features of Japanese spiritual culture. At the same time, he notes the fact that nihilism is a spiritual disease not only of the Western part of humanity, but also of Japanese society.

TI  - Optical reflectance across spatial scales--an intercomparison of transect-based hyperspectral, drone, and satellite reflectance data for dry season rangeland
T2  - DRONE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drone-based multispectral sensing is a valuable tool for dryland spatial ecology, yet there has been limited investigation of the reproducibility of measurements from drone-mounted multispectral camera array systems or the intercomparison between drone-derived measurements, field spectroscopy, and satellite data. Using radiometrically calibrated data from two multispectral drone sensors (MicaSense RedEdge (MRE) and Parrot Sequoia (PS)) co-located with a transect of hyperspectral measurements (tramway) in the Chihuahuan desert (New Mexico, USA), we found a high degree of correspondence within individual drone data sets, but that reflectance measurements and vegetation indices varied between field, drone, and satellite sensors. In comparison to field spectra, MRE had a negative bias, while PS had a positive bias. In comparison to Sentinel2, PS showed the best agreement, while MRE had a negative bias for all bands. A variogram analysis of NDVI showed that ecological pattern information was lost at grains coarser than 1.8 m, indicating that drone-based multispectral sensors provide information at an appropriate spatial grain to capture the heterogeneity and spectral variability of this dryland ecosystem in a dry season state. Investigators using similar workflows should understand the need to account for biases between sensors. Modelling spatial and spectral upscaling between drone and satellite data remains an important research priority.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization and their annual increase in volume is not only one of the main problems of arid and subarid regions, but it is becoming global. Studying the problem of salinization and its spatial distribution using operational remote sensing methods is very important for Kazakhstan, where almost half of the agricultural land is exposed to salinization, but it is at the initial stage of development in the use of space technologies of research. The main goal of this study is to conduct a field study of soil salinity in corn fields, one of the most common crops in the arid region of the country, located in the Shaulder irrigated massif, using space-based methods, and to create algorithms for compiling a salinity map based on remote sensing data. For this purpose, firstly, using Sentinel-2 images, the method of separating corn from other dominant crops in the region by creating NDVI dynamics covering all phases of growth of agricultural crops was shown. Then, a regression analysis was performed on soil and vegetation indices calculated using satellite images and data on soil salinity obtained through field studies. As a result of the analysis, the main predictor of deciphering salinized soils was determined. By dividing the predictive image into quartiles, contours of salinized soils were determined and a soil salinity map was created. With the help of the soil salinity map, it was found that, non-saline soils - 2912.2 ha; slightly saline soils - 3288.4 ha, moderately saline soils - 2615.2 ha, and strongly saline soils - 1284.3 ha in the study area.

TI  - Potential Impact of the Pan-African Great Green Wall on Sahelian Summer Precipitation: A Global Modeling Approach with MPAS
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The pan-African Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel initiative (GGW) is a reforestation pro-gram to reverse the degradation of land. We investigate characteristics of mean precipitation due to proposed land-use changes to woody savannah with three hypothetical courses of the GGW, with an area between 0.8 and 1.25 million km2, and between the 100-and 400-mm isohyets. The global Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) was applied for this in-vestigation, employing ensembles with 40 members for the rainy season from June to September and 50 members for August when precipitation is at its peak. In comparison with the observational reference, the results show that a wet bias on the order of 33% in the eastern Sahel and a moderate dry bias of 241% in the western Sahel are present in the MPAS simulations. Our simulations do not provide any significant evidence for GGW-induced changes in the characteristics of the summer precipitation, for positive changes within the Sahel supporting the forestation activities, or for potentially adverse changes in the neighboring regions. Changes are present at the regional scale, but they are not significant at the 5% level. Also, changes simulated for further hydrometeorological variables such as temperature, radiation fluxes, or runoff are comparatively small.

NASA's Space Communication and Navigation program has introduced a vision of interoperable user terminals that can roam between multiple service providers. For several years, NASA has also been exploring the use of automation for user-initiated service requests, which could increase network efficiency and reduce our operational burden. In this work, we present a simulation framework that is being used to research User Initiated Services and automated algorithms for NASA's future network of networks. Our digital testbed interfaces with AGI's System Tool Kit (STK), for orbital mechanics and link budget analysis, and adds custom software for satellite data generation, satellite buffers, nondeterministic scheduling requests, data priority handling, service provider cost models, and user scheduling algorithms.

TI  - Political Mythology in the Work of Valerius Maximus
T2  - ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the ideas about the republic in the work of the Roman author Valerius Maximus, who lived at the beginning of the principate. The most revealing elements of the republican structure are taken for analysis: the People's Assembly, the Senate, the Tribunes of the Plebs, freedom, the enemies of freedom, as well as the image of Cato the Younger as the embodiment of the moral spirit of the republic. Valerius's narrative is dominated by outstanding personalities and the Senate, which fully corresponds to the current political situation. Such attention to the individual reflects a certain departure from polis collectivism. "Freedom" is perceived by Valerius undoubtedly as the antipode of the sole power, although the special position of the princeps in the new political system was also realized by our author. However, the contradiction here is only external, since already under Augustus an understanding of freedom as "security" (securitas) was formed, which linked freedom with authoritarian power. The views of Valerius Maximus basically correspond to the optimate' worldview, i.e. the res publica of the past for him is primarily associated with the leadership of the Senate. But this optimate' view reflects the opposition of the "best citizens" not only to the unreasonable people, but also to the claims of an outstanding personality to sole rule. In this respect, this "program" has come into clear contradiction with the new political situation, changing and adapting as the monarchical principle strengthens. The transformation of optimate' views is shown by the example of an ardent supporter of the republic Cato the Younger, whose image in Valerius Maximus' work reflects the transformation of past events into textbook examples outside the historical context.

TI  - How Organizations Lose Their Way: Unethical Behavior and Moral Disengagement in Complex Organizational Context
T2  - BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unethical behavior in organizations has garnered more and more attention in the last decades but most of the scholarly work has used a static approach relying on methodological individualism and a mechanistic worldview when studying this topic. The process of moral disengagement and organizational culture have been linked to the prevalence of unethical behavior earlier, but this paper uses a complexity-informed systems perspective to explore the dynamic relationship of these concepts and aims to improve our understanding of the often unnoticeable, step-by-step process through which organizational cultures can become conducive to unethical behavior. Organizations are conceptualized as complex adaptive systems in which transformative and stabilizing processes based on feedback loops take place continuously. It is discussed how these processes can lead to a phase transition driving organizations towards a state where unethical behavior is the general norm. The process is illustrated through real-life examples.

TI  - Occurrence and spatial distribution of native acai groves in high-production areas of the Amazon region1
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - -The floodplain forests of the Amazon estuary have undergone constant change over recent years, where management techniques, especially intensive management, have had an impact on the dynamics of the vegetation and land use. These changes can be monitored using satellite data. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of ground vegetation on the islands of Jarimbu, Mamangal, Itaboca, Mutirao and Bucu in the district of Igarape-Miri, Para, using images from the RapidEye and Planet satellites. The unsupervised ISODATA classification method was used, generating distinct classes of vegetation between each island. To evaluate the efficiency of the classification, an average of 200 random points were used, with another 30 points relating to the type of usage for each class. The Kappa index and overall precision were also analysed, in addition to calculating errors of omission and commission. Monitoring on a seven-year time scale using high-resolution satellites, a more than 50% increase in the Exposed Soil class was seen for the islands of Jarimbu, Mutirao and Itaboca, the latter responsible for an increase of more than 50% in the Urban Area class. On each of the five islands, the Alluvial class, representing the areas of acai groves, has emerged over the last seven years, increasing in area at the expense of a reduction in the Arboreal class. In this respect, the confusion matrix showed a mean accuracy for the islands of 'very good', with a mean overall precision of 77.74%, and a mean Kappa index of 0.73, indicating strong agreement with the reference data and the classification.

TI  - Modeling of the land surface temperature as a function of the soil-adjusted vegetation index
T2  - REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is a physical-environmental variable that is the target of studies in climatology and heat island phenomena resulting from the urbanization model of the 21st century. It is known that each object has a different thermal capacity, which results in higher or lower temperatures. The modeling of temperature as a function of objects on the land surface can allow understanding between these variables. It can corroborate temperature forecasts with the alteration of objects in an area. The objects on the Earth's surface can be computed with geoprocessing techniques that aim to detail Land Use and Occupation. This paper evaluates the Linear, Exponential, and Sinusoidal models to determine which of these models is more expressive for the study of the land surface temperature as a function of land surface objects. For this purpose, images from the Landsat 8 satellite were used to calculate the Earth's surface temperature and determine the scene's objects. To determine the scene's objects, the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) was used, which is one of the techniques for obtaining Land Use and Occupation. For model analysis, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Sum of Square of Residuals (SSR). According to the AIC, BIC, and SSR criteria, the sinusoidal model presented better performance when compared to the other models. However, there are large variations in SSR between classes, especially for the pasture class, which makes the models not highly explanatory.

TI  - The Phenomenon of Cosmological Ideas in Early American Puritan Philosophy
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to offer a specific perspective on Puritan philosophy. Most of the early American philosophy of the Puritans dealt with theological issues, the main topics of philosophical speculation were the ideas of God, salvation, freedom, and others. However, there were some ideas, the presence of which is an important factor, which until now has been little taken into account. This factor is the genuine interest of the Puritans in the natural sciences. Both in England and in America, there were favorable conditions for the new natural philosophy proclaimed by Francis Bacon, this natural philosophy offered a new type of thought. The English philosopher struggled with obstacles in the way of research, one of which was infallible authority, for example, the authority of Aristotle. One of the most curious facts about the colonial life of American settlers is the construction of Harvard College, which from the first days, preserved and increased knowledge. Among the sciences taught was astronomy, which indicates the interest of the Puritans in the study of space. The most important change in the scientific worldview of the times of the first colonies in North America was the adoption of the heliocentric system of Nicolaus Copernicus to replace the geocentric system of Ptolemy, which had existed for many centuries. Among the first books printed in the colonies were mainly religious texts, but there were also scientific ones, for example, astronomical almanacs and catalogs appeared. The information in these books helped in observing the heavenly bodies, for which the first optical instruments, telescopes, were used. Several decades after the first settlers in Plymouth, the first telescope appeared in America thanks to John Winthrop Jr. Taken together, these facts show that in addition to religious reflections, American Puritan thinkers were also interested in cosmological problems.

TI  - High-Resolution Semantically Consistent Image-to-Image Translation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has become one of remote sensing scientists' most efficient computer vision tools in recent years. However, the lack of training labels for the remote sensing datasets means that scientists need to solve the domain adaptation (DA) problem to narrow the discrepancy between satellite image datasets. As a result, image segmentation models that are then trained, could better generalize and use an existing set of labels instead of requiring new ones. This work proposes an unsupervised DA model that preserves semantic consistency and per-pixel quality for the images during the style-transferring phase. This article's major contribution is proposing the improved architecture of the SemI2I model, which significantly boosts the proposed model's performance and makes it competitive with the state-of-the-art CyCADA model. A second contribution is testing the CyCADA model on the remote sensing multiband datasets, such as WorldView-2 and SPOT-6. The proposed model preserves semantic consistency and per-pixel quality for the images during the style-transferring phase. Thus, the semantic segmentation model, trained on the adapted images, shows substantial performance gain compared to the SemI2I model and reaches similar results as the state-of-the-art CyCADA model. The future development of the proposed method could include ecological domain transfer, a priori evaluation of dataset quality in terms of data distribution, or exploration of the inner architecture of the DA model.

TI  - COLOR VOCABULARY IN "THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES" BY R. BRADBURY
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a comparative analysis of color vocabulary in the original and in the Russian translation of the novel by R. Bradbury "The Martian Chronicles". The aim of the article is to identify the spec- ificity of the color worldview of the novel as a component of the author's individual style. The scope of research embraces color lexemes used in the original and in the text of translation of the novel, and the object of analysis includes the structural and semantic organization of color vocabulary in the space of the literary text, as well as the lexical transformations used in the process of their translation. The author employs the methods of compo- nent, contextual and comparative text analysis, the statistical method and the method of continuous sampling. The study argues that the authored color nominations serve not only as a means of direct nomination, but also act as an important component of the poetics of the novel, which determines its stylistic specificity. The text has a specific color palette, which is inherently connected with the key themes of the novel and is represented by the recurrent colors of the white-black-blue line in the original and in the translation. The attributes of color can be expressed by nouns, adjectives, verbs and participles, as well as by phrases of various structures. Among the composite nominations, figurative means of "object" color nomination containing an implicit comparison are of particular interest. The classical Russian translation, made by L. L. Zhdanov, tends towards comparative con- structions with a color component, due to the translator's desire to convey color characteristics as adequately as possible. The article focuses on the principles of translating the author's individual color nominations using various types of translation transformations (generalization, modulation, compensation, concretization, lexical addition, omission, and descriptive translation). The research results expand the knowledge of color terms as specific elements of a literary text and can be used in the practical teaching of comparative lexicology, linguistic analysis of literary text, and translation theory.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the work is to develop the theory of corporate management of Chinese transnational corporations (TNC) by identifying and substantive characteristics of the factors influencing these relations. The methodological main of research are systemic and comparative analysis, the method of conceptualization of scientific ideas, the method of qualitative and quantitative assessment, the subjective approach. The following are identified as the main factors determining the directions, tools and forms of development of corporate management in China: strengthening economic interdependence within macro -regions, including through transnational corporations, with the growth of economic and geopolitical confrontation between macro-regions; high rates of economic growth of the country, requiring the expansion of transnational forms of doing business in order to stimulate exports and provide access to the necessary import resources; expansion of the private sector while main-taining state control over assets in key industries and the development of the national stock market; the ongoing credit and financial policy of the state, which provides Chinese TNCs with privileged access to financial resources; reconfiguration of the global technological space in favor of China, which contributes to the development of Chinese TNCs in the ICT (infor-mation and communication technologies) sector and the improvement of corporate management on a new technological basis; the leading role of the Communist Party in the political life of the country, which allows Chinese TNCs to use political capital to increase competitiveness; national cultural and worldview features that contribute to the formation of a specific culture of corporate management (guangxi), characterized by a high level of social capital and a focus primarily on collective inter-ests. The novelty of the results obtained lies in the disclosure of a variety of factors and the mechanism of their influence on the corporate management of Chinese TNCs, a high degree of interdependence of internal and external factors, as well as in the study of economic, political and cultural factors not in isolation, but in the unity of their influence on the object of study, which allows significantly improve the quality of economic analysis of the development of corporate management in China.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccines have played an important role in reducing the impact of the current pandemic. Previously, we developed NARUVAX-C19 vaccine based on a recombinant Wuhan spike protein extracellular domain expressed in insect cells and formulated with a squalene emulsion adjuvant (Sepivac SWE). The current study assessed the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of NARUVAX-C19 vaccine in rhesus macaques and hamsters. Macaques immunized intramuscularly with two doses of NARUVAX-C19 vaccine showed no adverse effects and demonstrated cellular immunity as assessed by T cell IFN-gamma responses against spike protein, in addition to inducing a humoral response. Serum from immunized animals neutralized the homologous wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants. In hamsters, immunization with NARUVAX-C19 vaccine protected against a heterologous challenge with the Delta virus, as reflected by reduced lung and nasal viral loads and lung pathology in immunized animals. Nevertheless, some NARUVAX-C19 vaccinated animals were still shown to transmit infection to naive sentinel animals. Overall, NARUVAX-C19 vaccine induced broadly cross-neutralizing antibody and T cell IFN-gamma responses in rhesus macaques and provided heterologous protection of hamsters against infection by the Delta virus variant. This data supports the utility of squalene emulsion-based adjuvanted recombinant vaccine in protection against SARS-CoV-2 and supports their continued clinical development.

TI  - Estimate Forest Aboveground Biomass of Mountain by ICESat-2/ATLAS Data Interacting Cokriging
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with the previous full-waveform data, the new generation of ICESat-2/ATLAS (Advanced Terrain Laser Altimeter System) has a larger footprint overlap density and a smaller footprint area. This study used ATLAS data to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high-altitude, ecologically fragile area. The paper used ATLAS data as the main information source and a typical mountainous area in Shangri-La, northwestern Yunnan Province, China, as the study area. Then, we combined biomass data from 54 ground samples to obtain the estimated AGB of 74,873 footprints using a hyperparametric optimized random forest (RF) model. The total AGB was estimated by combining the best variance function model in geostatistics with the slope that is the covariates. The results showed that among the 50 index parameters and three topographic variables extracted based on ATLAS, six variables showed a significant correlation with AGB. They were, in order, number of canopy photons, Landsat percentage canopy, canopy photon rate, slope, number of photons, and apparent surface reflectance. The optimized random forest model was used to estimate the AGB within the footprints. The model accuracy was the coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.93, the root mean square error (RMSE) = 10.13 t/hm(2), and the population estimation accuracy was 83.3%. The optimized model has a good estimation effect and can be used for footprint AGB estimation. The spatial structure analysis of the variance function of footprint AGB showed that the spherical model had the largest fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.65, the residual sum of squares (RSS) = 2.65 x 10(-4)), the nugget (C-0) was 0.21, and the spatial structure ratio was 94.0%. It showed that the AGB of footprints had strong spatial correlation and could be interpolated by kriging. Finally, the slope in the topographic variables was selected as the co-interpolation variable, and cokriging spatial interpolation was performed. Furthermore, a continuous map of AGB spatial distribution was obtained, and the total AGB was 6.07 x 10(7) t. The spatial distribution of AGB showed the same trend as the distribution of forest stock. The absolute accuracy of the estimation was 82.6%, using the statistical value of the forest resource planning and design survey as a reference. The ATLAS data can improve the accuracy of AGB estimation in mountain forests.

TI  - Effect Modifications of Overhead-View and Eye-Level Urban Greenery on Heat-Mortality Associations: Small-Area Analyses Using Case Time Series Design and Different Greenery Measurements.
T2  - Environmental health perspectives
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protective effect of urban greenery from adverse heat impacts remains inconclusive. Existing inconsistent findings could be attributed to the different estimation techniques used.OBJECTIVES: We investigated how effect modifications of urban greenery on heat-mortality associations vary when using different greenery measurements reflecting overhead-view and eye-level urban greenery.METHODS: We collected meteorological and daily mortality data for 286 territory planning units between 2005 and 2018 in Hong Kong. Three greenery measurements were extracted for each unit: a) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat remote sensing images, b) the percentage of greenspace based on land use data, and c) eye-level street greenery from street view images via a deep learning technique. Time-series analyses were performed using the case time series design with a linear interaction between the temperature term and each of the three greenery measurements. Effect modifications were also estimated for different age groups, sex categories, and cause-specific diseases.RESULTS: Higher mortality risks were associated with both moderate and extreme heat, with relative risks (RRs) of 1.022 (95% CI: 1.000, 1.044) and 1.045 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.079) at the 90th and 99th percentiles of temperatures relative to the minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Lower RRs were observed in greener areas whichever of the three greenery measurements was used, but the disparity of RRs between areas with low and high levels of urban greenery was more apparent when using eye-level street greenery as the index at high temperatures (99th percentile relative to MMT), with RRs for low and high levels of greenery, respectively, of 1.096 (95% CI: 1.035, 1.161) and 0.985 (95% CI: 0.920, 1.055) for NDVI (p=0.0193), 1.068 (95% CI: 1.021, 1.117) and 0.990 (95% CI: 0.906, 1.081) for the percentage of greenspace (p=0.1338), and 1.103 (95% CI: 1.034, 1.177) and 0.943 (95% CI: 0.841, 1.057) for eye-level street greenery (p=0.0186). Health discrepancies remained for nonaccidental mortality and cardiorespiratory diseases and were more apparent for older adults (≥65 years of age) and females.DISCUSSION: This study provides new evidence that eye-level street greenery shows stronger associations with reduced heat-mortality risks compared with overhead-view greenery based on NDVI and percentage of greenspace. The effect modification of urban greenery tends to be amplified as temperatures rise and are more apparent in older adults and females. Heat mitigation strategies and health interventions, in particular with regard to accessible and visible greenery, are needed for helping heat-sensitive subpopulation groups in coping with extreme heat. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12589.

TI  - Fine-Grained Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images via Adaptive Label Assignment and Refined-Balanced Feature Pyramid Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images remains a challenging task due to the uniqueness of its viewing perspective, complex background, arbitrary orientation, etc. For fine-grained object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images, the high intra-class similarity is even more severe, which makes it difficult for the object detector to recognize the correct classes. In this article, we propose the refined and balanced feature pyramid network (RB-FPN) and center-scale aware (CSA) label assignment strategy to address the problems of fine-grained object detection in remote sensing images. RB-FPN fuses features from different layers and suppresses background information when focusing on regions that may contain objects, providing high-quality semantic information for fine-grained object detection. Intersection over Union (IoU) is usually applied to select the positive candidate samples for training. However, IoU is sensitive to the angle variation of oriented objects with large aspect ratios, and a fixed IoU threshold will cause the narrow oriented objects without enough positive samples to participate in the training. In order to solve the problem, we propose the CSA label assignment strategy that adaptively adjusts the IoU threshold according to statistical characteristics of oriented objects. Experiments on FAIR1M dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior. Moreover, the proposed method was applied to the fine-grained object detection in high-resolution optical images of 2021 Gaofen challenge. Our team ranked sixth and was awarded as the winning team in the final.

TI  - 3-D Stereo Geolocation of Radar Reflectors Using Multiaspect SAR Acquisitions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With well-controlled orbits and a more accurate timing system of the new-generation synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, the ability of high-precision geolocation with multiple SAR acquisitions has been verified based on radar reflectors. In this letter, SAR absolute and differential geolocation methods are introduced and implemented to retrieve the coordinates of two different types of radar reflectors: corner reflectors (CRs) and multidirectional dihedral reflectors (MDRs). The experimental results demonstrate that decimeter- even centimeter-level positioning accuracy can be obtained by SAR stereo geolocation based on multiaspect SAR acquisitions from RadarSAT-2 (RS-2), COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), Sentinel-1 (S1), and TerraSAR-X (TSX), respectively.

TI  - Significant Wave Height Retrieval Using XGBoost from Polarimetric Gaofen-3 SAR and Feature Importance Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical algorithms have become the mainstream of significant wave height (SWH) retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). But the plentiful features from multi-polarizations make the selection of input for the empirical model a problem. Therefore, the XGBoost models are developed and evaluated for SWH retrieval from polarimetric Gaofen-3 wave mode imagettes using the SAR features of different polarization combinations, and then the importance of each feature on the models is further discussed. The results show that the reliability of SWH retrieval models is independently confirmed based on the collocations of the SAR-buoy and SAR-altimeter. Moreover, the combined-polarization models achieve better performance than single-polarizations. In addition, the importance of different features to the different polarization models for SWH inversion is not the same. For example, the normalized radar cross section (NRCS), cutoff wavelength (lambda(c)), and incident angle (theta) have more decisive contributions to the models than other features, while peak wavelength (lambda(p)) and the peak direction (phi) have almost no contribution. Besides, NRCS of cross-polarization has a more substantial effect, and the lambda(c) of hybrid polarization has a stronger one than other polarization models.

TI  - DBSAGAN: Dual Branch Split Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Super-Resolution Reconstruction in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution reconstruction methods emerge in an endless stream, but the models proposed by many researchers are not fit for certain types of images, such as remote sensing images. This is because remote sensing images have rich texture details and geometrical structures. Therefore, directly applying previous models to remote sensing images generates unsatisfactory artifacts. In this letter, we propose a dual branch split attention generative adversarial network (DBSAGAN) for super-resolution tasks on remote sensing images. Specifically, the proposed DBSAGAN adopts a dual branch split attention group (DBSAG) as the cascading basic unit in the generator. In addition, we remove batch normalization (BN) layers in the basic unit to improve the generative ability of the network. To reduce the gap between the reconstructed and original images from the frequency domain, we innovatively use focal frequency loss to constrain the network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) remote sensing image dataset.

TI  - Finding Ground-Based Radars in SAR Images: Localizing Radio Frequency Interference Using Unsupervised Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images are used increasingly more for Earth observation. While SAR images are useable in most conditions, they occasionally experience image degradation due to interfering signals from external radars, called radio frequency interference (RFI). RFI-affected images are often discarded in further analysis or preprocessed to remove the RFI. However, few on-ground radars can cause RFI in SAR images and such information can thus increase domain awareness greatly over both land and sea, where, e.g., localizing and characterizing RFI signals in the ocean could help classify otherwise overlooked ships. The aim of the current study is to detect and localize RFI signals automatically in Sentinel-1 level-1 images and further characterize the on-ground radar. The spatial structure of RFI signals vary greatly. A convolutional autoencoder (CAE) was therefore developed to reconstruct RFI-free Sentinel-1 images. Conversely, RFI-affected images could not be well reconstructed. Anomalous heatmaps were then developed to automatically detect and localize RFI anomalies in the images under varying environmental and geographical conditions, whereafter the external radar characteristics were extracted manually from Sentinel-1 level-0 data. We could consequently classify and localize RFI signals believed to originate from both stationary radars and ship-borne radars. We further argue that the calculated ship-borne radar characteristics correspond to those of air-surveillance radars. Empirically, the method showed better detection results than those of previous studies. Our study shows that more information can be extracted from certain detected objects, such as ships, from SAR images.

T2  - Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) is a semiaquatic carnivore and a top predator in the trophic chain, considered a sentinel of freshwater ecosystems. Ticks are common ectoparasites of worldwide distribution and potential vectors of diseases. In this study, we report the ectoparasitism by ticks on a giant otter carcass found during monitoring activity at the Negro River, that holds a viable population of this endangered species in the Brazilian Pantanal. A total of three tick specimens were collected: two adults were identified as Amblyomma sculptum and a nymph as Amblyomma spp. There is a lack of information about the health of free-ranging giant otters and this report contributes to elucidate some of the host-parasite relationships, although much more research is needed to expand the knowledge about which kinds of pathogens are circulating in the species, especially among those transmitted by ticks.

TI  - CORRELATION OF MULTIPLATFORM SAR-DATA FOR MULTITEMPORAL SLOPE INSTABILITY ANALYSIS: THE PAUPISI CASE STUDY (BENEVENTO PROVINCE, SOUTHERN ITALY)
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Benevento Province (southern Italy) has been historically affected by soil erosion and ground deformation (i.e. landslides; REVELLINo et alii, 2019), as testified by documents and reports which describe damage scenario, social effects, surveys and measures carried out. REVELLINo et alii (2010) highlighted as the landslide index, defined as the ratio of areas affected by landslides over total areas, reaches up to 90%. Earth flows make up about 46% of these landslides, involving structurally complex geologic formations and often responsible for damaging human infrastructures (e.g. roads and service lines; GUERRIERo et alii, 2016; MARESCA et alii, 2022). As a result, the province has widespread problems in management of the landslide hazard, due to the activation (and reactivation) of phenomena connected to both rainfall and seismic events. In order to reconstruct state of activity maps for the Benevento Province, a multitemporal analysis of multiplatform satellite data was carried out, with a resolution of cells of 20x20 m. In particular, PSInSAR (ERS 1 & 2 for the time-span 1992-2000, ENVISAT for 2002-2010, and RADARSAT for 2003-2007) and ISBAS data (Sentinel-1 for 2017-2020), were first treated by a grid-based approach to uniform the PS data and subsequently, by a multiplatform approach defining weighted average velocity (VWA) maps on the base of the extent of the area with data availability. Finally, a multiplatform activity-matrix approach allowed the definition of landslide activity maps based on a velocity threshold of & PLUSMN; 3 mm/y, derived by VWA maps. Specifically, velocity threshold allowed to discriminate for each cell of the analyzed area i) stable cells (velocities between & PLUSMN; 3 mm/y), ii) unstable cells (velocities greater than & PLUSMN; 3 mm/y), iii) cells with no data (unclassified). The multiplatform activity-matrix approach at provincial scale was used to identify and analyze unstable area (hotspots), currently involved in active deformation processes. Among them, the Paupisi municipality (Benevento Province) was identified as critical for the involvement of built-up areas and infrastructures in landslide deformation processes. For that reason, Paupisi area was selected as study case and a detailed analysis of the PS distribution as well as reconstruction and evaluation of deformation trend were carried out. Finally, a relation between land deformation and rainfall events was also investigated.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the relationship be-tween neoliberal development and violations of the human right to an ecologically bal-anced environment. To this end, the research addresses the concept of neoliberal rationality, how the system presents itself today, its premis-es and consequences, and its relationship with the protection of the environment. In addi-tion, the work clarifies the definition of the human right to the environmentally balanced environment, as recognized in modern consti-tutions and international treaties on the sub-ject, and what are the contours of this human right and its importance today. Furthermore, this study presents alternatives to the neolib-eral rationality and worldview, based on the counter-hegemonic theories of human rights (Epistemologies of the South). The develop-ment of the study has as approach the analec-tic method, thought by Enrique Dussel.

TI  - The space of motility of the Ob Ugrians and Samoyeds as a phenomenon of "Northernness"
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the concept of a phenomenon of "Northernness" in the title of the article makes it possible to present the North of Western Siberia as an area of mobile cultures, a model of the development of vast spaces by the Ob Ugrians and the establishment of their control over it. The focus of the author's attention is the motility, which has left an imprint on mentality as a specific style of perception of the world. It can be recognized in many aspects - biomotility, psychomotility, sociomotility, - the features of which as an ethnic phenomenon are revealed in this article.Objective: to reveal a culturally determined system of movement modes against the background of historical and ethno-graphic realities, as well as their representation in the folklore and traditional worldview of the Ob Ugrians and Samoyeds.Research materials: collections of folklore, linguistic and ethnographic data from published sources, toponymic and linguistic dictionaries, oral reports of informants.Results and novelty of the research: the article identifies two streams of movement (biomotility) associated with the intracontinental migrations of Ugric nomads from the West through the Urals to the territory of the Lower Ob region (legends about the people of Por and Moshch, the cosmogonic myth of the pursuit of the six-legged Moose) and from the Southern Urals to the territory of Western Siberia (the movement of the people Moshch - the inhabitants of huge herds of animals and living in "broadcloth houses"). The internal movements of individual local groups in search of new forage or hunting and fishing grounds are also being investigated (the heroic legend about the bogatyr Pakv Posy Vojkan Otyr, the legend about the settlement of Mansi ancestors along the rivers of Sosva and Lyapin).The article for the first time systematically presents an expanded interpretation of the concept of motility as movement, reflected in the mental sphere (psychomotility): the travels of the gods of the Ob-Ugric pantheon; the mobile nature of the human soul moving through the universe's layers; the idea of different trajectories of the movement of time; sociomotorics as the drift of kinship. Thus, the movement is considered in a space and time continuum, the unity of ideas about which characterizes the phenomenon of "northernness" as a unique way of constructing the ethnic picture of the world.

TI  - Hybrid learning model for analysing the Uppal earth region, in Telangana state, using multispectral Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are being widely used to carry out analysis of the Earth's surface. In this paper, a hybrid learning model is proposed for the classification and analysis of the Uppal earth region, located nearby Hyderabad in Telangana state. In the hybrid learning model, the ISODATA clustering algorithm is combined with the Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) and K-means learning model. In this proposal, the spectral features of the Uppal region are extracted from the satellite images and used for further analysis. The obtained accuracy of the proposed Merged-ISODATA algorithm is 74.33% and the Kappa value is 0.64. The obtained accuracy and Kappa value for existing ISODATA clustering and K-Means algorithm are 71.5% and 0.58. These values imply that the obtained results of the proposed algorithm are better than the results obtained in existing approaches.

TI  - Evaluation of new tracers in the identification of sentinel lymph node in patients with early breast cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel node mapping is the standard of care for evaluation of axilla for women with early node negative breast cancer. Validation of a new tracer for sentinel node biopsy requires full axillary lymph node dissection to establish its performance indicators. This exposes about 70% of women to unnecessary axillary dissection with its attendant morbidity. Aims and Objective: To investigate the predictive value of identification of sentinel lymph nodes by a tracer for knowing its sensitivity and false-negative rates (FNR). Methods: A linear regression on data from a network meta-analysis was carried out, and the correlation between identification and sensitivity and its predictive value were ascertained. Results: A strong linear relationship was observed between identification and sensitivity of sentinel node biopsy (correlation coefficient r = 0.97). The sensitivity and false negativity can be predicted by the identification rate. An identification rate of 93% corresponds to sensitivity = 90.51% and a FNR = 9.49%. The current literature on newer tracers has been succinctly reviewed. Conclusion: The linear regression demonstrated a very high predictive value of identification rate for ascertaining the sensitivity and FNRs of sentinel node biopsy. A new tracer for sentinel node biopsy can be introduced in clinical practice, if it achieves an identification rate of 93% or more.

TI  - Validation of the PREDICT Prognostication Tool in US Patients With Breast Cancer.
T2  - Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: PREDICT is an online prognostication tool derived from breast cancer registry information on approximately 6,000 women treated in the United Kingdom that estimates the postsurgical treatment benefit of surgery alone, chemotherapy, trastuzumab, endocrine therapy, and/or adjuvant bisphosphonates in early-stage breast cancer. Our aim was to validate the PREDICT algorithm in predicting 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) probabilities using real-world outcomes among US patients with breast cancer.METHODS: A retrospective study was performed including women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer in 2004 through 2012. Women with primary unilateral invasive breast cancer were included. Patients with bilateral or metastatic breast cancer, no breast surgery, or missing critical clinical information were excluded. Prognostic scores from PREDICT were calculated and external validity was approached by assessing statistical discrimination through area under time-dependent receiver-operator curves (AUC) and comparing the predicted survival to the observed OS in relevant subgroups.RESULTS: We included 708,652 women, with a median age of 58 years. Most patients were White (85.4%), non-Hispanic (88.4%), and diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (79.6%). Approximately 50% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, 67% received adjuvant endocrine therapy, 60% underwent a partial mastectomy, and 59% had 1 to 5 axillary sentinel nodes removed. Median follow-up time was 97.7 months. The population's 5- and 10-year OS were 89.7% and 78.7%, respectively. Estimated 5- and 10-year median survival with PREDICT were 88.3% and 73.8%, and an AUC of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively. PREDICT performed most poorly in patients with high Charlson-Deyo comorbidity scores (2-3), where PREDICT overestimated OS. Sensitivity analysis by year of diagnosis and HER2 status showed similar results.CONCLUSIONS: In this prognostic study utilizing the National Cancer Database, the PREDICT tool accurately predicted 5- and 10-year OS in a contemporary and diverse population of US patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

TI  - POST-FIRE RECOVERY MONITORING USING REMOTE SENSING: A REVIEW
T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Wildfires are a common disturbance factor, while climate change is thought to be one of the main causes of the fires. The detection of disturbance and post-fire recovery monitoring are vital for ecological research. This article aims to provide a review of current research of post-fire recovery monitoring based on remotely sensed data. While a close relationship between vegetation indices (VIs) and physiological parameters of vegetation has been established, VIs have become the main tool for assessing and monitoring vegetation status. Research on the effects and recovery from fires has been conducted by a number of authors, with VIs being used mainly in the methodologies. Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) method is also used to assess the state of the ecosystem before and after a fire. When viewed in series, Disturbance Index (DI) images provide an immediate way to recognize the pixels of the forests affected by the fire, different from those characteristics of the normal state of forests. The incorporation of various remote sensing data with field data is able to support the monitoring of post-fire effects and forest recovery.

TI  - Impact of High Concentrations of Saharan Dust Aerosols on Infrared-Based Land Surface Temperature Products
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of three operational satellite-based thermal-infrared land surface temperature (LST) products is presented for conditions of heavy dust aerosol loading. The LST products are compared against ERA5's skin temperature (SKT) across the Sahara Desert and Sahel region, where high concentrations of dust aerosols are prevalent. Large anomalous differences are found between satellite LST and ERA5's SKT during the periods of highest dust activity, and satellite-ERA5 differences are shown to be strongly related to dust aerosol optical depth (DuAOD) at 550 nm, indicating an underestimation of LST in conditions of heavy dust aerosol loading. In situ measurements from two ground stations in the Sahel region provide additional evidence of this underestimation, showing increased biases of satellite LST with DuAOD, and no significant dependence of ERA5's SKT biases on dust aerosol concentrations. The impact of atmospheric water vapor content on LST and SKT is also examined, but dust aerosols are shown to be the primary driver of the inaccurate LSTs observed. Based on comparisons with in situ data, we estimate an aerosol-induced underestimation of LST of approximately 0.9 K for every 0.1 increase in DuAOD. Analysis of brightness temperatures (BTs) in the thermal infrared atmospheric window reveals that dust aerosols have the opposite effect on BT differences compared to water vapor, leading to an underestimation of atmospheric correction by the LST retrieval algorithms. This article highlights a shortcoming of current operational LST retrieval algorithms that must be addressed.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Assessment of Feasibility and Safety by Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging and Clinical Consequences
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Occult micrometastases can be missed by routine pathological analysis. Mapping of the pulmonary lymphatic system by near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging can identify the first lymph node relay. This sentinel lymph node (SLN) can be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), which may increase micrometastasis detection and improve staging. This study analyzed the feasibility and safety of identifying SLNs in thoracic surgery by NIR fluorescence imaging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This was a prospective, observational, single-center study. Eighty adult patients with suspected localized stage NSCLC (IA1 to IIA) were included between December 2020 and May 2022. All patients received an intraoperative injection of indocyanine green (ICG) directly in the peri tumoural area or by electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB). The SLN was then assessed using an infrared fluorescence camera. SLN was identified in 60 patients (75%). Among them, 36 SLNs associated with a primary lung tumor were analyzed by IHC. Four of them were invaded by micrometastases (11.1%). In the case of pN0 SLN, the rest of the lymphadenectomy was cancer free. The identification of SLNs in thoracic surgery by NIR fluorescence imaging seems to be a feasible technique for improving pathological staging.

TI  - Processing pipeline for estimating Secchi depth at Lake Yojoa, Honduras from remote sensing products
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Abstract Summary The processing pipeline in this repository utilizes Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data to develop machine learning models and stepwise linear regression models to estimate Secchi depth at Lake Yojoa, Honduras. This codebase acquires and harmonizes the Landsat and ERA5 data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API (Gorelick, et al. 2017). Remote sensing data are matched with in situ Secchi depth measurements and the matchups are partitioned into train-test ('stringent' data handling) or train-test-validate ('very stringent' data handling) data sets. Models were created using both xgboost gbtree methods and stepwise linear regression methods. Methods Landsat Stack Median Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance (Masek, et al., 2006, Vermote, et al., 2016) values (Rrs) were obtained for the 18 sampling locations in Lake Yojoa following the methods described in Topp, et al. (2021. Minor adaptations were made for the transition for Collection 1 to Collection 2 Landsat data to account for differences in scaling factors between collections. Rrs summaries included only 'confident' water pixels as defined by the dynamic surface water extent algorighm (Jones ,2019). Data were filtered for reasonable values for water reflectance (-0.01 [less than] Rrs [less than] 0.2) for all bands (Blue, Red, Green, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared 1, Shortwave Infrared 2). Inter-mission handoff coefficients to standardize Rrs values due to slight changes in sensors and atmospheric correction between missions (Gardner, et al. 2021) were calculated based on Landsat Collection 2 data acquired from all lakes greater than 25 hectares within Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador (described in Regional Handoff Coefficients below). All Landsat data were acquired using the Google Earth Engine Python Application Programming Interface (API) in RStudio version 2023.03.0, R version 4.2.3 (R Core Team 2023), and Python version 3.8 (Python Software Foundation, https://www.python.org/). = Secchi-RS matchups Secchi data were matched with records from the Landsat remote sensing stack at a number of time windows: same, one, two, three, and five day windows. In addition to these standard windows, we employed a variable window defined by local knowledge. In this method, we allowed for matchups up to 7 days for all months where the conditions of the lake are relatively consistent and in October and November, months that often have sudden clarity changes, only matches 1 day were permitted. Windows up to 7 days have yielded reasonable results when paired with remote sensing data (Kloiber, et al. 2002). We avoided discrete over-matching of our data by assuring that each satellite overpass instance was only paired with the nearest-in-time Secchi measurement and that each discrete Secchi measurement was only paired with a single, nearest-in-time valid satellite overpass. Only matchup datasets of 5 days and 7/1 produced reasonable models and are the only datasets summarized in this methods overview. Climate Data Climate data were acquired from the ERA5 dataset (Munoz, 2019) in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor (Gorelick, 2017) from a single data point at the approximate geographical center of Lake Yojoa (14.8768degreesN, 87.9791degreesW) for all available data. ERA5 data provide daily modeled values for an extensive list of parameters; however, we only used total precipitation, mean air temperature, total solar radiation, and mean wind speed in our analysis. These data were aggregated for the previous 3, 5, and 7 days. xgboost Model We used the R package {xgboost} (Chen, et al. 2023) to develop the best performing gradient tree boost algorithm for these data. Model features were median Rrs values for the blue, green, red and near infrared bands, the ratio of red to green, blue to green, red to blue, green to red, total solar radiation, maximum air temperature, mean air temperature, minimum air temperature, total precipitation, and mean wind speed. Various input feature window combinations were tested, including providing the program with the previous day's meteorology as well as a summary of the previous 5 or 7 days. Stepwise Regression Model We used the R packages {caret} (Kuhn, 2008) and {leaps} (Lumley, 2020) to perform backwards stepwise regression. We tested the same combinations of matchup windows and meteorological data as with the {xgboost} package, except all input data were normalized to values between 0 and 1 using a min-max scaling method. Because this method uses cross-wise validation (10 times cv), no test data were provided to the model. 70% of the data were used in model development and the remaining 30% were holdout data to examine the results independently. Data partitioning was completed by total number of matchups not by image date.

TI  - Redesigning Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Guidelines in Melanoma Cases.
T2  - Eplasty
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Accurately staging and prognosticating melanoma classically depends on a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The mainstay predictors of SLNB positivity according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) are Breslow depth and ulceration. Nevertheless, even with these predictors, negative SLNBs, even in deep melanomas, are a common occurrence and may result in unnecessary invasive procedures for patients. This suggests that the parameters for determining SLNB candidates are a potential area for improvement in surgical dermatology (surgical oncology and plastic surgery).Methods: The authors conducted a systemic review to assess current AJCC guidelines on when a SLNB in melanoma is indicated. We also investigated how age, mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, satellitosis, melanoma subtype, anatomical location, and an immunocompromised state affected positivity rates in sentinel lymph node biopsies in melanoma.Results: These variables significantly impacted SLNB positivity rates and serve as evidence to support the proposal of redesigning SLNB guidelines in melanoma.Conclusions: Integrating the current AJCC guidelines with the newly examined variables will create patient-specific recommendations centered on the aim of reducing the number of invasive procedures while increasing SLNB positivity rates and prognostication.

TI  - Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and its Contemporary Import: Ideas Emerging in Context and Time
T2  - KULTURNO-ISTORICHESKAYA PSIKHOLOGIYA-CULTURAL-HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alexey N. Leontiev's legacy - as part of cultural-historical activity theory - is discussed as an openended, dynamic, and continuously emerging system of ideas. The meaning and import of these ideas are becoming transparent in the context of contemporary conceptual revolution in psychology. Various trends within this cutting-edge movement have converged on the notion of relationality - in opposition to traditional "substance" metaphysics that posits self-contained, independent entities as the exclusive analytical focus. CHAT is revealed to be a pioneer in this conceptual revolution, contributing conceptual advances such as on embodied, situated, distributed, and enacted cognition/mind and on a (non-dual) "natureculture." In CHAT, human development is an open-ended, dynamic, non-linear, and ever-unfolding, that is, emergent process with no preprogrammed blueprints. This process is composed of embodied bi-directional interactivities of persons-acting-in-the-world, embedded in fluid contexts - soft assemblages contingent on situational demands and affordances. Moreover, CHAT foregrounds collective dynamics of meaningful shared activities extending through history as a unified onto-epistemology of human development and mind. In addition, CHAT also offers, in outlines, steps to move beyond the relational paradigm towards a transformative worldview premised on the notion of a simultaneous persons-and-the-world co-realizing.

T2  - CHAUCER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Critics have been sharply divided both on whether the ending of Troilus and Criseyde is an artistic mishap or a key to the meaning of the larger poem and whether it signals agreement with or a departure from Dante. This article argues that the model of the Trinity employed by Dante also has structural meaning for Troilus, but that the ending of Troilus clearly signals a worldview that departs from that found in the Commedia. It further demonstrates that the structure of the poem is divided into thirds, even as it is divided in half, and even as it is a cohesive whole, a feature that has important implications for interpretative cruxes surrounding the poem.

TI  - Lower Segment of Productive Society of Russia in the 1950s - 1960s: Sources on the Problem of Perception of Socio-Economic and Political Inequality
T2  - HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Epistolary heritage of the 20(th) century is a mass source on the history of the development of way of thinking, world perception, worldview, self-awareness of the Russian society. Large blocks of documents of this type are stored in many central and regional archives and libraries. The author raises the issue of identification of letters written by representatives of the productive segment. Employees and workers from the average strata of the working class left much commentary on socio-economic and political processes in the country. As a rule, these were sent to Soviet newspapers or directly to the Central Committee of the CPSU. In the Central Committee, letters were distributed to specialized departments and registered in the press sector. A significant corpus of these documents (partially declassified) is preserved in fond 5 ("Apparatus of the Central Committee of the CPSU (1949-91)") and in fond 100 (Subdivision of Letters of the General Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU (1953-91)") in the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History. However, establishing to which strata of productive society the authors belonged seems a difficult task. Many texts are anonymous or written by pensioners, war invalids, groups of workers of unknown specialization. Nevertheless, data obtained from the letters relates not only to material conditions, everyday life, work and rest, but also to factors influencing norms of behavior, political preferences. Analysis of documentary data informs of formation of socio-psychological portraits of groups of workers in production and overproduction, as well as of levels of public consciousness, value orientations, spiritual world, mentality that were developing in the productive environment. The article concludes that epistolary genre reflected the situation of social reformatting in the 1950s-60s. The letters illuminate the process of genesis of a social and labor community with new moral and managerial values and attitudes. Demarcation in the productive society deepened, as acute and urgent social phenomena of working life intensified. In state economic structure there emerged two types of behavior. One gravitated towards preservation and reproduction of traditions. This was characteristic of the lower strata of society: urban and rural workers, proletarians. They insisted on collectivism, equalization, fairness. A different type of lifestyle was associated with moneymaking part of the society, middle and upper classes: party nomenklatura, specialists, managers. They set their own agenda, one reflected in the letters of ordinary people as "abuses."

TI  - Drought Monitoring in Terms of Evapotranspiration Based on Satellite Data from Meteosat in Areas of Strong Land-Atmosphere Coupling
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was focused on a key aspect of drought monitoring that has not been systematically studied in the literature: evaluation of the capacity of evapotranspiration data retrieved using geostationary meteorological satellites for use as a water stress precursor. The work was methodologically based on comparisons between constructed indexes of vegetation water stress (evapotranspiration drought index (ETDI) and evaporative stress ratio (ESR)) derived from the EUMETSAT LSASAF METREF and DMET satellite products and soil moisture availability (SMA) from a SVAT model. Long-term (2011-2021) data for regions with strong land-atmosphere coupling in Southeastern Europe (Bulgaria) were used. Stochastic graphical analysis and Q-Q (quantile-quantile) analyses were performed to compare water stress metrics and SMA. Analyses confirmed the consistency in the behavior of vegetation water-stress indexes and SMA in terms of their means, spatiotemporal variability at monthly and annual levels, and anomalous distributions. The biophysical aspects of the drought evaluation confirmed the complementary and parallel interaction of potential (METREF) and actual (DMET) evapotranspiration (in view of the Bouchet hypothesis) for the studied region. Anomalies in evapotranspiration stress indexes can provide useful early signals of agricultural/ecological drought, and the results confirm the validity of using their satellite-based versions to characterize SMA in the root zone and drought severity.

TI  - Image-to-Image Training for Spatially Seamless Air Temperature Estimation With Satellite Images and Station Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature at approximately 2 m above the ground (T-a) is one of the most important environmental and biophysical parameters to study various earth surface processes. T-a measured from meteorological stations is inadequate to study its spatio-temporal patterns since the stations are unevenly and sparsely distributed. Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) provides global coverage, and is generally utilized to estimate T-a due to the close relationship between LST and T-a. However, LST products are sensitive to cloud contamination, resulting in missing values in LST and leading to the estimated T-a being spatially incomplete. To solve the missing data problem, we propose a deep learning method to estimate spatially seamless T-a from LST that contains missing values. Experimental results on 5-year data of mainland China illustrate that the image-to-image training strategy alleviates the missing data problem and fills the gaps in LST implicitly. Plus, the strong linear relationships between observed daily mean T-a (T-mean), daily minimum T-a (T-min), and daily maximum T-a (T-max) make the estimation of T-mean, T-min, and T(max )simultaneously possible. For mainland China, the proposed method achieves results with R-2 of 0.962, 0.953, 0.944, mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.793 degrees C, 2.143 degrees C, and 2.125 degrees C, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.376 degrees C, 2.808 degrees C, and 2.823 degrees C for T-mean, T-min, and T-max, respectively.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat remote sensing image is a widely used data source in water remote sensing. Normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI) are commonly used water extraction classifiers. In the process of their application, because the threshold varies with the location and time of the research object, how to select the threshold with the highest classification accuracy is a time-consuming and challenging task. The purpose of this study was to explore a method that can not only improve the accuracy of water extraction, but also provide a fixed threshold, and can meet the requirements of automatic water extraction. We introduced the local spatial auto correlation statistics and calculate the Getis-Ord Gi* index to have hot spot analysis. Comparative analysis showed that the accuracy of water classification had been greatly improved through hot spot analysis. AWEI(sh) classifier had the best classification accuracy under the condition of INVERSE_DISTANCE neighborhood rule and Z > 1.96, and the accuracy changes least in different time, different location and different vegetation coverage images. Therefore, in the process of regional water extraction, hot spot analysis method was effective, which was helpful to improve the accuracy of water extraction.

TI  - Agricultural Droughts Monitoring of Aceh Besar Regency Rice Production Center, Aceh, Indonesia - Application Vegetation Conditions Index using Sentinel-2 Image Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the agricultural drought of paddy rice fields is a crucial aspect of preparing for proper action in main-taining food security in Indonesia. The Aceh Province is one of Indonesia's national rice production centers, especially Aceh Besar Regency; it includes three central districts; Indrapuri, Kuta Cot Glie, and Seulimeum. Sat-ellite-Sentinel 2A data have been tested to monitor the drought levels of around 2,803 Ha in the three districts in this study. This study aimed to determine the drought level in Indrapuri, Kuta Cot Glie, and Seulimeum districts, Aceh Besar Regency's paddy rice fields using Sentinel-2A data imagery. The vegetation conditions index (VCI) of Sentinel-2 data was utilized to identify a vegetative drought level in the area for the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 growing seasons. The vegetation inertia index is derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results show that the VCI looked volatile, but the trendline increased by four percent, from 92.56 in July 2019 to 96.08 in July 2021. Most areas on the dates investigated found that the no drought category was still dominant. The designated data analyzed found that the June 2022 data tend to be distributed to the drought in extreme, severe, moderate, and mild increases compared to the previous data investigated. This figure shows an increasing drought in the study area, and the average drought index is in the category of mild drought. In addition, there has been a trendline decline in the value of NDVI in recent years, causing agricultural land for paddy rice fields to be slightly vulnerable to drought.

TI  - Spatial distribution vegetation density, land surface temperature, and land surface moisture of Banda Aceh, Indonesia after 17 years of tsunami: a multitemporal analysis approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although some studies on vegetation cover in relation to the land surface temperature (LST) and land surface moisture (LSM) have been carried out, but not yet been investigated in relation to the pre-disaster and after-tsunami disasters. This paper investigates the spatial extent of vegetation cover density, land surface temperature, and land surface moisture of Banda Aceh from 2000 to 2020 to represent the pre-disaster phase, during the disas-ter, post-disaster, rehabilitation, and reconstruction stages, and current conditions using remote sensing data. NDVI, LST, and NDMI indexes were utilized, and the mapping process of multitemporal images of Banda Aceh was carried out. The results show that after the tsunami, the distribution of vegetation den-sity varies, tending to decrease for densely vegetated areas before increasing more than 5 years later. For medium categories, the vegetation density increased by 22% in 2020 and almost 26% in 2015. Meanwhile, dense vegetation grew by 19% and 13%, respectively, according to data for 2015 and 2020. In a similar out-look, the increasing vegetation density has demon-strated that the LST across Banda Aceh is dominated by 27-30 degrees C, with 2005 data occupying the coldest area. The city's moderate moisture content covered 85.43% of its surface. The low to medium vegeta-tion density, LST, and LSM indexes from 2000 to 2010 is shown by overlaying a combination of three spatial extent indexes. It is shown that Banda Aceh's medium-to-high density, medium LSM, and medium -to-high LST spatially. Banda Aceh's dynamic changes in vegetation, LST, and LSM over the past two dec-ades have been proven in this research; the Banda Aceh's spatial variation in vegetation density, LST, and LSM is influenced by the tsunami.

TI  - Changes in the Distribution of Air Pollutants (Carbon Monoxide) during the Control of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Yogyakarta, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The condition of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 characterizing DKI Jakarta, Sura-baya, and Yogyakarta Provinces which have a high population density in 2019, necessitates implementing Large -Scale Social Restrictions (LSSR) to control or break the chain of the spread of COVID-19. The LSSR policy that limits community activities, be it business activities, transportation, and the industrial sector, will impact social activities and the environment due to the reduced intensity of community activities. Therefore, this study aimed to determine changes in the carbon monoxide (CO) levels in Jakarta, Surabaya and Yogyakarta during the pre -pandemic and during the pandemic. The method used is the tropospheric CO concentration extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite data. The CO data were retrieved and calculated using Google Earth Engine. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced CO level by 19.7%, 14.9%, and 21%, respectively. The paired t-test shows no significant dif-ference from before the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significance of 0.05. The highest pre-pandemic average and total CO concentration levels were 0.042 and 1.0198 mol/m2 in Yogyakarta, respectively, whereas the lowest dur-ing the pandemic were 0.02845 and 0.6828 mol/m2 in Surabaya. Overall, the three cities have a weak relationship between CO level and precipitation as well as temperatures and CO level.

TI  - Land surface temperature changes caused by land cover/ land use properties and their impact on rainfall characteristics
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the relationships between land cover presented by vegetation index and land surface temperature, between vegetation index and the built-up index, between built-up index and land surface temperature, and between land surface temperature and rainfall characteristics in East Java Province, Indonesia.METHODS:Three cities and four regencies were used as examples. Landsat imagery scanned in 1995, 2001, 2015, and 2020 were used. Daily rainfall data recorded in the same years with Landsat data are used. The pixel values along the urban heat island line were used to analyze the interrelationships between vegetation index, built-up index, and land surface temperature. The land surface temperature and daily rainfall data from each Thiessen polygon were used to analyze the relationship between land surface temperature and rainfall characteristics. Image processing analysis was used to analyze the vegetation index, built-up index, and land surface temperature. The mathematical interrelationship between vegetation index, built-up index, land surface temperature, and rainfall intensity was analyzed using linear regression.FINDINGS: The results of the analysis show that the relationship between vegetation index and built-up index is inversely proportional and with land surface temperature is nearly inversely proportional to a coefficient of determination greater than 0.5. For the relationship between the built-up index and land surface temperature, the results of the analysis show that both have a directly proportional relationship, with a significant coefficient of determination (R2>0.5). For the relationship between land surface temperature and rainfall characteristics, the results of the analysis show that land surface temperature has a directly proportional but weak relationship with rainfall intensity and an inversely proportional but weak relationship with the number of rainfall days. Decreasing environmental conditions indicated by decreasing vegetation index will influence increasing land surface temperature and its effect on increasing rainfall intensity and decreasing rainfall days.CONCLUSION:Changes in land use/land cover are characterized by a change in vegetation cover to built-up land. These changes affect the land surface temperature. Changes in land surface temperature affect the occurrences of rainfall intensity. When the vegetation index decreases, the built-up index increases, and the land surface temperature increases as well. The increase in land surface temperature will increase the rainfall intensity. Satellite remote sensing imagery is effective and efficient for analyzing vegetation index, built-up index, and land surface temperature.

TI  - Assessment of Forests of the Natural Park "Kandry-Kul" using the Earth Remote Sensing Data
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to substantiate the monitoring of protective forests actively used in recreational activities. Monitoring of the plantings state was carried out based on landscape and forest inventory and using geographic information systems, in particular Landsat satellite data allowing to cover the entire object area simultaneously and analyze the state of the object plantings over 30 years. The research involved the plantings of the natural park "Kandry-kul" located on the Belebeevskaya upland of the Southern Urals. Ground investigations and the results of processing satellite images allowed the conclusion that natural and artificial mixed coniferous-deciduous forests are basic. Artificial stands are mainly represented by young pine trees of IA-II growth class. Their sanitary and hygienic assessment is average since silver birch stands contain dropsy. Few landscaped and planted park areas and poorly developed pathway network have a negative impact on the plant community structure and reforestation. Thus, using technical capabilities of satellite systems working based on wide band electromagnetic radiation and ground inventory studies makes it possible to obtain data on the forest ecosystems state with high territorial and temporal resolution and use them when monitoring recreational facilities to solve forestry problems.

TI  - Toward a Deep-Learning-Network-Based Convective Weather Initiation Algorithm From the Joint Observations of Fengyun-4A Geostationary Satellite and Radar for 0-1h Nowcasting
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowcasting of convective weather is a challenging and significant task in operational weather forecasting system. In this article, a new convolution recurrent neural network based regression network for convective weather prediction is proposed, which is named as the convective weather nowcasting net (CWNNet). The CWNNet adopts the joint observations of Fengyun-4A geostationary (GEO) satellite and the ground-based Doppler weather radar data of the last 0-1-h as the inputs of the model to predict the radar reflectivity factor maps of next 0-1 h. The statistical validating results clearly demonstrate that the mean values of the probability of detection, false alarm ratio, threat score, root mean square error and mean absolute error evaluating the performance of CWNNet for 1-h nowcasting reach 0.87, 0.137, 0.71, 3.365 dBZ and 1.038 dBZ, respectively. Due to that the GEO meteorological satellite is capable of capturing the features of convective initiation (CI), the CWNNet shows a good performance in CI nowcasting. Besides, several case studies also further indicate that the CWNNet can predict CI more than 30 min in advance by monitoring the convective clouds. The CWNNet based on the joint satellite and radar data shows a better nowcasting performance than that only employing single data source. Thus, it can effectively produce more reliable nowcasting for convective weather events.

TI  - Check dam extraction from remote sensing images using deep learning and geospatial analysis: A case study in the Yanhe River Basin of the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Check dams are widely used on the Loess Plateau in China to control soil and water losses, develop agricultural land, and improve watershed ecology. Detailed information on the number and spatial distribution of check dams is critical for quantitatively evaluating hydrological and ecological effects and planning the construction of new dams. Thus, this study developed a check dam detection framework for broad areas from high-resolution remote sensing images using an ensemble approach of deep learning and geospatial analysis. First, we made a sample dataset of check dams using GaoFen-2 (GF-2) and Google Earth images. Next, we evaluated five popular deep-learning-based object detectors, including Faster R-CNN, You Only Look Once (version 3) (YOLOv3), Cascade R-CNN, YOLOX, and VarifocalNet (VFNet), to identify the best one for check dam detection. Finally, we analyzed the location characteristics of the check dams and used geographical constraints to optimize the detection results. Precision, recall, average precision at intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50 (AP(50)), IoU threshold of 0.75 (AP(75)), and average value for 10 IoU thresholds ranging from 0.50-0.95 with a 0.05 step (AP(50-95)), and inference time were used to evaluate model performance. All the five deep learning networks could identify check dams quickly and accurately, with AP(50-95), AP(50), and AP(75) values higher than 60.0%, 90.0%, and 70.0%, respectively, except for YOLOv3. The VFNet had the best performance, followed by YOLOX. The proposed framework was tested in the Yanhe River Basin and yielded promising results, with a recall rate of 87.0% for 521 check dams. Furthermore, the geographic analysis deleted about 50% of the false detection boxes, increasing the identification accuracy of check dams from 78.6% to 87.6%. Simultaneously, this framework recognized 568 recently constructed check dams and small check dams not recorded in the known check dam survey datasets. The extraction results will support efficient watershed management and guide future studies on soil erosion in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Understanding the Spatial-Temporal Characteristics of Land Subsidence in Shenzhen under Rapid Urbanization Based on MT-InSAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a common geological hazard in urban areas. It can be caused by human activities such as land reclamation and subway construction. However, rapid urbanization can accelerate the progress of these activities. Therefore, spatial-temporal analysis of land subsidence can provide a guarantee for rapid urbanization progress. In this study, Shenzhen, one of the fastest urbanizing cities in China, is selected for continued land subsidence monitoring. We collected 153 Sentinel-1A images from December 2015 to July 2021 and utilized an interferometric point target analysis method to generate the land subsidence in Shenzhen. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between land subsidence and typical urbanization progress: land reclamation, transportation network, and urban construction. The results show that land subsidence mostly occurs in the western reclamation area, with a maximum rate of -74.9 mm/a in Qianhai Bay. Areas with larger quaternary marine sediment thickness in the range of 10-20 m are more likely to experience subsidence. Obvious subsidence (<-20 mm/a) along the subway mainly occurred on Lines 11 and Line 5, which is inversely proportional to the distance from the metro. The correlation coefficient is -0.197. Areas with low road densities have a high probability of experiencing great subsidence. A relationship between land subsidence and building construction in the Guangming district is found. Obvious subsidence (<-20 mm/a) mainly occurred in the building areas, with a percentage of 43.48%.

TI  - Predicting Land Surface Temperature and Land Cover Changes Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Hefei, Eastern China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid urban infrastructure expansion in China, numerous cities have been suffering from the negative effects of urban warming and ensuing social and environmental challenges. Accurate acquisition of long-term dynamics in urban land surface temperature (LST) helps to the development of sustainable urban management actions. In this article, based on the Landsat and MODIS long-term observations from 2000 to 2020 covering Hefei City, the capital of Anhui Province of China, four spatio-temporal fusion algorithms including the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, flexible spatio-temporal data fusion model and spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model were implemented and compared, followed by the extraction of the spatial distribution characteristics and evolution trend of urban summer average LST. Next, the relationships between LST grading zones and different land cover types were explored, and the 2030 urban LST was predicted by using the patch-generating land use simulation coupled with Markov chain model. The results showed that STARFM was the best spatio-temporal fusion algorithm here. From 2000 to 2020, the high temperature zone expanded from 638.81 to 886.31 km(2), and there was still a continuous trend of enhancing high temperature zone and built-up area in Hefei during 2020-2030, indicating that the urban heat island effect will intensify continuously. This study provides a feasible and comprehensive approach to monitoring urban surface temperature dynamics. These findings contribute a scientific insight for local governments to formulate urban land management plans.

TI  - The "No-Self" in Ciurlionis landscape painting
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the philosophical and aesthetic links between the mature painting of Ciurlionis and the paintings of the Chinese literati known as "wen ren". From the author's point of view, Ciurlionis' mature works of the Sonata period embody the category of "no self" ("wu wo") of traditional Chinese philosophical aesthetics. Ciurlionis, like the great Chinese masters of the Song and Yuan dynasties, in the process of expressing a philosophical view of the world through his paintings, expands the consciousness of the perceivers, who, having transcended their ego-centered worldview, reach a qualitatively higher state of "no self". This dynamic state of "no self" consciousness enables the artist to see the world around him with completely new eyes, to expand the boundaries of time and space, and finally to feel at one with the infinity of the surrounding natural world. Summarising the ideas expressed in the article, the author draws the principal conclusion that the aesthetic value of Ciurlionis' paintings from the mature sonata period lies in the painter's ability to philosophically interpret the world around us in the language of artistic images, symbols and metaphors, and that the principles of the category of `no self' place him on a par with the great masters of the traditional Chinese landscape painting.

TI  - Evaluation of the AMSR2 Ice Extent at the Arctic Sea Ice Edge Using an SAR-Based Ice Extent Product
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive microwave (PM) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are essential tools for providing long time series of sea-ice cover information, including sea-ice concentration (SIC) and sea-ice extent (SIE). Large uncertainties have been revealed in PM SIC/SIE products in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and during the melting season, where fusion with SAR data could be effective for improving accuracy due to its high spatial resolution and ability to preserve detailed ice distributions. A comprehensive comparison of PM and SAR ice cover products is needed for better data fusion. This study evaluates one of the PM SIE products, the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SIE product retrieved with the arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study (ARTIST) sea ice (ASI) algorithm, using a neural-network-based SAR SIE product throughout the year 2019. First, we present key results of three assessment parameters, including the overall accuracy (OA), error-of-ice (EI), and ice edge location distance (LD), and then estimate the optimal SIC segmentation threshold for AMSR2 ASI SIE. Based on OA and EI, the annual average SIC threshold of 12.24%, winter average of 9.25%, and summer average of 16.43% are obtained and regarded as optimal by excluding cases with large uncertainties. Second, the AMSR2 ASI SIE product is found to perform better in identifying thin ice and melt ponds, while the SAR NN SIE product has better detection of brash ice and frazil ice. We introduce a parameter of sea-ice fragmentation fraction (IFF) to analyze the primary impact factors behind the different performances. It is found that the ratio of LD to IFF could distinguish the aforementioned different ice conditions, thus providing hints for combining the complementary advantages of the two SIE products during data fusion.

TI  - Improving Leaf Area Index Estimation With Chlorophyll Insensitive Multispectral Red-Edge Vegetation Indices
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential vegetation biophysical trait that determines the plant's structure and photosynthetic capacity, characterizing of leaf area index (LAI) is important for vegetation growth and health monitoring. The empirical models based on vegetation indices (VIs) from remote sensing images are an effective method for deriving LAI. However, due to the coupled impacts of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) on canopy reflectance and saturation effect, most VIs cannot achieve a good accuracy of LAI estimation. The remotely sensed red-edge reflectance can provide valuable information to delineate the LAI, therefore a series of leaf chlorophyll insensitive red-edge VIs by using the Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-6 (GF-6) multispectral images are developed in this work to improve the LAI estimation accuracy. The potentials of reflecting LAI variations and sensitivity to LCC changes for each Sentinel-2 and GF-6 red-edge band are comprehensively analyzed based on the PROSAIL model to select the optimal band in VIs design. The proposed VIs are then evaluated in multiple ways, including with PROSAIL simulated datasets, ground measured LAI with canopy spectra, and real satellite images. The evaluation results based on field LAI measurements indicate that the proposed red-edge VIs can effectively improve crop LAI estimation accuracy with the best regression coefficient (R-2 = 0.81 for Sentinel-2 and R-2 = 0.65 for GF-6) among all comparative VIs. Our work showcases incorporating red-edge bands with suitable formula is promising for improving VI-based LAI retrieval, and they offer a practicable solution to fast achieve decameter LAI maps by using the Sentinel-2 or GF-6 images.

TI  - Depth-Resolved and Depth-Integrated Primary Productivity Estimates From In-Situ and Satellite Data in the Global Ocean
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of marine phytoplankton primary productivity (PP) from satellite remote sensing observations are potentially used to assess global carbon budgets, biogeochemical response, pools and fluxes of carbon and its spatial and temporal variations due to ocean-atmospheric oscillations under climate change. According to the recent studies, satellite-based vertically integrated global PP products have significant uncertainties due to the limitations of the past models, challenges in deriving the appropriate parameters that account for the variation of PP with seasons and provinces, and specify the vertical structure of phytoplankton biomass from satellite observation data and scarcity of in-situ vertical profile data. To overcome these issues, we developed a depth-resolved and depth-integrated model to estimate PP for global oceanic waters. It comprises the depth-resolved primary productivity (DRPP) and satellite-based depth-integrated primary productivity (DIPP) parameterizations to accurately estimate the magnitude and variability of PP in the global ocean. These parameterization algorithms require knowledge of the relative chlorophyll-specific carbon fixation rate (P-rel(b)) and maximum chlorophyll-specific carbon fixation rate within the water-column P-opt(b) in order to derive the spatial and temporal patterns of DRPP and DIPP. To estimate the chlorophyll-specific maximum rate of carbon fixation at a depth equal to z (P-z(b)), two different P-rel(b) algorithms were developed based on the relative values of i) the subsurface photosynthetically available radiation (PAR(rel)) and ii) the optical depth at depth z (zeta(z)). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the effect of sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface chlorophyll concentration (SCHL) and sea-surface photosynthetically available radiation (SPAR) on the photo-physiological parameter (P-opt(b)). These physical, biological and optical parameters were used to obtain accurate P-opt(b) estimates. The model based on the SST-SCHL-SPAR (P-opt(b) (SSTCP)) produced more accurate Pbopt estimates than the global Vertically Generalised Productivity Model (Pbopt (VGPM)). Comparison of the model results with in-situ measurement data demonstrated that the zeta(z)-based DRPP algorithm (DRPP(zeta(z))) yields more accurate results than the PAR(rel)-based DRPP algorithm (DRPP(PAR(rel))). This study also investigates the spatial and temporal patterns in MODIS-Aqua-derived P-opt(b) and DIPP products and the impacts of climate-driven perturbations on the global ocean PP due to the La Nina and El Nino phenomenon during 2010 and 2015.

TI  - FEATURES OF PERSONALITY TRUST OF RUSSIAN AND INDONESIAN STUDENTS IN TERMS OF NETWORK ACTIVITY
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The process of modern youth's cybersocialisation is caused by the digitalisation and the inclusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) in daily life. Network activity is a part of students' socialisation. The interaction of student youth in the virtual space is conditioned by personality trust, which is revealed through the categories of trust in oneself, other users and the virtual world. The personality trust of students, as a belief in the reliability of other people and the world, regulates network activity and the life of society. Trends in the formation of personality trust in traditional and virtual space have similar prerequisites.Aim. The aim of the study is to identify the features of personality trust of Russian and Indonesian students in terms of network activity.Methodology and research methods. The study was conducted on the basis of the subject-personal approach. A set of methods was used: "Assessment of trust/distrust of a person in other people" (A. B. Kupreychenko) (the authors introduced an additional construct "virtual world"); "The study of trust/distrust of the individual in the world, other people, oneself"; "Questionnaire for the problematic use of social networks"; "Assessment of involvement in the use of ICT".Results and scientific novelty. For the first time, personality trust is considered in the context of network activity in the framework of a comparative study of Russian and Indonesian students. Indonesian students tend to display personality trust in communication by accepting participants in network activity, in choosing more authoritative sources of information and participants with a positive reputation. Students from Russia trust reliable and credible sources and network users, basing on empathy and a similar worldview. The personality trust of students in the virtual world and network users is more pronounced among Indonesians, and trust in oneself is equally important for both groups of students. The Russian student youth is characterised by a low level of trust in the information on the network, in comparison with the Indonesian youth. General trends in the problematic use of technology have been identified, such as cognitive absorption, emotion regulation, and Internet addictive behaviour. Both groups of students prefer online communication and strive for open and effective relationships in the virtual space with like-minded people, for mutual assistance and unity.Practical significance. The results of studying the personality trust of Russian and Indonesian students in terms of network activity can be used to build open and productive relationships between young representatives of the countries, to organise psychological and pedagogical support for the socio-cultural adaptation of foreign students, to develop digital educational environment of an international university.

TI  - Epidemiology of syphilis infections among pregnant women in Tanzania: Analysis of the 2020 national representative sentinel surveillance.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Syphilis has detrimental effects on the health of the mother and that of both fetuses and newborns exposed in utero or at delivery. Understanding its local epidemiology is essential for policies, planning, and implementation of targeted preventive interventions. Using data from the 2020 National Sentinel Surveillance of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANCs) in Tanzania we determined the prevalence and determinants of syphilis among pregnant women in Tanzania mainland.METHODOLOGY: The ANC surveillance was conducted in 159 ANC sites from all 26 regions of Tanzania's mainland from September to December 2020. It included all pregnant women 15 years and above on their first ANC visit in the current pregnancy during the survey period. Counseling for syphilis was done using standard guidelines at the ANC and testing was done using rapid SD Bioline HIV/Syphilis Duo test kits. Analysis was done using both descriptive statistics to determine the prevalence and characteristics of syphilis, whereas, logistic regressions were used to examine the independent association between syphilis and dependent variables.RESULTS: A total of 38,783 women [median age (Interquartile range (IQR)) = 25 (21-30) years] participated in the surveillance. Of them, 582 (1.4%) tested positive for syphilis. A wide regional variation was observed with the highest burden in Kagera (4.5%) to the lowest burden in Kigoma (0.3%). The odds of syphilis infections were higher among older women and those with no formal education. Compared with primigravids, women with 1-2, those with 3-4 and those with more than four previous pregnancies had 1.8 (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), 2.1 (aOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.1) and 2.6 (aOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7-3.9) higher odds of syphilis infection respectively.CONCLUSION: Syphilis is still prevalent among pregnant women in Tanzania with a wide regional disparity. Efforts to prevent new infections, screen pregnant women, and treat those infected should be strategized to include all regions and renewed emphasis on regions with high burden, and importantly among women who are multipara, with a low level of education, and advanced age.

TI  - A Parameter-Free Enhanced SS&E Algorithm Based on Deep Learning for Suppressing Azimuth Ambiguities
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aliasing artifacts introduced by azimuth ambiguity seriously impact the interpretation of synthetic aperture radar images. To achieve parameter-free and fast azimuth ambiguity suppression, a novel deep learning model is designed to estimate the ambiguous signal intensity to total signal intensity ratio in the range-Doppler domain. This model does not depend on processing parameters and can be applied in any acquisition mode. The mean shift algorithm is applied to select less ambiguous subspectra according to the estimation result. The selected subspectra are restored to a full spectrum with an energy concentrated extrapolation method to preserve the resolution. The enhanced spectral selection and extrapolation algorithm overcomes the dependence on processing parameters, and experiments based on TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images indicate that the proposed algorithm suppresses the azimuth ambiguity significantly.

TI  - Fire Impacts and Dynamics of Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest of East Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) are globally important ecosystems which receive less research attention compared to tropical rainforests but are equally under serious threat. The objectives of this paper are to characterize the vegetation structure, diversity and composition of SDTF of Baluran National Park, East Java, Indonesia, and to assess the impact of burning this SDTF and its post-fire recovery. (2) Methods: In the field, we measured floristic composition and dominance at sites with different fire histories in both SDTF and adjacent savannas of Baluran. Remote sensing image analysis was also employed using the MODIS burn area product and various thematic maps. (3) Results: SDTF at Baluran has moderately high tree cover, is less diverse in species than rainforest, and has a prominent vegetative response to fire, especially in the tree layer. The immediate post-fire period in SDTF featured lower densities of tree seedlings and saplings, more grasses and herbs, and lower species richness than older unburned forest. Species composition varied with fire age and vegetation type, with relatively rapid recovery with time since fire evident, although there was some convergence of long-unburned savanna and SDTF sites in terms of floristics. (4) Conclusions: The SDTF of Baluran recovers after fire principally via resprouting but also via seedling regeneration, with structural attributes returning more quickly (<10 years) than floristic composition (>10 years). We did not find consistent evidence of ecosystem transitions between SDTF and savanna despite a small number of long-unburned savanna sites having floristic similarities to dry forest (particularly in terms of characteristic tree species), and we identify the need for more study to determine the degree and mechanisms of forest-savanna transitions in the region, with a future research agenda outlined. Relatively large areas of savanna-dry forest transitions demonstrated from remote sensing analyses were primarily attributed to spread of Acacia nilotica (an alien invasive small tree or shrub) into long-unburned savanna, and its decline in areas where the species is being successfully controlled via burning and cutting. Knowledge of such ecological shifting is important for the ecosystem management, especially in terms of their usage by large mammals.

TI  - Seasonal and Yearly Controls of CO2 Fluxes in a Tropical Coastal Ocean
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from Earth's surface is a critical component of the global carbon budget, and the ocean surface is a significant CO2 source and sink. The tropical coast absorbs CO2 due to phytoplankton abundance and the all-year availability of photosynthetically active radiation. However, the role of the tropical coastal ocean in the global carbon budget is uncertain because of its underrepresentation in the literature. This study is the first to describe the variations of long-term CO2 flux in the tropical coast on monthly and annual scales using the eddy covariance method and remote sensing data. The 5-yr average of the CO2 flux is-0.089 +/- 0.024 mmol m-2 day-1, which indicates that it is a moderate carbon sink. The results show that the CO2 flux varied seasonally: the fall transitional, southwest, spring transitional, and northeast mon-soons partitioned the flux into three phases: increasing, stable, and decreasing. The rising and falling stages can be identified by the erratic behavior of the flux, whereas the stable phase's fluxes were relatively constant. The environmental parameters that regulated CO2 flux were chlorophyll a, sea surface temperatures, wind, and atmospheric stability, which modulated the CO2 flux on the monthly time scale. Wavelet analysis corroborated the finding and revealed the role of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on CO2 flux through El Nino-Southern Oscillation. On the monthly time scale, sea surface tempera-ture only slightly affected the fluxes, unlike chlorophyll a, but temperature's control on the flux became more apparent on the yearly time scale. These findings help us to understand the monthly and yearly controls of CO2 flux and could contribute to developing models for predicting the flux on the tropical coast.

AB  - The segmentation of volcanic ash clouds in remote sensing images provides valuable insights to study the volcanic deformation, forecasting, tracking, and hazard monitoring. However, the task of delineating the boundary of volcanic eruptions becomes difficult due to non-uniformity in the scale of eruptions across remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a network for multi-scale volcanic ash clouds segmentation (MS-VACSNet) in remote sensing images. The proposed MS-VACSNet uses U-Net as base line with few improvements in the encoder and decoder sub-networks. Specifically, we employ dilated convolutions to capture the contextual information while delineating volcanic eruptions of different scales. We have conducted experiments on 10 active volcanic regions across the globe using MODIS thermal and infrared images. The experimental results show that our MS-VACSNet achieves an improvement of 5% in dice score compared to state-of-the-art segmentation approaches in segmenting the volcanic ash clouds.

AB  - Introduction: the research is devoted to the comprehension of the poetic creativity of Meshalkina Natalya Albertovna, a representative of the modern stage of the development of Khanty literature. The subject of the study is the techniques and means of expression of the author's worldview. Objective: to identify the features of artistic thinking and perception of the poetess. Research materials: poetic texts by N. A. Meshalkina. Results and novelty of the research: for the first time in the study the poetic creativity of Natalya Albertovna Meshalkina is analyzed. As a result, we come to conclusion that the poetess refers to the embodiment of the theme of nature, homeland, and family. The leading theme of creativity is nature. The lyrical heroine admires the surrounding world. The image of nature also becomes a tool through which the poetess creates a character. The space of N. A. Meshalkina's poetic texts is natural, it can expand and narrow down. The image of the lyrical heroine is full of an optimistic beginning, she is sensual, emotional. The motif of solitude is an essential part of the creation of a lyrical heroine.

TI  - Modelling snowpack bulk density using snow depth, cumulative degree-days, and climatological predictor variables
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowpack water equivalent (SWE) is a key variable for water resource management in snow-dominated catchments. While it is not feasible to quantify SWE at the catchment scale using either field surveys or remotely sensed data, technologies such as airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) support the mapping of snow depth at scales relevant to operational water management. To convert snow depth to water equivalent, models have been developed to predict SWE or snowpack density based on snow depth and additional predictor variables. This study builds upon previous models that relate snowpack density to snow depth by including additional predictor variables to account for (1) long-term climatologies that describe the prevailing conditions influencing regional snowpack properties, and (2) the effect of intra- and inter-year variability in meteorological conditions on densification through a cumulative degree-day index derived from North American Regional Reanalysis products. A non-linear model was fit to 114 506 snow survey measurements spanning 41 years from 1166 snow courses across western North America. Under spatial cross-validation, the predicted densities had a root-mean-square error of 47.1 kg m(-3), a mean bias of -0.039 kg m(-3), and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.70. The model developed in this study had similar overall performance compared to a similar regression-based model reported in the literature, but had reduced seasonal biases. When applied to predict SWE from simulated depths with random errors consistent with those obtained from LiDAR or Structure-from-Motion, 50% of the SWE estimates for April and May fell within -45 to 49 mm of the observed SWE, representing prediction errors of -15% to 20%.

TI  - Rapid Spaceborne Mapping of Wildfire Retardant Drops for Active Wildfire Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial application of fire retardant is a critical tool for managing wildland fire spread. Retardant applications are carefully planned to maximize fire line effectiveness, improve firefighter safety, protect high-value resources and assets, and limit environmental impact. However, topography, wind, visibility, and aircraft orientation can lead to differences between planned drop locations and the actual placement of the retardant. Information on the precise placement and areal extent of the dropped retardant can provide wildland fire managers with key information to (1) adaptively manage event resources, (2) assess the effectiveness of retardant slowing or stopping fire spread, (3) document location in relation to ecologically sensitive areas; and perform or validate cost-accounting for drop services. This study uses Sentinel-2 satellite data and commonly used machine learning classifiers to test an automated approach for detecting and mapping retardant application. We show that a multiclass model (retardant, burned, unburned, and cloud artifact classes) outperforms a single-class retardant model and that image differencing (post-application minus pre-application) outperforms single-image models. Compared to the random forest and support vector machine, the gradient boosting model performed the best with an overall accuracy of 0.88 and an F1 Score of 0.76 for fire retardant, though results were comparable for all three models. Our approach maps the full areal extent of the dropped retardant within minutes of image availability, rather than linear representations currently mapped by aerial GPS surveys. The development of this capability allows for the rapid assessment of retardant effectiveness and documentation of placement in relation to sensitive environments.

AB  - Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a field of increasing interest and worthy of new approaches and innovative applications. As well known, Italy boasts a unique cultural-historical heritage of monuments and archeological sites that need to be managed, particularly in a multi-hazard prone area like our country. A really appealing technique is represented by the advanced multi-temporal differential interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-DInSAR), which has been developed and applied in different fields in the last twenty years. The exploitation of such techniques in the monitoring and structural assessment of cultural heritage is still an open issue even if the first applications available in literature show promising potentialities. In this paper the general framework for structural monitoring and assessment previously proposed by the authors, is applied to the complex building San Michele in Rome (Italy). In particular, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) ascending and descending datasets are collected and processed applying the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method obtaining deformation time series and mean velocity maps of the persistent scatterers located in the investigated area, for both geometry acquisitions. Finally, different techniques useful for assessing the structural behavior and monitoring of constructions are applied and critically discussed.

TI  - Estimation of Aboveground Biomass in Agroforestry Systems over Three Climatic Regions in West Africa Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ALOS, and GEDI Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) offer viable solutions for climate change because of the aboveground biomass (AGB) that is maintained by the tree component. Therefore, spatially explicit estimation of their AGB is crucial for reporting emission reduction efforts, which can be enabled using remote sensing (RS) data and methods. However, multiple factors including the spatial distributions within the AFS, their structure, their composition, and their variable extents hinder an accurate RS-assisted estimation of the AGB across AFS. The aim of this study is to (i) evaluate the potential of spaceborne optical, SAR and LiDAR data for AGB estimations in AFS and (ii) estimate the AGB of different AFS in various climatic regions. The study was carried out in three climatic regions covering Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Two AGB reference data sources were assessed: (i) AGB estimations derived from field measurements using allometric equations and (ii) AGB predictions from the GEDI level 4A (L4A) product. Vegetation indices and texture parameters were generated from optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR data (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) respectively and were used as predictors. Machine learning regression models were trained and evaluated by means of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the RMSE. It was found that the prediction error was reduced by 31.2% after the stratification based on the climatic conditions. For the AGB prediction, the combination of random forest algorithm and Sentinel-1 and -2 data returned the best score. The GEDI L4A product was applicable only in the Guineo-Congolian region, but the prediction error was approx. nine times higher than the ground truth. Moreover, the AGB level varied across AFS including cocoa (7.51 +/- 0.6 Mg ha(-1)) and rubber (7.33 +/- 0.33 Mg ha(-1)) in the Guineo-Congolian region, cashew (13.78 +/- 0.98 Mg ha(-1)) and mango (12.82 +/- 0.65 Mg ha(-1)) in the Guinean region. The AFS farms in the Sudanian region showed the highest AGB level (6.59 to 82.11 Mg ha(-1)). AGB in an AFS was mainly determined by the diameter (R-2 = 0.45), the height (R-2 = 0.13) and the tree density (R-2 = 0.10). Nevertheless, RS-based estimation of AGB remain challenging because of the spectral similarities between AFS. Therefore, spatial assessment of the prediction uncertainties should complement AGB maps in AFS.

TI  - Mapping Soil Parameters with Environmental Covariates and Land Cover Projection in Tropical Rainforest, Hangadi Watershed, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning and geostatistics are efficient techniques for investigating the geographic distribution of soil properties. This study's objectives were to assess soil fertility status, map the spatial variability of selected soil parameters and compare random forest with ordinary kriging. Soil samples were collected to analyze parameters: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and organic carbon (OC) using systematic sampling. Some environmental covariates were used in the machine learning process: a digital elevation model (DEM) collected from USGS distributing shuttle radar topography mission data and a LULC map generated from a 30-year time series (1988-2018) of Landsat 8. Georeferenced samples were sent to Batu Soil Research Laboratory. pH, CEC and OC were mapped and status was determined using random forest and ordinary kriging. Random forest was more accurate with low mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (high R-2). In random forest, pH varied between 5.03 and 5.76 and ordinary kriging pH ranged from 4.96 to 5.76. pH was greater in cultivated land. CEC and OC were higher in the forest. The higher pH in cultivated land was due to grass coverage and minimal tillage. The addition of organic matter and CEC to a forest may result in higher OC. Environmental covariates (topographic, bands, NDVI and LULC) were used to predict the gradients of pH, OC and CEC. For pH, OC and CEC, DEM was the most important predictor. CEC was high in low landscape, but low in high landscape positions. Low OC requires composting, fallow and organic fertilizers. Future research should include the remaining predictors: physiochemical and lithological data to improve the performance of random forest.

TI  - Urban cooling effect of rivers: its role in climate change mitigation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural landscapes, such as rivers, can moderate intense heat in cities and provide a salubrious environment. This study aimed to evaluate how different urban forms affect the urban cooling effect of rivers. Landsat 8 satellite images were used to extract the water index, vegetation, bare land/non-vegetated land, built-up area, built-up density, and vegetation density from two study sites. The impact of urban forms on the cooling effect of rivers was analysed through ordinary least squares method via exploratory regression analysis and scatter plot diagrams. Analysis revealed that natural landscapes have a positive relationship with surface temperature, whereas other urban forms have a negative trend. Although both sites displayed the same trend for every urban form, statistical analysis revealed different adjusted R-2 values for every set of independent variables for each study site in the exploratory regression analysis report, justifying the variation of the influence of urban forms.

TI  - Correspondence between spectral reflectance and features of the built environment for community resilience
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As humans increasingly settle in dense urban areas, localized natural and anthropogenic shocks become more likely to impact larger numbers of individuals. Research suggests that resilience to shocks is a function of physical fortifications and social processes including critical infrastructure, social networks, and trust. Although physical fortifications are relatively easy to identify and catalog, social processes elude simple measurement due to data limitations and geographic constraints. Recent work has shown that certain types of infrastructure may correlate with social processes that enhance community resilience; however, the ability to assess where and to what extent that infrastructure exists depends on a complete representation of the built environment. OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Places are two sources of data commonly used to locate and characterize infrastructure, but they are often incomplete. We address this limitation by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 to estimate the density and type of infrastructure. We compare the classification results to known infrastructure locations from OSM data. Our results show that the CNN classifier performs well and may be used to augment incomplete datasets for a deeper understanding of the prevalence of infrastructure associated with social processes that enhance community resilience.

T2  - Melanoma research
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Identifying prognostic biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes in stage I and II cutaneous melanomas could guide the clinical application of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) as a biomarker in early-stage melanoma. This study evaluated all initially staged Ib and II melanoma patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy at a tertiary centre in Brisbane, Australia between 1994 and 2007, with survival data collected from the Queensland Cancer Registry. Primary melanoma tissue from 189 patients was analysed for pSTAT5 level through immunohistochemistry. Cox regression modelling, with adjustment for sex, age, ulceration, anatomical location, and Breslow depth, was applied to determine the association between pSTAT5 detection and melanoma-specific survival. Median duration of follow-up was 7.4 years. High pSTAT5 detection was associated with ulceration and increased tumour thickness. However, multivariate analysis indicated that high pSTAT5 detection was associated with improved melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.15, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.67) as compared to low pSTAT5 detection. This association persisted when pSTAT5 detection was limited to immune infiltrate or the vasculature, as well as when sentinel node positivity was accounted for. In this cohort, staining for high-pSTAT5 tumours identified a subset of melanoma patients with increased survival outcomes as compared to low-pSTAT5 tumours, despite the former having higher-risk clinicopathological characteristics at diagnosis. pSTAT5 is likely an indicator of local immune activation, and its detection could represent a useful tool to stratify the risk of melanoma progression.

TI  - A New Sea Ice Concentration Retrieval Algorithm Based on Relationship Between AMSR2 89-GHz Polarization and Landsat 8 Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A newly developed linear sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval algorithm based on passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) measurements is proposed. SIC is retrieved by a linear function of the polarization ratio (PR) at 89 GHz (PR89) corrected for atmospheric influence. We use Landsat 8 SIC data to derive the coefficients of the linear function. Results using this linear algorithm are compared to those of ASI2 developed by Lu et al. (2018), which is a nonlinear 89-GHz algorithm with polarization difference (PD) at 89 GHz (PD89) that also includes a correction for atmospheric influence. Both algorithms are compared with independent SIC data derived from Landsat 8, ship-based observation, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and both tend to underestimate the ship-based and Landsat 8 SICs, particularly over thin ice. However, the proposed algorithm tends to provide results with lower bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) for different ice categories.

TI  - Low billing rates for pediatric sedation fee on magnetic resonance imaging
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The 2018 revision of social insurance in Japan allows additional fees to be calculated for pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that must be performed under sedation. The number and trend of actual claims since this revision was established is unknown. The aim of this study to investigate the use of the additional fees and any regional differences in the use.Methods: To analyze the claims of additional fees for pediatric sedated MRI after the fiscal year (FY) 2018, the actual claims in inpatient and outpatient practice was analyzed using publicly-available data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). We analyzed the calculation rate for all MRI scans. Annual changes in the actual number and calculation rate were analyzed. The ratio of the number of additional fees to the overall number of pediatric radiological procedures was used to examine the geographic disparity.Results: The number of calculations from FY 2018 to FY 2020 was available. In FY 2020, only 1347 additional fees were calculated, corresponding to 0.35% of the total number of MRI scans. The number of fees showed a decreasing trend. Most cases were in the 0-4 year age group; however, there were a few cases in the 10-14 year age group without such a decrease. The relative number of calculations by prefecture showed an up to 14-fold disparity.Conclusions: The requirements for sedation for pediatric MRI are strict, but they are not fully utilized. Measures such as relaxing the requirements for the fee are needed to make MRI-related sedation safer.

TI  - Pixel-Level Projection of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Using Landsat Images and Cellular Automata Models in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed a pixel-level projection method for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over a long term and across a large area using a combination of Landsat images, PM2.5 data from monitoring stations, and historical gridded PM2.5 data. We considered the spatial dependence effects of the particulate matter using a spatial lag model to quantify the relationship between PM2.5 concentration and land coverage indices, where the latter were calculated by the built-up, vegetation, and water indices. The future land coverage indices for the pixel-level projection of PM2.5 were derived from the future land-use scenario predicted by the Futureland model. We applied the method to analyze the spatial patterns of PM2.5 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, from 2000 to 2020, and then projected its pixel-level scenario in 2030. The projected PM2.5 shows high concentrations in the north and low in the south and temporally decreases compared to 2010. The projection of the fine-grained PM2.5 scenario can help adjust YRDs environmental and industrial policies, as well as implement its management strategies for sustainable urban development. Our method can be used to predict future patterns not only for long-term and large-scale pixel-level PM2.5 concentrations but also for other environmental parameters.

T2  - JCMS-JOURNAL OF CINEMA AND MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to ongoing ecological crises, recent turns to animism in eco-criticism have celebrated a materialist dimension of this worldview that understands the world as a relational mesh collectively formed by agential entities, human and nonhuman alike. But as animism increasingly gets grounded in contemporary concerns and materialism rather than indige-neity and the soulful metaphysics behind the term's etymology, critiques of its politics emerge as well. By analyzing Joris Ivens and Marceline Loridan's Une histoire de vent (A Tale of the Wind, 1988), this article demonstrates how animism does not need be secularized in order to be ecopolitical.

TI  - A Geometric Location Matching Method for Validation of Satellite Products: A Case Study for Albedo
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of satellite albedo products relies on reference value on the coarse pixel scale which is acquired by independent means. In previous research, reference value was generally obtained within the nominal spatial extent of the validation pixel from in situ observations or high spatial resolution airborne/spaceborne albedo references. Nevertheless, the signal of the validation pixel may correspond to different areas due to geometric errors. This geolocation mismatch will introduce large uncertainty into validation results, particularly for pixels covering heterogeneous areas. Therefore, this study first proposed a geometric location matching method on the coarse pixel level to establish the actual position of the validation pixel. The results show that geolocation error of the validation pixels of the high-order satellite products occurs widely. And they are not systematically shifted. The errors in reference values resulting from geolocation errors range from -10% to 25%, which are very likely to be greater than the accuracy requirement of satellite albedo products. Such errors caused by geometric shifts of validation pixels significantly amplify the errors in satellite albedo products. With this geometric location matching method, the reported relative root mean square error (RMSE) of MCD43A3 V061 reduced from 9.8% to 3.2%, and the reported correlation coefficient increased from 0.204 to 0.611. This method is very helpful to reduce the uncertainty of validation results and identify the real accuracy of satellite albedo products. Moreover, it has the generalization ability for other numerical variables over other types of land surfaces.

TI  - Multi-Domain Fusion Graph Network for Semi-Supervised PolSAR Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expensive acquisition of labeled data limits the practical use of supervised learning on polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image analysis. Semi-supervised learning has attracted considerable attention as it can utilize few labeled data and very many unlabeled data. The scattering response of PolSAR data is strongly spatial distribution dependent, which provides rich information about land-cover properties. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method named multi-domain fusion graph network (MDFGN) to explore the multi-domain fused features including spatial domain and feature domain. Three major factors strengthen the proposed method for PolSAR image analysis. Firstly, we propose a novel sample selection criterion to select reliable unlabeled data for training set expansion. Multi-domain fusion graph is proposed to improve the feature diversity by extending the sample selection from the feature domain to the spatial-feature fusion domain. In this way, the selecting accuracy is improved. By few labeled data, very many accurate unlabeled data are obtained. Secondly, multi-model triplet encoder is proposed to achieve superior feature extraction. Equipped with triplet loss, limited training samples are fully utilized. For expanding training samples with different patch sizes, multiple models are obtained for the fused classification result acquisition. Thirdly, multi-level fusion strategy is proposed to apply different image patch sizes for different expanded training data and obtain the fused classification result. The experiments are conducted on Radarsat-2 and AIRSAR images. With few labeled samples (about 0.003-0.007%), the overall accuracy of the proposed method ranges between 94.78% and 99.24%, which demonstrates the proposed method's robustness and excellence.

TI  - Exploiting Phase Difference of Arrival of V2X Signals for Pedestrian Positioning: Key Methods and Simulation Evaluation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pedestrian-to-vehicle communication helps to prevent pedestrian accidents by disseminating position information of a pedestrian to nearby vehicles. This is especially useful when a pedestrian is in the blind spot of vehicles. In urban canyons, roadside buildings obstruct satellite signals, which may cause an outage in pedestrian positioning. Using vehicles and roadside units as positioning anchors helps to solve this problem. But the performance of distance estimation, based on the attenuation property of wireless signals, is degraded by multipath propagation. To address this issue, this paper exploits phase information of V2X signals, instead of signal strength, for distance estimation. The signal transmitted by a pedestrian device is simultaneously received by several anchors, and the phase difference of arrival (PDoA) is used to compute the distance difference. Using the OFDM structure, phase information of multiple subcarriers can be computed efficiently. Potential problems like inter-symbol interference, synchronization error and phase ambiguity are addressed and the accuracy of distance estimation is further improved by combining phase information of multiple subcarriers before fixing the phase ambiguity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation evaluations, using 3D map and ray-tracing.

TI  - Filling Then Spatio-Temporal Fusion for All-Sky MODIS Land Surface Temperature Generation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared band of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra/Aqua satellite can provide daily, 1 km land surface temperature (LST) observations. However, due to the influence of cloud contamination, spatial gaps are common in the LST product, restricting its application greatly at the regional scale. In this article, to deal with the challenge of large gaps (especially complete data loss) in MODIS LST for local monitoring, a filling then spatio-temporal fusion (FSTF) method is proposed, which utilizes another type of product with all-sky coverage, but coarser spatial resolution (i.e., the 7 km China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST product). Due to the great temporal heterogeneity of LST, temporally closer auxiliary MODIS LST images are considered to be preferable choices for spatio-temporal fusion of CLDAS and MODIS LST time-series. However, such data are always abandoned inappropriately in conventional spatio-temporal fusion if they contain gaps. Accordingly, pregap filling is performed in FSTF to make fuller use of the valid information in temporally close MODIS LST images with small gaps. Through evaluation in both the spatial and temporal domains for three regions in China, FSTF was found to be more accurate in reconstructing MODIS LST images than the original spatio-temporal fusion methods. FSTF, thus, has great potential for updating the current MODIS LST product at the global scale.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Estimation of High-Resolution Snow Depth in Alaska Using Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth (SD) knowledge is significant in many applications related to hydrology, climate, and disaster management. Many SD models are developed using multifrequency spaceborne passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperature (Tb) observations because of their sensitivity to SD. The sensitivity of Tb to SD is affected by snow metamorphism, which constrains the utility of several empirical and conceptual models for estimating SD. For the first time, extremely randomized trees (ERT), a machine learning algorithm, which is less susceptible to data noise, is used in this study for estimatingSDat high resolution (1kmx1 km) forAlaska. Different ERT SD models (i.e., Alaska wide model, zonal model) are developed using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 data and auxiliary datasets for various Alaska regions during 2012-2021. Thesemodels are evaluated using three different crossvalidations (i.e., sample, spatial, and temporal). Further, ERT models' predictive power assessment is performed using independent spatial, temporal datasets. The results indicate that: 1) inclusion of auxiliary parameters improves the accuracy of ERT SD estimates; 2) there is no substantial difference between the zonal and Alaska wide ERT model estimates; 3) when SD >30 cm, the ERT models have outperformed the AMSR-2 product, the GlobSnow product, and the Chang model; 4) the mean absolute error in SD estimates increases with a decrease in latitude, an increase in elevation, and from early winter to late winter across Alaska. Overall, this study shows that the ERT SD model has good potential for improving moderate to deep SD estimates.

TI  - A WORLDVIEW DIALOGUE OR PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT OF THOUGHT: ANCIENT PARALLELS TO THE BOOK OF QOHELETH 12:7
T2  - SCHOLE-FILOSOFSKOE ANTIKOVEDENIE I KLASSICHESKAYA TRADITSIYA-SCHOLE-ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the ancient parallels of the fifth century B.C.E. to Qoh. 12:7 ("And the dust shall return to the earth, which it was, andthe spirit shall return to God who gave it"). First of all, these parallels include passages from Euripides: "That which is of the earth returns to the earth, the same which is born of the etheric seed returns to the heavenly pole" ("Chrysippus"; 839, 8-11 [ed. Nauck]); "the spirit is to the ether (pi nu epsilon upsilon mu alpha mu epsilon nu pi rho o zeta alpha iota theta epsilon rho alpha), and the body to the earth" ("The Suppliants," 533-534; see also: fr. 971 [ed. Nauck]). Another parallel to Qoh.12:7 is found in an Attic public inscription commemorating the Athenian soldiers killed at Potidaea (432 B.C.E.): "The ether took (their) souls, [the earth (took)] the bodies..." (IG I-3, 1179, eds. Kirchhoff et al.). This view correlates with Empedocles' assertion that there is neither birth (phi upsilon sigma iota zeta) nor death, but only the mixing and subsequent separation of mixed elements (cf.: B8-9, 11, 15 [DK]), and the idea of Anaxagoras, who said that "birth and death are tantamount" to "change (alpha lambda lambda lambda omicron iota omicron upsilon sigma theta alpha iota) only" (Arist.GC I, 314a.14-15). In Euripides' tragedy "Helen", the heroine expresses the idea that all "mind" (omicron nu omicron upsilon zeta) "does not live" on the death of the body, it dies "in immortal ether"; but in ether the "immortal" gamma nu omega mu eta which the "mind" of man "possesses" persists. In analysing these fragments, the author concludes that one would rather assume a parallel development of the concepts of the afterlife in the Mediterranean region, rather than a direct influence of Hellenic religious doctrines on Jewish thought or a philosophical dialogue between Judaeans and Hellenes at the time the Book of Qoheleth was written.

TI  - Lesia Ukrainka: Ukrainian National Identity Against the "Russian Ukrainians" Dichotomy
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The article is dedicated to the research of Lesia Ukrainka's correspondence, journalistic and literarycritical articles concerning the problem of national identity as a factor in overcoming the "Russian Ukrainians" dichotomy. Achieving this purpose involves solving the following tasks: 1) to reveal the poetess's views on the essence and social manifestations of worldview fluctuations in the life activities of the Ukrainian elite at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries; 2) outline her strategy for overcoming cultural "inter-words" in the individual and society. Theoretical basis. The author applies the existential discourse of Foreignness by G. Marcel, criticism of Christianity by F. Nietzche, the theory of the nation by F. Meineke, typology of patriotism by A. Valitsky, the phenomenology of the relationship between the Self and the Other by J. Kristeva, the typology of the Stranger by B. Waldenfels, the ideas of D. Dontsov, O. Zabuzhko, S. Varetska, S. Matsenka, D. Melnyk, Y. Tarasiuk. Originality. The author proves that Lesia Ukrainka is one of the first among Ukrainian thinkers who critically considers the issue of dichotomy in the worldview and life world of "Russian Ukrainians" of the early twentieth century - One's own and Others', stopping in the uncertainty of one's belonging to Russian or Ukrainian culture, rejection of national selfidentification. Conclusions. The ways to overcome this dichotomy, alienation from the values of Ukrainian culture, betrayal, and collaborationism, Lesia Ukrainka sees, firstly, awareness of the cultural difference of Ukrainians, that is, the spiritual and psychological incompatibility of the Ukrainian national identity with the Russian one. Secondly, the need for an effective volitional separation from others and the political struggle for unification into the Ukrainian nation as a social and culturally self-sufficient collective self, worthy of a free dignified existence and recognition by other nations of the world.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessment of land use land cover based on trajectories and cellular automata Markov modelling and its impact on land surface temperature of Lahore district Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to assess the urban growth and impact on land surface temperature (LST) of Lahore, the second biggest city in Pakistan. In this research, various geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques (maximum likelihood classification (MLC)) LST, and different normalized satellite indices have been implemented to analyse the spatio-temporal trends of Lahore city; by using Landsat for 1990, 2004, and 2018. The development of integrated use of RS and GIS and combined cellular automata-Markov models has provided new means of assessing changes in land use and land cover and has enabled the projection of trajectories into the future. Results indicate that the built-up area and bare area increased from 15,541 (27%) to 23,024 km(2) (40%) and 5756 km(2) (10%) to 13,814 km(2) (24%). Meanwhile, water area and vegetation were decreased from 2302 km(2) (4%) to 1151 km(2) (2%) and 33,961 km(2) (59%) to 19,571 km(2) (34%) respectively. Under this urbanization, the LST of the city was also got affected. In 1990, the mean LST of most of the area was between 14 and 28 celcius, which rose to 22-28 celcius in 2004 and 34 to 36 celcius in 2018. Because of the shift of vegetation and built-up land, the surface reflectance and roughness of each land use land cover (LULC) class are different. The analysis established a direct correlation between Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with LST and an indirect correlation among Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Built-up Index (BI) with LST. The results are important for the planning and development department since they may be used to guarantee the sustainable utilization of land resources for future urbanization expansion projects.

AB  - Remote sensing scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, which involves categorizing land areas into predefined classes based on very high-resolution remotely sensed data. Deep learning architectures such as classical convolutional and residual neural networks as well as relatively new attention-based networks, have shown great potential in achieving high accuracy in remote sensing scene classification tasks. With the increasing availability of remote sensing data and the advancements in deep learning techniques, modern deep learning architectures such as ConvNeXt and vision transformers have shown tremendous potential in achieving high accuracy in this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of modern deep-learning architectures for remote sensing scene classification. Preliminary experiments showed that the models from the ResNet family are better than modern networks in fulfilling the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.

AB  - Accurate and long-term series surface water extraction from dams are of great significance for developing the agroecosystem and sustainable management of water resources. By expanding the remote sensing data with an excellent spatial-temporal resolution, it is possible to monitor various hydrological parameters such as dams' water level and surface area. This study provides a quick and robust method for open-surface water detection based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in Taleqan Dam. For this purpose, 90 Sentinel-2 images from September 2015 to November 2019 were used. First, the NDWI index separated water pixels from non-water pixels. Then binary segmentation was conducted to extract water pixels from NDWI images to calculate the water surface area. Comparing two time series of water surface area results obtained from Sentinel-2 images with in-situ data showed RMSE values of 0.43 km(2), a correlation of 93.64%, and an RRMSE value of 4.09%. Also, the results showed that the most significant increase in the water surface area with a value of 1.22 km(2) occurred from June 27, 2018, to August 1, 2018, and also the most significant decrease. It also happened with 1.75 km(2) from May 23, 2017, to June 12, 2017. On the other hand, the variations average of the water surface area with a value of -0.03 km(2) shows a slight decrease in the water surface area of Taleqan Dam in the study period.

TI  - Interpretable Deep Learning Framework for Land Use and Land Cover Classification in Remote Sensing Using SHAP
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An interpretable deep learning framework for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in remote sensing using Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs) is introduced. It utilizes a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of satellite images and then feeds the results to a SHAP deep explainer so as to strengthen the classification results. The proposed framework is applied to Sentinel-2 satellite images containing 27000 images of pixel size $64 \times 64$ and operates on three-band combinations, reducing the model's input data by 77% considering that 13 channels are available, while at the same time investigating on how different spectrum bands affect predictions on the dataset's classes. Experimental results on the EuroSAT dataset demonstrate the CNN's accurate classification with an overall accuracy of 94.72 %, whereas the classification accuracy on three-band combinations on each of the dataset's classes highlights its improvement when compared to standard approaches with larger number of trainable parameters. The SHAP explainable results of the proposed framework shield the network's predictions by showing correlation values that are relevant to the predicted class, thereby improving the classifications occurring in urban and rural areas with different land uses in the same scene.

AB  - PURPOSE: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System is a national medical product safety surveillance system consisting of a large multisite distributed database of administrative claims supplemented by electronic health-care record data. The program seeks to improve data capture of race and ethnicity for pharmacoepidemiology studies.METHODS: We conducted a narrative literature review of published research on data augmentation and imputation methods to improve race and ethnicity capture in U.S. health-care systems databases. We focused on methods with limited (five-digit ZIP codes only) or full patient identifiers available to link to external sources of self-reported data. We organized the literature by themes: (1) variation in data capture of self-reported data, (2) data augmentation from external sources of self-reported data, and (3) imputation methods, including Bayesian analysis and multiple regression.RESULTS: Researchers reduced data missingness with high validity for Asian, Black, White, and Pacific Islander racial groups and Hispanic ethnicity. Native American and multiracial groups were difficult to validate due to relatively small sample sizes.CONCLUSIONS: Limitations on accessible self-reported data for validation will dictate methods to improve race and ethnicity data capture. We recommend methods leveraging multiple sources that account for variations in geography, age, and sex.

AB  - Nowadays, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems can provide images with very high-resolution, representing a formidable tool for maritime surveillance applications. Nevertheless, ship targets usually appear defocused in level-1 SAR images, due to their motion. Ship target refocusing can be achieved via Inverse SAR (ISAR) techniques, and a number of autofocus approaches have been proposed and tested in the past. However, the estimation of the full ship's dynamic (translation and rotation), is a strategic information, also providing the possibility to scale the images in the uniform range-cross-range plane. In this work, the effectiveness of suitable single-channel ISAR techniques at estimating the ship velocity and at correctly scaling the images is assessed by means of Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) data exploiting the Automatic Identification System (AIS) information as the reference ground truth.

AB  - High-resolution images provided by satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are of great interest for maritime surveillance applications. As ship targets can be characterized by complex motions, they usually appear defocused in level-1 SAR images. Previous works have shown the effectiveness of the applications of Inverse SAR (ISAR) techniques to refocus the images of such targets. Apart from achieving well-focused images, also the knowledge of ship velocity is strategic information for surveillance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the capability of ISAR techniques to estimate the ship translational motion: to this purpose, two different autofocus approaches are considered and compared, one based on the image contrast and the other on the phase gradient algorithm. Achievable performances are analyzed by means of Cosmo-SkyMed data and exploiting the Automatic Identification System (AIS) information as the reference ground truth.

TI  - Riesz-Quincunx-UNet Variational Autoencoder for Unsupervised Satellite Image Denoising
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiresolution deep learning approaches, such as the UNet architecture, have achieved high performance in classifying and segmenting images. Most traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures commonly use pooling to enlarge the receptive field, which usually results in irreversible information loss. The UNet architecture avoids this information loss by introducing skip connections that allow the reconstruction of lost information. Leveraging this property of the UNet, this study proposes to include a Riesz-Quincunx (RQ) wavelet transform, which combines: 1) higher order Riesz wavelet transform and 2) orthogonal Quincunx wavelets (commonly used to reduce blur in medical images) inside the UNet to reduce noise in satellite images and their time-series. Combining both approaches, we introduce a hybrid RQ-UNet variational autoencoder (RQUNet-VAE) scheme for image and time series decomposition used to reduce noise in satellite imagery. By including denoising capabilities directly inside the UNet architecture, we hypothesize that our RQUNet-VAE may improve downstream image processing tasks that use the traditional UNet architecture. We present qualitative and quantitative experimental results that demonstrate that our proposed RQUNet-VAE is effective at reducing noise in satellite imagery yielding results similar to other state-of-the-art noise reduction methods. We further show that our RQUNet-VAE outperforms the UNet architecture specifically in cases where images exhibit high levels of noise. We show this result in two down-stream applications for multiband satellite images, including image time-series decomposition and image segmentation.

TI  - Monitoring the storage volume of impounding reservoirs in inaccessible regions using multi-sensor satellite data: the case study of Tuyen Quang Reservoir (Vietnam)
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water stored by reservoirs is critical for irrigation, electricity generation, drinking water supply, recreation, fisheries, and flood control. Therefore, the reservoir's water storage volume (SW) must be measured and monitored frequently for better watershed management. Since SW data is often not publicly available, finding a method to quantify SW objectively and accurately but to facilitate local water management is necessary. This study proposes a method for monitoring water surface area and storage volume using multi-sensor satellite remote sensing data through the Tuyen Quang Reservoir case study in Northern Vietnam. Accordingly, the water surface area was first delineated from multi-temporal optical satellite images, such as Landsat series and Sentinel-2 images, using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index and resampled into 30-m pixel resolution data. Using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model data, the water depth at each pixel was then calculated by the difference between its elevation and the reservoir shoreline's mean elevation. The results showed that the reservoir's water surface area increased rapidly during 2003-2007 (from 579 ha to 5,516 ha), fluctuated insignificantly in 2008-2020, and reached 7,196 ha in 2021. Consequently, SW was raised from 11.8 million m3 in 2003 to 1.68 billion m3 in 2021. Our estimations agree with the depth and SW of Tuyen Quang Reservoir published in 2019. Our proposed method could be an effective water resource management tool in developing countries where the number of impounding reservoirs increases dramatically yearly without the financial afford to build gauging stations.

TI  - Water consumption of industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) during dry growing seasons (2018-2022) in NE Germany
T2  - JOURNAL FUR KULTURPFLANZEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Europe experienced unprecedented droughts during the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. In the course of climate change, it is expected that such drought events will occur more frequently so that agriculture needs to adapt to droughts. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been promoted as an adaptation to water limited conditions. Hemp delivers biomass as a raw material to a variety of different value chains, such as fibers and textiles, house construction, chemicals, or food applications.Hemp develops a deep root system, which enables it to cover its water demand even during longer dry periods. This may lead to an over exploitation of soil moisture of deeper soil layers or of the groundwater in the long-term. Against this background, this study assessed the water consumption of hemp in Northeastern Germany (region Uckermark) during the growing seasons 2018-2022. The Penman Monteith approach was used to calculate the water consumption, whereby the remote sensing based S-SEBI approach was employed, with Landsat satellite images as input data, to feed crop coefficients into those calculations.The water consumption of hemp ranged from 310 to 407 mm over the growing seasons 2018-2022, while stem yields were 9 t ha-1 (except 2018 with 7.8 t ha-1). This water consumption did exceed the precipitation during the growing seasons, but did not exceed the total precipitation of the given hydrological years so that growing hemp does not constitute an over -exploitation of water. Instead, hemp taps the soil moisture that has infiltrated into the soil during autumn and winter. This makes hemp a crop well suited for an adaptation to a drier, hotter, and more variable climate.

TI  - A Framework to Assess Remote Sensing Algorithms for Satellite-Based Flood Index Insurance
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data have the potential to monitor natural hazards and their consequences on socioeconomic systems. However, in much of theworld, inadequate validation data of disaster damage make reliable use of satellite data difficult. We attempt to strengthen the use of satellite data for one application-flood index insurance-which has the potential to manage the largely uninsured losses from floods. Flood index insurance is a particularly challenging application of remote sensing due to floods' speed, unpredictability, and the significant data validation required. We propose a set of criteria for assessing remote sensing flood index insurance algorithm performance and provide a framework for remote sensing application validation in data-poor environments. Within these criteria, we assess several validation metrics-spatial accuracy compared to high-resolution PlanetScope imagery (F1), temporal consistency as compared to river water levels (Spearman's.), and correlation to government damage data (R-2)-that measure index performance. With these criteria, we develop a Sentinel-1 flood inundation time series in Bangladesh at high spatial (10 m) and temporal (similar to weekly) resolution and compare it to a previous Sentinel-1 algorithm and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series used in flood index insurance. Results show that the adapted Sentinel-1 algorithm (F1(avg) = 0.925, (rho avg) = 0.752, R-2 = 0.43) significantly outperforms previous Sentinel-1 and MODIS algorithms on the validation criteria. Beyond Bangladesh, our proposed validation criteria can be used to develop and validate better remote sensing products for index insurance and other flood applications in places with inadequate ground truth damage data.

TI  - Improving Surface Soil Moisture Estimation Through Assimilating Satellite Land Surface Temperature With a Linear SM-LST Relationship
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a vital role in linking the global terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. Land data assimilation (DA) is typically applied for acquiring more accurate SM estimates by incorporating remote sensing (RS) retrievals to constraint model parameters and system states. In addition to RS SM retrievals that are frequently used in land DA, the land surface temperature (LST), which can be directly and independently retrieved from thermal infrared measurements, is closely linked with SM, and can also be used in the land DA to improve SM estimation. However, it is hampered by the lack of a general observation operator that links LST retrievals with SM in the land surface model (LSM). Therefore, a novel LST DA scheme is developed in this article, in which RS LST is linked to SM by a linear relationship between the simulated ensembles of SM and LST generated by the Ensemble Kalman filter. Subsequently, MODIS LST is assimilated into the LSM to estimate SM and calibrate the soil parameters (soil porosity, soil texture) with the dual-cycle assimilation algorithm. The DA SM results are validated using an in situ SM network deployed in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results demonstrate that our DA scheme improved the SM accuracy-leading to a decrease in the root-mean-square error from 0.11 m(3)m(-3) to 0.026 m(3)m(-3). This article provides a novel scheme of LST assimilation, which is beneficial for the assimilation of high-resolution RS data.

TI  - Comparison between biophysical analysis model and dimidiate pixel model for the estimation of forest canopy density
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy density (FCD) is an essential factor in forest resources investigation and plays a vital role in forest resources management. To replace the traditional time-consuming and labor-intensive survey methods, it is of great importance to study how to select a suitable model at specific temporal and spatial scales for rapid and accurate estimation of FCD in large areas. To reduce workload and errors, we present an approach combing Landsat 5 TM data and biophysical analysis algorithms without considering thermal index (TI) information to model FCD in a temperate forest in Northern China. The scaled vegetation index (SVD) and scaled shadow index were used as variables for modeling and mapping FCD. The dimidiate pixel model based on the normalized difference vegetation index was also used to estimate FCD. We compared the forest management inventory data of 2012 with the FCD results from the biophysical analysis model and the dimidiate pixel model. The results showed that the biophysical analysis model (prediction precision P = 93.62%, coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.886, root mean square error RMSE = 0.057) has higher accuracy than the dimidiate pixel model (P = 89.92%, R-2 = 0.725, RMSE = 0.078) in estimating FCD. This study shows that the biophysical analysis model without TI information has better performance than the dimidiate pixel model, and can be used for monitoring large scale FCD.

TI  - Extended Moving Ship Detection Based on Improved Variance Weighted Information Entropy in ATI-SAR Systems
T2  - 2023 24TH INTERNATIONAL RADAR SYMPOSIUM, IRS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Radar Symposium (IRS)
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Ships with a low-signal-to-clutter ratio in sea background are usually difficult to detect due to extensive isolated strong sea clutter. To address the issue, an approach for extended moving ship detection based on improved variance weighted information entropy (VWIE) in along-track interferogram(ATI)-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems is proposed. Firstly, the primary potential target pixels are detected by using the ATI detector, followed with the pixel clustering to acquire the images of each potential extended targets. Then, an adaptive spatial filter is designed to suppress sea clutter and optimize the output of those potential targets at the same time. Finally, the improved VWIE with an adaptive window size for each potential extended target is constructed in the filtered image in order to enhance the signal-to-clutter ratio and thus to accurately detect the extended moving ships. Experimental results on dual-channel data-set collected by the satellite TerraSAR-X demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - A Lightweight Multitask Learning Model With Adaptive Loss Balance for Tropical Cyclone Intensity and Size Estimation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity and size estimation are key in disaster management and prevention. While great breakthroughs have been made in TC intensity estimation research, there is currently a lack of research on TC size reflecting TC influence radius. Therefore, we propose a lightweight multi-task learning model (TC-MTLNet) with adaptive loss balance to simultaneously estimate TC intensity and size. Adaptive loss balance is utilized to solve the problem of inconsistent convergence speed of TC intensity and size estimation tasks. The model based on four 2-D convolutions, four 3-D convolutions and three fully connected layers takes up less computational and storage space and improves the accuracy of TC intensity and size estimation by sharing knowledge among multiple tasks. In addition, due to the imbalanced distribution of TC samples, with significantly few low-intensity and high-intensity TC satellite data, this phenomenon poses a great challenge to TC intensity and size estimation. So, we utilize the influence of nearby samples to calibrate the sample density to weight the loss function to enable the model to be generalized to all samples. The result shows that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of TC intensity estimation is $\text{8.40}\,\text{kts}$, which is 33.5% lower than that of the Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) and 11.4% lower than that of the deep learning method (3DAttentionTCNet). The mean absolute error (MAE) of the TC size estimation is $\text{20.89}\,\text{nmi}$, which is a 16% reduction compared to the Multi-Platform Tropical Cyclone Surface Winds Analysis (MTCSWA).

TI  - Landscape pattern evolution characteristics of a typical small watershed in an earthquake disaster area-a case study in the Longxi River Basin
T2  - Chinese Journal of Applied and Environmental Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the characteristics of landscape pattern change in a small watershed severely affected by disaster, the Longxi River Basin was selected as the study area. Four remote sensing images from SPOT-5 and Worldview in 2005, 2009, 2011, and 2015 were selected as data sources. 3S technology and the Fragstats landscape index calculation software were used to study the evolution characteristics of landscape ecological patterns in the Longxi River Basin under the frequent disturbance of secondary mountain disasters before and after the earthquake. To reveal the evolutionary characteristics of landscape patterns in the Longxi River Basin, 14 landscape pattern indices were used to measure landscape patterns in four different periods: before (2005), early after (2009), three years after (2011), and seven years after (2015) the earthquake. In addition, ArcGIS software was used to establish buffer zones, and four periods of remote sensing images were divided into human activity areas and natural areas. The results showed the following: (1) From 2005 to 2015, the patches affected by earthquake disasters changed in different degrees, among which forest landscape patches accounted for the largest proportion of the landscape matrix of the Longxi River Basin, with 91.35% in 2005, 78.41% in 2009, 86.06% in 2011, and 90.46% in 2015. The forest patch area showed little change before and after the earthquake. The landscape patch areas of farmland and construction land decreased, but the traffic land increased continuously. The patch area of shrub and grass landscapes decreased in 2009, increased in 2011, and decreased in 2015. However, patch areas of gullies, bare lands, and geological disaster landscapes increased in 2009 and then decreased continuously. (2) From 2005 to 2015, the landscape types of the Longxi River Basin in Dujiangyan mainly transformed into shrub-grass, geological disasters, and forestland. The landscape area transfer characteristics were as follows: shrub-grass to forest land and forest land to geological disaster from 2005 to 2009; shrub-grass to forest land, forest land to geological disaster, and forest land to shrub-grass from 2009 to 2011; and shrub-grass, geological disaster to forest land and forest land to shrub grass and geological disaster from 2011 to 2015. The overall transfer characteristics from 2005 to 2015 were as follows: shrub and grass to forest land, and forest land to geological disaster shrub-grass. (3) After the earthquake, which was strongly affected by human interference, the degree of landscape fragmentation of the forestland, shrub and grass, traffic land, bare land, and geological disaster increased. Among all landscape types, forest land and geological disasters were most significantly affected by the earthquake, with deeply divided boundaries, high landscape fragmentation, and obvious boundary effects, whereas forest land as a landscape matrix still had the highest aggregation degree. Human disturbance was relatively mild in natural areas. After the earthquake, the patch density and edge density of the geological disaster were significantly reduced and were lower than those of the human activity area, which indicated that the earthquake and secondary disasters have little impact on the natural area, and natural recovery can be very good without human disturbance.(4) SHEI and SHDI decreased after the earthquake but increased from 2009, while CONTAG had an opposite trend, indicating that the area difference of each landscape type in the Longxi River Basin decreased, resulting in increased patch types and landscape-level heterogeneity and a decreased dominance degree of landscape type and landscape connectivity. The distribution of the landscape in the natural area was more concentrated and adjacent than that in the human activity area. The distribution of the landscape in areas of human activity was subject to the effects of topographic factors. The "5 & BULL;12" earthquake destroyed the original landscape pattern of the Longxi River Basin and induced debris flow, landslides, and other secondary disasters, destroying the original patches. Human activity is closely related to changes in landscape patterns after secondary disasters. This study provides fundamental data for habitat restoration and post-disaster reconstruction in the Longxi Province, China.

CP  - Conference on Molecular-Guided Surgery - Molecules, Devices, and Applications IX
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - An increasing number of cancer surgery protocols are including sentinel lymph node biopsies on the day of resection to stage for non-palpable spread of cancer through tumor draining lymph nodes. The challenge is that often a tumor-positive node will make it necessary to perform an enhanced resection of the lymphatic network, and if lymph node processing is not completed within the timeframe of surgery, then patients may have to be called back for additional surgery or have to undergo amplified chemo or radiation therapy. Our group is working on a rapid lymph node staining and fluorescence tomography system that we call ADEPT to provide surgeons with lymph node biopsy results within 15 min. The aim is to minimize the number of callback surgery or amplified therapy procedures to minimize stress to patients and reduce health care costs. This work predicts, using Monte Carlo photon propagation modeling simulations, that ADEPT has the potential to yield greater than 95% accuracy in detecting the smallest amount of cancer considered clinically relevant withing 15 min of tissue processing and imaging.

TI  - The Worldview of Supporters of the Western Path of Development for Russia among the General Population
T2  - MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Using data from a nationwide Russian survey conducted in 2022, this study illustrates the distinct characteristics of proponents of a pro-Western development trajectory for Russia, in comparison to the opponents of this course, and Russians occupying an intermediate position. I demonstrate that the different attitudes of these groups towards the West are a consequence of profound differences in their norms, values, attitudes, and views, as well as their socio-psychological features. These differences are grounded in their orientation either towards the interests of the community (and thus, the state) or towards individual interests and, correspondingly, human rights. This conflict reflects the dual nature of Russian culture, poised at the juncture of Western individualistic cultures and Eastern collectivist cultures. The 'Westerners' are more frequently encountered within 'strong' social groups. However, even in the most affluent age, residential, and other groups, they constitute a minority. Only among urban youth who have obtained the most prestigious forms of higher education and were raised in families where both parents also had higher education, do 'Westerners' constitute a majority. Yet, living in a foreign normative-value environment makes them feel alien in their own country. As a result, they perceive the world pessimistically and largely mistrust not only power structures and civil society but also the people around them. The conviction that Russia should follow its own path and not look to the West dominates in all mass social groups. Therefore, the norms, values, and attitudes of the group that most consistently shares this belief can be seen as a system that is characteristic of Russian cultural norms and values. However, this does not mean that the position of supporters of a Western development path for Russia is alien to this culture. To evaluate the place of these two groups within the culture, we need to consider not only their ratio in the mass of the population (7 % and 54 %, respectively), but also several other factors, from their coexistence in Russian society for centuries to the presence of their members, albeit in different proportions, in all strata and groups of Russian society.

AB  - The results of the ground-based absolute gravity and space geodetic measurements for the Altai Mountains were considered in combination with EIGEN-6C4 Global Geopotential Model (ETOPO1 Global Relief Model) generated from the satellite data. Analysis was made on different kinds of data: model values for the vertical component of gravity, values of Bouguer and Faye gravity reductions, variations of the vertical gravity gradient, and changes in altitude of the measurement sites. With EIGEN-6C4 model for Bouguer reduction, the crustal thickness curve was drawn along the Novosibirsk (southern West Siberia) - Ukok Plateau (Altai Mountains) line with a length of 800 km. The Moho depth in-creases from 40 km in the northwest of the area to 51 km in the southeast. For the homogeneous crust model, there was obtained the Moho depth distribution in the Altai Mountains and their foothills.The analysis of the results of modeling Bouguer and Faye reductions, the data on quasigeoid heights and the relation-ship between relief height and Bouguer anomalies implies that the Altai Mountains area as a whole is isostatically com-pensated. Non-compensated are some intermountain basins, such as, for example, the Kurai and Chuya valleys.

When hyperspectral images compared with multispectral images, hyperspectral satellite images increase the distinguishability of classes as they provide high spectral resolution. In this study, cultivation area, bare land, forest, residential & industrial, road, lake, river, marsh classes of Susurluk River and its surroundings which provide significant discharge to the Sea of Marmara were determined by classification from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 images that were acquired on 13.05.2021 and 14.05.2021, respectively. Firstly, Sentinel-2 satellite image was resampled to 30 m spatial resolution. Maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were applied to the total of six datasets, including the original dataset, PCA and MNF results of the both satellite images. F1-score, precision, recall metrics were compared to assess accuracies. It was concluded from the ML algorithm applied PRISMA results, the highest F1-score (0.924) was achieved by the PCA applied result, while the lowest F1-score (0.712) belongs to the original dataset. The reason is that high correlated spectral bands can be eliminated by using dimensionality reduction methods. Most of the classes were distinguished with higher accuracy by PRISMA image due to having high spectral resolution.

TI  - Changes of Worldview Structures in the Czech Republic and Slovakia After 1990. Methodological Aspects of Measuring Religiosity and "Nones".
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, four censuses have been conducted since 1990, in which the religious affiliation of the population was monitored. While the first one, in 1991, was carried out with a uniform methodology still within the framework of a common, albeit federalised, state, the later censuses differed from each other in both countries in their methodology, which was changed several times, but also in what they actually measured. In the same period, international surveys that worked with a more unified methodology for measuring religiosity were also conducted, most notably the EVS and WVS programmes. The study will focus on the analysis of the methodology used in both countries and the various risks involved in attempting to compare results between the two countries. Different survey and census results also lead to substantial differences in interpretation of the results of trends in religiosity change, leading to the need for a more in-depth analysis of the impact of the different methods on the results obtainet. Comparisons will be made concerning the possible ways to analyse both the group of people claiming a religious affiliation and those who did not claim a religious affiliation (nones). The ways of comparing the results from the censuses will be tested by using the survey-type studies EVS/WVS. Sociologia 2023, Vol. 55 (No. 4: 434-464)

AB  - Solar radiation measurement data is used to predict photovoltaic power generation. Ground measurement is highly accurate, but there is a problem the measurement location is limited. On the other hand, satellite measurement is available anywhere on the earth, but the accuracy is not sufficient. Therefore, this paper has proposed to model the relationship between ground measurement data and satellite measurement data using machine learning. Focusing on the recently developed constellation technology that links multiple low earth orbit satellite to observe data with high temporal resolution, this paper has proposed a solar radiation estimation model that combines geostationary orbit satellite data and low earth orbit satellite data as input data. This paper aims to estimate the solar radiation on the ground using satellite measurement data and improve the estimation accuracy.

T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to outline the variable markers of the individual linguistic awareness/consciousness development in the conditions of artificial bilingualism.Methods. The main method of the study was the method of selective observation with the fixation of markers of the linguistic awareness development and qualitative indicators of respondents' mastery of English as a foreign language in the artificial bilingualism conditions. Potential standards of passive-mechanical (imitation) and active (cognitive-communicative) models of artificial bilingualism were used for comparison. Markers of the respondents' linguistic awareness were subject to monitoring: language knowledge, culture and speaking skills (at a level sufficient for formulating and expressing thoughts in the process of interpersonal communication in a foreign language), manifestations of language socialization (mastering the norms of listening, perceiving and speaking in a foreign language at a level sufficient for communication and coordination of semantic codes of communication subjects). The obtained data were subjected to content analysis, which made it possible to evaluate the markers of the development of the respondents' linguistic awareness in the artificial bilingualism conditions and to reveal the level of using a foreign language in communication. In order to statistically confirm the significance of the obtained data, the method of one-factor variance analysis (Fisher's phi-criterion) was used. A multidimensional procedure of cluster analysis (K-means clustering) was also used, which made it possible to distinguish subsets of the levels of the linguistic awareness development among the respondents of the research project.Results. The results of the data analysis of the research project proved that the differences between the experimental and control groups of junior high school students in identifying markers of linguistic awareness are reliably significant relative to individual predictors of the logical ordering of speech-thinking dimensions of language awareness (at p <= 0.05).Respondents of the experimental group demonstrate better results in listening, understanding the content of oral expression in a familiar everyday context and in communicative competences. The dominance of markers of an average level of linguistic awareness development among younger schoolchildren was also recorded.Conclusions. In the realities of permanent transformations of the modern information society, bilingualism appears as a predictor of foreign language mastery at a level sufficient for communication and exchange of ideas with other subjects of linguistic activity. Language (and foreign language in particular) is not only a communication tool, but also a way of perceiving, organizing and encoding (or decoding) the surrounding reality. In this context, linguistic awareness is interpreted as an invariant of possible schemes of mastering reality, which is most suitable for the purposes of communication between people. The analysis of markers of the junior high school students' linguistic awareness development proved that when an active (cognitive -communicative) model of artificial bilingualism is implemented, the respondents demonstrate statistically better results in listening, understanding the content of oral expression in a familiar everyday context and in identifying communicative competences.

TI  - Entomological Characteristics of Malaria Transmission across Benin: An Essential Element for Improved Deployment of Vector Control Interventions
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary With limited resources to properly perform geographic surveillance of malaria vectors, Benin, through its National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), conducted a study on vector dynamics and transmission across the country's departments in order to generate an entomological transmission profile. Per department, 2 communes (i.e., 24 across twelve departments) were chosen for this study, taking into account geographical and ecological diversity. We selected two villages per commune and four households (HH) per village to collect mosquitoes using human landing catches (HLCs). In each HH, an indoor and outdoor HLC session took place between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. on two consecutive nights between July and September 2017. Captured Anopheles were identified and ovaries were dissected for parity. Heads and thoraxes were tested for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites by ELISA, and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was calculated. Analyses revealed low, medium, and high transmission communes distributed throughout the country. Heterogeneity in malaria transmission in Benin was observed, which is not evident when assessing entomological surveillance from sentinel sites alone. The NMCP will use the study findings in the future to stratify and plan vector control interventions in high transmission districts to better protect the most at-risk populations. Entomological surveillance in Benin has historically been limited to zones where indoor residual spraying was performed or where long-standing sentinel surveillance sites existed. However, there are significant country-wide gaps in entomological knowledge. The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) assessed population dynamics of Anopheles vectors and malaria transmission in each of Benin's 12 departments to create an entomological risk profile. Two communes per department (24/77 communes) were chosen to reflect diverse geographies, ecologies and malaria prevalence. Two villages per commune were selected from which four households (HH) per village were used for human landing catches (HLCs). In each HH, an indoor and outdoor HLC occurred between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. on two consecutive nights between July-September 2017. Captured Anopheles were identified, and ovaries were dissected to determine parous rate. Heads and thoraces were tested for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites by ELISA. The Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) was calculated as the product of mosquito bite rate and sporozoite index. Bite rates from An. gambiae s.l., the primary vector species complex, differed considerably between communes; average sporozoite infection index was 3.5%. The EIR ranged from 0.02 infectious bites (ib) per human per night in the departments of Oueme and Plateau to 1.66 ib/human/night in Collines. Based on transmission risk scales, Avrankou, Sakete and Nikki are areas of low transmission (0 < EIR < 3 ib/human/year), Adjarra, Adja Ouere, Ze, Toffo, Bopa, Pehunco, Perere and Kandi are of medium transmission (3 < EIR < 30 ib/human/year), and the other remaining districts are high transmission (EIR > 30 ib/human/year). The heterogeneous and diverse nature of malaria transmission in Benin was not readily apparent when only assessing entomological surveillance from sentinel sites. Prospectively, the NMCP will use study results to stratify and deploy targeted vector control interventions in districts with high EIRs to better protect populations most at-risk.

AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) in peripheral tissue serve as a sentinel to invasion and maintain tolerance. They ingest and carry antigens to the draining lymph nodes and present antigens to antigen-specific T cells to initiate acquired immune responses. Thus, understanding DC migration from peripheral tissues and function is critical for understanding DCs' roles in immune homeostasis. Here, we introduced the KikGR in vivo photolabeling system, an ideal tool for monitoring precise cellular movements and related functions in vivo under physiological conditions and during various immune responses that occur in pathologic condition. Using a mouse line expressing photoconvertible fluorescent protein KikGR, we can label DCs in peripheral tissues by changing the color of KikGR from green to red after exposure to violet light and accurately track DC migration from each peripheral tissue to its respective draining lymph nodes.

AB  - As one of the main natural disasters affecting the natural cycle of vegetation, wildfires cause deterioration of natural ecosystems and the destruction of forests. Every year, a large quantity of forest is destroyed by wildfires all over the world. Therefore, precise and timely information about the extent of the burned areas is critical for monitoring wildfire damage. The use of remote sensing and deep learning methods offers great benefits to improve the reliability and efficiency of burned area detection. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the efficacy and usability of a deep learning model (i.e., Convolutional Neural Networks-CNNs) for burned area mapping and compare its predictive performance with a novel machine learning algorithm (i.e., Extreme Gradient Boosting-XGBoost) using various state-of-the-art accuracy metrics. In this paper, the Mu.gla-Bodrum fire that occurred in July 2021 situated on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey was evaluated. To investigate the effects of the spectral indices (i.e., normalized burn index-NBR, differenced normalized burn index-dNBR, and normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI), two datasets consisting of different combinations (i.e., Sentinel-2 original spectral bands and spectral bands together with spectral indices) were employed in analyses. The findings of burned area delineation indicated that the CNN model produced 97.53% overall accuracy whilst the XGBoost algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 93.14% with the use of spectral indices as ancillary data. A similar performance difference was also observed when the predictions were analyzed with the area under the curve metric.

TI  - SEMANTIC CONSTANTS IN PRELUDES Op. 32 BY SERGEI RACHMANINOFF
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper addresses the Preludes Op. 32 by Sergei V. Rachmaninoff. At first, the author presents the crucial from the researcher's perspective semantic constants, i. e., the prevailing sense of nature and manorial life, including the correlation of indoor vs. outdoor states. The Preludes are replete with the foreboding of the impending fatal events of Russian history; they conceal oscillation between home warmth and wanderings. The idea of Russia, the idea of path, the idea of death as the pivotal elements of Rachmaninoff's worldview manifest in the Op. 32. The author points out the relation to the major symphonic works of the period, such as the Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 27, the choral symphony-poem The Bells , Op. 35. The paper attempts to "perceive" the implicit programme nature of the cycle; associations with Alexander S. Pushkin' oeuvre emerge, as well as a subtle affinity with I. Bunin's lyrical poetry and A Nobleman's Nest by I. Turgenev.The Prelude in B minor is a pinnacle of the cycle's dramatic accumulation, appearing as a glimpse into the future through the burden of the happened events; the kinship with Rachmaninoff's emigrant works is stunning. The "boundless snow desert" as an allegorical image of the native land on the eve of disaster is depicted in the Prelude in G sharp minor, reminding of the snowstorm in wilderness from Pushkin's Captain's Daughter - serving as the closest association, since in the beginning of the 1910s Russia yet again faced the fire of mutiny, the devastating revolutionary abyss of wrath and cruelty.The combination of intrinsic musical-theoretical observations with the historical-cultural survey allows the author to come near the comprehensive picture. The methodological basis of the paper relies on the complex method: the author has applied hermeneutical, comparative, and historical approaches.

TI  - Reducing the Cost of Caring: Indirect Trauma Exposure on Mental Health Providers
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMDR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Most mental health clinicians treating trauma survivors are exposed to repeated details of clients' traumatic experiences, and some of these clinicians may experience symptoms of indirect trauma through vicarious traumatization (VT), which has the potential of negatively impacting professional quality of life (ProQOL). The ProQOL Scale was developed to measure both negative and positive effects of working with those who have experienced traumatic stress. The purpose of this study was to determine if clinicians who are trained in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, as compared to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and prolonged exposure (PE), would relate to aspects of their ProQOL differently. Second, it was hypothesized that the ProQOL model would predict VT in TF-CBT and PE clinicians, but not in EMDR therapy clinicians. Fifty-four trauma clinicians who reported their primary modality of treatment as EMDR, PE, and TF-CBT were studied. Participants completed a survey that included demographic information, the ProQOL Scale, and the Vicarious Trauma Scale (VTS). Hierarchical ordinary least squared regression revealed that the empirical ProQOL model did not predict VT scores in EMDR therapy clinicians as it did for non-EMDR therapy clinicians. This study implies that there could be aspects of the EMDR therapy methodology that may support a clinician's healthy worldview when empathetically bonding with traumatized clients, thereby fostering longevity for both clients and clinicians.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the strategies developed by the Administrative Management of the Colegio Indigena de Ujarras to attend the needs of the Educational Community. Therefore, the concepts of education, educational management, and administrative management were taken into account. The qualitative method with the descriptive design was used. The subjects of information were made up of administrative and teaching staff, students, and community leaders related to the Colegio Indigena de Ujarras. The investigation was based on two categories of analysis: the Administrative Management strategies and the needs of the educational community. The analysis was divided into three segments: Indigenous Community of Ujarras, Aspects of the Education Center and Educational Center-Community Relationship. Based on these segments, the results show the need of a transformation in the administrative management of the educational center, which considers the worldview and culture of the indigenous population, the promotion of the ancestral culture of the community, the strengthening of a strategic leadership by the director of the educational center, as well as the strengthening of interpersonal relationships. In conclusion, the researchers consider that there is a need to include the indigenous worldview in the school curriculum of the educational center, in addition to incorporating actions to improve personal relationships between the educational community and to motivate the teaching staff.

AB  - Recently, using remote sensing to monitor water quality has become popular because of its outstanding advantages. Tri An reservoir, since its construction, has always played an important role in the southern provinces; however, the lake is now highly eutrophicated in which the green algae community, which causes this phenomenon, is strongly influenced by the nutrients in the lake. The aim of this research is to estimate the nutrient pollutants concentration (i.e., NO2-, NO3-, NH4+) for the Tri An reservoir on November 14th 2020 using Landsat 8 OLI images. The study performed correlation analysis between measured nutrient pollutants concentration and spectral reflectance values derived from Landsat 8 image bands. The result showed that they are strongly correlated with each other (Pearson coefficients are larger 0.95 between band 4 and NO2-, NO3-, NH4+ measured concentrations). On that basis, the regression equations estimating the nutrient pollutants concentration in the lake were set up and the optimal equation was chosen (the equations estimated NO2-, NO3-, and NH4+ concentrations had adjusted R-2 values 0.94, 0.93, 0.94, respectively), consequently, the nutrient distribution maps in Tri An reservoir were established to identify the high pollution areas. This study has clearly revealed the effectiveness of using satellite images for monitoring water quality.

AB  - Vietnam has diverse and rich natural resources with over 5000 mines and 60 different types of minerals. Mineral activities in Vietnam are licensed by the Government and must ensure to protect the environment and daily activities. However, due to the high profits generated from mining, there have been many illegal mining activities taking place all over Vietnam. One of the causes leading to this situation is the insufficiency in monitoring and managing resources and minerals. Additionally, many mines are located in the forest which is difficult to detect. Therefore, in this study, we adopt Sentinel-1 radar satellite image and Sentinel-2 multi-temporal satellite image to determine illegal coal mining activities at the Minh Tien coal mine, Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam. The research method includes applying Google Earth Engine (GEE) for processing the Sentinel-1 images in both ascending and descending directions and Sentinel-2 optical images to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series to control the different trends from 2016 to 2021. NDVI is then employed to mask the areas with vegetation that witness no abrupt changes in the land cover. This NDVI also acts as the basis for collecting samples for Random Forest classification of the Sentinel-2 images. The results from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 combined with MASK from NDVI have determined the expansion area of the Minh Tien coal mine. The results are compared with those published on the website of Thai Nguyen Portal and have a significant similarity.

TI  - TIMP-1 as a biomarker in obstructive sleep apnea: screening, monitoring, risk stratification, and a step towards precision medicine
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex time -and resource-intensive diagnostic procedure. Since tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP's) are involved in various pathophysiological processes and are correlated with a high cardiovascular risk, TIMP's appear to be a suit-able candidate for an OSA-biomarker.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective controlled diagnostic study, TIMP-1 serum levels of 273 OSA-patients and controls were analyzed for correlation with OSA severity, BMI, age, sex, cardio-/ cerebrovascular comorbidities. Furthermore, longitudinal medium-and long-term effects of CPAP-treatment (n=15) on TIMP-1-levels were investigated.RESULTS: TIMP-1 was clearly linked to OSA as well as to disease severity (mild, moderate, severe; each p < 0.001) and was not influenced by age, gen-der, BMI, or cardio-/cerebrovascular comorbidities. ROC curve analysis revealed an AUC of 0.91 +/- 0.017 SE (p < 0.001), suggesting a TIMP-1 cut-off value of 75 ng/ml (sensitivity 0.78; specificity 0.91) being especially sensitive for patients with severe OSA (sensitivity 0.89; specificity 0.91). The likelihood ratio was 8.88, while the diagnostic odds ratio was 37.14. CPAP-treatment led to a significant decrease of TIMP-1 after 6-8 months (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 seems to fulfill the preconditions for a circulating OSA-biomarker: disease-specific with a mandatory presence in affected patients, reversible on treatment, re-flects disease severity and provides a cutoff val-ue between the healthy state and disease. In the clinical routine, TIMP 1 may help to strati-fy the individual OSA-associated cardiovascu-lar risk and to monitor the treatment response to CPAP-therapy as a further step towards provid-ing a personalized therapy.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1 radar interferometric images for the monitoring of vertical displacements of the earth?s surface affected by non-tidal atmospheric loading
T2  - GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical movements of the Earth's surface affected by non-tidal atmospheric load-ing (NTAL) are analyzed using satellite radar interferometry data. A clear relationship between deformation maps data derived from radar interferometry data and the GNSS time series of permanent stations has been established. The object of the study was the areas around the GNSS stations BYCH (Buchach), GORD (Horodok), CRNT (Chernivtsi). The input data were four pairs of radar interferometric images for the specified areas.Radar satellite images were obtained from the Sentinel-1A spacecraft. Data type - SLC (Single Look Complex) with vertical polarization. Acquisition mode - wideband interferometric IW (Interferometric Wide Swath). Data were processed using SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) software. The processing yileded maps of vertical displacement of the speci-fied territories where the earth's surface displacement caused by influence of non-tidal atmospheric loading had taken place. The values obtained on the basis of vertical dis-placement maps have a high agreement with the results of time series of changes in the altitude position of permanent GNSS stations. The results obtained in the article are of both scientific and practical importance for studying the impact of non-tidal atmospheric loading in large areas. The practical significance is in improving the accuracy of terrestrial geodetic measurements' processing, in particular high-precision levelling. The research data allow to make corrections of the results of levelling for short-period displacements affected by the influence of non-tidal atmospheric loading (NTAL).

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the implications of variations in glacier surface ice velocity (SIV) has become an essential component of glacier research and monitoring. This study investigates the variability in SIV with respect to geography, morphology, and topography in Karakoram-Himalaya. SIVs are extracted for 1439 glaciers in the Karakoram-Himalaya region for the period 2016-2019 using Landsat-8 datasets and a feature tracking method. Glaciers are categorized based on their area, ice thickness, and ice volume in order to investigate the SIV variability with geographical, mor-phological, and topographical parameters. We highlight regional heterogeneities in glacier SIV across the Karakoram-Himalaya. We conclude that in addition to glacier morphology, the altitu-dinal heterogeneity of glaciers in the Karakoram-Himalaya best explains regional disparities in glacier SIV. For all glacier areas smaller than 20 km2, a significant negative correlation (less than -0.4) is observed between glacier minimum elevation and SIV. Heterogeneity in the role of eleva-tion on SIV is also observed at the sub-basin scale, with a correlation of -0.47, -0.33, and -0.18 in the Hanza, Chenab, and Kosi sub-basins, respectively. An unsystematic variability of SIV for large glaciers (area >20 km2), located mostly in the Karakoram and Western Himalayan regions, suggests that the elevation and sub-glacial hydrology may have a significant impact on their dy-namics.

CP  - 10th IEEE International Symposium on Inertial Sensors and Systems (INERTIAL)

AB  - The research presented in this work compensates non-orthogonality over temperature stress effects in low-cost open-loop MEMS gyroscopes using neural networks (NN) for a sensor individual compensation to improve the sensor performance. The non-orthogonality is included in the sensor cross-axis sensitivity (CAS) of MEMS gyroscopes. Using the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) as a self-calibration algorithm and one initial measurement after soldering, an individual compensation model is generated for each sensor that predicts the non-orthogonality using the MEMS gyroscope's quadrature value as an input. It will be shown that a sensor-individual model outperforms a compensation model that should fit for all sensors at once like linear regression or classic NN and improves the non-orthogonality by 82.7 %, 7.5 % and 70 % for yx-, zx-, and zy-non-orthogonality.

TI  - Combining Environmental, Multispectral, and LiDAR Data Improves Forest Type Classification: A Case Study on Mapping Cool Temperate Rainforests and Mixed Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictive vegetation mapping is an essential tool for managing and conserving high conservation-value forests. Cool temperate rainforests (Rainforest) and cool temperate mixed forests (Mixed Forest, i.e., rainforest spp. overtopped by large remnant Eucalyptus trees) are threatened forest types in the Central Highlands of Victoria. Logging of these forest types is prohibited; however, the surrounding native Eucalyptus forests can be logged in some areas of the landscape. This requires accurate mapping and delineation of these vegetation types. In this study, we combine niche modelling, multispectral imagery, and LiDAR data to improve predictive vegetation mapping of these two threatened ecosystems in southeast Australia. We used a dataset of 1586 plots partitioned into four distinct forest types that occur in close proximity in the Central Highlands: Eucalyptus, Tree fern, Mixed Forest, and Rainforest. We calibrated our model on a training dataset and validated it on a spatially distinct testing dataset. To avoid overfitting, we used Bayesian regularized multinomial regression to relate predictors to our four forest types. We found that multispectral predictors were able to distinguish Rainforest from Eucalyptus forests due to differences in their spectral signatures. LiDAR-derived predictors were effective at discriminating Mixed Forest from Rainforest based on forest structure, particularly LiDAR predictors based on existing domain knowledge of the system. For example, the best predictor of Mixed Forest was the presence of Rainforest-type understorey overtopped by large Eucalyptus crowns, which is effectively aligned with the regulatory definition of Mixed Forest. Environmental predictors improved model performance marginally, but helped discriminate riparian forests from Rainforest. However, the best model for classifying forest types was the model that included all three classes of predictors (i.e., spectral, structural, and environmental). Using multiple data sources with differing strengths improved classification accuracy and successfully predicted the identity of 88% of the plots. Our study demonstrated that multi-source methods are important for capturing different properties of the data that discriminate ecosystems. In addition, the multi-source approach facilitated adding custom metrics based on domain knowledge which in turn improved the mapping of high conservation-value forest.

AB  - Rapid urban growth causes the increase of impervious surface which was converted from vegetation land. This affects the rate of water penetration into soils, the rise of surface runoff, and the lowering of groundwater levels. The expansion of the impervious surface gives rise to a series of changes in the physical environment, affecting the quality of life of people due to a change in the thermal energy balance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyse of changes of impervious surface area Ho Chi Minh City and Ba Ria - Vung Tau province which is the marine national economic hub in the period of 2009-2020 by using Landsat satellite image data. The main methods used are NDWI, PISI indices and ISODATA algorithm. The results show that the area of impervious surface area of Ho Chi Minh City is very high with 18.5% in 2009 and 35% increasing rate from 2009-2020. There are 75% districts in Ho Chi Minh city having over 50% impervious surface area. Ba Ria-Vung Tau has lower impervious surface area with 5.8% in 2009 but having the incredible increasing rate- over 100%.

AB  - Van Yen district in Yen Bai province of Vietnam is one of the most affected areas indicating high and very high potential of landslide occurrences. WebGIS technology is useful for dissemination of the geographical information related to landslides. To this aim, this paper provides a landslide information system for Van Yen district of the Yen Bai province. The paper firstly provides a landslide susceptibility map produced using a Random Forest-based model. Along the process, a landslide inventory from three investigations of 2013, 2017, and landslides along national road 32 and provincial road 163 (collected in November 2021) was considered. Additionally, thirteen factors were used in the model as variables including geological data, DEM (digital elevation model), slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, fault network, river network, road network, land use-land cover data, and Sentinel-2 based NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). The model was validated based on confusion matrix, and gave an excellent accuracy of 91.33%. Finally, WebGIS was created using open-source technologies such as Leaflet, Openlayers, Geoserver, PostgreSQL as the database management system, and PostGIS as it is plugin for spatial database management. WebGIS not only contains information relevant to landslides, but it also combines the landslide susceptibility map with population data in order to assess exposure for warning purposes.

TI  - Exploration of convolutional neural network architectures for large region map automation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning semantic segmentation algorithms have provided improved frameworks for the automated production of land use and land cover (LULC) maps, which significantly increases the frequency of map generation as well as consistency of production quality. In this research, a total of 28 different model variations were examined to improve the accuracy of LULC maps. The experiments were carried out using Landsat 5/7 or Landsat 8 satellite images with the North American land change monitoring system (NALCMS) labels. The performance of various convolutional neural networks and extension combinations were assessed, where Visual Geometry Group Network with an output stride of 4, and modified U-Net architecture, provided the best results. Additional expanded analysis of the generated LULC maps was also provided. Using a deep neural network, this work achieved 92.4% accuracy for 13 LULC classes within southern Manitoba representing a 15.8% improvement over published results for the NALCMS. Based on the large regions of interest, higher radiometric resolution of Landsat 8 data resulted in better overall accuracies (88.04%) compare to Landsat 5/7 (80.66%) for 16 LULC classes. This represents an 11.44% and 4.06% increase in overall accuracy compared to previously published NALCMS results, including larger land area and higher number of LULC classes incorporated into the models compared to other published LULC map automation methods.

TI  - Impact of Land Reclamation on Coastal Water in a Semi-Enclosed Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land reclamation has a profound impact on coastal environments. On the Chinese coast, the new Xiang'an International Airport has been built on newly reclaimed land. The impact of the massive land reclamation project (finished in 2018) on water quality and coast conditions in a nearby semi-enclosed bay is investigated using remotely sensed data. Factors affecting surface water quality and coast conditions are further analyzed using multiple regression. All water quality and coast condition indices show no long-term trend from 2005 to 2021. The suspended solid concentration (with a maximum value of 96.11 mg/L) is much lower than the threshold of 188 mg/L. When considering variations in sediment concentration, the probability that the concentration reaches the threshold is less than 1x10(-6)%; therefore, suspended solids have little threat to the local oyster-growing industry. The trend of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration is steady, implying little alteration to nutrient circulation in the semi-enclosed bay. Within the observation timeframe of 2005-2021, a recent sedimentation trend (surrogated by the normalized difference water index) appears after 2018 but it needs to be confirmed by a longer observation. Statistical models based on multiple regression highlight the following links: (1) the sediment source is outside the bay, (2) the overland runoff from newly claimed land dilutes nutrient concentrations, and (3) the coast conditions are mainly affected by tides and rainfall. Neither actively reclaimed or cumulative reclaimed areas form a direct causal relationship to water quality or coast conditions in the semi-enclosed bay.

TI  - Genotoxicity assessment of impacted urban coast using <i>Chelon auratus</i> (Risso, 1810)
T2  - CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the genetic damage and the accumulations of trace metals in Chelon auratus (Risso, 1810) by COMET Assay to test whether this species should represent a bioindicator species of the Arsuz coast of Iskenderun Bay, North-Eastern Mediterranean. Fish were seasonally collected at a contaminated sampling site and as a reference material in an aquacultural farm over one year. Physicochemical parameters in water and trace metals in the tissues of fish collected from these sites were obtained by electrochemical techniques. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for significance assessments. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to define the most important parameters involved in DNA damage, and Pearson correlation test was also used to determine the relationship between trace metals and DNA damage. In the present study, Fe, Zn, Cr and Cu concentrations in the water column of sampling site were exceeded the values allowed by the TEG (2015) and EPA (1989) for all seasons. Trace metal concentrations in the liver tissues of C. auratus can be ranged as follows: Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Ni > Cr > Co > Pb > Cd > Hg for the sampling site. Fe and Pb accumulations in liver tissues of golden grey mullet exceeded the maximum limits allowed by the TFC (2011) and EU (2005) in Summer and Autumn. The highest levels of DNA damage were detected at the sampling site with 77.67 +/- 1.52% DF, 181.67 +/- 9.71 AU, and 1.81 +/- 0.09% GDI in the gill tissue in the Summer. A significant positive correlation between Fe, Zn, Cu, Hg, Cr and Co accumulations and DNA damage parameters were reported in the present study. Besides, we reported firstly, that the electrochemical technique can be used successfully in the determination of trace metal concentrations in C. auratus. Consequently, obtained ecotoxicological data indicate that C. auratus constitutes a useful tool as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring the coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Hazelnut, which is one of the leading hard-shelled fruits grown in Turkey, is of great economic importance especially for the Eastern Black Sea region. In this study, hazelnut cultivated agricultural areas were determined using different data sets created with Sentinel-2 MSI satellite image bands and calculated indices dated 22 October, 2020. 5 data sets were produced by calculating the different plant indices included in the study. Giresun province Piraziz district has been selected as the study area. Random forest (RO) image classification method was used for the classification process. 7 different Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) types have been defined in the study area. For the first data set; selected Sentinel-2 MSI bands were classified by RO algorithm. In other data sets, respectively; added Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDVIre). The classification results of the 5 data sets were compared using the error matrix. According to the McNemar test results, it was seen that the differences in classification accuracy for each data set were not statistically significant. The overall accuracy calculated for dataset 1 was 98.98% and Kappa value was 0.98, higher than the other four datasets.

TI  - MOTIVES COMMON TO TURKIC PEOPLE IN KAZAKH TOPONYMIC LEGENDS*
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Toponymic legends, a subcategory of the legend genre in field of folklore, are valuable cultural heritage that reflect the cultural and historical significance of a place and are associated with the beliefs and stories of local people. Toponymic legends are stories hidden in the depths of place names. These legends shed light on the history and cultural context of the places they are named after. Serving as a reflection of a place's essence, toponymic legends nourish the fabric of geography, revealing the uniqueness of a region. Like an archaeolo-gist carrying the traces of history, they provide us with an unparalleled window to unravel the secrets of the past and understand the roots of local culture. However, this subcategory has not been sufficiently studied within the discipline of folklore. However, the study of toponymic legends contributes to the preservation and valorization of cultural heritage by providing scientific data in cultural, historical, linguistic, geographical and ecological fields. Moreover, the interrelationship between similar legends in different regions is an important means of comprehensively assessing the culture of a nation. This relationship sheds light on the internal harmony, national unity and historical depth of a spesific nation's traditional culture. The aim of the study is to provide a holistic perspective on Turkish culture through two toponymic legend texts from Kazakh Turks. The legends of "Kiz Kulesi" (Maiden's Tower) and "Kirk Kiz" (Forty Maidens) exist among both Kazakh Turks and other Turkish communities in the research sample. Both legends belong to the categorical subcategory of toponymic legends. When examined in terms of their motifs and narrative patterns, along with their texts, variants, and historical background, they show significant similarities. Furthermore, when the elements that constitute the narrative are analyzed and interpreted from the perspective of Turkish culture, it is determined that they possess intra-cultural consistency. The fact that Turkic communities, which have interacted with distant and different cultures, share the same legends with almost identical motifs, indicates the preservation of cultural unity. "Kirk Kiz" and "Kiz Kulesi" legends shed historical light on Turkish culture within the toponymic category. These legends, with their rich motifs and narrative elements, provide insights into the cultural heritage and historical background of the Turkish people. They serve as important cultural symbols, reflecting the deep-rooted traditions, beliefs, and values of the Turkish culture. Through the exploration of these legends, one can gain a deeper understanding of the historical, social, and cultural dynamics that have shaped the Turkish identity over time.

TI  - Merging Satellite and Gauge-Measured Precipitation Using LightGBM With an Emphasis on Extreme Quantiles
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the actual precipitation in space and time is critical in hydrological modeling applications, yet the spatial coverage with rain gauge stations is limited due to economic constraints. Gridded satellite precipitation datasets offer an alternative option for estimating the actual precipitation by covering uniformly large areas, albeit related estimates are not accurate. To improve precipitation estimates, machine learning is applied to merge rain gauge-based measurements and gridded satellite precipitation products. In this context, observed precipitation plays the role of the dependent variable, while satellite data play the role of predictor variables. Random forests are the dominant machine learning algorithm in relevant applications. In those spatial prediction settings, point predictions (mostly the mean or the median of the conditional distribution) of the dependent variable are issued. The aim of the manuscript is to solve the problem of probabilistic prediction of precipitation with an emphasis on extreme quantiles in spatial interpolation settings. Here we propose, issuing probabilistic spatial predictions of precipitation using light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). LightGBM is a boosting algorithm, highlighted by prize-winning entries in prediction and forecasting competitions. To assess LightGBM, we contribute a large-scale application that includes merging daily precipitation measurements in contiguous United States with PERSIANN and GPM-IMERG satellite precipitation data. We focus on extreme quantiles of the probability distribution of the dependent variable, where LightGBM outperforms quantile regression forests (a variant of random forests) in terms of quantile score at extreme quantiles. Our study offers an understanding of probabilistic predictions in spatial settings using machine learning.

TI  - Ye.I.Uchaev, M.V.Kharkevich UNTHINKABLE DOOMSDAY: POSTAPOCALYPTIC NATURE OF MODERN POLITICAL REALISM
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the relevance of political realism in the times when a total planet catastrophe is possible. According to Ye.Uchaev and M.Kharkevich's hypothesis, modern political realism is a post-apocalyptic di-rection of thought, which is based on the belief that a final state of the world has arrived. Therefore, now that human survival is under threat, realism could be rejected due to the denial of the postapocalyptic worldview, which histori-cally made realism possible, rather than external reasons. The article defines political realism as an approach towards international relations that assumes the inevitability of conflicts between multiple political actors. The authors claim that such an approach requires interpretation of time as infinite. Based on the works of Bruno Latour and Eric Voegelin, Uchaev and Kharkevich show that such a perception of time was formed at the turn of the Middle Ages and the New Age through the self-positioning of Mo-dernity as a post-apocalyptic era, and the state within the Modern era - as a post-apocalyptic subject. The study of the texts of modern political realism confirms the hypothesis about its post-apocalyptic nature. A consistent real-ist position is found only after the post-apocalyptic self-perception took root in Europe (roughly in the middle of the 17th century) as a result of the triumph of a sovereign state. The realist position is most clearly revealed in the concept of the balance of power of the late 17th-18th centuries. The authors who wrote before or on the eve of this turning point (Niccolo Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes) in their works turn to the apocalyptic-utopian horizon, where disuni-ty is transformed into political unity. In turn, the threat of the total nuclear war that emerged in the middle of the 20th century becomes an incentive for Hans Morgenthau, John Hertz and Reinhold Niebuhr to overcome realism and de-velop projects for global political reform. However, according to Uchaev and Kharkevich's conclusion, overcoming realism will remain incomplete until the problem of the political subject of global reform is resolved.

TI  - A Six-Year Prospective Study on Problem Drinking among Evacuees of the Great East Japan Earthquake: The Fukushima Health Management Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evacuees of the Great East Japan Earthquake have experienced adverse, long-term physical and psychological effects, including problem drinking. This study examined the risk and recovery factors for problem drinking among evacuees between fiscal years (FY) 2012 and 2017 using data on residents in the evacuation area from the Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey. With the FY 2012 survey as a baseline, a survey comprising 15,976 men and women was conducted in the evacuation area from FY 2013 to FY 2017, examining the risk and protective factors for problem drinking. Particularly, the Cutting down, Annoyed by criticism, Guilty feeling, and Eye-opener (CAGE) questionnaire was used to evaluate problem drinking. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to identify the risk and recovery factors of problem drinking. The findings indicated that the male gender, insufficient sleep, job change, trauma symptoms, mental illness, family financial issues, and heavy drinking (>= 4 drinks per day) were significant risk factors for the incidence of problem drinking among the evacuees. Furthermore, a high blood pressure diagnosis could exacerbate problem drinking among men, while younger age and a diabetes mellitus diagnosis could increase problem drinking among women. Trauma symptoms and heavy drinking inhibited recovery from problem drinking after the disaster. Understanding these factors can shape effective long-term intervention strategies to physically and psychologically support evacuees.

TI  - Methodology for the Classification of Types of Land Use in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico based on the Spectral Signature of Satellite Images and its Effect on the Rainfall Simulation with the WRF Model
T2  - COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In numerical models of the atmosphere, data on land use are considered as initialization data, therefore a current classification at the simulation date will allow the model an appropriate representation of the processes related to the radiation balance and the hydrological cycle of the study area. In the particular case of the Weather Research and Forecasting model, the default database uses a classification of 21 categories of land use type, based on MODIS satellite images between the years 2001-2005 with a spatial resolution of 500 meters, therefore these data are not considered current or applicable to recent events. This paper proposes a methodology to update the classification of types of land use in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico based on the analysis of the spectral signature of Landsat 8 satellite images and derived indices, as well as the statistical validation of its effect in the numerical simulation of rainfall with the WRF model.

TI  - Assessing the Fitness of Satellite Albedo Products for Monitoring Snow Albedo Trends
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of albedo trends over snow is essential to evaluate the consequences of the global snow cover retreat on Earth's energy budget. Satellite observations provide the best way to monitor these trends globally, but their uncertainty increases over snow. Besides, different products sometimes show diverging trends. A better assessment of the fitness of satellite products for monitoring snow albedo trends is needed. We analyze the consistency of black-sky albedo estimates from global long-term products over snow: advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-based (CLARA-A2.1, GLASS-v4.2), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based (MCD43C3-v6.1/v6, GLASS-v4.2), multiangle imaging spectro radiometer (MISR)-based (MIL3MLSN-v4), and multisensor (C3S-v1/v2). We use MCD43C3-6.1 as the reference based on a previous comparison against in situ measurements. CLARA-A2.1 is the one most consistent with MCD43C3, but has a low coverage in high latitudes and an artificial albedo decrease since 2015. The study shows the limitations of MIL3MLSN, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), and Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) multisensor products over snow. MIL3MLSN has a too-low coverage of albedo over snow. GLASS-AVHRR overestimates albedo in regions with seasonal snow due to delayed snowmelt and underestimates it in permanently snow-covered regions. GLASS-MODIS is more consistent with MCD43C3 at mid-latitudes, and also underestimates albedo in regions with permanent snow and has an increase in missing values after 2011. Both the GLASS datasets are temporally inconsistent with the other products. Despite the improvements from v1 to v2, C3S-v2 has the largest negative bias over snow and discontinuities in the transitions between sensors. The study evidences the difficulties of AVHRR products to provide stable snow albedo estimates in polar regions, particularly before 2000.

TI  - Central Russia heavy metal contamination model based on satellite imagery and machine learning br
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric heavy metal contamination is a real threat to human health. In this work, we examined several models trained on in situ data and indices got from satellite images. During 2018-2019, 281 samples of naturally growing mosses were collected in the Vladimir, Yaroslavl, and Moscow regions in Russia. The samples were analyzed using Neutron Activation Analysis to get the contamination levels of 18 heavy metals. The Google Earth Engine platform was used to calculate indices from satellite images that represent summarized information about sampling sites. Statistical and neural models were trained on in situ data and the indices. We focused on the classification task with 8 levels of contamination and used balancing techniques to extend the training data. Three approaches were tested: variations of gradient boosting, multilayer per-ceptron, and Siamese networks. All these approaches produced results with minute differences, making it difficult to judge which one is better in terms of accuracy and graphical outputs. Promising results were shown for 9 heavy metals with an overall accuracy exceeding 89%. Al, Fe, and Sb contamination was predicted for 3,000 and 12,100 grid nodes on a 500 km2 area in the Central Russia region for 2019 and 2020. The results, methods, and perspectives of the adopted approach of using satellite data together with machine learning for HM contamination prediction are presented.

TI  - Seasonal Dynamics of Vegetation in the Wetlands of the Lower Dniester NNP Based on Remote Data from the Landsat-8 Satellite
T2  - Hydrobiological Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the season of 2020, the vegetation dynamics of the wetlands in the Lower Dniester National Nature Park were examined using the indices NDVI dex) on the basis of Landsat-8 satellite remote sensing data. The results demonstrated that distribution of values throughout the vegetation season did not correspond to normal distribution, indicating variety of their habitat conditions. The vegetation development in spring was negatively affected by the pyrogenic factor, which formed some areas without vegetation and with poorly developed vegetation. Sharp increase in NDVI values in early summer occurred due to development of wetland ecosystems' edifier Phragmites australis, whose stems emerged from the pickle stage and developed a leaf lamina. In this period, the well-developed vegetation prevailed, its total area exceeded 97%. In autumn, the areas of the developed vegetation gradually decrease, whereas areas of the poorly developed increased. The results of the research showed effectiveness of remote sensing of wetland areas using NDVI and VCI to assess vegetation state; it also can be used for the purposes of the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of wetland ecosystems of the north-west Black Sea coastal area under increasing anthropogenic pressure and global climate change.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: the article continues the cycle of the author's publications on reincarnation in the cultures of indigenous peoples in comparison with the traditions of the Ob Ugrians. The subject of its consideration is the traditional worldview of the Forest Nenets living in area of Numto Lake. Objective: to identify the peculiarities of ideas related to reincarnation that have developed among the Forest Nenets of Numto in the context of Khanty and Nenets cultural contacts in this territory. Research materials: field materials of the author; published data from scientific articles and monographs. Results and novelty of the research: the author for the first time recorded and systematized the ideas and rituals of the Numto ethnographic group of the Forest Nenets, based on the belief in the reincarnation of tribal ancestors. The existence in their environment of the terms of reincarnation of the Kazym Khanty, as well as the absence of such customs among the Tundra Nenets and Forest Nenets of the Pur River gives us reason to believe that the traditions of reincarnation of the Numto Forest Nenets were formed under the influence of the Khanty culture. At the same time, they have distinctive features, most clearly manifested in the rituals of divination and customs associated with the naming of newborns.

TI  - Effect of the Synergetic Use of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, LiDAR and Derived Data in Land Cover Classification of a Semiarid Mediterranean Area Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification in semiarid areas is a difficult task that has been tackled using different strategies, such as the use of normalized indices, texture metrics, and the combination of images from different dates or different sensors. In this paper we present the results of an experiment using three sensors (Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI and LiDAR), four dates and different normalized indices and texture metrics to classify a semiarid area. Three machine learning algorithms were used: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron; Maximum Likelihood was used as a baseline classifier. The synergetic use of all these sources resulted in a significant increase in accuracy, Random Forest being the model reaching the highest accuracy. However, the large amount of features (126) advises the use of feature selection to reduce this figure. After using Variance Inflation Factor and Random Forest feature importance, the amount of features was reduced to 62. The final overall accuracy obtained was 0.91 & PLUSMN; 0.005 (alpha = 0.05) and kappa index 0.898 & PLUSMN; 0.006 (alpha = 0.05). Most of the observed confusions are easily explicable and do not represent a significant difference in agronomic terms.

TI  - A New Methodology to Assess Spatial Response Models for Satellite Imagers Using the Optical Design Parameters of a Generic Sensor as Independent Variables
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several types of analytic models are currently used to estimate the spatial response of satellite imagers, the accuracy of these models being critical for applications requiring precise knowledge about the spatial response of a given imager. The assessment of these models is complicated because the actual spatial response of an imager depends on its optical design, so evaluations based on a single kind of design are inherently biased. To reduce this bias, a new assessment methodology based on a generic imaging sensor is proposed; the key optical design parameters of this sensor are selected as independent variables, so the error of any spatial response model can be computed within a broad domain of possible optical designs. Assuming a generic sensor with an annular optical aperture and square detector elements, the optical factor Q and the aperture obstruction ratio e are selected as key design parameters, allowing the error of spatial response models to be computed in the ( Q, e) plane. This approach is used to assess the separable point spread function (PSF) model, which assumes that the PSF is equal to the product of two perpendicular line spread functions (LFSs), concluding that it is only valid when Q = 0.35 for PSF = 0.1. This methodology can be used to assess other types of spatial response models for different shapes of optical apertures and detect elements. We contend that our approach provides a standard assessment procedure that will help end users select the correct model for their specific application.

AB  - This study implemented an index-based approach to monitor drought in the Vu Gia - Thu Bon river basin using remote sensing data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing services. Landsat's time-series remote sensing data are effectively used to calculate various drought indices. In this investigation, we evaluated the performance of various remote sensing-based drought indices (RSDI) utilizing the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) computing platform. Results indicated that there was a significant correlation between RSDI and the in-situ Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) and the soil temperature. The empirical results of this study demonstrated the possible utility of remote sensing data in drought monitoring for data-scarce regions.

T2  - Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The WHO classification of melanocytic skin tumours published in 2018 describes a new classification with nine different pathways based on molecular driver mutations, localization, clinical context and solar damage. The dichotomous concept of benign (nevus) versus malignant (melanoma) is replaced by a gradual concept starting with a benign nevus with progression into low to high grade intermediate melanocytic lesions, called melanocytoma, and ending at melanoma. The current European recommendation is (re-)excision with 2-5mm margin of low grade melanocytoma and with 5-10mm margin of high grade melanocytoma. Low grade melanocytoma needs no follow-up. For high grade melanocytoma a follow-up for at least 5 years every 6 months is recommended. Routine sentinel node procedure is not indicated. If diagnosis melanoma cannot be ruled out the lesions have to be treated as melanoma. Correct classification of a melanocytoma is a diagnostic challenge, but of high importance for therapeutic choices and prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis poisonings among children are of public health concern. Existing evidence from the US and from four provinces in Canada (Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia) indicate an increase in pediatric cannabis-related poisonings since the legalization of cannabis. This study evaluates trends in cannabis-related poisoning pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in Canada and addresses a gap in literature by describing trends and context around cannabis edible-related poisoning cases using data from a Canadian sentinel surveillance system.METHODS: Mixed-methods using data from two administrative data sources and one injury/poisoning sentinel surveillance system to estimate age-specific rates of cannabis-related poisonings ED visits (Ontario and Alberta), edible-related events (sentinel surveillance Canada), and hospitalizations (Canada with the exception of Quebec) among children between the ages of 0 to 11 from 2015/2016 to 2021. Annual absolute changes were calculated to quantify the magnitude of change between each age-specific rate. Joinpoint regression was used for trend analysis. A thematic analysis was completed to gain a better understanding of cannabis edible-related poisoning cases in the ED.RESULTS: The pediatric age-specific rates for cannabis-related poisoning ED visits (average annual percent change (AAPC) Ontario: 98.2%, 95% CI: 79.1, 119.2; AAPC Alberta: 57.4%, 95% CI: 36.7, 81.2), hospitalizations (AAPC: 63.4%, 95% CI: 42.0, 87.9) and cannabis edible-related events (AAPC: 122.8%, 95% CI: 64.0, 202.6) increased significantly from 2015 to 2021. Almost half of all pediatric edible-related events involved gummy edible products (48.8%, n=143). Based on the thematic analysis, 88% cannabis edible-related events were attributed to inadvertent ingestion due to access to such products or lack of safe storage practices.CONCLUSION: Age-specific rates of cannabis-related poisoning ED visits (Ontario and Alberta) and hospitalizations (Canada with the exception of Quebec) have increased since cannabis legalization, with the largest increase in rates occurring from 2019 to 2020. A similar increase in the rate of cannabis edible-related cases from sentinel surveillance data underscores the importance of monitoring this outcome. Public health messaging and national public health promotion strategies targeted towards raising awareness on the risks associated with consuming illegal cannabis and safe storage of cannabis could help mitigate cannabis poisonings among children.

TI  - Sentinel-2 60-m Band Super-Resolution Using Hybrid CNN-GPR Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 image super-resolution (SR) has proven advantageous in multiple data analysis pipelines, leading to a more comprehensive assessment of different environment-related metrics. This research aims to provide a method for super-resolving the 60-m bands provided by Sentinel-2 up to 10-m spatial resolution, using Gaussian process regression (GPR). While common GPR methods directly operate on raw data using carefully designed kernels, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature extraction kernel to directly process the input 10-m patches, applied in constructing the elements of the integrated covariance matrices. For each scene, a small number of training patches are sampled to optimize the CNN parameters and to construct the predictive mean function, the latter being further used for predicting super-resolved pixels for new input areas. We prove that our method is a reliable SR mechanism by assessing its performance both quantitatively, using metrics against other methods from literature, and qualitatively, through visual analysis of the results.

TI  - A CNN-Based Sentinel-2 Image Super-Resolution Method Using Multiobjective Training
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning methods have become ubiquitous tools in many Earth observation applications, delivering state-of-the-art results while proving to generalize for a variety of scenarios. One such domain concerns the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission, which provides multispectral images in the form of 13 spectral bands, captured at three different spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 m. This research aims to provide a super-resolution mechanism based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for upsampling the low-resolution (LR) spectral bands of S2 up to 10-m spatial resolution. Our approach is centered on attaining good performance with respect to two main properties: consistency and synthesis. While the synthesis evaluation, also known as Wald's protocol, has spoken for the performance of almost all previously introduced methods, the consistency property has been overlooked as a viable evaluation procedure. Recently introduced techniques make use of sensor's modulation transfer function (MTF) to learn an approximate inverse mapping from LR to high-resolution images, which is on a direct path for achieving a good consistency value. To this end, we propose a multiobjective loss for training our architectures, including an MTF-based mechanism, a direct input-output mapping using synthetically degraded data, along with direct similarity measures between high-frequency details from already available 10-m bands, and super-resolved images. Experiments indicate that our method is able to achieve a good tradeoff between consistency and synthesis properties, along with competitive visual quality results.

TI  - REDUCTION OF ROMANTIC WOMEN'S WRITING IN A.K. GERTSYK'S TEXT "HISTORY OF A FRIENDSHIP (BETTINA BRENTANO AND KAROLINA VON GUNDERRODE)"
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the text of the Russian poetess of the Silver Age Adelaida Gertsyk "The Story of a Friendship (Bettina Brentano and Karoline v. Gunderrode)", first published in 1915 in the second issue of the journal "Northern Notes". Gertsyk's reconstruction of the friendship between Bettina Brentano and Karoline von Gunderrode looks like a translation of fragments from Bettina von Arnim's novel Gunderode (1840), accompanied by an introduction and commentary. However, Gertsyk's text is a compilation of quotations from two novels by the romantic writer: Goethe's Correspondence with a Child and Gunderode. Gertsyk makes a significant reduction of the novel Gunderode, its volume, problems, narrative practice of romantic women's writing. Gertsyk eliminates the dialogue between Bettina and Karoline, which is the basis of equal interaction, a means of knowing oneself and the other. The article analyzes the problems of writing discussed by Bettina and Karoline in the novel Gunderode. The romantic understanding of friendship is compared with the image of friendship between two romantic writers, made of Adelaida Gertsyk. The Christian foundations of the worldview of Bettina von Arnim are revealed, which determine the problematics of the relationship between Self, You and Others. Self-determination in the novel Gunderode is associated with the independence of thinking and perception of the world. The social significance of Bettina's book lies in the protest not only against stereotypes regarding the gender role of women, but also against other prejudices of contemporary German society, including its anti-Semitism. In comparison with Bettina's book, Gertsyk's text is a significant reduction of romantic women's writing, both at the level of problems, and at the level of structure and narrative features.

CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - Humans are reshaping the Earth. Not just the climate of Earth, but the planet itself. As the Earth warms due to human interference with the climate, the oceans absorb this extra heat and glaciers and ice sheets melt, causing the oceans to rise. Covering more than two thirds of the planet's surface, it means the rising oceans are literally changing the shape of the planet we call home. Since the early 1990s, a series of satellites (e.g., TOPEX-Poseidon, followed by Jason-1, Jason-2, and then Jason-3) has captured this change with remarkable accuracy. Built to measure changes in sea level, these satellites have revolutionized our understanding of the oceans, especially how the oceans store and redistribute heat around the planet, and now provide one of the most important records of how fast our climate is changing. The unprecedented success of these missions has led to the development of the Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 Mission, under a US-European collaboration, that will ensure another full decade of sea level observations. This mission includes two satellites launched 5 years apart, with the first satellite Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich launched in November 2020. In the beginning of the altimetry era, the largest uncertainties had to do with orbit determination, more recently things like radiometer stability have become important and perhaps the current and ongoing technical issues have more to do with increasing resolution and temporal sampling. This paper will summarize the history and evolution of the science, mission and technology development and programmatic mechanisms fueled by a global collaboration to achieve and sustain this crucial and unprecedented climate data record.

T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Long intervals between detection of breast cancer and therapy initiation may affect the prognosis and survival of patients.Aim. To identify the psychological factors behind the delay between noticing large breast lumps and seeking specialized medical care.Materials and methods. The study included a total of 154 women from Chelyabinsk city and Chelyabinsk region aged 32 to 80 years (mean age 54.1) with breast cancer of different stages. All the breast cancer patients were under supervision of an oncologist for up to 6 months from the moment of diagnosis. The following research methods were used: test method and mathematical methods for data analysis. We used such measuring techniques as the World Assumptions Scale (WAS), the Purpose in Life Test (PIL), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), Hardiness Survey, and the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used as a statistical method.Results. Breast cancer patients who delayed presentation for diagnosis and treatment had a more positive worldview. They used a wider range of coping strategies, they showed more pronounced components of learned helplessness such as motivation and cognitive element and they had stronger internal locus of control, in comparison to women who presented at the first sign of breast cancer.Conclusion. The findings of the study highlight the psychological reasons for delay in seeking medical help among women with breast cancer after large breast lumps have been detected.

TI  - Impact of Yucatan Channel Subsurface Velocity Observations on the Gulf of Mexico State Estimates
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) surface circulation variability is dominated by the Loop Current (LC) and the episodically released anticyclonic Loop Current eddies (LCEs). The Yucatan Current feeds the LC through the Yucatan Channel (YC), and its flow structure at the YC is hypothesized to affect the LC evolution critically. This study examines the impact of assimilating YC subsurface velocity observations from a tall mooring array across the YC on the GoM circulation. State estimates and forecasts of the LC circulation were produced using a regional implementation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and its adjoint-based four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) assimilation system. The estimates were constrained by combinations of the YC observations and satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST). The results show that assimilation of both moored and satellite data improves the model hindcasts and forecasts for all LC phases. Additionally, one realization of the state estimate that assimilates only moored data matches the LCE detachment timing with that of AVISO SSH. Observations from the moorings close to the Yucatan Peninsula significantly impact the LCE detachment. A finite-time Lyapunov exponent analysis reveals the differences among the assimilation experiments, such as eddylike structures intruding into the GoM through the YC, and its relation to the typical LC sudden growth. Finally, an adjoint sensitivity analysis is used to verify the dynamic link between the LC extension and the intrusion of eddylike structures into the GoM.

TI  - Identification of Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Salinity Fronts along the California Coast: Application Using Saildrone and Satellite Derived Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling regions are one of the most dynamic areas of the world's oceans. The California and Baja California Coasts are impacted by both coastal upwelling and the California Current, leading to frontal activity that is captured by gradients in both Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Satellite data are a great source of spatial data to study fronts. However, biases near coastal areas and coarse resolutions can impair its usefulness in upwelling areas. In this work gradients in SST from NASA Multi-Scale Ultra-High Resolution (MUR) and in two SSS products derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) NASA mission are compared directly with gradients derived from the Saildrone uncrewed vehicles to validate the gradients as well as to assess their ability to detect known frontal features. The three remotely sensed data sets (MURSST/JPL, SMAP SSS/RSS, SMAP SSS) were co-located with the Saildrone data prior to the calculation of the gradients. Wavelet analysis is used to determine how well the satellite derived SST and SSS products are reproducing the Saildrone derived gradients. Overall results indicate the remote sensing products are reproducing features of known areas of coastal upwelling. Differences between the SST and SSS gradients are mainly associated with the limitations of the microwave derived SSS coverage near land and its reduced spatial resolution. The results are promising for using remote sensing data sets to monitor frontal structure along the California Coast and the application to long term changes in coastal upwelling and dynamics.

TI  - Girls Don acute accent t Already Want To Be Princesses! Informal Learning, Toys Advertising and Gender Construction in Early Childhood
T2  - PEDAGOGIA SOCIAL REVISTA INTERUNIVERSITARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass media has become a main socialization agency in recent years. From a critical literacy approach, the present research aims to analyze printed toys advertising from a gender perspective, since it acts as a diffuser of social and cultural models that childhood assumes uncritically and that can lead to discriminatory situations of inequality between men and women. The principal source for this research was taken the images present in the toy catalogs of the main commercial houses, which analyzed by a content analysis through the documental interpretation. In this way, the following categories considered: protagonists, types of toys, representation spheres and social functions and interactions. The results ob- tained show a change with respect to female protagonism, since their presence has increased considerably. However, the worldview they transmit shows a very traditional pattern and a very marked gender segregation. Thus, in the social functions represented in these catalogs, the femininity model is associated with motherhood-domesticity-beauty, and the masculinity model linked to the figure of the breadwinner (provider) -active, strong,...-. Based on these results, it can be concluded that this advertising is still far from coeducational purposes and makes it difficult to achieve democratic and equal citizenship.

AB  - Remote sensing is a tool based on acquiring images of objects at a distance. The distance to the object is a determining factor, conditioning the strength of the analysis, and it can be reduced with lower flights and longer flight missions. Still, there is a physical limit depending on the type of platform used. In this way, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) allow images to be obtained with a higher spatial resolution, as they can fly only a few metres above the ground. Therefore, they have become a very useful platform as they have democratised field imaging technology, offering greater versatility in obtaining spectral information due to their small size and significantly reduced costs compared to traditional aerial platforms. In this way, several authors have conducted comparative studies on the suitability of different platforms for remote sensing data collection in viticulture; however, there is a lack of information about the image processing workflows. In the framework of the FlexiGroBots project, methodologies for analysing the spatial variability of different factors affecting the crop are being explored, and the automation of processes is a key factor that has proven their applicability.In this article, the suitability of carrying out two different workflows for image processing is analysed: i) a manual workflow, which involves specific steps with human intervention and considers software traditionally used by pilots and remote sensing technicians, and ii) an automated workflow in Python, which allows image processing to be carried out with little or no human intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE.: To analyze and explore the myths and beliefs about insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus and their family caregivers from a general hospital in northern Peru in 2020.MATERIALS AND METHODS.: This qualitative study used a thematic analysis model, following the interpretative paradigm. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records. Patients with diabetes that used some type of insulin for at least three months prior to the study were interviewed, as well as their family caregivers. Patients participated in a focus group and in-depth interviews; family caregivers participated only in in-depth interviews.RESULTS.: Twelve patients with diabetes (11 with type 2 diabetes mellitus) were included; six in the focus group and six in the in-depth interviews. Seven family caregivers were included. After analysis, we obtained four categories: 1) beliefs related to starting insulin treatment: treatment of choice after failure of other drugs, cures diabetes, regulates sugar, fear of injectables; 2) beliefs related to treatment adherence: decompensation for not using insulin, insulin is necessary to live; 3) beliefs related to alternative therapies and cost: use of alternative therapies, high cost of insulin; and 4) myths related to the use of insulin: generates dependence, dependence for insulin administration, negative effects of insulin.CONCLUSIONS.: The beliefs and myths of patients treated with insulin arise from the beginning of treatment, remain throughout the course of treatment, and are often reinforced by the worldview of family members.

TI  - AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data for biomass modeling: from ground plot selection to forest species recognition
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is an important biophysical parameter, which delivers vital and valuable information about forest health, growth, productivity, carbon cycle monitoring, forest degradation, and its ecosystem. It is an important inconstant for ecological modeling, carbon stock assessment, and climate change. Forest biomass estimation has been progressively investigated, in which the accuracy of results is good enough to estimate accuracy of biomass; therefore, more accurate estimation of biomass is important for refining the precision and its applicability of these techniques. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides more accurate information about vegetation, so with the combination of advanced hyperspectral datasets it may be a better technique to enhance the results and accuracy of spatial biomass. Airborne hyperspectral data of airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer-next generation data were demonstrated to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) of a tropical dry deciduous forest. Atmospherically resistant vegetation index, simple ratio index (SRI), normalized difference vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used to estimate AGB, in which EVI performs better than other vegetation indices with 0.55 R square value. Plant senescence reflectance index was used to estimate the dry and senescence condition of the forest and its correlations were performed with ground biomass and other vegetation indices.

TI  - New LiDAR-Based Elevation Model Shows Greatest Increase in Global Coastal Exposure to Flooding to Be Caused by Early-Stage Sea-Level Rise
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest projections indicate that sea-level rise (SLR) is certain to exceed 2 m in coming centuries, and a rise by 4 m is considered possible. Radar-based land elevation models applied to date suggest that the increase of area below mean sea level, that is potentially exposed to permanent flooding, will accelerate as SLR proceeds, being relatively limited initially. However, applying new and more accurate satellite LiDAR elevation data we find the opposite pattern, with the fastest increase in the area of exposed land occurring in the early stages of SLR. In one-third of countries most of this increase will be caused by the first meter of SLR and in nearly all within the first 2 m. We conclude that in many regions the time available to prepare for increased exposure to flooding may be considerably less than assumed to date, and that better elevation data will support timely preparations. The global LiDAR lowland DTM (GLL_DTM_v2) elevation data set developed for this assessment is available in the public domain.

TI  - EFFECTIVENESS OF USING THE BED FUND AND HUMAN RESOURCES FOR PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO CHILDREN WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASES.
T2  - Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim: Retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of the use of beds and human resources for the treatment of children with respiratory diseases in hospitals in the period 2008-2021.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We calculated indicators that characterize the efficiency of the use of bed and personnel resources: the density of beds per 10,000, the rate of hospitalized children per 10,000 (RH per 10,000), the bed occupancy rate per year (BOR), average length of stay (ALOS), full-time positions (FTP) per 100,000, number of beds per 1 FTP of doctors.RESULTS: Results: During 2008-2021, there was a significant decrease in the density of all types of beds. The percentage of hospitalized children for inpatient treatment decreased, BOR decreased, and ALOS decreased. The density of full-time positions of allergists increased by +23.78%, pediatricians by +4.86%, pulmonologists decreased by -13.15%. In 2021, there were 10.31 beds for 1 FTP of an allergist, 12.8 beds for 1 FTP of a pulmonologist, and 5.83 beds for 1 FTP of a pediatrician. According to the correlation matrix, it was established that the more beds there are for 1 full-time position of a pediatrician and 1 full-time position of an allergist, the longer the ALOS and the bed occupancy rate are.CONCLUSION: Conclusions: When planning staffing of health care institutions, it is necessary to mind the level of urbanization of the region, and ensure status of the general practitioner as a leading medical specialist responsible for medical care during the first meeting with the patient and his subsequent follow-up.

TI  - Novel Vegetation Mapping Through Remote Sensing Images Using Deep Meta Fusion Model
T2  - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance is essential in current environmental conditions. It is challenging to determine vegetation using traditional map classification approaches. The primary issue in detecting vegetation pattern is that it appears with complex spatial structures and similar spectral properties. It is more demandable to determine the multiple spectral ana-lyses for improving the accuracy of vegetation mapping through remotely sensed images. The proposed framework is developed with the idea of ensembling three effective strategies to produce a robust architecture for vegetation mapping. The architecture comprises three approaches, feature-based approach, region-based approach, and texture-based approach for classifying the vegetation area. The novel Deep Meta fusion model (DMFM) is created with a unique fusion frame-work of residual stacking of convolution layers with Unique covariate features (UCF), Intensity features (IF), and Colour features (CF). The overhead issues in GPU utilization during Convolution neural network (CNN) models are reduced here with a lightweight architecture. The system considers detailing feature areas to improve classification accuracy and reduce processing time. The proposed DMFM model achieved 99% accuracy, with a maximum processing time of 130 s. The training, testing, and validation losses are degraded to a significant level that shows the performance quality with the DMFM model. The system acts as a standard analysis platform for dynamic datasets since all three different fea-tures, such as Unique covariate features (UCF), Intensity features (IF), and Colour features (CF), are considered very well.

AB  - Phenology of crops is the study of specific stages in crop life cycles. Understanding the phenological changes of crops is vital for crop mapping and to monitor the impact of climate change on the crop cycle. The traditional remote sensing data processing method for large-scale spatial and temporal data analysis is complicated in both space and time. For reliable monitoring and analysis of vegetation dynamics as well as the extraction of sensitive crop phenology variables, it is necessary to aggregate massive datasets with high temporal resolution. The current state of research in this topic is restricted by the need for long-term, high temporal resolution multispectral data collection and processing. Cloud computing technology has advanced and the platforms like Google Earth Engine are now available for cloud-based big spatial data analysis and processing, leveraging the Big Geospatial data-cube paradigm. GEE datacubes can be used to meet the computational and big data resource organization needed for long-term agricultural phenology extraction in a virtual server platform. Variations in the average temperature and other factors, such as rainfall, have affected the phenology of the wheat crop in Madhya Pradesh. Establishing effective and efficient agricultural methods, as well as for controlling water and nutrients, projecting yields, and managing crops, all depend heavily on the crop calendar and phenological parameters that were retrieved. This study has been conducted to extract and analyze changes in the wheat phenology parameters in order to better comprehend the impact of temperature stress on the wheat crop calendar. This study uses the Landsat 8 multispectral dataset, which has a geographical resolution of 30 m, to examine changes in wheat phenology over the course of five succeeding crop seasons. The phenological metrics extracted include the Early vegetative state, anthesis state, physiological maturity state, length of cropping season, asymmetry, green-up slope, and brown down slope. This study also offers two new perspectives for further work: the first is on crop classification using phenological criteria, and the second is a comprehensive methodology for monitoring crop phenology changes in contexts of impending climatic changes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is taking place faster, and urban air temperatures are gradually rising in all cities across the world. Uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization leads to constant environmental threats and can alter local and regional climates. According to the survey published by Economist Intelligence Unit, in India, Keralas Malappuram district ranks first among the fastest-growing urban areas globally, with a 44.05% growth rate. Hence, the present study aims to identify the hotspot regions of extreme heat within the Malappuram urban agglomeration region and suggest strategies for its improvement. The split-window algorithm retrieved land surface temperature (LST) for 1991, 1998, 2014, and 2020 using Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 satellite imageries. A rising trend in LST has been detected in the last 30 years, and the mean value has increased by 1.70 & DEG;C within the region. Among the selected hotspots, an LST increase of 1.84 & DEG;C was observed for those areas with the highest increase in urban density with decreased vegetation. The increasing impact of urbanization and the subsequent change in land use patterns at the cost of greenery have caused a substantial effect on the local climate. Accordingly, planning and policy directions are proposed for the local government that can help provide awareness to the people through the effective implementation of mitigation measures.

TI  - An assessment of the effects of DEM quality and spatial resolution on a model for mapping lahar inundation areas at volc?an Copahue (Argentina & Chile)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lahars are debris flows originating at volcanoes with very erosive and destructive capabilities. Lahars constitute a serious hazard for the communities close to the Volc ' an Copahue, lying at the Argentina-Chile border. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of the geographic information system (GIS) assisted model LAHARZ to the spatial resolution and quality of the digital elevation models (DEMs) for mapping lahar inundation areas within the context of Volc ' an Copahue. In addition, critical lahar volumes required to reach the nearby settlements are investigated, following a literature review to characterize plausible triggering mechanisms. We compared lahar inundation areas at the four main catchments of Volc ' an Copahue resulting from five DEMs: three 30-m spatial resolution datasets (SRTM, ASTER and AW3D30), the 12-m WorldDEMTM, and a 5-m DEM derived from SPOT-7 data. Our sensitivity analysis shows that DEM spatial resolution and quality precipitate into the LAHARZ results. The interaction between the spatial resolution and the channel confinement constitutes the main control of the output geometries. Higher-spatial resolution DEMs (i.e. smaller pixel size) better depict channels and better define confined channels zones resulting in narrower output areas and longer runouts. For the same volume, the inundation areas obtained using the 5- and 12-m pixel DEMs are narrower and 2-3 km longer than when derived from any of the 30-m DEMs. At unconfined channels, LAHARZ is less sensitive to the spatial resolution and inundation areas tend to show ragged edges regardless of the input DEM. The quality of the DEM controls the inundation trajectories. These results highlight the importance of evaluating topographic models for LAHARZ simulations before the implementation of the model for hazard mapping. Our results suggest that lahars of volumes of 105-106 m3 would reach the nearest villages within a radius of 15 km from the volcano. More work is required to improve the knowledge on lahar deposits and in turn hazard assessment.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Machine Intelligence for GeoAnalytics and Remote Sensing (MIGARS)

AB  - Detection of landslide-prone areas plays an important role in planning urban connectivity like roads, bridges, etc. Landslides are generally caused by a variety of factors, the most important of which is rainfall. In this paper, the detection is carried out in four taluks of Chikkamagaluru district, namely Koppa, Sringeri, Mudigere, and Narashimarajpur; these four taluks are located in the Western Ghat region. Landslides are primarily caused by heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. For the detection of landslides, Sentinel optical and SAR data are used because of their 10-metre resolution and revisiting period of two to five days. The entire methodology for detecting landslides is carried out in Google Earth Engine due to its large collection of data, which aids in multi-temporal studies. This paper attempts to investigate the capabilities of remote sensing and GIS techniques in the detection of landslides. For the detection of landslides, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used for Sentinel-2 data and the SAR backscatter change approach is used for Sentinel-1 images, and I-ratio thresholding is applied to both methods to detect areas where landslides had occurred. The main thing is that no previous landslide inventory data is used for detection. The previous landslide inventory is used for validation purposes only. Finally, the performance of both approaches was compared using accuracy assessment properties such as overall accuracy and kappa coefficient to determine which approach is superior.

T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article introduces into scientific circulation and for the first time examines the marginalia of I.A. Bunin at the "Collection of Poems" (1927) by V.F. Khodasevich from the funds of the Russian Archive of Leeds (RAL). A comprehensive analysis of the marginalia of I. Bunin, undertaken by the authors of the article, allows to clarify both the aesthetic and general poetic principles of I. Bunin himself, and his attitude to the poetry of V. Khodasevich. As a result of the study, conclusions were made that in his marginalia I. Bunin appears as a traditionalist advocating for classical aesthetic orientation. He does not accept the symbolist worldview and modernist poetics, the mixing of prosaism and poetism, reduced "physiological" imagery, the use of heterogeneous lexical and stylistic layers. It is these characteristic features of V. Khodasevich's poetry that cause the negative attitude of I. Bunin, which is reflected in his marks and comments. The negative marginalia of I. Bunin are also associated with the biographical context of V. Khodasevich's poems, which is not always "read" by I. Bunin, as well as with allusions to the poetry of A. Bely and A. Blok.

T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The patterns of seasonal phytoplankton variability in the Caspian Sea were studied using the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua scanners. The chlorophyll "a" (CHL) concentration in the Caspian Sea was calculated by the regional algorithm developed using the data of in situ measurements in different seasons of the year. Average monthly CHL maps over a twenty-year period and seasonal dynamics diagrams were constructed for the Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian Sea areas. The seasonal phytoplankton variability were analyzed using the CHL data. The fundamental differences were noted in the seasonal phytoplankton variability in the Northern, Middle, and Southern Caspian areas. The spatial CHL trends throughout the Caspian Sea related to the seasonal succession of phytoplankton were studied. The years with considerable seasonal CHL deviations from the average climatic trends were identified. The possible causes of abnormal phenomena in the development of phytoplankton identified by remote sensing data are considered.

T2  - 2023 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP, SSP
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
CL  - VNU Univ Engn & Technol, Hanoi, VIETNAM
AB  - The advanced payload technology has opened up a new way to design future NGSO satellite systems exploiting the full flexibility in radio resource and beam coverage management. Conventional spatial multiplexing techniques, which require the CSI, however, cannot be efficiently applied in NGSO due to long round-trip time(RTT). In this paper, we tackle the long RTT in the precoding design by proposing a joint channel prediction and dynamic radio resource management framework. Our aim is to optimize the bandwidth and transmit power in every spot beam based on the predicted channel gains to maximize the system capacity. Since the satellite's orbit is time-varying but predictable, Kalman filter-based channel estimation method is employed. Given the predicted channels, a joint bandwidth allocation and precoding design is formulated. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via practical satellite channel models using the STK software and 3GPP codebook- and non-codebook-based precoding designs.

TI  - Mapping Tropical Forest Cover and Deforestation with Planet NICFI Satellite Images and Deep Learning in Mato Grosso State (Brazil) from 2015 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes in tree cover for assessment of deforestation is a premise for policies to reduce carbon emission in the tropics. Here, a U-net deep learning model was used to map monthly tropical tree cover in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso between 2015 and 2021 using 5 m spatial resolution Planet NICFI satellite images. The accuracy of the tree cover model was extremely high, with an F1-score >0.98, further confirmed by an independent LiDAR validation showing that 95% of tree cover pixels had a height >5 m while 98% of non-tree cover pixels had a height <5 m. The biannual map of deforestation was then built from the monthly tree cover map. The deforestation map showed relatively consistent agreement with the official deforestation map from Brazil (67.2%) but deviated significantly from Global Forest Change (GFC)'s year of forest loss, showing that our product is closest to the product made by visual interpretation. Finally, we estimated that 14.8% of Mato Grosso's total area had undergone clear-cut logging between 2015 and 2021, and that deforestation was increasing, with December 2021, the last date, being the highest. High-resolution imagery from Planet NICFI in conjunction with deep learning techniques can significantly improve the mapping of deforestation extent in tropical regions.

TI  - Seafloor Habitat Mapping by Combining Multiple Features From Optic and Acoustic Data: A Case Study From Ganquan Island, South China Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seafloor habitat mapping plays an important role in marine environment monitoring and marine geological research. Optic and acoustic remote sensing are becoming common survey tools in seafloor habitat mapping. However, a single acoustic or optic technique may have a limited detection range and be more susceptible to the impact of image quality. Additionally, it is challenging to satisfy the requirements for accurate detection since single-source data cannot fully reflect the substrate distribution characteristics. This article developed a method for detecting coastal seafloor habitats through the fusion of multiscale optics and acoustics data. First, the original feature set was composed of multispectral satellite data and bathymetric data by multibeam echo sounder and airborne light detection and ranging at different scales, which improved the capacity to represent feature information. Then, a ReliefF-mRMR method was implemented to select optimal features with appropriate scales and remove redundant features. Finally, the optimal features were employed in model training and classification of several supervised classifiers to verify the effectiveness of the strategy. The developed method was applied to the Ganquan Island survey in the South China Sea. The results demonstrated that, after integrating multisource data, the accuracies were up to 3.31% and 17.28% higher than those obtained using multispectral data or bathymetric data alone, respectively. ReliefF-mRMR exhibited better performance than other feature selection methods. The average coral coverage in the study area was estimated to range from 70.85% to 80.33%. This research highlights the greater potential of multisource data for precisely detecting seafloor habitats.

TI  - NOISY TENSOR COMPLETION VIA ORIENTATION INVARIANT TUBAL NUCLEAR NORM
T2  - PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Noisy tensor completion is considered for reconstructing multi-way data from a small fraction of noisy observations caused by many practical reasons such as sensor dead pixels, communication loss, electromagnetic interferences, etc., and can provide a powerful pre-processing tool for subsequent tasks like classification, unmixing, and target detection in many remote sensing applications. Thanks to the capability to simultaneously model multi-orientational spectral low-rankness, the recently proposed Orientation Invariant Tubal Nuclear Norm (OITNN) empirically outperforms traditional tensor nuclear norms in tensor recovery tasks. However, its theoretical and empirical performance for noisy tensor completion is still insufficiently explored. To further unleash and understand the modeling potential of OITNN, this paper formulates an OITNN penalized least squares estimator for noisy tensor completion and studies its statistical and empirical performance. We compute the proposed estimator using an ADMM-based algorithm and rigorously characterize the statistical performance by establishing an upper bound on the estimation error. Simulation studies on nine different types of remote sensing data demonstrate the effectiveness of the OITNN for noisy tensor completion.

TI  - Ventilation analysis of urban functional zoning based on circuit model in Guangzhou in winter, China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively alleviating the urban thermal environment is an important problem faced by modern urban environment optimization. This paper predicts the land surface temperature (LST) of Guangzhou based on the whale intelligence optimization algorithm. The circuit model is used to analyze the urban ventilation distribution, and the contribution of wind resistance and ventilation effect to LST is examined. We attempt to explore the relationship between the two in combination with urban functional zoning. Results showed that the temperature range of >34.C in winter in Guangzhou increased by 49.13% from 1990 to 2030. Guangzhou has four main wind resistances in the ventilation direction, and the areas with large wind resistance are located in high-rise buildings or densely-built areas. The pearl river basin is the main urban ventilation corridor in Guangzhou. The ventilation coefficient is between 0.560 and 1.605, due to the poor ventilation in the central city. Interestingly, the overall contribution rate of urban ventilation and wind resistance to LST reaches 11.09%. Urban functional areas have a significant influence on LST. We found that the temperature in commercial land and transportation land is high, and the proportion of temperature ranges above 34. C in the functional areas reaches 57% and 22%. This research can provide new insights into the mitigation of the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Phenology Alignment-Based PolSAR Crop Classification Considering Polarimetric Statistical and Time-Varying Curve Characteristics
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The uncertainty of crop phenological cycle is an important issue in crop classification with time series polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. The time series alignment algorithm represented by dynamic time warping (DTW) can supply a potential solution, which realigns curves based on shape matching, dealing with the distortion of feature curves caused by uncertain crop phenological development. However, previous studies mainly focused on shape characteristics of time-varying feature curves, which is hard to comprehensively evaluate the similarity degree of crop phenological cycles. Furthermore, it ignored the differences in scattering signal and polarimetric statistical distribution of crops, which limited the accuracy of crop classification. In this letter, a novel crop classification method based on phenology alignment is proposed. First, the dual-branch time series alignment method is proposed, including the time-weighted DTW (TWDTW) alignment and the Wishart distance-based TWDTW (WD-TWDTW) alignment, which combines the feature curve characteristics and the polarimetric statistical information to correctly describe the similarity degree of phenological cycles. Second, a multi-similarity measure (including shape similarity, feature similarity, and polarimetric similarity) is defined to improve capacity of crop discrimination. The multisimilarity measure can describe the differences of crop types from three aspects, including crop growth trend, growth status, and statistical distribution. The proposed method is evaluated with time series full-polarization Radarsat-2 data in Flevoland area. The results show that our method is superior to traditional method with single TWDTW alignment and shape similarity, and the corresponding overall accuracy (OA) is improved by 6%.

TI  - Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval Based on DPC Onboard GaoFen-5 (02) Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-5 (02) (GF5-02) is a new Chinese operational satellite that was launched on 7 September 2021. The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is one of the main payloads and is mainly used for the remote sensing monitoring of atmospheric components such as aerosols and water vapor. At present, the DPC is in the stage of on-orbit testing, and no public DPC precipitable water vapor (PWV) data are available. In this study, a PWV retrieval algorithm based on the spectral characteristics of DPC data is developed. The algorithm consists of three parts: (1) the construction of the lookup table, (2) the calculation of water vapor absorption transmittance (WVAT) in the band at 910 nm, and (3) DPC PWV retrieval. The global PWV results derived from DPC data are spatially continuous, which can illustrate the global distribution of water vapor content well. The validation based on the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) PWV data shows that the DPC PWV data have accuracy similar to that of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) PWV data, with coefficient correlation of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), and relative error (RE) of 0.32, 0.30, and 0.93 using the DPC and 0.23, 0.36, and 0.96 using the MODIS, respectively. The results show that our proposed DPC PWV retrieval algorithm is feasible and has high accuracy. By analyzing the errors, we found that the calibration coefficients of the DPC in the 865 nm and 910 nm bands need to be updated.

TI  - Cloud-Target Calibration for Fengyun-3D MERSI-II Solar Reflectance Bands: Model Development and Instrument Stability
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative calibration of satellite spectral radiometers is essential for their downstream applications. The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II) is a key instrument of the Chinese polar orbit Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite. However, its calibration performance has not been sufficiently studied, which limits its broad application. This study revealed the feasibility of a cloud-target method for assessing the MERSI-II calibration performance in solar bands. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances for six MERSI-II reflective solar bands (RSBs) were numerically simulated using a rigorous forward radiative transfer method and cloud properties from well-collocated and well-calibrated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational cloud products with strict constraints. Only ice cloud targets were examined in the collocation due to their better homogeneity. The excellent agreement between our simulated reflectance and the MODIS reflectance (relative differences (RDs) of over 90% are within a 5% uncertainty range in six bands) validates our models. The simulated results in MERSI-II bands 1-4 showed reasonable agreements with the MERSI-II operational reflectance, i.e., mean RDs <3%, while the RDs in bands 6 and 7 reaches 12% and 6%, respectively. Our systematic cloud-target-calibration results over three years (2019-2021) indicated clear seasonal calibration biases and signal degradation of the MERSI-II solar bands, and those in the two cloud-absorbing bands, which reached similar to 15% and similar to 12% (in the three years), respectively. More importantly, we removed these seasonal and degradation biases to improve the current calibration accuracy to a stable value within 3%. Due to its robust performance, our cloud-target-based calibration method can be applied to future MERSI-II sensors to monitor solar band stability.

TI  - Singularly Degenerate Heteroclinic Cycles with Nearby Apple-Shape Attractors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with most known singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles consisting of two different equilibria of a line or a curve, or two parallel lines of semi-hyperbolic equilibria, little seems to be noticed about the one that connects two perpendicular lines of semi-hyperbolic equilibria, i.e. E-z = (0,0, z) and E-x = (x, ex, k + ef), z, x is an element of R, which is found in the mathematical chaos model: x? = a(y - x) + dxz, y? = kx + fy - xz, z? = -ex(2) + xy + cz when c = 0 and e(a + fd) = (a - kd). Surprisingly, apple-shape attractors are also created nearby that kind of singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles in the case of small c > 0. Further, some other rich dynamics are uncovered, i.e. global boundedness, Hopf bifurcation, limit cycles coexisting with one chaotic attractor, etc. We not only prove that the ultimate bound sets and globally exponentially attracting sets perfectly coincide under the same parameters, but also illustrate four limit cycles coexisting with one chaotic attractor, the saddle in the origin, and other two stable nontrivial node-foci, which are also trapped in the obtained globally exponentially attracting set, extending the recently reported results of the Lu spexpressioncing diexpressioneresis -type subsystem. In addition, combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the bidirectional forming mechanism of that kind of singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles is illustrated, and their collapses may create three-scroll/apple-shape attractors, or limit cycles, etc. Finally, conservative chaotic flows are numerically found in the new system. We expect that the outcome of the study may provide a reference for subsequent research.

TI  - Micro Resistance Spot Welding Optimization for Ultra-Thin Mo-Re Sheet Used in TWT
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - 30 mu m ultra-thin Mo-Re sheet had been joined by micro resistance spot welding (MRSW) and successfully applied to the low heating power cathode of traveling wave tube (TWT). The effects of different welding parameters, surface state and protection conditions on the joint's appearance, micro-structure and lap shear strength (LSS) were analyzed in this paper. The results showed that a 63.5 N LSS of the MRSW joint was obtained under the following conditions: electrode force F = 9.0 N, welding current I = 1000A, ramping time t(1) = 5ms, welding time t(2) = 2ms and dip in the alcohol for protection. The fracture occurs in the heat affected zone (HAZ). Using metallurgical microscopy observed the nugget, metallurgical fusion could be found, the diameter of nugget was about Phi 0.3 mm, without gas pores. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the fracture surface. It could be found some "whisker" shape diverged from the joint center to the surroundings in HAZ. The electrode tip was observed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and optical profiler. It was found that the tip was uneven and adhered the base metal obviously after spark. Additional work about electrode sticking will be required. The thermal test data showed that the use of ultra-thin Mo-Re sheet can reduce a space TWT cathode heating power (CHP) by 0.57 W, which will effectively save satellite energy and improve the expected working life of vacuum electronic devices.

TI  - An Epipolar HS-NCC Flow Algorithm for DSM Generation Using GaoFen-3 Stereo SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radargrammetry is a widely used methodology to generate the large-scale Digital Surface Model (DSM). Stereo matching is the most challenging step in radargrammetry due to the significant geometric differences and the inherent speckle noise. The speckle noise results in significant grayscale differences of the same feature points, which makes the traditional Horn-Schunck (HS) flow or multi-window zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) methods degrade. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm named Epipolar HS-NCC Flow (EHNF) for dense stereo matching, which is an improved HS flow method with normalized cross-correction constraint based on epipolar stereo images. First, the epipolar geometry is applied to resample the image to realize the coarse stereo matching. Subsequently, the EHNF method forms a global energy function to achieve fine stereo matching. The EHNF method constructs a local normalized cross-correlation constraint term to compensate for the grayscale invariance constraint, especially for the SAR stereo images. Additionally, two assessment methods are proposed to calculate the optimal cross-correlation parameter and smoothness parameter according to the refined matched point pairs. Two GaoFen-3 (GF-3) image pairs from ascending and descending orbits and the open Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are utilized to fully evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the EHNF algorithm improves the DSM elevation accuracy by 9.6% and 27.0% compared with the HS flow and multi-window ZNCC methods, respectively.

TI  - Unsupervised Domain Factorization Network for Thick Cloud Removal of Multitemporal Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal is an important task in remotely sensed images (RSIs) processing, which is beneficial for downstream applications, such as unmixing, fusion, and target detection. Multitemporal RSIs (MRSIs), which contains abundant spatial-spectral-temporal (SST) information, potentially bring new opportunities for cloud removal. However, how to effectively and efficiently explore the rich information of MRSIs remains a challenge. Inspired by the low-rankness of MRSIs, we propose an Unsupervised Domain Factorization Network (UnDFN) for thick cloud removal, which allows us to effectively and efficiently exploit the rich SST information of MRSIs. In the UnDFN framework, we first factorize RSI for each time node of MRSIs into its corresponding spatial factor and spectral factor. Due to powerful expressive ability, untrained neural networks (NNs) are leveraged to faithfully capture the spatial and spectral factors. Especially, motivated by the low-rankness of the concatenated spatial factors of all time nodes, a low-rank spatial factor module is elaborately designed to effectively and efficiently capture the spatial factors of all time nodes as compared with separately using networks to capture spatial factors for each time node. Extensive experiments on simulated and real MRSIs of different satellites (including Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) substantiate that the proposed UnDFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in thick cloud removal compared to other methods.

TI  - Toward Universal Representation Learning for Multidomain Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based methods have greatly improved the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification over the past several years. Nevertheless, current deep learning methods require training and deploying an independent model for each hyperspectral data domain. Representations learned for one data domain can hardly be generalized to other data domains, so multiple models are needed in real-world applications when data from multiple domains are involved. In this article, we design a single neural network that learns universal representations simultaneously from multiple hyperspectral remote sensing data domains. The universal convolutional neural network (CNN) adapts its behavior to different hyperspectral datasets. The majority of parameters of the network are shared to learn common knowledge from multiple datasets. A small number of domain-specific parameters are assigned to handle the domain shift. In addition, we propose a two-step training strategy to fully utilize the capacity of the universal network. Experiments conducted on seven HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed universal network outperforms multiple individual specialized single-domain networks.

TI  - Improving the Quality of MODIS LAI Products by Exploiting Spatiotemporal Correlation Information
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) product is critical for global terrestrial carbon monitoring and ecosystem modeling. However, MODIS LAI is calculated on a pixel-by-pixel and day-by-day basis without using spatial or temporal correlation information, which leads to its high sensitivity of LAI to uncertainties in observed reflectance, resulting in an increased noise level in time series. While exploiting prior knowledge is a common practice to fill gaps in observations, little research has been conducted on reducing noisy fluctuations and improving the overall quality of the MODIS LAI product. To address this issue, we proposed a spatiotemporal information composition algorithm (STICA), which directly introduces prior spatiotemporal correlation and multiple quality assessment (MQA) information into the existing MODIS LAI product. STICA reduces the noise level and improves the quality of the product while maintaining the original physically based (radiative transfer model, RTM) LAI production process. In our analysis, the R-2 increased from 0.79 to 0.81 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased from 0.81 to 0.68 compared to the ground-based LAI reference. The improvement was more pronounced with the degradation of the data quality. STICA reduced noisy fluctuations in the LAI time series to varying degrees among eight biome types. In the Amazon forest, STICA significantly improved the time-series stability of LAI. Moreover, STICA can effectively eliminate abnormal declines in time series and correct for extreme outliers in LAI. We expect that the MODIS LAI reanalyzed product generated by this method will better support the application of high-quality LAI datasets.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Scene Classification via Multistage Self-Guided Separation Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote-sensing scene classification is one of the research hotspots and has played an important role in the field of intelligent interpretation of remote-sensing data. However, various complex objects and backgrounds form a variety of remote-sensing scenes through spatial combination and correlation, which brings great challenges to accurately classifying different scenes. Among them, the insufficient feature difference brought about the unbalanced change of background and target between interclass samples and the feature representation inconsistency caused by the difference of representation among the intraclass samples have become obstacles to effectively distinguishing different scene images. To address these issues, a multistage self-guided separation network (MGSNet) is proposed for remote-sensing scene classification. First of all, different from the previous work, it attempts to utilize the background information outside the effective target in the image as a decision aid through a target-background separation strategy to improve the distinguishability between target similarity-background difference samples. In addition, the diversity of feature concerns among different network branches is expanded through contrastive regularization (CR) to improve the separation of target-background information. Additionally, a self-guided network is proposed to find common features between intraclass samples and improve the consistency of feature representation. It combines the texture and morphological features of images to guide feature learning, effectively reducing the impact of intraclass differences. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that MGSNet can achieve better classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Farmland quality assessment using deep fully convolutional neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland is the cornerstone of agriculture and is important for food security and social production. Farmland assessment is essential but traditional methods are usually expensive and slow. Deep learning methods have been developed and widely applied recently in image recognition, semantic understanding, and many other application domains. In this research, we used fully convolutional networks (FCN) as the deep learning model to evaluate farmland grades. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat images was used as the input data, and the China National Cultivated Land Grade Database within Jiangsu Province was used to train the model on cloud computing. We also applied an image segmentation method to improve the original results from the FCN and compared the results with classical machine learning (ML) methods. Our research found that the FCN can predict farmland grades with an overall F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.719 and F1 score of 0.909, 0.590, 0.740, 0.642, and 0.023 for non-farmland, level I, II, III, and IV farmland, respectively. Combining the FCN and image segmentation method can further improve prediction accuracy with results of fewer noise pixels and more realistic edges. Compared with conventional ML, at least in farmland evaluation, FCN provides better results with higher precision, recall, and F1 score. Our research indicates that by using remote sensing NDVI data, the deep learning method can provide acceptable farmland assessment without fieldwork and can be used as a novel supplement to traditional methods. The method used in this research will save a lot of time and cost compared with traditional means.

TI  - Real-Time LEO Satellite Orbits Based on Batch Least-Squares Orbit Determination with Short-Term Orbit Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The augmentation of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) by Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites is proposed as an effective method to improve the precision and shorten the convergence time of Precise Point Positioning (PPP). Serving as navigation satellites in the future, LEO satellites need to be provided with their high-accuracy orbits in real-time. This would potentially enable the high-accuracy real-time LEO satellite clock determination, and eventually facilitate the high-accuracy ground-based positioning. Studies have been performed to achieve such real-time orbits using a Kalman filter in both the kinematic and reduced-dynamic modes. Batch Least-Squares (BLS) adjustment delivers more stable orbits in near-real-time, as it performs better phase screening. However, it suffers from longer delays compared to the Kalman filter. With the LEO satellite orbit prediction strategies improved over time, this latency can be bridged by short-term orbit prediction. In this study, using real-time GNSS satellite products, the real-time LEO satellite orbits are obtained based on the batch least-squares adjustment and short-term prediction. LEO ephemeris parameters are generated within specific prediction time windows. Using real data from the 500 km GRACE C satellite and 810 km Sentinel-3B satellite, the near-real-time BLS Precise Orbit Determination (POD) results exhibit good accuracy with an Orbital User Range Error (OURE) of 2-4 cm using different real-time GNSS products. A range of delays of the BLS POD processes are assumed, based on tests performed on different processing machines, leading to various prediction windows, from 3-8 min to 12-17 min that correspond to the real-time usage. The orbital prediction errors are shown to be highly correlated with the orbital height and the prediction time. The computational efficiency thus becomes essential to reduce the prediction errors for a certain LEO satellite. For advanced processing units leading to a prediction window shorter or equal to 6-11 min, one can expect a total real-time orbital error budget of 3-5 cm, provided that an appropriate prediction strategy is applied and high-quality GNSS products are used. For a given fitting interval, the ephemeris fitting errors are generally related to the number of ephemeris parameters and the orbital height. Compared with the prediction errors, the ephemeris fitting errors do not play a significant role in the total error budget when using 22 ephemeris parameters.

TI  - Long-Term Tibetan Alpine Vegetation Responses to Elevation-Dependent Changes in Temperature and Precipitation in an Altered Regional Climate: A Case Study for the Three Rivers Headwaters Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies offer more evidence that the rate of warming is amplified with elevation, indicating thereby that high-elevation ecosystems tend to be exposed to more accelerated changes in temperature than ecosystems at lower elevations. The phenomenon of elevation-dependent warming (EDW), as one of the regional climate-change impacts, has been observed across the Tibetan Plateau. Studies have often found large-scale greening trends, but the drivers of vegetation dynamics are still not fully understood in this region, such that the local implications of vegetation change have been infrequently discussed. This study was designed to quantify and characterize the seasonal changes in vegetation across the Three Rivers Headwaters Region (TRHR), where the land cradles the headwaters of the Yangtze, the Yellow, and the Lancang (Mekong). By mapping the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the growing season from 1982 to 2015, we were able to evaluate seasonal changes in vegetation cover over time. The results show a slightly increased tendency in green vegetation cover, which could possibly be attributed to sustained warming in this region over the past three decades, whereas a decline in the green-up rate with elevation was found, indicating an inconsistent trend of vegetation greening with EDW. The cause of the green-up rate decline at high elevations could be linked to the reduced soil water availability induced by the fast increase in warming rates associated with EDW. The findings of this study have important implications for devising adaptation strategies for alpine ecosystems in a changing climate.

TI  - Measuring Urban Poverty Spatial by Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data: A Fine-Scale Empirical Study from Zhengzhou
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban poverty is a major obstacle to the healthy development of urbanization. Identifying and mapping urban poverty is of great significance to sustainable urban development. Traditional data and methods cannot measure urban poverty at a fine scale. Besides, existing studies often ignore the impact of the built environment and fail to consider the equal importance of poverty indicators. The emerging multi-source big data provide new opportunities for accurately measuring and monitoring urban poverty. This study aims to map urban poverty spatial at a fine scale by using multi-source big data, including social sensing and remote sensing data. The urban core of Zhengzhou is selected as the study area. The characteristics of the community's living environment are quantified by accessibility, block vitality, per unit rent, public service infrastructure, and socio-economic factors. The urban poverty spatial index (SI) model is constructed by using the multiplier index of the factors. The SOM clustering method is employed to identify urban poverty space based on the developed SI. The performance of the proposed SI model is evaluated at the neighborhood scale. The results show that the urban poverty spatial measurement method based on multi-source big data can capture spatial patterns of typical urban poverty with relatively high accuracy. Compared with the urban poverty space measured based on remote sensing data, it considers the built environment and socio-economic factors in the identification of the inner city poverty space, and avoids being affected by the texture information of the physical surface of the residential area and the external structure of the buildings. Overall, this study can provide a comprehensive, cost-effective, and efficient method for the refined management of urban poverty space and the improvement of built environment quality.

TI  - Combining Multitemporal Sentinel-2A Spectral Imaging and Random Forest to Improve the Accuracy of Soil Organic Matter Estimates in the Plough Layer for Cultivated Land
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is vital for assessing the quality of arable land. A fast and reliable estimation of SOM is important to predict the soil carbon stock in cropland. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of combining multitemporal Sentinel-2A imagery and random forest (RF) to improve the accuracy of SOM estimates in the plough layer for cultivated land at a regional scale. The field data of SOM content were utilized along with multitemporal Sentinel-2A images acquired over three years during the bare soil period to develop spectral indices. The best bands and spectral indices were selected as prediction variables by using the RF algorithm. Partial least squares (PLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and RF were employed to calibrate spectral indices for the SOM content, and the optimal calibration model was used for the mapping of the SOM content in arable land at a regional scale. The results showed the following. (1) The multitemporal image estimation model outperformed the single-temporal image estimation model. The estimation model that utilized the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables usually had better accuracy than the models based on full spectral data. (2) For the SOM content estimates, the performance was better with RF than with PLS and GWR in almost all cases. (3) The most accurate SOM estimation in the case area was achieved by using multitemporal images from 2018 and the RF calibration model based on the optimal bands and spectral indices as prediction variables, with R-val(2) (coefficient of determination of the validation data set) = 0.67, RMSEval (root mean square error of the validation dataset) = 2.05, and RPIQ(val) (ratio of performance to interquartile range of the validation dataset) = 3.36. (4) The estimated SOM content in the plough layer for cultivated land throughout the study area ranged from 16.17 to 36.98 g kg(-1) and exhibited an increasing trend from north to south. In the current study, we developed a framework that combines multitemporal remote sensing imagery and RF for the SOM estimation, which can improve the accuracy of quantitative SOM estimations, provide a dynamic, rapid, and low-cost technique for understanding soil fertility, and offer an early warning of changes in soil quality.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval From Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Using Ensemble Learning Over Vegetated Fields
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is valuable basic data in climate, hydrological models, and agricultural applications. The rapid development of remote sensing technology can be used to monitor changes in SM at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In this article, we unfolded an SM retrieval method using ensemble learning combined with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 with multisource datasets. First, using the WCM, the influence of vegetation cover on the backscattering coefficient was removed, where we use three vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index, and normalized difference water index) for analysis and comparison. Then, combined with other multisource datasets, an SM retrieval model was established based on the ensemble learning algorithm. Here, we choose two familiar ensemble learning algorithms for analysis and comparison, using Pearson correlation significance analysis, which are the random forest (RF) and the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). The results revealed that the RF model performed is slightly superior to the AdaBoost model. The optimal performance mean absolute error, root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the unbiased RMSE of RF model are 2.289 vol%, 2.934 vol%, 2.934 vol%, respectively, which are slightly better than the AdaBoost model. EVI is suitable for WCM model to remove vegetation scattering effect. It shows that it is attainable to utilize the ensemble learning method to inversion of SM using radar data. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of WCM, RF model, and multisource datasets in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SM estimates, which should be valuable for SM inversion development.

TI  - Ground Moving Target Indication and Relocation in Spaceborne MIMO-SAR Systems
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique has recently received great attention due to its promising prospect for ground moving target indication (GMTI) applications in a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. In this article, an SAR-GMTI processing technique in an MIMO-SAR system with dual-channel configuration is proposed. In the proposed method, up and down chirps are adopted as the transmitted waveforms. Then, the baseline estimation and clutter rejection are simultaneously accomplished in the raw Doppler data domain, after which two separated range-compressed echo signals corresponding to two transmitters can be obtained without the influence of cross-correlated interferences of the clutters. Subsequently, a ground moving target can be detected, clustered, finely refocused based on the Doppler chirp parameter estimation, and accurately relocated by using the along-track interferometry (ATI) processing technique. Simulated experiments are implemented to validate and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method.

TI  - Nearest Neighbor-Based Contrastive Learning for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The joint hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data classification aims to interpret ground objects at more detailed and precise level. Although deep learning methods have shown remarkable success in the multisource data classification task, self-supervised learning has rarely been explored. It is commonly nontrivial to build a robust self-supervised learning model for multisource data classification, due to the fact that the semantic similarities of neighborhood regions are not exploited in the existing contrastive learning framework. Furthermore, the heterogeneous gap induced by the inconsistent distribution of multisource data impedes the classification performance. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a nearest neighbor-based contrastive learning network (NNCNet), which takes full advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data to learn discriminative feature representations. Specifically, we propose a nearest neighbor-based data augmentation scheme to use enhanced semantic relationships among nearby regions. The intermodal semantic alignments can be captured more accurately. In addition, we design a bilinear attention module to exploit the second-order and even high-order feature interactions between the HSI and LiDAR data. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NNCNet over state-of-the-art methods. The source codes are available at https://github.com/summitgao/NNCNet.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval From Landsat 9 TIRS-2 Data Using Radiance-Based Split-Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared sensor-2 (TIRS-2) carried on Landsat 9 is the newest thermal infrared (TIR) sensor for the Landsat project and provides two adjacent TIR bands, which greatly benefits the land surface temperature (LST) retrieval at high spatial resolution. In this article, a radiance based split window (RBSW) algorithm for retrieving LST from Landsat 9 TIRS-2 data was proposed. In addition, the split-window covariance-variance ratio (SWCVR) algorithm was improved and applied to Landsat 9 TIRS-2 data for estimating atmospheric water vapor (AWV) that is required for accurate LST retrieval. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using the simulation data and satellite observations. Results reveal that the retrieved LST using the RBSW algorithm has a bias of 0.06 K and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 K based on validation with the simulation data. The sensitivity analysis exhibited a LST error of < 1.75 K using the RBSW algorithm when the uncertainties in input parameters (i.e., AWV, emissivity, and at-sensor radiance) were considered. There is a marginal discrepancy between LST retrievals using the estimated AWV and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer AWV, with a difference in bias of -0.14 K and RMSE of 0.22 K, which indicates that the improved SWCVR method can provide an optional means to obtain AWV inputted in LST retrieval. With regard to the validation using the in situ measurements, the retrieved LST from Landsat 9 TIRS-2 data exhibits a bias of 0.44 K and RMSE of 1.98 K, respectively, showing a higher accuracy than the USGS Landsat LST product with bias of 1.21 and RMSE of 2.56 K. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm combining RBSW algorithm and improved SWCVR algorithm for LST retrieval from Landsat 9 has a good accuracy without dependence on external atmospheric data, and it is expected to be a reliable method for LST generation from Landsat 9 TIRS-2 data.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Land Surface Temperature Products From Landsat Series Using in Situ Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three operational long-term land surface temperature (LST) products from Landsat series are available to the community until now, i.e., U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) LST, Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) LST, and China University of Geosciences (CUG) LST. A comprehensive assessment of these LST products is essential for their subsequent applications (APPs) in energy, water, and carbon cycle modeling. In this study, an evaluation of these three Landsat LST products was performed using in situ LST measurements from five networks [surface radiation budget (SURFRAD), atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM), Heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research (HiWATER), baseline surface radiation network (BSRN), and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)] for the period of 2009-2019. Results reveal that the overall accuracies of CUG LST with bias [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] of 0.54 K (2.19 K) and IPMA LST with bias (RMSE) of 0.59 K (2.34 K) are marginally superior to USGS LST with bias (RMSE) of 0.96 K (2.51 K). The RMSE of USGS LST is about 0.3 K less than IPMA/CUG LST at water surface sites and is about 0.4 K higher than IPMA/CUG LST at cropland and shrubland sites. As for tundra, grassland, and forest sites, the RMSEs of three Landsat LST products are similar, and the RMSE difference among three Landsat LST products is < 0.18 K. Considering the close emissivity estimates over water surface in these three LST data, USGS LST has a better performance in atmospheric correction over water surface compared with IPMA/CUG LST. For land surface sites, the RMSE of LST increases initially and then decreases with land surface emissivity (LSE) for three Landsat LST products. This indicates that the emissivity correction has a large uncertainty for moderately vegetated surface with emissivity ranging from 0.970 to 0.980. Underestimated emissivity for USGS LST at vegetated sites leads to overestimation of LST, which could have led to the higher bias and RMSE compared with IPMA/CUG LST. For the LST retrievals for the three different sensors [i.e., Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS)] onboard the Landsat satellite series, the accuracies are consistent and comparable, which is beneficial for providing long-term and coherent LST.

TI  - Interannual changes of coastal aquaculture ponds in China at 10-m spatial resolution during 2016-2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of coastal aquaculture has strongly supported global food security and economic development of coastal areas in the past few decades but has also caused remarkable impacts on coastal ecosystems. Accurate delineation of coastal aquaculture extent and changes is thus significant for improving coastal zone management toward sustainability. Here, by means of Sentinel-2 images, we propose an effective and rapid approach that combines simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) with hierarchical decision trees (HDT), so-called SNIC-HDT, to generate fine-resolution coastal aquaculture pond data at the national scale of China. The SNIC-HDT fully considers the spatial heterogeneity of coastal aquaculture ponds and performs accurate segmentation by determining the optimal segmentation scale for coastal aquaculture ponds with different sizes and shapes. In addition, the SNIC-HDT incorporates temporal features into the establishment of HDT and thus effectively distinguishes coastal aquaculture ponds from other water bodies. In support of the Google Earth Engine platform, we employed 85,501 scenes of Sentinel-2 images and generated the first annual 10-m spatial resolution national coastal aquaculture pond dataset of China between 2016 and 2021 (China_CAP), with an overall classification accuracy of more than 90%. This dataset reveals that total area of China's coastal aquaculture ponds experienced a substantial loss of 13.21% from 9769 km2 in 2016 to 8629 km2 in 2021. The most remarkable areal reduction occurred in Zhejiang Province, with a decrease rate of 38.24%, followed by Guangdong (27.93%), and these reductions were mostly related to the policy of retuning aquaculture ponds to natural wetlands. Coastal aquaculture ponds in Fujian and Tianjin provinces experienced slight areal gains (7.24% and 2.13%). The results generated in this study could provide a basis for the conservation of habitats of migratory water birds on the East Asia-Australia Flyway and are of great scientific and practical importance to support the evaluation of Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Tree species classification using machine learning algorithms with OHS-2 hyperspectral image
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the form diversity of tree species composition in the Bagong Mountain National Forest Park of China, we mapped tree species utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers) based on the OHS-2 hyperspectral satellite image by different datasets which combined spectral information and hyperspectral-derived vegetation indices (VIs) for improving tree species classification and explored the best performance of them. To verify the improvement, the results of physically-based spectral classifiers (spectral angle mapper (SAM) and maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers) were applied to compare with the results of machine learning algorithms. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 94.01%, 96.08%, 82.9% and 79.3% for SVM, RF, SAM and ML classifiers of the best performance using different datasets. Highest accuracies resulted from two machine learning algorithms classifiers; SVM and RF compared to SAM and ML classifiers. Although SVM outperformed RF when using all hyperspectral bands and VIs, the overall accuracy of the RF classifier is higher when compared to the SVM classifier using VIs combined selected features. Meanwhile, the RF classifier performed better than SVM after removing the redundancy of spectral data in training samples. Moreover, the machine learning algorithms successfully classified a small number of tree species (Cedrus deodara and Pterocarya stenoptera C. DC.) in the study area, but the physical spectroscopy-based method failed to classify these species. Such integration strategy improved the effectiveness of enhancing the accuracy of tree species classification and mapping their distribution on broad spatial and temporal scales using machine learning algorithms and hyperspectral imagery.

TI  - Data Augmentation for SAR Sea Ice and Water Classification Based on Per-Class Backscatter Variation With Incidence Angle
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring sea ice in polar regions is critical for understanding global climate change and supporting marine navigation. Recently, researchers started to utilize machine/deep learning methodologies to automate the separation of sea ice and open water in synthetic aperture radar imagery. However, this requires a large amount of reliably labeled training data. We here propose an augmentation routine for Sentinel-1 data, which incorporates physical principles of radar backscatter into the augmentation procedure. First, we apply an incidence angle (IA)-aware algorithm to segment Sentinel-1 images into separate clusters. We compute the corresponding slopes of backscatter intensity with the IA for each cluster. Second, the slopes are used as prior information to project labeled pixels and segments to different IAs and thus further enrich the labeled data. We then apply a simplified U-Net for pixelwise classification of Sentinel-1 images into sea ice or open water. The performance of our model is evaluated by visual inspection as well as comparison with an available product from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The results indicate that the physics-based data augmentation improves the model performance compared to training with data without augmentation. The inferred ice edge is in line with the inference for other available datasets (CAS), but with a finer spatial resolution. Finally, we also found that the inference of our model is highly correlated with the visual interpretation of overlapping optical observations. Overall, the proposed methodology provides an alternative for the automated separation of sea ice/open water at fine spatial resolution.

TI  - A Difference Enhanced Neural Network for Semantic Change Detection of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning techniques have been widely used for semantic change detection (SCD) of remote sensing images (RSIs) and have shown encouraging performance. In this letter, we propose a novel neural network by embedding the difference enhancement (DE) module into the adjacent layers of ResNet for SCD of RSIs (DESNet), which can pay more attention to the changes of bitemporal RSIs. Furthermore, we deploy the module of multiscale parallel sampling spatial-spectral nonlocal (SSN) after feature extraction, which can effectively improve the robustness to large-scale changes and the integrity of the changed objects by fusing global features that sampled from the multiscale feature space. The experimental tests demonstrate that our DESNet can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the SECOND dataset and the Landsat-SCD dataset.

TI  - Comparison of Doppler-Derived Sea Ice Radial Surface Velocity Measurement Methods From Sentinel-1A IW Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The near-instantaneous radial velocity of a target can be obtained using the Doppler effect of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is widely used in ocean current retrieval. However, in sea ice drift velocity measurements, only a Doppler centroid estimation algorithm in frequency domain has been studied, so whether there is a better algorithm is worth exploring. In this article, based on Sentinel-1A interferometric wide data, three Doppler centroid estimation algorithms applied to ocean current retrieval are selected. Combined with the characteristics of the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans mode, made two applicability adjustments to each algorithm, and finally applied the three algorithms to sea ice radial surface velocity measurements. The first adjustment is to explore and determine the optimal parameters. The second adjustment is to use parallel computing to improve the efficiency, which is improved by an average of 43.55%. In addition, the deviation of Doppler centroid estimation bias correction is verified using rainforest data, and the deviation is controlled at approximately 3 Hz. Based on the three algorithms, five sets of experiments are carried out in this article. By analyzing and comparing the results of each algorithm, it is found that the results of the three algorithms are relatively consistent, among which the correlation Doppler estimation algorithm has the advantages of high efficiency and high precision and is the most suitable method for sea ice drift measurement among the three methods. However, for SAR images with abnormal speckles caused by human activities, the sign Doppler estimation algorithm can effectively remove abnormal speckles and ensure the smoothness of the image with better adaptability.

TI  - STA-GAN: A Spatio-Temporal Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Missing Value Imputation in Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data is of high importance for ocean environment monitoring and protection. However, due to the missing values in satellite data, caused by various force majeure factors such as cloud cover, bad weather and sensor failure, the quality of satellite data is reduced greatly, which hinders the applications of satellite data in practice. Therefore, a variety of methods have been proposed to conduct missing data imputation for satellite data to improve its quality. However, these methods cannot well learn the short-term temporal dependence and dynamic spatial dependence in satellite data, resulting in bad imputation performance when the data missing rate is large. To address this issue, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Attention Generative Adversarial Network (STA-GAN) for missing value imputation in satellite data. First, we develop the Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) to learn features for capturing both short-term temporal dependence and dynamic spatial dependence in satellite data. Then, the learned features from STA are fused to enrich the spatio-temporal information for training the generator and discriminator of STA-GAN. Finally, we use the generated imputation data by the trained generator of STA-GAN to fill the missing values in satellite data. Experimental results on real datasets show that STA-GAN largely outperforms the baseline data imputation methods, especially for filling satellite data with large missing rates.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Longwave downward radiation (LWDR) is an important parameter that modulates the Earth's radiation and energy balance and is also a key variable that affects global warming. Currently, although many reanalysis LWDR products and satellite-based algorithms are available, their coarse spatiotemporal resolutions, as well as the difficulties in organizing the corresponding driving parameters, seriously limit their applications. As China's new generation geostationary satellite, Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) provides higher spatial and temporal resolutions (4 km@nadir, 15 min at full disk mode) at longwave infrared channels, which can routinely monitor the changes of the Earth's radiation in near real time, and therefore, provide great potentials in generating various high-accuracy radiation products. Unfortunately, the existing official LWDR products of FY-4A can only provide estimates under clear skies, and their accuracy still has much room for improvement. For the above-mentioned points, an improved general all-sky parameterization algorithm is proposed based on readily available input variables, such as land surface temperature (LST), column water vapor (CWV), and cloud-top temperature (CTT). Then the new algorithm is applied to FY-4A, aiming to derive a believable all-sky LWDR. The validation results show that the new algorithm does show a noticeable improvement over the original one by reducing the relatively large errors in LWDR under extremely cold and dry conditions (flux range < 150 W/m(2)), as well as the large bias in the polar and high altitude regions. Moreover, the new method can generate a more reliable LWDR than that of the FY-4A official product in terms of both spatiotemporal continuity and accuracy, with RMSE less than 22 W/m(2) and bias less than 0.5 W/m(2) under all-sky conditions. The easy-to-use and believable performance of the new algorithm provides an opportunity to accurately derive all-sky LWDR from FY-4A and similar satellite missions with high resolutions.

T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the correlations between gene alter-ations induced in Mdr2-knockout (Mdr2-/-) models and liver fibrosis.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The overlapping genes in Mdr2-/-models were determined and in-cluded in logistic regression analysis to identi-fy potential candidates for predicting liver fibro-sis. Correlations between the expression levels of the identified candidates and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were addressed. Functional enrich-ment of the identified candidates was also evalu-ated via bioinformatic analysis.RESULTS: Twenty-two overlapping genes in the GSE4612, GSE8642 and GSE14539 datasets were identified. Univariate and multivariate analysis in-dicated that ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7 (ELOVL7) was significantly associated with liver fibrosis S >= 2 (OR = 11.8, 95% CI = 2.0 -69.2, p = 0.006). ELOVL7 was significantly upregulated in patients with var-ious types of liver injury including hepatitis B vi-rus (HBV) infection and fatty liver diseases, and in multiple liver injury models, including bile duct ligation (BDL), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and paracetamol injection-induced liver damage mod-els (all p < 0.05). The ELOVL7 levels were signifi-cantly higher in HSCs than in other liver cells (all p < 0.05) and were significantly upregulated in ac-tivated HSCs compared to quiescent HSCs (all p < 0.05). In addition, ELOVL7 expression was posi-tively associated with transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) expression and negatively associated with BMP7 expression. Bioinformatic analysis of functional enrichment indicated that ELOVL7 is mainly in-volved in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism.CONCLUSIONS: ELOVL7 could accurately predict advanced liver fibrosis. It might be in-volved in the activation of HSCs and the TGF beta signaling pathway.

TI  - A STUDY OF MYTH AND RELIGIOUS COLORS IN BRITISH AND AMERICAN LITERATURE
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Literature from the United Kingdom and the United States represents the cultural expression of those peoples' lived experiences. Reading British and American literature may also aid in our understanding of the values, worldview, and ideological underpinnings of western civilization. Therefore, this thesis examines the mythological and religious themes in British and American literature using literary works from both countries. Greek Myth is the source and soil of ancient Greek literature, and ancient Greek and Roman literature is a rich treasure for later generations to understand myths, both of which provide creative materials for later British and American writers. It can be said that myths and religious ideas gave birth to great literary works and some immortal poets. Among them, "Wuthering Heights" is the main representative work of 19th century literature and occupies an important position in the history of British and American literature. Based on this, this paper discusses the religious and cultural characteristics of British and American literature in "Wuthering Heights", mainly from the perspective of environment description and plot shaping. I hope this research can play a role in attracting jade.

TI  - Estimation of Live Fuel Moisture Content From Multiple Sources of Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is a crucial factor that influences both the ignition and behavior of wildfires. Previous studies have utilized remote sensing data-derived vegetation indices, meteorological indicators, and soil moisture to estimate LFMC. However, an attempt to estimate LFMC using all of these data sources collectively has not been made until now. In this study, we have integrated these remotely sensed data into the construction of LFMC estimation models. Employing the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, we have constructed an empirical model that provides reasonable LFMC estimates (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 27.16%) across the western U.S. states. Among different vegetation cover types, the best LFMC estimate was found for the closed shrublands (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 24.38%), followed by open shrublands (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 30.04%), grasslands (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 27.02%), savannas (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 24.23%), and woody savannas (R2 = 0.44, RMSE = 25.94%). This study advances from previous research as it involved the integration and analysis of multiple indicators from various sources. Furthermore, it necessitated the utilization of long-term meteorological data to improve the accuracy of LFMC estimation across different vegetation cover types in a large-scale regional context.

TI  - BiG-FSLF: A Cross Heterogeneous Domain Few-Shot Learning Framework Based on Bidirectional Generation for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD) based on deep learning has achieved high detection accuracy, but these methods obtain excellent detection results usually rely on having sufficient labeled samples to train the network. However, the production of HSI labels is difficult, costly, and inefficient. In practical tasks, often only a limited number of labeled samples can be obtained due to the limitation of timeliness. To address this problem, a cross-heterogeneous domain few-shot learning framework based on bidirectional generation (BiG-FSLF) is proposed for HSI-CD, which aims to solve the few-shot problem of HSI-CD by few-shot learning (FSL) and to assist HSI-FSL to perform better by obtaining learnable changed information (i.e., empirical knowledge) from another remote sensing data. Specifically, a multitask generation encoder (MLGenE) is designed to take on both the tasks of FSL and domain adaptation to achieve HSI-CD under the condition of cross-heterogeneous domain few-shot. First, we take any pair of image data in a very high-resolution image (VHRI) CD dataset as the source domain and HSI is used as the target domain, using sufficient labeled samples in the source domain and a small number of labeled samples in the target domain for FSL. Meanwhile, a bidirectional generation domain adaptation (BiGDA) method based on a generative adversarial strategy is proposed to achieve adaptive alignment of the two heterogeneous domains (source and target domains) feature distributions, to mitigate the impact of the domain shift problem inherent to cross-domain data on FSL. Abundant experiments with only five training samples on the publicly available popular HSI-CD datasets confirm that the proposed method can show great detection performance. The source code of the proposed framework will be released at https://github.com/lsylnnu/BiG-FSLF.

TI  - Accurate Label Refinement From Multiannotator of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing (RS) field has an increasing research interest in using deep learning (DL) models to recognize kinds of RS data, leading to a great demand for training data annotation. Due to the high cost of expertise, using nonexperts to label data has become an important way to improve labeling efficiency. Commonly, a single data sample is labeled by multiple annotators and the most voted label is accepted to promise accuracy. But in the RS context, the widely admitted strategy could lose effect. Usually RS data involve considerable classes on account of the complexity of surface environments, which is prone to interclass similarity difficult to distinguish. Annotators without expertise probably make mistakes on these indistinguishable classes, thus causing error voted labels. Although classification of different characteristics in RS data has been widely documented, the nonexpert annotators are unfamiliar with these expertise, and it is difficult to force them to handle specialized labeling skills. To address the issues, this article bases multiannotator label selection on the investigation of annotators' own ability in distinguishing similar classes of images. A quality evaluation process is designed which weights the labels from capable annotators higher than those from weak ones. By a multi-round quality evaluation algorithm, correct labels could outcompete the wrong ones even disadvantaged in numbers. Experimental results demonstrate the advance of the proposed method on the RS datasets.

TI  - Assessment of Ecological Environment Quality in Qilian Mountain National Nature Reserve Based on Improved RSEI Model
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the non uniqueness of feature vector direction of remote sensing ecological index( RSEI) model and the existence of necrotic pixels in optical images, 489 Landsat TM/ SR availability remote sensing images of Qilian Moun. tain National Nature Reserve from 1986 to 2021 were selected in view of Google Earth Engine platform, and the improved remote sensing ecological index model was utilized to assess the ecological environment quality of the reserve. The single factor analysis and interactive detection analysis in geographical detector were applied to analyze the mechanisms of the seven influencing factors ( NDVI, WET, LST, NDBSI, land use type, DEM, and population density) of RSEI. The re. sults show that: ( 1) Compared with remote sensing ecological index model, the improved remote sensing ecological index model avoided the interference of feature vector direction, and could better reflect the changes of ecological environment quality. The ecological environment quality from 1986 to 2021 demonstrated a recovery trend of " first decreasing and then increasing", with a spatial distribution of " high in the east and low in the west". ( 2) The spatio.temporal differences in the reserve indicate that the ecological environment quality slightly deteriorated, unchanged or slightly improved in the past 35 years. The distribution of slightly deteriorated areas located mainly in the northern part of Sunan Yugur Autonomous County in Zhangye City and the junction of Zhangye City and Wuwei City. The slightly improved areas were scattered in the reserve, while the core areas were relatively more distributed in the reserve. ( 3) From the analysis of the causes of ecolog. ical environment quality, among the seven influencing factors, greenness ( NDVI) had the strongest explanatory power on the spatial differentiation characteristics of RSEI. Considering the synergistic effect of multiple factors, the NDVI and ND. BSI were the key driving indicators of ecological environment quality. The results above show that the ecological environ. ment quality in Qilian Mountain Nature Reserve has been gradually improved in recent years, and a series of environment protection measures were effective.

TI  - Winter Wheat Extraction Using Time-Series Sentinel-2 Data Based on Enhanced TWDTW in Henan Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a major world crop, the accurate spatial distribution of winter wheat is important for improving planting strategy and ensuring food security. Due to big data management and processing requirements, winter wheat mapping based on remote-sensing data cannot ensure a good balance between the spatial scale and map details. This study proposes a rapid and robust phenology-based method named "enhanced time-weighted dynamic time warping" (E-TWDTW), based on the Google Earth Engine, to map winter wheat in a finer spatial resolution, and efficiently complete the map of winter wheat at a 10-m resolution in Henan Province, China. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the resulting map are 97.98% and 0.9469, respectively, demonstrating its great applicability for winter wheat mapping. This research indicates that the proposed approach is effective for mapping large-scale planting patterns. Furthermore, based on comparative experiments, the E-TWDTW method has shown excellent robustness across lower quantities of training data and early season extraction ability. Therefore, it can provide early data preparation for winter wheat planting management in the early stage.

TI  - Comparison of Lake Extraction and Classification Methods for the Tibetan Plateau Based on Topographic-Spectral Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification and extraction of lake boundaries are the basis of the accurate assessment of lake changes and their responses to climate change. To reduce the effects of lake ice and snow cover, mountain shadows, cloud and fog shielding, alluvial and proluvial deposits, and shoals on the extraction of lake boundaries on the Tibetan Plateau, this study developed an RNSS water index to increase the contrast between the lake and similar surface objects of the spectral curve, and constructed a new method flow for lake extraction on the Tibetan Plateau based on image synthesis, topographic-spectral feature indexes, and machine learning algorithms. The lake extraction effects of three common machine learning classification algorithms were compared: the Cart decision tree, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The results show that the new lake extraction method based on topographic-spectral characteristics and the GBDT classification method had the highest extraction accuracy for Tibetan Plateau lakes in 2016 and 2021. Its overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, user's accuracy, and producer's accuracy for 2016 and 2021 were 99.81%, 0.887, 83.55%, 94.67% and 99.88%, 0.933, 89.18%, 98.24%, respectively, and the total area of lake extraction was the most consistent with the validation datasets. The three classification methods can effectively extract lakes covered by ice and snow, and the extraction effect was ranked as GBDT > RF > Cart. The lake extraction effect under mountain shadow was ranked as Cart > GBDT > RF, and the lake extraction effect under alluvial deposits and shoals was ranked as GBDT > RF > Cart. The results may provide technical support for extracting lakes from long time series and reveal the impact of climate change on Tibetan Plateau lakes.

TI  - A Block-Scale FFT Filter Based on Spatial Autocorrelation Features of Speckle Noise in SAR Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to reduce the impact of noise on the accuracy of inversion products based on SAR images, many filtering algorithms have been developed for noise reduction of SAR images. This paper proposes a filtering method based on the spatial autocorrelation feature of the block fast Fourier transform (BFFT). The method statistically analyses the autocorrelation length of speckle noise on Sentinel-1B images for different features and then constructs a relationship between autocorrelation length and noise period. After that, the size of the optimal FFT filtering window radius was determined based on the relationship between the noise period and the components in the image frequency domain. Finally, we filtered the SAR image within the parcels. We compared BFFT with six commonly used filtering methods. The results show that: (1) The noise periods of the soybean, corn, paddy, and water objects on the SAR image have little difference, with noise periods of 3.36, 3.17, 3.13, and 3.14 pixels on the VV polarization and 3.49, 3.17, 2.94, and 2.42 pixels on the VH polarization; (2) after the BFFT filtering in the land parcel area, the mean value of the backscattering coefficient (BC) kept constant, whilst at the same time, the standard deviation (STD) was reduced to half of that before the filtering and (3) the BFFT and NLM filtering methods have a better effect on noise reduction inside the block. The BFFT filtering method retains the variation trend between different regions within the block and preserves the block boundary's clarity. This study provides a new idea for refined image processing.

TI  - Hybrid Methods' Integration for Remote Sensing Monitoring and Process Analysis of Dust Storm Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are of great importance to climate change, air quality, and human health. In this study, a complete application frame of integrating hybrid methods based on multi-source data is proposed for remote sensing monitoring and process analysis of dust storms. In the frame, horizontal spatial distribution of dust intensity can be mapped by optical remote sensing products such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS; the vertical spatial distribution of dust intensity by LIDAR satellite remote sensing products such as AOD profile from CALIPSO; geostationary satellite remote sensing products such as Chinese Fengyun or Japanese Himawari can achieve high-frequency temporal distribution information of dust storms. More detailed process analysis of dust storms includes air quality analysis supported by particulate matter (PM) data from ground stations and the dust emission trace and transport pathways from HYSPLIT back trajectory driven by meteorological data from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). The dust storm outbreak condition of the source location can be proved by precipitation data from the WMO and soil moisture data from remote sensing products, which can be used to verify the deduced emission trace from HYSPLIT. The proposed application frame of integrating hybrid methods was applied to monitor and analyze a very heavy dust storm that occurred in northern China from 14-18 March 2021, which was one of the most severe dust storms in recent decades. Results showed that the dust storm event could be well monitored and analyzed dynamically. It was found that the dust originated in western Mongolia and northwestern China and was then transmitted along the northwest-southeast direction, consequently affected the air quality of most cities of northern China. The results are consistent with the prior research and showed the excellent potential of the integration of the hybrid methods in monitoring dust storms.

TI  - Vegetation disturbances characterization in the Tibetan Plateau from 1986 to 2018 using Landsat time series and field observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances in vegetated land could dramatically affect the process of vegetation growth and reshape the land cover state. The overall greenup of vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has almost served as a consensus to date. However, we still lack consistent acquisitions on the timing, the spatial patterns, and the temporal frequency of vegetation disturbance over the TP, limiting the capacity for planning land management strategies. Therefore, we explored the spatiotemporal pattern and variation of vegetation disturbances across the TP during the past decades and analyzed the disturbance agents. We utilized 37-year Landsat time series images and field observations coupled with a temporal segmentation approach to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation disturbances across the TP for the period 1986-2018. The results from this study revealed that 75.71 M ha (accounting for 29.34% of TP's area) vegetation area underwent at least one disturbance, of which 8.44 M ha area ever experienced large-scale disturbances (disturbance area greater than 0.9 ha and disturbance magnitude (the difference between the spectral value of pre-disturbance and that of post-disturbance) over 0.2). Further, the spatial distributions of these large-scale disturbances varied over time: before 2002, the disturbed sites were evenly distributed over the southeast part of the TP probably induced by overgrazing and unscientific livestock management, while after 2002, most disturbances were concentrated in the south of the Yarlung Tsangpo, mainly caused by anthropogenic activities, such as urban area, roadways, railway, and water control projects. This study presents an effort to characterize vegetation disturbances and their variations over the past decades on the TP, which provides crucial insights toward a complete understanding of vegetation dynamics and its causal relationship with human activities.

TI  - Relative Importance of Radar Variables for Nowcasting Heavy Rainfall: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly short-term forecasting, or nowcasting, of heavy rainfall due to rapidly evolving mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) is particularly challenging for traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To overcome such a challenge, a growing number of studies have shown significant advantages of using machine learning (ML) modeling techniques with remote sensing data, especially weather radar data, for high-resolution rainfall nowcasting. To improve ML model performance, it is essential first and foremost to quantify the importance of radar variables and identify pertinent predictors of rainfall that can also be associated with domain knowledge. In this study, a set of MCS types consisting of convective cell (CC), mesoscale CC, diagonal squall line (SLD), and parallel squall line (SLP), was adopted to categorize MCS storm cells, following the fuzzy logic algorithm for storm tracking (FAST), over the Korean Peninsula. The relationships between rain rates and over 15 variables derived from data products of dual-polarimetric weather radar were investigated and quantified via five ML regression methods and a permutation importance algorithm. As an applicational example, ML classification models were also developed to predict locations of storm cells. Recalibrated ML regression models with identified pertinent predictors were coupled with the ML classification models to provide early warnings of heavy rainfall. Results imply that future work needs to consider MCS type information to improve ML modeling for nowcasting and early warning of heavy rainfall.

TI  - Remote Sensing Prediction Model of Cultivated Land Soil Organic Matter Considering the Best Time Window
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is very important to the quality evaluation of cultivated land, especially in fertile black soil areas. Many studies use remote sensing images combined with different machine learning algorithms to predict the regional SOM content. However, the information provided by remote sensing images in different time windows is very different. Taking Youyi Farm, a typical black soil area in Northeast China, as the research area, this study obtains all available Sentinel-2 images covering the research area from 2019 to 2021, calculates the spectral index of single-phase and multi-temporal synthesis images, takes the spectral index and band of each image as the input, and employs the random forest regression algorithm to evaluate the performance of SOM prediction using remote sensing images with different time windows. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is generally improved compared to using only the band; (2) when using single-phase images, the R-2 range of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is from 0.16 to 0.59 and the RMSE ranges from 0.82% to 1.23%; When using multi-temporal synthesis images, the R-2 range of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is from 0.18 to 0.56 and the RMSE ranges from 0.85% to 1.19%; (3) the highest accuracy of SOM prediction using synthetic images is lower than that of single-phase images; (4) the best time window of the bare soil period in the study area is May. This study emphasizes the importance of the time window to SOM prediction. In subsequent SOM prediction research, remote sensing images with appropriate time windows should be selected first, and then the model should be optimized.

TI  - Poetics of the Medial State of Emily Dickinson's Persona
T2  - JOURNAL OF LITERARY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emily Dickinson, the famous 19th-century American poet with a passion for books, botany, and gardens, spent most of her life secluded in her bedroom, where she wrote some 1,800 poems, published only posthumously. Within four walls, the poet built an imaginary bridge between the real and the unreal. One of the most important characteristics relating to the poet is the unwitting creation of an immanent authorial mythology. This article is an analysis-reflection on the poet's work, her artistic expression, and autofiction. The aim is to highlight the concept of boundary and medial state of the lyrical persona. A linguistic analysis of lexical and semantic syntagms of the poet's works is carried out. The conceptual images of poetics, conveying the receptive potential of the poet's worldview, are determined. Consideration of the use of stylistic forms of the poetic narrative was revealed as a priority for media-oriented analysis.

TI  - Generalized Fine-Resolution FPAR Estimation Using Google Earth Engine: Random Forest or Multiple Linear Regression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of fine-resolution fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is urgently needed for modeling land surface processes at finer scales. While traditional methods can hardly balance universality, efficiency, and accuracy, methods using coarse-resolution products as a reference are promising for operational fine-resolution FPAR estimation. However, current methods confront major problems of underrepresentation of FPAR-reflectance relations within coarse-resolution FPAR products, particularly for densely vegetated areas. To overcome this limitation, this article has developed an enhanced scaling method that proposes an outlier removal procedure and a method weighting the selected samples and models FPAR through weighted multiple linear regression (MLR) between the coarse-resolution FPAR product and the aggregated fine-resolution surface reflectance. Meanwhile, a random forest regression (RFR) method has also been implemented for comparison. Both methods were particularly applied to Landsat 8 OLI and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) FPAR data on the Google earth engine. Their performance was tested on a regional scale for an entire year. The results of the enhanced scaling method were closer to the in situ measurements (RMSE = 0.058 and R-2 = 0.768) and were more consistent with the MODIS FPAR (RMSE = 0.091 and R-2 = 0.894) than those of the RFR, particularly over densely vegetated pixels. This indicates that a well-designed simple MLR-based method can outperform the more sophisticated RFR method. The enhanced scaling method is also less sensitive to the number of training samples than the RFR method. Moreover, both methods are insensitive to land cover maps, and their computation efficiency depends on the number of images to be estimated.

TI  - A General Dual-Branch Framework for Land Cover Mapping Models With Multispectral Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping based on multispectral images can, in principle, be considered an application of semantic segmentation, but land cover mapping inputs include near-infrared (NIR) data in addition to RGB data. It has been experimentally found that LULC mapping performance based on RGB data alone is better than that based on RGB and NIR data when using some established single-branch encoder-decoder models. To address this issue, we propose a dual-branch encoder-decoder (DBED) framework that can be applied to existing encoder-decoder models for semantic segmentation. First, the multispectral input data is divided into two parts: RGB and NIR and fed to the respective branch for encoding. The dual-branch structure facilitates cross-modal complementary information encoding without deteriorating the original RGB modality-specific feature extraction. Second, an attention module named the multispectral attention module (MSAM) is proposed to mine the contextual correlation between the multispectral feature maps, leading to further performance boosting. We apply this framework to three mainstream semantic segmentation models and validate it on the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID). Experimental results show that this structure brings performance improvements. The source code of DBED is publicly available at https://github.com/MalignusCN/DBED.

TI  - Attention Multilayer Perceptron Fusion Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rise of downstream image tasks, the requirements for the quality of images obtained upstream are becoming higher and higher. In view of the many structural features of remote sensing images, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture for hyperspectral image fusion that integrates attention mechanisms and multi-layer perceptron blocks. The proposed network can capture long-range spatial dependencies between image elements, which is critical for capturing multi-scale features in remote sensing applications. The attention mechanisms selectively focus on important image features while disregarding redundant information, and the multi-layer perceptron blocks can capture multi-scale features by processing image features at different scales. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both objective evaluation metrics and visual quality. The proposed method achieves higher Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Spatial Consistency and Contrast values compared to other methods while preserving fine details and textures in the fused images. Overall, the proposed network provides an effective and efficient solution for hyperspectral image fusion that can contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable remote sensing applications.

Taking Caohai National Nature Reserve (CNNR) as the research object, three polarization combinations of two backscattering coefficients and 10 vegetation indexes were extracted from the GF-3 and Sentinel-2A, and the correlation between them and biomass were analyzed. Then, the AGB estimation models based on the integration of optical image and radar image were constructed. Based on the above research, the integration of optical and radar remote sensing was able to obtain the complete spatial distribution of biomass in the study area; which serves as a good reference value for the estimation of grassland AGB in cloudy and rainy areas.

TI  - Hidden Feature-Guided Semantic Segmentation Network for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools. However, the existing CNN-based methods have the problems of feature information loss, serious interference by clutter information, and ignoring the correlation between different scale features. To solve these problems, this article proposes a novel hidden feature-guided semantic segmentation network (HFGNet) for remote sensing images, which achieves accurate semantic segmentation by hierarchically extracting and fusing valuable feature information. Specifically, the hidden feature extraction module (HFE-M) is introduced to suppress the salient feature representation to mine more valuable hidden features. Meanwhile, the multifeature interactive fusion module (MIF-M) establishes the correlation between different features to achieve hierarchical feature fusion. The multiscale feature calibration module (MSFC) is constructed to enhance the diversity and refinement representation of hierarchical fusion features. Besides, the local-channel attention mechanism (LCA-M) is designed to improve the feature perception capability of the object region and suppress background information interference. We conducted extensive experiments on the widely used ISPRS 2-D Semantic Labeling dataset and the 15-Class Gaofen Image dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HFGNet has advantages over several state-of-the-art methods. The source code and models are available at https://github.com/darkseid-arch/RS-HFGNet.

TI  - Continuous Change Detection of Flood Extents With Multisource Heterogeneous Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood monitoring is of crucial importance for protecting lives and properties. Change detection (CD) methods on multisource remote sensing images have been widely used for flood extent monitoring. In this article, we propose a spatiotemporal fusion CD (STFCD) algorithm, exploiting the spatial dependence and temporal interaction of multisource heterogeneous (MSH) satellite image time series (SITS), to realize improved flood CD performance in comparison with existing methods. The proposed STFCD algorithm mainly contains two steps, i.e., spatial clustering and temporal fusion (TF). In the spatial clustering step, we propose a sparse Markov random field (MRF)-based strategy to exploit contextually spatial features in each image of MSH-SITS, which provides a larger local receptive field than the commonly used MRF. In the TF step, the historical information of flood detection results is employed as constraints to effectively reduce the effects of terrain shadows in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and cloud shadows and topography shadows in optical images on flood CD results of existing methods in accordance with the temporal dependence among MSH-SITS. Experiments on real MSH-SITS (containing Gaofen-1, Gaofen-3, Gaofen-6, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellite images) covering Chinese Amur and Huma Rivers show that the overall flood CD accuracy of our proposed STFCD algorithm is higher than the other commonly used algorithms for CD of flood extents and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed STFCD algorithm.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on 3-D change detection (3DCD) become a research hotspot with the development of 3-D sensors. However, most of the 3DCD works are focused on remote sensing data. In the field of street-level 3-D data, the related works are under investigation. The two main challenges are the lack of pointwise annotated datasets and a universal detection framework. In this article, we proposed an end-to-end point-based network named 3DCDNet and a new dataset named street-level point cloud change detection (SLPCCD) dataset to deliver street-level 3DCD task. To structure the proposed 3DCDNet, a local feature aggregation (LFA) module and a nearest feature difference (NFD) module are introduced. The LFA is capable of extracting point features and aggregating local information, which is an effective neural module for embedding point cloud features. By stacking multiple LFA blocks, the proposed network can be good at establishing relationships between different points and embedding semantically rich features. Different from the CD in images, another crucial point in 3DCD is how to identify changes since point clouds are unstructured data. In order to deliver this challenge, the NFD module is introduced to identify change results using the nearest query operation. Extensive experiments were implemented on the manually annotated SLPCCD dataset as well as another benchmark called Urb3DCD to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the introduced network. It demonstrates that the proposed network outperforms popular existing approaches. The source code and the annotated dataset are available at: https://github.com/wangle53/3DCDNet.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatio-Temporal Distribution of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> in the Yellow Sea (2020-2022) Based on Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The green tide caused by Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera) is becoming more severe as climate change and human activity accelerate, endangering tourism, aquaculture, and urban landscapes in coastal cities. In order to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of U. prolifera in response to the green tide disaster, this study used the Haiyang-1C (HY-1C) satellite accompanied by the Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellites to systematically monitor U. prolifera between 2020 and 2022. The consistency of U. prolifera distribution between the HY-1C and Sentinel-2 satellites, as well as the HY-1C and GF-1 satellites, was first investigated and the determination coefficients (R-2) were 0.966 and 0.991, respectively, which supports the feasibility of China's first ocean water color operational satellite, HY-1C, for U. prolifera monitoring. Therefore, the spatio-temporal distribution of U. prolifera is studied herein, along with the influence range, influence area, and drift paths. From 2020 to 2022, U. prolifera appeared in late May and lasted for 61, 88, and 73 days. Additionally, the in influence area continuously decreased in 2020 and 2022, while it generally increased and then decreased in 2021. It is an interesting phenomenon that when the maximum influence area occurred at the early stage of U. prolifera in both 2020 and 2022, the drift paths tended to move southward after traveling northward. The overall trend of the drift path in 2021 was to head northward. Thus, the study of the dynamic evolution, influence range, influence area, and drift paths of U. prolifera is helpful to promote the systematic development of emergency response mechanisms for U. prolifera.

TI  - Evaluating Urban Vitality of Street Blocks Based on Multi-Source Geographic Big Data: A Case Study of Shenzhen.
T2  - International journal of environmental research and public health
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Urban vitality is the comprehensive form of regional development quality, sustainability, and attractiveness. Urban vitality of various regions within the cities has difference, and the quantitative evaluation of urban vitality within the cities can help guide to future city constructions. Evaluation of urban vitality needs the combination of multi-source data. Existing studies have developed index method and estimation models mainly based on geographic big data to evaluate urban vitality. This study aims to combine remote sensing data with geographic big data to evaluate urban vitality of Shenzhen at street block scale and build the estimation model by random forest method. Indexes and random forest model were built, and some further analyses were conducted. The results were: (1) urban vitality in Shenzhen was high in the coastal areas, business areas, and new towns; (2) compared to indexes, the estimation model had advantages of more accurate results, combination of various data, and the ability to analyze feature contributions; and (3) taxi trajectory, nighttime light, and housing rental data had the strongest influence on urban vitality.

TI  - Hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat interventions for young children with iron-deficiency anaemia in The Gambia: an individually randomised, three-arm, double-blind, controlled, proof-of-concept, non-inferiority trial
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutritional disorder worldwide. Iron supplementation has modest efficacy, causes gastrointestinal side-effects that limit compliance, and has been associated with serious adverse outcomes in children across low-income settings. We aimed to compare two hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat regimens designed to reduce overall iron dosage by targeting its administration to periods when children were safe and ready to receive iron supplementation, with WHO's recommendation of universal iron supplementation.Methods We conducted an individually randomised, three-arm, double-blind, controlled, proof-of-concept, noninferiority trial in 12 rural communities across The Gambia. Eligible participants were children aged 6-23 months with anaemia. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either the WHO recommended regimen of one sachet of multiple micronutrient powder (MMP) daily containing 12 center dot 0 mg iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate (control group); to MMP with 12 center dot 0 mg per day iron for the next 7 days if plasma hepcidin concentration was less than 5 center dot 5 mu g/L, or to MMP without iron for the next 7 days if plasma hepcidin concentration was at least 5 center dot 5 mu g/L (12 mg screen-and-treat group); or to MMP with 6 center dot 0 mg per day iron for the next 7 days if plasma hepcidin concentration was less than 5 center dot 5 mu g/L, or to MMP without iron for the next 7 days if plasma hepcidin concentration was at least 5 center dot 5 mu g/L (6 mg screen-and-treat group). Randomisation was done by use of a permuted block design (block size of 9), with stratification by haemoglobin and age, using computer-generated numbers. Participants and the research team (except for the data manager) were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was haemoglobin concentration, with a non-inferiority margin of -5 g/L. A per-protocol analysis, including only children who had consumed at least 90% of the supplements (ie, supplement intake on >= 75 days during the study), was done to assess non-inferiority of the primary outcome at day 84 using a one-sided t test adjusted for multiple comparisons. Safety was assessed by use of ex-vivo growth tests of Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes and three species of sentinel bacteria in plasma samples from participants. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN07210906.Findings Between April 23, 2014, and Aug 7, 2015, we prescreened 783 children, of whom 407 were enrolled into the study: 135 were randomly assigned to the control group, 136 to the 12 mg screen-and-treat group, and 136 to the 6 mg screen-and-treat group. 345 (85%) children were included in the per-protocol population: 115 in the control group, 116 in the 12 mg screen-and-treat group, and 114 in the 6 mg screen-and-treat group. Directly observed adherence was high across all groups (control group 94 center dot 8%, 12 mg screen-and-treat group 95 center dot 3%, and 6 mg screen-and-treat group 95 center dot 0%). 82 days of iron supplementation increased mean haemoglobin concentration by 7 center dot 7 g/L (95% CI 3 center dot 2 to 12 center dot 2) in the control group. Both screen-and-treat regimens were significantly less efficacious at improving haemoglobin (-5 center dot 6 g/L [98 center dot 3% CI -9 center dot 9 to -1 center dot 3] in the 12 mg screen-and-treat group and -7 center dot 8 g/L [98 center dot 3% CI -12 center dot 2 to -3 center dot 5] in the 6 mg screen-and-treat group) and neither regimen met the preset non-inferiority margin of -5 g/L. The 12 mg screen-and-treat regimen reduced iron dosage to 6 center dot 1 mg per day and the 6 mg screen-and-treat regimen reduced dosage to 3 center dot 0 mg per day. 580 adverse events were observed in 316 participants, of which eight were serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation mainly due to diarrhoeal disease (one [1%] participant in the control group, three [2%] in the 12 mg screen-and-treat group, and four [3%] in the 6 mg screen-and-treat group). The most common causes of non-serious adverse events (n=572) were diarrhoea (145 events [25%]), upper respiratory tract infections (194 [34%]), lower respiratory tract infections (62 [11%]), and skin infections (122 [21%]). No adverse events were deemed to be related to the study interventions.Interpretation The hepcidin-guided screen-and-treat strategy to target iron administration succeeded in reducing overall iron dosage, but was considerably less efficacious at increasing haemoglobin and combating iron deficiency and anaemia than was WHO's standard of care, and showed no differences in morbidity or safety outcomes.Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Genomic Determinants of Pathogenicity and Antimicrobial Resistance of Nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii Clinical Isolates of Hospitalized Patients (2019-2021) from a Sentinel Hospital in Hangzhou, China
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii or AB) is one of the most opportunistic, nosocomial pathogens threatening public healthcare across countries. A. baumannii has become a primary growing concern due to its exceptional ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple antimicrobial agents which is increasingly reported and more prevalent every year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the AMR knowledge of A. baumannii for effective clinical treatment of nosocomial infections. This study aimed to investigate the clinical distribution AMR phenotypes and genotypes, and genomic characteristics of A. baumannii isolates recovered from hospitalized patients of different clinical departments of a sentinel hospital to improve clinical practices.Methods: A total of 123 clinical isolates were recovered from hospitalized patients of different clinical departments during 2019- 2021 to analyze AMR patterns, and further subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) investigations. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), as well as the presence of antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs) and insertion sequences (ISs) were also investigated from WGS data.Results: The results highlighted that A. baumannii clinical isolates had shown a high AMR rate, particularly from the intensive care unit (ICU), towards routinely used antimicrobials, ie, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones. ST2 was the most prevalent ST in the clinical isolates, it was strongly associated to the resistance of cephalosporins and carbapenems, with blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-66 being the most frequent determinants; moreover, high carrier rate of VFGs was also observed such as all strains containing the ompA, adeF, pgaC, lpsB, and bfmR genes.Conclusion: Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates are mostly ST2 with high rates of drug resistance and carrier of virulence factors. Therefore, it requires measurements to control its transmission and infection.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use Types, Soil Properties, and Topography on Baseflow Recharge and Prediction in an Agricultural Watershed
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Baseflow is an essential component of runoff, which is the dominant water resource for the dry season. To better manage water resources, it is vital to investigate the links between the multiple influencing factors and the baseflow for better prediction in light of global changes. Previous studies have seldom separated these influencing factors in the analysis, making it difficult to determine their effect on the baseflow. In this study, based on the analysis datasets generated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, the control single variables, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression (MRL) methods were firstly combined to analyze the influences of the chosen factors (land use, topography, and soil type) on the baseflow. The findings revealed that the ability of precipitation to replenish the baseflow was better in areas with a higher slope. The ability of precipitation to recharge the baseflow for different land uses was ranked as "forest land > grass land > agricultural land > urban land"; land use factors should be added to the baseflow prediction equation. The hydrological group is the main property of soil affecting the baseflow recharge. A regression model established using publicly acquired remote sensing data had a good performance (R-2 = 0.84) on baseflow prediction on an annual scale. As a result of this information, relevant government officials and environmentalists may better manage water supplies in drought years. In addition, this regression model frame has the potential to be used for a baseflow inquiry inside an ungauged zone for a better ecological assessment.

TI  - Multiyear Mapping of Water Demand at Crop Level: An End-to-End Workflow Based on High-Resolution Crop Type Maps and Meteorological Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel system that produces multiyear high-resolution irrigation water demand maps for agricultural areas, enabling a new level of detail for irrigation support for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. The system is based on a scalable distributed deep learning (DL) model trained on dense time series of Sentinel-2 images and a large training set for the first year of observation and fine tuned on new labeled data for the consecutive years. The trained models are used to generate multiyear crop type maps, which are assimilated together with the Sentinel-2 dense time series and the meteorological data into a physically based agrohydrological model to derive the irrigation water demand for different crops. To process the required large volume of multiyear Copernicus Sentinel-2 data, the software architecture of the proposed system has been built on the integration of the Food Security thematic exploitation platform (TEP) and the data-intensive artificial intelligence Hopsworks platform. While the Food Security TEP provides easy access to Sentinel-2 data and the possibility of developing processing algorithms directly in the cloud, the Hopsworks platform has been used to train DL algorithms in a distributed manner. The experimental analysis was carried out in the upper part of the Danube Basin for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 considering 37 Sentinel-2 tiles acquired in Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Germany.

TI  - Investigating ground deformation due to a series of collapse earthquakes by means of the PS-InSAR technique and Sentinel 1 data in Kandy, Sri Lanka
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have rarely been applied to detect displacement due to low-magnitude (5.5 >= M) earthquakes. This study exploits the combined permanent scatterer (PS) interferometry (PS-InSAR) and differential interferometry (D-InSAR) methods to investigate the deformation rates due to low-magnitude partial series of collapse earthquakes. Kandy, the hill capital of Sri Lanka, was experiencing a series of collapsed earthquakes. Historical geological evidence of dynamic topography with prolonged vertical movement further promotes the initiatory InSAR investigation. A series of Sentinel 1A images from the years 2019 to 2021 were employed. Initial D-InSAR near-zero baseline analysis suggested possible displacement in the range of -10 mm / year and +2 mm / year for subsidence and uplift, respectively. Using these prior motion velocities, the temporal coherence was optimized in PS-InSAR. Variogram models and ordinary Kriging (OK) were employed to predict deformation for the areas with limited PS detection. Descending orbits images PS show a dominant uplift of +20 mm / year, which are concentrated over Kandy urban areas. Movements along the ascending line of sight at Victoria Dam in the south are in the range of -40 mm / year. Slopes along the Mahaweli river lineament to the east show subsidence in the range of -29 to 36 mm / year. The coregistered landslide hazard map of Kandy shows deformation areas are exposed to landslide risk. Changes in terrestrial and ground water levels measured with the gravity recovery and climate experiment/GRACE-Follow-On during the period reveal significant irregularities. The study can be considered a prototype example that can be extended to investigate low-magnitude incomplete collapse earthquakes in different geological and geotechnical setups for ground deformation.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mechanisms behind the phenomenon of Arctic amplification are widely discussed. To contribute to this debate, the (AC)(3) project was established in 2016 (www.ac3-tr.de/). It comprises modeling and data analysis efforts as well as observational elements. The project has assembled a wealth of ground-based, airborne, shipborne, and satellite data of physical, chemical, and meteorological properties of the Arctic atmosphere, cryosphere, and upper ocean that are available for the Arctic climate research community. Short-term changes and indications of long-term trends in Arctic climate parameters have been detected using existing and new data. For example, a distinct atmospheric moistening, an increase of regional storm activities, an amplified winter warming in the Svalbard and North Pole regions, and a decrease of sea ice thickness in the Fram Strait and of snow depth on sea ice have been identified. A positive trend of tropospheric bromine monoxide (BrO) column densities during polar spring was verified. Local marine/biogenic sources for cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles were found. Atmospheric-ocean and radiative transfer models were advanced by applying new parameterizations of surface albedo, cloud droplet activation, convective plumes and related processes over leads, and turbulent transfer coefficients for stable surface layers. Four modes of the surface radiative energy budget were explored and reproduced by simulations. To advance the future synthesis of the results, cross-cutting activities are being developed aiming to answer key questions in four focus areas: lapse rate feedback, surface processes, Arctic mixed-phase clouds, and airmass transport and transformation.

TI  - Multimodal and Multitemporal Land Use/Land Cover Semantic Segmentation on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery: An Application on a MultiSenGE Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global change, up-to-date land use land cover (LULC) maps is a major challenge to assess pressures on natural areas. These maps also allow us to assess the evolution of land cover and to quantify changes over time (such as urban sprawl), which is essential for having a precise understanding of a given territory. Few studies have combined information from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, but merging radar and optical imagery has been shown to have several benefits for a range of study cases, such as semantic segmentation or classification. For this study, we used a newly produced dataset, MultiSenGE, which provides a set of multitemporal and multimodal patches over the Grand-Est region in France. To merge these data, we propose a CNN approach based on spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral feature fusion, ConvLSTM+Inception-S1S2. We used a U-Net base model and ConvLSTM extractor for spatio-temporal features and an inception module for the spatio-spectral features extractor. The results show that describing an overrepresented class is preferable to map urban fabrics (UF). Furthermore, the addition of an Inception module on a date allowing the extraction of spatio-spectral features improves the classification results. Spatio-spectro-temporal method (ConvLSTM+Inception-S1S2) achieves higher global weighted F1Score than all other methods tested.

TI  - Integrating Racism as a Sentinel Indicator in Public Health Surveillance and Monitoring Systems
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate public health surveillance and monitoring systems' (PHSMS) efforts to collect, monitor, track, and analyze racism.Methods. We employed an environmental scan approach. We defined key questions and data to be collected, conducted a literature review, and synthesized the results by using a qualitative description approach.Results. We identified 125 PHSMS; only 3-the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System, and California Health Interview Survey-collected and reported data on individual-level racism. Structural racism was not collected in PHSMS; however, we observed evidence for linkages to census and administrative data sets or social media sources to assess structural racism.Conclusions. There is a paucity of PHSMS that measure individual-level racism, and few systems are linked to structural racism measures.Public Health Implications. Adopting a standard practice of racism surveillance can advance equity-centered public health praxis, inform policy, and foster greater accountability among public health practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers. Failure to explicitly address racism and the insufficient capacity to support a robust health equity data infrastructure severely impedes efforts to address and dismantle systemic racism.

T2  - FLUVIAL MEGAFANS ON EARTH AND MARS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Using a variety of remotely-sensed data, a worldwide survey of river-generated megafans is presented. Thus far, 272 partial cones reaching minimum lengths and widths of 80 km and 40 km, respectively, have been identified. They all indicate large areas of fluvially-laid sediment distant from present or past shorelines. This more than doubles prior counts of fans of these dimensions, partly as a result of using a different set of criteria. All are visible either as pristine or degraded features, and it is likely that more will be found as older, more eroded individual occurrences are identified. The greatest numbers are found in Asia (n = 87), from Iraq to the clusters of megafans on the south flank of the Himalaya, and also in central Asia. Africa displays a similar number (n = 87), almost all related to relatively low-relief topographic swells. In South America (n = 60), most megafans are found clustered along the east flanks of the Andes Mountains and include the longest known example (704 km). Few occur in Europe (n = 9) or North America (n = 1), in both cases as a result of incisional fluvial regimes operating almost continent wide. Australia hosts 28 megafans. River-generated fans with smaller dimensions are numerous on all continents, however.

TI  - Aboriginal Kinship Carers and Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in Western Australia: Advancing Knowledge from an Indigenous and Disability Lens
T2  - FIRST PEOPLES CHILD & FAMILY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Children and youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have limited access to assessment, diagnostic, and treatment resources - a distinct disadvantage in meeting their care needs in Australia. Limited knowledge exists on the intersection of FASD, Indigeneity, racism, trauma, and child welfare involvement. Notably, the lack of support for children with FASD increases the risk of adverse outcomes, including incarceration, homelessness, mental health problems, and early mortality. Children with FASD are often cared for in the child protection system by kinship carers, many without a diagnosis or the benefits of FASD informed care. Rarely considered is the Australian response to FASD or the Aboriginal worldview on disability. Qualitative research was utilized to conduct semi-structured interviews with six carers of Indigenous children with FASD-three foster carers and three relative or kinship carers. Seven core themes identified by carers included: FASD awareness, caregiver health, advocacy for the child, mothers of the children with FASD, loss and grief experienced by the carer, social costs, and children in child protection care. Carers identified that limited resources existed to address the disabilities and care needs of children, including training and respite. Financial disparity exists with relative carers receiving less income than foster carers. Carers demonstrated advocacy, resiliency, and resourcefulness in providing care. A lack of knowledge of FASD and core resources in child welfare services were identified as major challenges in providing care. This research examined the caregiving experiences of foster and Aboriginal kinship carers, caring for children with FASD in child protection.

TI  - An application of the Causal Roadmap in two safety monitoring case studies: Causal inference and outcome prediction using electronic health record data.
T2  - Journal of clinical and translational science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Real-world data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, are increasingly used for safety monitoring and to help guide regulatory decision-making. In these settings, it is important to document analytic decisions transparently and objectively to assess and ensure that analyses meet their intended goals.Methods: The Causal Roadmap is an established framework that can guide and document analytic decisions through each step of the analytic pipeline, which will help investigators generate high-quality real-world evidence.Results: In this paper, we illustrate the utility of the Causal Roadmap using two case studies previously led by workgroups sponsored by the Sentinel Initiative - a program for actively monitoring the safety of regulated medical products. Each case example focuses on different aspects of the analytic pipeline for drug safety monitoring. The first case study shows how the Causal Roadmap encourages transparency, reproducibility, and objective decision-making for causal analyses. The second case study highlights how this framework can guide analytic decisions beyond inference on causal parameters, improving outcome ascertainment in clinical phenotyping.Conclusion: These examples provide a structured framework for implementing the Causal Roadmap in safety surveillance and guide transparent, reproducible, and objective analysis.

TI  - Urban tree pests can support biological control services in landscape shrubs
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Scale insects are common tree pests in urban ecosystems. Although severe scale infestations can worsen tree condition, trees can tolerate moderate scale densities. Scale insects are prey for many arthropod natural enemies that also feed on plant pests throughout urban landscapes. Because scale-infested trees support natural enemy communities, they may support biological control services on nearby plants and function analogously to banker plants in greenhouse production systems. In this study, we tested if sentinel insect prey were more likely to be removed on shrubs below scale-infested trees compared to scale-uninfested trees. We conducted several biological control experiments from 2019-2021 using fruit flies, aphids, and caterpillars in potted and planted holly shrubs below scale-infested and scale-uninfested oak trees. We found that caterpillars in potted shrubs and fruit flies in planted landscape shrubs were more likely to be removed underneath scale-infested trees compared to scale-uninfested trees. Caterpillars were also more likely to be removed from landscape Ilex vomitoria shrubs compared to I. cornuta shrubs. In all other experiments, we found no effect of scale infestation status or shrub species on prey removal. Our results suggest that scale-infested trees can support biological control services in shrubs below them but that this effect can vary depending on prey and shrub species. The natural enemy communities in urban trees and shrubs appear to be linked and tolerating tree pests can favor conservation biological control services in urban landscapes.

TI  - Assessing Changes in Land Use/Land Cover and Ecological Risk to Conserve Protected Areas in Urban-Rural Contexts
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes in response to natural factors and human activities constitute a pressing issue for the conservation of Protected Areas in urban-rural landscapes. The present study investigated LULC changes in the Jajrud Protected Area (JPA) and the Kavdeh Wildlife Refuge (KWR) in the Tehran province, Iran, between 1989 and 2019. To inform ecological conservation measures for the JPA and KWR, LULC changes were identified and monitored using Landsat imagery from between 1989 and 2019. In addition, the landscape ecological risk (ER) was evaluated by conducting a landscape pattern index analysis. Then, the importance of different indicators affected by ER in these two PAs was assessed using the Delphi method, and expert opinions were solicited through a questionnaire. As for LULC changes in the JPA, high-density pasture declined the most over 1989-2019, from 38.6% (29,241 ha) to 37.7% (28,540 ha). In contrast, built-up areas increased the most, from 10.4% (7895 ha) in 1989 to 11.9% (9048 ha) in 2019. Water bodies also increased, from 0.88% (676 ha) in 1989 to 0.94% (715 ha) in 2019. In the KWR, cropland and gardens increased the most, from 2.14% (1647 ha) in 1989 to 3.4% (2606 ha) in 2019. Built-up areas also increased, from 0.05% (45 ha) in 1989 to 0.09% (75 ha) in 2019. Water bodies increased from 0.69% (538 ha) in 1989 to 0.71% (552 ha) in 2019. Finally, high-density pasture decreased the most, from 29.4% (22,603 ha) in 1989 to 28.5% (21,955 ha) in 2019. At the same time, the high and very high ER classes increased, more so in the JPA compared to the KWR. Finally, considering both LULC and ER changes, the Delphi method demonstrated that the greatest impacts occurred in the JPA. Various illegal economic and physical activities have created LULC changes and caused extensive destruction of ecosystems, posing a high ER in the study areas. The intensity of ER differs between the two PAs because of the varying distance from the metropolis, varying degrees of human activities, LULC changes, along with differences in legal restrictions of use. Aligned with the management plans of these areas, our research shows that it is necessary to develop land only within the designated zones to minimize the amount of ER. Various models of LULC changes have been presented, and a comparison of these models relating to the methodology and model effectiveness can help increase their accuracy and power of interpretation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Small Arctic catchments that are sensitive to climate change reinforced by Arctic amplification remain poorly studied. Since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) glaciers on Svalbard have been retreating, and thus, many catchments have transformed from glaciated or partly glaciated to ice-free conditions. Our study focuses on changes that have occurred since the end of the LIA in a small High Arctic mountain catchment, Bratteggdalen. In this study, we traced changes in the Bratteggbreen glacier areal extent since 1976 with parallel vegetation analysis using Landsat and Sentinel data. The geomorphology of Bratteggdalen was mapped and basic morphometric analyses, such as long profile, hypsometric curve, slope and aspect orientation analyses were carried out. We also present a map of landforms in Bratteggdalen based on a fieldwork in 2018 and an analysis of orthophotomaps. Through this research, we enhance the knowledge of small catchments in polar regions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this work was to describe the experiences of EMS personnel in responding to drug overdose-related calls and the impact the pandemic has had to help better inform current response and treatment efforts.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 99 EMS personnel across 18 areas throughout the United States that were designated as Early Warning Network sentinel sites by the National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded National Drug Early Warning System. Participants were asked about topics including the potential burdens from the pandemic and the opioid crisis. We coded the interview responses and identified themes through qualitative analysis. Multiple cycles of descriptive coding, recoding, subcoding, pattern-coding, and thematic coding of responses were conducted.Results: Responses were categorized into the following themes: 1) being over-worked from increased call volume; 2) increased risk for personal harm when responding to patients; 3) compassion fatigue due to long hours and repeat calls for the same people; 4) conflicting perceptions of the utility of naloxone; 5) the need for better treatment options to respond to opioid crisis on top of COVID-19.Conclusions: The burden of the substance use disorder (SUD) crisis on EMS personnel has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. These reports from EMS personnel throughout the US can help inform policy and procedures to better protect the mental health of EMS personnel and to ensure better care for patients with SUD. These experiences and recommendations may be of use for other countries as substance use and COVID-19 are global health issues.

Using electronic medical record (EMR) data for an interrupted time series study, the authors examined the relationship between antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and the COVID-19 pandemic. The main outcome of the study was to gauge the proportion of RTI encounters with an antibiotic prescription. The pre-pandemic RTI antibiotic prescribing rate was 27.8%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prescribing dropped significantly by 9.4% (p < 0.001). Almost 750,000 fewer patients could potentially avoid receiving an antibiotic prescription for RTI. The authors also discuss the value of EMR data; their use can help develop insights for health system improvement.

TI  - Removing invasive giant reed reshapes desert riparian butterfly and bird communities

M3  - Software
AB  - Giant reed (Arundo donax) is a prevalent invasive plant in desert riparian ecosystems that threatens wildlife habitat. From 2008 to 2018, under a United States-Mexico partnership, prescribed burns and herbicide applications were used to remove giant reed and promote native revegetation along the Rio Grande - Rio Bravo floodplain in west Texas, USA, and Mexico. Our goal was to explore the effects of the removal efforts on butterfly and bird communities and their habitat along the United States portion of the Rio Grande - Rio Bravo floodplain in Big Bend National Park, Texas. During spring and summer, 2016-2017, we surveyed butterflies, birds, and their habitat using ground-collected and remotely sensed data. Using a variety of generalized linear and N-mixture modeling routines and multivariate analyses, we found that the initial giant reed removal efforts removed key components of riparian habitat leading to reduced butterfly and bird communities. Within several years following management, giant reed levels remained low, while riparian habitat conditions and butterfly and bird communities largely rebounded, including many disturbance-sensitive butterfly species and riparian-associated bird species. Butterflies were most consistently associated with forb and grass cover, and birds with a remotely sensed index of greenness (the normalized difference vegetation index), several vegetation cover types, and habitat heterogeneity, habitat elements that were most common in locations that had the longest time to recover following management actions. Our results suggest that prescribed burns and herbicide applications, when used following protocols to minimize risk to wildlife, can limit the spread of giant reed in desert riparian systems and introduce habitat conditions that support diverse and abundant butterfly and bird communities.

URL https://www.R-project.org/.Funding provided by: Southwest Border Resource Protection Program of the National Park Service*Crossref Funder Registry ID: Award Number: P17AC00085 Sampling design We used a space-for-time sampling design, sampling within the available floodplain area to capture conditions in unburned locations with and without giant reed and burned locations at different times since the last burn. We identified 167 sites distributed throughout the Rio Grande floodplain in BIBE, ranging from Santa Elena Canyon in the western portion of the park to Boquillas Canyon in the east.We used the following criteria to assign sites into 4 management groups, which we used for the basis of our analyses. We used the group recent (n = 21) for sites burned ≤3 years before sampling. These were characterized by bare ground, sparse vegetation, and some resprouting giant reed. The group older (n = 19) described sites burned ≥4 years before sampling. These were characterized by the regrowth of riparian vegetation and some resprouting giant reed. We used the group unburned floodplain (n = 16) for unburned, non-forest sites without significant giant reed cover ([less than]3% cover). We used this group to characterize typical non-forest floodplain conditions. Of the original 167 sites, our analysis included 73 that met the above criteria. The additional 94 sites were primarily in more upland forested floodplain sites (principally honey mesquite gallery forest), which, as previously indicated, was not a target of the management activities Butterfly and bird surveys We surveyed birds and butterflies at each site from May to July 2016 and 2017. We conducted 3 counts at each site each year, with a fourth butterfly count in 2017 to capture mid-summer monsoonal activity. We used 5-minute point counts to record all birds detected by sight or sound within a 100-m radius. To survey butterflies, we established 10 * 100-m belt transects, centered at a bird point count location and oriented approximately parallel to the river. An observer slowly walked the centerline, recording butterflies within a 5-m grid of the observer. Habitat characterization: remote sensing and field surveys We quantified habitat characteristics in the floodplain using a cloud-free NAIP color-infrared air photo mosaic with 1-m2 spatial resolution collected in 2016 (Figure 2). From this image, we computed a vegetation greenness index (the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]). We calculated NDVI for each image pixel, then computed the mean value within each 100-m bird survey radius, excluding water pixels. We also computed image texture as the second-order standard deviation of NDVI, capturing the variability in pixel value greenness across a defined area. We first calculated the standard deviation of pixel values within a 5 * 5-pixel moving window and assigned this value to the center pixel. We then calculated the standard deviation of those values within the 100-m survey radius. We computed the NDVI and habitat heterogeneity calculations using the image analysis and focal stats tools in ArcGIS 10.5.1. To quantify the cover of vegetation classes from the NAIP image, we first defined 4 classes that broadly characterized floodplain vegetation and were relevant for giant reed management and for quantifying riparian wildlife habitat use. These classes were giant reed, xeric woody vegetation, mesic woody vegetation, and low herbaceous vegetation (i.e., forbs and grasses, excluding giant reed).The cover of grass and forb vegetation are important butterfly habitat features that were difficult to distinguish from one another with remote sensing. Therefore, we included these 2 ground-based habitat measures in butterfly analyses, replacing the image-based herbaceous cover estimates. We estimated the proportional cover of forbs and grasses (excluding giant reed) within the butterfly transects by visual estimation in the field using a releve method. Observers walked the length of each transect and sketched the cover of grass and forb vegetation within the 5-m gridded rectangular outline of the transect, from which we estimated cover.

T2  - The Cochrane database of systematic reviews
M3  - Journal Article

M3  - Review
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery is a common treatment option in oral cavity cancer (and less frequently in oropharyngeal cancer) to remove the primary tumour and sometimes neck lymph nodes. People with early-stage disease may undergo surgery alone or surgery plus radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy/biotherapy, or a combination of these. Timing and extent of surgery varies. This is the third update of a review originally published in 2007.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative benefits and harms of different surgical treatment modalities for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 9 February 2022.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared two or more surgical treatment modalities, or surgery versus other treatment modalities, for primary tumours of the oral cavity or oropharynx.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our primary outcomes were overall survival, disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence, and recurrence; and our secondary outcomes were adverse effects of treatment, quality of life, direct and indirect costs to patients and health services, and participant satisfaction. We used standard Cochrane methods. We reported survival data as hazard ratios (HRs). For overall survival, we reported the HR of mortality, and for disease-free survival, we reported the combined HR of new disease, progression, and mortality; therefore, HRs below 1 indicated improvement in these outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.MAIN RESULTS: We identified four new trials, bringing the total number of included trials to 15 (2820 participants randomised, 2583 participants analysed). For objective outcomes, we assessed four trials at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and eight at unclear risk. The trials evaluated nine comparisons; none compared different surgical approaches for excision of the primary tumour. Five trials evaluated elective neck dissection (ND) versus therapeutic (delayed) ND in people with oral cavity cancer and clinically negative neck nodes. Elective ND compared with therapeutic ND probably improves overall survival (HR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.83; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 883 participants; moderate certainty) and disease-free survival (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.70; I2 = 12%; 5 trials, 954 participants; moderate certainty), and probably reduces locoregional recurrence (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; I2 = 0%; 4 trials, 458 participants; moderate certainty) and recurrence (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.70; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 633 participants; moderate certainty). Elective ND is probably associated with more adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.31, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.54; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 746 participants; moderate certainty). Two trials evaluated elective radical ND versus elective selective ND in people with oral cavity cancer, but we were unable to pool the data as the trials used different surgical procedures. Neither study found evidence of a difference in overall survival (pooled measure not estimable; very low certainty). We are unsure if there is a difference in effect on disease-free survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.11; 1 trial, 104 participants; very low certainty) or recurrence (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.33; 1 trial, 143 participants; very low certainty). There may be no difference between the interventions in terms of adverse events (1 trial, 148 participants; low certainty). Two trials evaluated superselective ND versus selective ND, but we were unable to use the data. One trial evaluated supraomohyoid ND versus modified radical ND in 332 participants. We were unable to use any of the primary outcome data. The evidence on adverse events was very uncertain, with more complications, pain, and poorer shoulder function in the modified radical ND group. One trial evaluated sentinel node biopsy versus elective ND in 279 participants. There may be little or no difference between the interventions in overall survival (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; low certainty), disease-free survival (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; low certainty), or locoregional recurrence (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.19; low certainty). The trial provided no usable data for recurrence, and reported no adverse events (very low certainty). One trial evaluated positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) following chemoradiotherapy (with ND only if no or incomplete response) versus planned ND (before or after chemoradiotherapy) in 564 participants. There is probably no difference between the interventions in overall survival (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.31; moderate certainty) or locoregional recurrence (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; moderate certainty). One trial evaluated surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone and provided very low-certainty evidence of better overall survival in the surgery plus radiotherapy group (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.59; 35 participants). The data were unreliable because the trial stopped early and had multiple protocol violations. In terms of adverse events, subcutaneous fibrosis was more frequent in the surgery plus radiotherapy group, but there were no differences in other adverse events (very low certainty). One trial evaluated surgery versus radiotherapy alone for oropharyngeal cancer in 68 participants. There may be little or no difference between the interventions for overall survival (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.09 to 7.46; low certainty) or disease-free survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.22; low certainty). For adverse events, there were too many outcomes to draw reliable conclusions. One trial evaluated surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy versus chemotherapy. We were unable to use the data for any of the outcomes reported (very low certainty).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate-certainty evidence based on five trials that elective neck dissection of clinically negative neck nodes at the time of removal of the primary oral cavity tumour is superior to therapeutic neck dissection, with increased survival and disease-free survival, and reduced locoregional recurrence. There was moderate-certainty evidence from one trial of no difference between positron emission tomography (PET-CT) following chemoradiotherapy versus planned neck dissection in terms of overall survival or locoregional recurrence. The evidence for each of the other seven comparisons came from only one or two studies and was assessed as low or very low-certainty.

TI  - A Vegetation Nighttime Condition Index Derived From the Triangular Feature Space Between Nighttime Light Intensity and Vegetation Index
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) data have been commonly used as a proxy for characterizing socioeconomic activities. Vegetation coverage has been found to be closely and inversely correlated with NTL intensity (NTLI). Although the combination of NTLI and vegetation indices has been studied in various applications, the complex relationship between NTLI and vegetation indices is not yet clear. By analyzing the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NTLI for the mainland China from 2013 to 2021, we found that the scatterplot between NDVI and NTLI exhibits a triangular shape with a physical meaning, which we called the NTLI-NDVI triangular feature space. Using the triangular feature space, we proposed the vegetation nighttime condition index (VNCI), which is defined as the ratio of NTLI differences among pixels with a specific NDVI value. VNCI is closely associated with local urban characteristics and has the ability to increase variation in NTLI conditions within urban areas. To demonstrate the application potential of the NTLI-NDVI triangular feature space and the proposed VNCI, two applications (urban area extraction and socioeconomic parameters estimation) were conducted. In terms of extracting urban areas, VNCI shows a better detection ability (with an average overall accuracy of 85.01%) than the original Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) NTL data and other two existing indices in extracting urban areas. Moreover, we further proposed a simple and novel NTL correcting approach to correct NTL using VNCI, which effectively eliminates the impact of vegetation and enhances the accuracy of estimating socioeconomic parameters. Our findings demonstrated that the VNCI-corrected NTL data show superior performance (with an average R-2 of 0.9) in estimating both the gross domestic product and electric power consumption at the provincial level. We believe the NTLI-NDVI triangular feature space and VNCI hold great potential for NTL-based urban studies.

TI  - Using Continuous Passive Assessment Technology to Describe Health and Behavior Patterns Preceding and Following a Cancer Diagnosis in Older Adults: Proof-of-Concept Case Series Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Describing changes in health and behavior that precede and follow a sentinel health event, such as a cancer diagnosis, is challenging because of the lack of longitudinal, objective measurements that are collected frequently enough to capture varying trajectories of change leading up to and following the event. A continuous passive assessment system that continuously monitors older adults' physical activity, weight, medication-taking behavior, pain, health events, and mood could enable the identification of more specific health and behavior patterns leading up to a cancer diagnosis and whether and how patterns change thereafter. Objective: In this study, we conducted a proof-of-concept retrospective analysis, in which we identified new cancer diagnoses in older adults and compared trajectories of change in health and behaviors before and after cancer diagnosis.Methods: Participants were 10 older adults (mean age 71.8, SD 4.9 years; 3/10, 30% female) with various self-reported cancer types from a larger prospective cohort study of older adults. A technology-agnostic assessment platform using multiple devices provided continuous data on daily physical activity via wearable sensors (actigraphy); weight via a Wi-Fi-enabled digital scale; daily medication-taking behavior using electronic Bluetooth-enabled pillboxes; and weekly pain, health events, and mood with online, self-report surveys.Results: Longitudinal linear mixed-effects models revealed significant differences in the pre-and postcancer trajectories of step counts (P<.001), step count variability (P=.004), weight (P<.001), pain severity (P<.001), hospitalization or emergency room visits (P=.03), days away from home overnight (P=.01), and the number of pillbox door openings (P<.001). Over the year preceding a cancer diagnosis, there were gradual reductions in step counts and weight and gradual increases in pain severity, step count variability, hospitalization or emergency room visits, and days away from home overnight compared with 1 year after the cancer diagnosis. Across the year after the cancer diagnosis, there was a gradual increase in the number of pillbox door openings compared with 1 year before the cancer diagnosis. There was no significant trajectory change from the pre- to post-cancer diagnosis period in terms of low mood (P=.60) and loneliness (P=.22).Conclusions: A home-based, technology-agnostic, and multidomain assessment platform could provide a unique approach to monitoring different types of behavior and health markers in parallel before and after a life-changing health event. Continuous passive monitoring that is ecologically valid, less prone to bias, and limits participant burden could greatly enhance research that aims to improve early detection efforts, clinical care, and outcomes for people with cancer.

TI  - A Method Based on Improved Ant Colony Algorithm Feature Selection Combined With GA-SVR Model for Predicting Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Ulansuhai Lake
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important parameter of water bodies, but due to the complexity of optics in water bodies, it is currently difficult to accurately predict Chl-a concentration in water bodies by traditional methods. In this paper, Sentinel-2 remote sensing images is used as the data source combined with measured data, and Ulansuhai Lake is taken as the study area. An adaptive ant colony exhaustive optimization (A-ACEO) algorithm is proposed for feature selection and combined with a novel intelligent algorithm of optimizing support vector regression (SVR) by genetic algorithm (GA) for prediction of Chl-a concentration. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is improved to select remote sensing feature bands for Chl-a concentration by introducing relevant optimization strategies. The GA-SVR model is built by optimizing SVR using GA with the selected feature bands as input, and comparing with the traditional SVR model. The simulation results show that under the same conditions, using A-ACEO algorithm to select feature bands as inputs can effectively reduce the model complexity, and improve the model prediction performance, which provides a valuable reference for monitoring Chl-a concentration in lakes.

TI  - Downscaling the Midsummer Temperature-Humidity Index Based on Multiple Machine Learning Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the finesse of the temperature-humidity index (THI), this study applies four machine learning methods in THI downscaling, including multiple linear regression, random forest (RF), support vector machine, and gradient boosting machine. The temperature data and specific humidity data of the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) are used to establish a downscaling model, and site observational data are used to test the model precision. By taking land surface temperature (LST), vegetation coverage, altitude, and slope as downscaling factors, the monthly average THI calculated by CLDAS-V2.0 data is downscaled from 6 to 1 km in Anhui Province in July and August from 2002 to 2021. The results show that the spatial resolution of THI is improved effectively by the four downscaling models, and there is a significant correlation between the downscaled values and the site values, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.97. The downscaling effect of RF is slightly better than that of the other three algorithms and better describes the distribution of summer resort resources. Simulated results from RF are piecewise corrected by using the mean variation, and the correlation between corrected values and observations in July and August are both improved (>0.98). According to the estimation of the corrected THI (1 km x 1 km), the proportion of summer resort area in Anhui Province is 9.58% in July and 19.29% in August.

TI  - Retrieving Eutrophic Water in Highly Urbanized Area Coupling UAV Multispectral Data and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urbanization and a population surge, the drawback of water pollution, especially eutrophication, poses a severe threat to ecosystem as well as human well-being. Timely monitoring the variations of water quality is a precedent to preventing the occurrence of eutrophication. Traditional monitoring methods (station monitoring or satellite remote sensing), however, fail to real-time obtain water quality in an accurate and economical way. In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multispectral camera is used to acquire the refined remote sensing data of water bodies. Meanwhile, in situ measurement and sampling in-lab testing are carried out to obtain the observed values of four water quality parameters; subsequently, the comprehensive trophic level index (TLI) is calculated. Then three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) are applied to construct the inversion model for water quality estimation. The measured values of water quality showed that the trophic status of the study area was mesotrophic or light eutrophic, which was consistent with the government's water-control ambition. Among the four water quality parameters, TN had the highest correlation (r = 0.81, p = 0.001) with TLI, indicating that the variation in TLI was inextricably linked to TN. The performances of the three models were satisfactory, among which XGB was considered the optimal model with the best accuracy validation metrics (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.52). The spatial distribution map of water quality drawn by the XGB model was in good agreement with the actual situation, manifesting the spatial applicability of the XGB model inversion. The research helps guide effective monitoring and the development of timely warning for eutrophication.

TI  - Observations and tracing of air quality during the Beijing Winter Olympic Games using Chinese satellite hyperspectral measurements
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2021, China's Gaofen-5B satellite carrying the environmental trace gas monitoring instrument (EMI) was successfully launched, which promoted the self-directed development of remote sensing monitoring in China. During the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Winter Olympics, we used the satellite product to provide remote sensing data support for air quality assurance at the Winter Olympics. This paper introduced the domestic hyperspectral satellite product of tropospheric NO2 retrievals, analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of NO2 pollution in Beijing and its surrounding key cities during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games from January to March, and further discussed the influence of meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emission control measures on the atmospheric NO2 concentration during the Winter Olympic Games. The results showed that the average tropospheric NO2 column concentration in North China during the Winter Olympics was approximately 3.75x10(15) molecules/cm(2), which was significantly lower than that before and after the Winter Olympics. NO2 concentrations in major cities decreased between 53.14% and 70.07%, indicating that the temporary control policy during the Winter Olympics had a significant effect. However, the implementation of the policy varies in different cities, which is consistent with the in situ measurements of NO2 concentration by the national air quality sites. High concentrations of tropospheric NO2 occurred on two days during the event, mainly due to unfavourable wind fields. Moreover, a generalized additive model was established to distinguish and quantify the contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors to the change in tropospheric NO2 concentrations. For example, the decreases in NO2 concentrations in Baoding, Beijing, Tianjin and Taiyuan during the event were 48.2%, 67.5%, 48.8% and 72.8%, respectively, and emission controls and meteorology contributed 41.8%, 32.0%, 30.0%, 42.8% and 6.4%, 35.6%, 18.8%, 30.1%, respectively. In general, the influence of meteorological factors on the sharp decrease in NO2 concentration was significantly weaker than the temporary measures of NOX emission control. Satellite air quality monitoring revealed the spatial and temporal variations in air pollutants during the event. Further analysis based on the GAM model can evaluate the effectiveness of air quality control measures and benefit environmental policy-makers.

TI  - Generating Sentinel-2 all-band 10-m data by sharpening 20/60-m bands: A hierarchical fusion network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observations from the Sentinel-2 mission have been extensively accepted in a variety of land services. The thirteen spectral bands of Sentinel-2, however, are collected at three spatial resolutions of 10/20/60 m, and such a difference brings difficulties to analyze multispectral imagery at a uniform resolution. To address this problem, we developed a hierarchical fusion network (HFN) to sharpen 20/60-m bands and generate Sentinel-2 all-band 10-m data. The deep learning architecture is used to learn the complex mapping between multi-resolution input and output data. Given the deficiency of previous studies in which the spatial information is inferred only from the fine-resolution bands, the proposed hierarchical fusion framework simultaneously leverages the self-similarity information from coarse-resolution bands and the spatial structure information from fine-resolution bands, to enhance the sharpening performance. Technically, the coarse-resolution bands are super-resolved by exploiting the information from themselves and then sharpened by fusing with the fine-resolution bands. Both 20-m and 60-m bands can be sharpened via the developed approach. Experimental results regarding visual comparison and quantitative assessment demonstrate that HFN outperforms the other benchmarking models, including pan-sharpening-based, model-based, geostatistical-based, and other deep-learning-based approaches, showing remarkable performance in reproducing explicit spatial details and maintaining original spectral fea-tures. Moreover, the developed model works more effectively than the other models over the heterogeneous landscape, which is usually considered a challenging application scenario. To sum up, the fusion model can sharpen Sentinel-2 20/60-m bands, and the created all-band 10-m data allows image analysis and geoscience applications to be authentically carried out at the 10-m resolution.

TI  - Dynamic Characteristics of Vegetation Change Based on Reconstructed Heterogenous NDVI in Seismic Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to protect forests and enhance the capacity of mountain ecosystems is highlighted in the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15. The worst-hit areas of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in southwest China were mountainous regions with high biodiversity and the impacted area is typical of other montane regions, with the need for detecting vegetation changes following the impacts of catastrophes. While the widely used remotely sensed vegetation indicator NDVI is available from various satellite data sources, these satellites are available for different monitoring periods and durations. Combining these datasets proved challenging to make a continuous characterization of vegetation change over an extended time period. In this study, compared with linear regression, multiple linear regression, and random forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) performed best with an average R-2 of 0.819 (leave-one-out cross-validation). Thus, the CNNs model was selected to establish the map of the overlapping periods of two remote-sensing products: SPOT-VGT NDVI and PROBA-V NDVI, to reconstruct a SPOT-VGT NDVI for the period from June 2014 to December 2018 in the worst-hit areas of the Wenchuan earthquake. We analyzed the original and reconstructed SPOT-VGT NDVI in the hard-hit areas of the Wenchuan earthquake from 1999 to 2018, and we concluded that NDVI showed an overall upward trend throughout the study period, but experienced a sharp decline in 2008 and reached its lowest value a year later (2009). Vegetation recovery was rapid from 2009 until 2011 after which, it returned to a pattern of slower natural growth (2012-2018). The Longmenshan fault zone experienced the greatest vegetation damage and initiation of recovery there has caused the overall regional average recovery to lag by 1-2 years. In areas where the land was denuded of vegetation (i.e., effectively all vegetation was stripped from the surface) after the earthquake, the damage exceeded what was experienced anywhere else in the entire study area, and by 2018 it remained unrestored. In the 15 years since the earthquake, the areas that were denuded were expected to recover to the level of restoration equivalent with the NDVI of 2007, as was the case in other earthquake-damaged regions. In addition to the earthquake and the immediate loss of vegetation, the Chinese government's Grain for Green Policy, the elevation ranges within the region, the forest's phenological conditions, and human activities all had an impact on vegetation recovery and restoration. The reconstructed NDVI provides a long-term continuous record, which contributes to the identifying changes that are improving predictive forest recovery models and to better vegetation management following catastrophic disturbances, such as earthquakes.

TI  - Improved human greenspace exposure equality during 21st century urbanization.
T2  - Nature communications
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Greenspace plays a crucial role in urban ecosystems and has been recognized as a key factor in promoting sustainable and healthy city development. Recent studies have revealed a growing concern about urban greenspace exposure inequality; however, the extent to which urbanization affects human exposure to greenspace and associated inequalities over time remains unclear. Here, we incorporate a Landsat-based 30-meter time-series greenspace mapping and a population-weighted exposure framework to quantify the changes in human exposure to greenspace and associated equality (rather than equity) for 1028 global cities from 2000 to 2018. Results show a substantial increase in physical greenspace coverage and an improvement in human exposure to urban greenspace, leading to a reduction in greenspace exposure inequality over the past two decades. Nevertheless, we observe a contrast in the rate of reduction in greenspace exposure inequality between cities in the Global South and North, with a faster rate of reduction in the Global South, nearly four times that of the Global North. These findings provide valuable insights into the impact of urbanization on urban nature and environmental inequality change and can help inform future city greening efforts.

TI  - Approach for Monitoring Spatiotemporal Changes in Fractional Vegetation Cover Through Unmanned Aerial System-Guided-Satellite Survey: A Case Study in Mining Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a vital indicator for monitoring regional vegetation and ecology. Although satellite remote sensing is used to monitor long-term changes in regional FVC, its applications are limited by the spatial resolution. Moreover, for unmanned aerial systems (UASs), obtaining long-term and large-scale images is difficult, and the efficiency of the synergy between UAS and satellite data for long-term FVC monitoring is limited. This article considered a mining area with extreme changes in vegetation as an example and proposed an efficient approach called multiple spatiotemporal-scale FVC prediction (MSFP) for long-term FVC monitoring in the region, which is based on the synergy of high spatial-resolution UAS data with high temporal-resolution Landsat data. First, we used the UAS imagery of several typical mining areas in Qianxi County of China collected in 2021, from which the vegetation information was extracted. Second, the 2-D Gaussian sampling was applied to aggregate, that is, to join/connect them into Landsat pixels. The vegetation index (VI) calculated from contemporary Landsat imagery was further used with the aggregated FVC of each satellite pixel. Finally, the VIs from the satellite imagery for different years were calibrated. The analysis demonstrated that: first, the proposed MSFP yielded improved the coefficient of determination (by 0.437) and decreased root-mean-square error (by 0.200) than the traditional dimidiate pixel method based on satellite imagery; second, the UAS imagery for few typical areas was used to predict the FVC of the large-scale area, thereby providing fine-scale vegetation information; third, the MSFP achieved high accuracy and long-term FVC monitoring by interyear calibration of VI calculated from Landsat data. This article paves the way toward accurate long-term monitoring of regional FVC. The demonstrated methodological framework is simple and operable, thereby opening the prospects for its applications in other environments.

TI  - Forest Volume Estimation Method Based on Allometric Growth Model and Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate forest volume is crucial for forest management, but rapid, large-scale, and high-accuracy estimation is still challenging. We proposed a method of coupling allometric growth model and multisource data for forest volume estimation (CAMFVe). First, the diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation model is constructed by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) to obtain more accurate measured volume. Second, the spectral attributes of Landsat and structural attributes of ALS are extracted and upscaled onto the 30-m plot scale, and the optimal attributes for volume estimation are selected. Third, the model of CAMFVe is constructed and applied to obtain the volume of study area. Finally, the applicability of CAMFVe is evaluated under four forest growth environments (different canopy closure and slope categories), and the accuracy is compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show the following. First, the DBH estimation model by TLS and ALS improves the DBH calculation accuracy of ALS with a 2.058 cm reduction in RMSE. Second, the mean of canopy height (H-mean) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are identified as the optimal structural and spectral attributes, respectively. Third, the model constructed by H-mean and EVI consistently achieves higher accuracy for most forest growth environments, and the addition of spectral attribute improves volume estimation accuracy with a 10.152% reduction in RMSE compared with the H-mean-based model. Fourth, compared with MLR, RF, and SVM, CAMFVe offers higher accuracy, requires fewer parameters, and is simpler and more efficient. Our proposed method, based on allometric growth model and utilizing vegetation index instead of DBH, provides a solution for large-scale and high-accuracy volume estimation by combining spaceborne light detection and ranging and optical satellite images.

TI  - SPSI: A Novel Composite Index for Estimating Panicle Number in Winter Wheat before Heading from UAV Multispectral Imagery.
T2  - Plant phenomics (Washington, D.C.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate estimation of panicle number per unit ground area (PNPA) in winter wheat before heading is crucial to evaluate yield potential and regulate crop growth for increasing the final yield. The accuracies of existing methods were low for estimating PNPA with remotely sensed data acquired before heading since the spectral saturation and background effects were ignored. This study proposed a spectral-textural PNPA sensitive index (SPSI) from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery for reducing the spectral saturation and improving PNPA estimation in winter wheat before heading. The effect of background materials on PNPA estimated by textural indices (TIs) was examined, and the composite index SPSI was constructed by integrating the optimal spectral index (SI) and TI. Subsequently, the performance of SPSI was evaluated in comparison with other indices (SI and TIs). The results demonstrated that green-pixel TIs yielded better performances than all-pixel TIs apart from TI[HOM], TI[ENT], and TI[SEM] among all indices from 8 types of textural features. SPSI, which was calculated by the formula DATT[850,730,675] + NDTICOR[850,730], exhibited the highest overall accuracies for any date in any dataset in comparison with DATT[850,730,675], TINDRE[MEA], and NDTICOR[850,730]. For the unified models assembling 2 experimental datasets, the RV2 values of SPSI increased by 0.11 to 0.23, and both RMSE and RRMSE decreased by 16.43% to 38.79% as compared to the suboptimal index on each date. These findings indicated that the SPSI is valuable in reducing the spectral saturation and has great potential to better estimate PNPA using high-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - Pansharpening Using Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Networks With Recursive Mixed-Scale Feature Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Panchromatic sharpening (pansharpening) is an important technology for improving the spatial resolution of multispectral (MS) images. The majority of the models are implemented at the reduced resolution, leading to unfavorable results at the full resolution. Moreover, the complicated relationship between MS and panchromatic (PAN) images is often ignored in detail injection. For the mentioned problems, unsupervised generative adversarial networks with recursive mixed-scale feature fusion for pansharpening (RMFF-UPGAN) are modeled to boost the spatial resolution and preserve the spectral information. RMFF-UPGAN comprises a generator and two U-shaped discriminators. A dual-stream trapezoidal branch is designed in the generator to obtain multiscale information. Further, a recursive mixed-scale feature fusion subnetwork is designed. Perform a prior fusion on the extracted MS and PAN features of the same scale. A mixed-scale fusion is conducted on the prior fusion results of the fine scale and coarse scale. The fusion is executed sequentially in the aforementioned manner building a recursive mixed-scale fusion structure, and finally, generating key information. A compensation information mechanism is also designed for the reconstruction of key information to compensate for information. A nonlinear rectification block for the reconstructed information is developed to overcome the distortion induced by neglecting the complicated relationship between MS and PAN images. Two U-shaped discriminators are designed and a new composite loss function is defined. The presented model is validated using two satellite data and the outcomes reveal better than the prevalent approaches regarding both visual assessment and objective indicators.

TI  - Reconstruction of Gap-Free Land Surface Temperature at a 100 m Spatial Resolution from Multidimensional Data: A Case in Wuhan, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperatures (LST) are vital parameters in land surface-atmosphere interactions. Constrained by technology and atmospheric interferences, LST retrievals from various satellite sensors usually return missing data, thus negatively impacting analyses. Reconstructing missing data is important for acquiring gap-free datasets. However, the current reconstruction methods are limited for maintaining spatial details and high accuracies. We developed a new gap-free algorithm termed the spatial feature-considered random forest regression (SFRFR) model; it builds stable nonlinear relationships to connect the LST with related parameters, including terrain elements, land coverage types, spectral indexes, surface reflectance data, and the spatial feature of the LST, to reconstruct the missing LST data. The SFRFR model reconstructed gap-free LST data retrieved from the Landsat 8 satellite on 27 July 2017 in Wuhan. The results show that the SFRFR model exhibits the best performance according to the various evaluation metrics among the SFRFR, random forest regression and spline interpolation, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) reaching 0.96, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.55, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.55. Then, we reconstructed gap-free LST data gathered in Wuhan from 2016 to 2021 to analyze urban thermal environment changes and found that 2020 presented the coolest temperatures. The SFRFR model still displayed satisfactory results, with an average R-2 of 0.91 and an MAE of 0.63. We further discuss and discover the factors affecting the visual performance of SFRFR and identify the research priority to circumvent these disadvantages. Overall, this study provides a simple, practical method for acquiring gap-free LST data to help us better understand the spatiotemporal LST variation process.

TI  - Mapping Forest Canopy Height at Large Scales Using ICESat-2 and Landsat: An Ecological Zoning Random Forest Approach
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height (FCH) is a crucial indicator in the calculation of forest biomass and carbon sinks. There are various methods to measure FCH, such as space-borne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), but their data are spatially discrete and do not provide continuous FCH maps. Therefore, an FCH estimation method that associates sparse LiDAR data with spatially continuous variables is required. The traditional approach of constructing a single model overlooks the spatial variability in forest growth, which will limit the FCH accuracy. Considering the distinct nature of forest in different ecological zones, the following hold. First, we proposed an ecological zoning random forest (EZRF) model in 33 ecological zones in China. Compared with the total zone RF (TZRF) model, the EZRF model showed a greater potential, which was 21.5%-36.5% more accurate than the TZRF model. Second, we analyzed a total of 62 variables related to forest growth, including Landsat variables and ancillary variables (forest canopy cover, bioclimatic, topographic, and hillshade factors). An insight into variable selection in FCH modeling was provided by analyzing the prediction accuracy of FCH under different categorical variables and analyzing the importance of variables in different ecological zones. Third, finally, we produced a 30-m continuous FCH map by the EZRF model. Compared with the airborne LiDAR data, the FCH prediction results produced a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.50-5.35 m, which were 41%-72% more precisely than the Global FCH, 2019. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and contribute to the study of forest carbon sinks.

TI  - Exploring Convolutional Neural Networks for Predicting Sentinel-C Backscatter Between Image Acquisitions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 C-band radar backscatter satellite images provide a repeating sequence of fine-resolution (10 m) observations that can be used for a number of applications, but the 12-day interval between satellite observations is too infrequent for many applications, such as measuring moisture dynamics. For a variety of applications, moisture information is demanded at high temporal frequency and fine spatial resolution over large areas. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict higher spatial resolutions than the original satellite images, but little effort has been made to increase the temporal resolution of acquired backscatter images. This study extends machine learning approaches to infer fine-resolution backscatter between observations relying on auxiliary data observations, including elevation and daily gridded weather. Several variations of multimodal fully convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, problem setup, and training methods are explored for a predominantly rural area in southwest Oklahoma near the transition between humid subtropical and semiarid climates. The training area lies in the overlap zone for adjacent Sentinel-1 satellite tracks, allowing for training with several different temporal offsets. We find that the U-shaped fully convolutional neural NETwork (UNET) architecture produced the most accurate and robust estimated backscatter patterns, with superior prediction compared to a prior observation baseline in nearly all cases investigated when geography was included in the training data. This superior performance also generalized to nearby areas when training data for a given geography was not available, where 86% of predictions performed superior compared to a prior observation baseline.

TI  - Reflections on the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS; 2006-2023): how population-based research can address Maori outcomes and governance.
T2  - Frontiers in research metrics and analytics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Injury is a leading cause of disability. Twenty years ago, we knew financial costs of injury were high but little was known about the short, medium and long-term outcomes after injury. In 2006, a Pilot Study and engagement with Maori across the country was undertaken to discuss the planned main study to understand how best to design a study that was meaningful and beneficial to Maori and policy-makers. Between 2007-2009, 2,856 injured New Zealanders (including 20% Maori) with an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) entitlement claim were recruited to the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS). Participants shared detailed information (at 3, 12 and 24 months, and 12-years post-injury) about a broad range of topics including: the injury, socio-demographics, health, health services access, employment and wellbeing. Administrative data about injury-related hospitalisations, the sentinel injury and subsequent injuries were also collected, as well as in-depth qualitative interviews. This paper focuses on the why, how and impacts of POIS, especially in relation to Maori design and approaches, capability and capacity building, and leadership. Focusing on these aspects for Maori within POIS over time has ensured delivery of findings capable of informing and improving outcomes and policy. In particular, POIS has had considerable impact, influencing ACC's research strategy and outcomes' focus, and has provided disability, health, and wellbeing outcomes knowledge previously unavailable, especially for Maori.

TI  - Epidemiological/Disease and Economic Burdens of Cervical Cancer in 2010-2014: Are Younger Women at Risk?
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Cervical cancer is an important factor threatening women's health in China. This study examined the epidemiological and economic burden of cervical cancer among the medically insured population, which could provide data support for government departments to formulate policies. Methods: All new cases of cervical cancer under the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) plan in a provincial capital city in eastern China from 2010 to 2014 were collected. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the factors affecting the survival rates for cervical cancer. Outpatient and hospitalization expenses were used to assess the direct economic burden, and the Potential Years of Life Loss (PYLL) and potential economic loss were calculated by the direct method to assess indirect burden. Results: During the observation period, there were 1115 new cases and 137 deaths. The incidence rate was 14.85/100,000 person years, the mortality was 1.82/100,000 person years, and the five-year survival rate was 75.3%. The age of onset was mainly concentrated in the 30-59 age group (82.9%) and the tendency was towards younger populations. The age of onset (HR = 1.037, 95% CI = 1.024-1.051), the frequency of hospitalization services (HR = 1.085, 95% CI = 1.061-1.109), and the average length of stay (ALOS) (HR = 1.020, 95% CI = 1.005-1.051) were the related factors affecting overall survival. Among the direct economic burden, the average outpatient cost was $4314, and the average hospitalization cost was $12,007. The average outpatient and hospitalization costs within 12 months after onset were $2871 and $8963, respectively. As for indirect burden, the average Potential Years of Life Loss (PYLL) was 27.95 years, and the average potential economic loss was $95,200. Conclusions: The epidemiological and economic burden reported in the study was at a high level, and the onset age of cervical patients gradually became younger. The age of onset, the frequency of hospitalization services and the ALOS of cervical cancer patients should be given greater attention. Policymakers and researchers should focus on the trend of younger onset age of cervical cancer and the survival situation within 12 months after onset. Early intervention for cervical cancer patients, particularly younger women, may help reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

TI  - Carbon storage estimation of mountain forests based on deep learning and multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing monitoring of forest carbon storage against the background of climate change is a popular research topic, and multisource remote sensing is significant for improving its accuracy at a regional scale. Improving accuracy at a low cost is a current challenge. In this study, the spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) ICESat-2/advanced terrain laser altimeter system (ATLAS), along with an optimized random forest regression (RF) model and 54 sample plots, was used to obtain early estimates of carbon storage at the canopy scale in the footprints of ICESat-2/ATLAS. On this basis, combined with Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) data and a deep neural network (DNN) model, a regional-scale remote sensing estimation of forest carbon storage in Shangri-La, a mountainous area in Southwest China, was performed. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to assess the estimation results. The results showed that (1) the apparent surface reflectance (ASR) and other parameters of the ATLAS spots had a strong correlation with the carbon storage of mountain forests, and the optimized RF model estimated the carbon storage well at the canopy scale. The modeling accuracy was R-2 = 0.8890, the verification accuracy was R-2 = 0.7750, and the contribution rate of the ASR was 22.76% in the model. (2) Using the carbon storage of 74,873 ATLAS footprints obtained by the RF model as the training sample for deep learning modeling, along with the Landsat 8 OLI vegetation index, a regional-scale forest carbon storage (DNN) estimation model was constructed. The model verification accuracy was R-2 = 0.5433 and RMSE = 6.6402 Mg / ha. (3) The estimated population carbon storage based on the DNN model was 4.717 x 10(7) Mg, with an average value of 49.04 Mg / ha in the study area. The model estimates were valid. In conclusion, the results estimated by a small sample were used as a large sample training dataset for region-scale deep learning, which can be effective in reducing costs.

TI  - High-Confidence Sample Generation Technology and Application for Global Land-Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning technology has become one of the most important technologies in remote sensing land classification applications. Its powerful sample-learning and information-mining abilities promote the continuous improvement of classification accuracy. A large volume of high-quality and representative sample data is the premise for the successful application of deep learning technology. Conventional methods of obtaining samples through manual delineation or surface surveys require a great deal of manpower and material resources. Therefore, the inability to obtain sufficient and widely representative high-quality samples is one of the key factors limiting the application of deep learning technology. In this study, the method of generating sample data obtains high-confidence classification results from a variety of existing high-quality classification products as deep learning samples, which are then used to support the application of deep learning technology for land-cover classification. When the three global land-cover classification products, FROM-GLC-2015, GLC_FCS30-2015, and GlobeLand30, have the same type of discrimination, the sample is considered a high-confidence sample. Based on this, a large volume of sample data widely distributed around the world was obtained. Using the extracted samples, a random forest classifier was trained using multiple types of information from the Landsat data, and land-cover classification was achieved. Application experiments were conducted in several typical regions, and the classification results were verified. The results showed that the classification accuracy of random forests under the support of samples generated using the sample extraction method proposed in this article was considerably higher than that of the three land-cover classification products.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method Integrating Multisource Data for ECMWF Forecasting Products Correction
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate numerical weather prediction is essential for public and commercial meteorological services, but due to the complexity of the meteorological system and the uncertainty of observation data, there may be certain errors in the forecast results. Therefore, this letter proposes a deep learning-based numerical forecast correction network (NFC-Net) that integrates multisource heterogeneous data from FY-4A satellite, digital elevation model (DEM) and ERA5. NFC-Net leverages a spatial resolution alignment module and a spatiotemporal feature extraction module to extract and fuse features from diverse data sources and then applies UNet to correct European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecast products. The model is evaluated using 2 m Temperature (2 m-T) and 10 m Wind Speed (10 m-WS) data, and compared against anomaly numerical-correction with observations (ANOs), Convlstm, and Fuse-CUnet, as well as ERA5 observations. Results demonstrate that NFC-Net outperforms other methods, reducing root mean square error (RMSE) of 2 m-T and 10 m-WS by 49.71% and 50.86%, respectively, compared to ECMWF forecast products. NFC-Net's success highlights the importance of effectively integrating and processing heterogeneous data.

TI  - A Uniform Model for Correcting Shortwave Downward Radiation Over Rugged Terrain at Various Scales
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) plays a major role in the material and energy balance of the Earth's climate system. However, most of the existing SWDR research and products assume that the surface is flat, ignoring the effect of topography. This approach introduces significant uncertainties in the calculated fluxes and smooths the spatial distribution of SWDR. This article proposes a uniform shortwave topographic radiation model (USWTRM) based on the principle of energy conservation. To evaluate the USWTRM, we compared it with the large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework (LESS). The USWTRM performed better than the traditional method in most conditions. For clear sky, when the SZA = 0 degrees, the relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), relative bias (rbias), and R2 of the USWTRM at 1 km were 0.1%, 0.0%, and 1.000, respectively. At SZAs of 20 degrees, 40 degrees, and 60 degrees, the USWTRM also showed better results than the traditional method. Moreover, the USWTRM performed similarly at 3 and 5 km as that of 1 km. For cloudy sky, the rRMSE and rbias of the USWTRM at fine scale were 3.5% and 0.0%, respectively. At 1 km, the rRMSE and rbias of the USWTRM were 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. In particular, the USWTRM outperformed previous studies in accurately quantifying the SWDR over rugged areas, under both clear and cloudy skies. Overall, the analysis reveals that the USWTRM works well over mountainous regions in terms of reliable accuracy, applicability, and generalization. It provides a new perspective for accurately deriving topographic SWDR at various scales and significantly reduces radiation uncertainties over rugged terrain.

TI  - Cloud Coverage Estimation Network for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of cloud detection is to estimate cloud coverage and thus determine whether to transmit remote sensing images to earth or execute subsequent tasks based on cloud coverage. Fast and accurate cloud coverage estimation is a necessary preprocessing step on board. Therefore, we propose a new approach for cloud coverage estimation using a regression network to directly predict the coverage. A cloud coverage estimation network, which is termed (CE)-E-2-Net, is proposed in this work. The proposed network consists of three modules, including an encoder for representation feature extraction, a coverage estimation for predicting the cover rate of clouds, and an auxiliary supervision module for improving the performance of the model. To verify the effectiveness of our method, experiments are performed on two open-source datasets (Landset 8 Biome dataset and GaoFen-1 WFV dataset). Our method effectively improves the efficiency of cloud detection by at least doubling, while keeping the estimation error low.

TI  - A Study of the Method for Retrieving the Vegetation Index from FY-3D MERSI-II Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NDVI data have been widely used to detect and monitor vegetation status at regional, continental, and global scales. FY-3D MERSI-II NDVI (FNDVI) is a critical operational product used in many studies monitoring ecosystems and agriculture and assessing climate change and its risks, including drought and fire. MERSI-II and MODIS have very similar spectral response functions in the red and near-infrared channels, making MERSI/NDVI an effective replacement for MODIS/NDVI (MNDVI). Therefore, it is critical to conduct a thorough evaluation of the product's quality. In this study, the consistency characteristics of two normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products, FY-3D MERSI-II NDVI and MODIS NDVI, were compared and validated at national and regional scales in China from 2020 to 2021. To assess the consistency of these two NDVI datasets, the correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, and mean bias error were used. The findings revealed that the spatial distribution patterns of FNDVI and MNDVI were highly consistent across the country at the monthly time scale. The correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9475 for the two years 2020-2021, while the average deviation was between 0.02 and 0.05, and the root-mean-square error was 0.11. Based on the difference in the time consistency between FNDVI and MNDVI, the changes in the monthly NDVI values of the two types of satellites are generally consistent across the country. Among the three typical experimental areas, the relative deviation of the regional time series for products was the highest in Xinjiang. The relative average deviation of FNDVI in other regions was low, and its change trend was consistent with that of MODIS.

TI  - Design of remote sensing image feature extraction method based on high score 2 wavelet transform
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The feature extraction of Gaofen-2 Remote Sensing Image (RSI) has problems such as poor extraction accuracy and large noise reduction error. Therefore, this paper designs an RSI feature extraction method based on high score 2 wavelet transform (WT). The RSI is collected with the help of Gaofen-2 satellite and high-resolution remote sensing technology, the key points of the image are determined through the Gaussian difference scale space, and the key points of the edge are judged by the peak curvature value of the difference function at the edge junction, so as to complete the RSI acquisition. Specific filtering and spatial domain transformations are used to remove image noise and improve the quality of RSI. The mean shift (MS) algorithm is used to iteratively find the area with the most dense sample points in the RSI space, complete the image analysis, and realize the preprocessing of the high score 2 RSI. The linear features of the RSI are determined by the WT algorithm, and the image threshold is set for feature extraction of the high score 2 RSI. The experimental results show that in the RSI noise reduction error analysis of different methods, the noise reduction error curve of the sample RSI of the method proposed in this paper has the lowest trend, which is always lower than 2%. Compared with the two methods proposed before, the error is higher. At the same time, in the accuracy analysis of key point feature extraction, the proposed scheme has better accuracy. Therefore, it can be seen that this method has better comprehensive performance, and the proposed method can effectively improve the feature extraction accuracy of RSI and reduce the noise in RSI.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Satellite Reflectance Images for Crop Monitoring
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) techniques play important roles in Earth observation analysis as they enable the generation of images with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, existing STF models often fuse images from various satellites, not satisfying the demand for precise crop monitoring. In contrast, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can deliver detailed data, and deep learning (DL)-based STF models have the potential to automatically extract abstract features. To this end, this study proposed a novel end-to-end DL-based STF model named UAV-Net, which can produce centimeter-scale UAV images. UAV-Net has an encoder-decoder architecture with Modified ResNet (MResNet), Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and decoder modules. The encoder uses MResNet modules to extract input features, while the FPN module performs a multiscale fusion of these features before reconstructing UAV images using transposed convolution in the decoder module. Through comparative and ablation experiments, this study evaluated the efficacies of MResNet modules with 18, 34, and 50 layers, along with the FPN module of UAV-Net. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that UAV-Net adequately produces UAV images both visually and quantitatively. Furthermore, a comparison with state-of-the-art STF models highlights the innovation and effectiveness of UAV-Net in producing centimeter-scale images. The predicted centimeter-scale images using UAV-Net have great potential for various environmental monitoring applications.

TI  - Glacier Retreating Analysis on the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau via Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate multitemporal glacier change investigations and analyses are lacking on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP). A combination of photogrammetry, optical remote sensing, and synthetic aperture radar datasets can accurately identify large-scale glaciers; In this article, glaciers in three periods on the SETP (1970s, 2000, 2020) were identified from multisource remote sensing data based on a deep learning method and manual visual interpretation, and multitemporal glacial inventory data from relatively high-frequency source imagery. Totals of 11648, 12993, and 11875 glaciers were identified in the 1970s, 2000, and 2020, with total areas of 13372.08 km(2), 11692.31 km(2), and 10612.94 km(2), respectively. The general distribution of SETP glaciers was identified to be typical of alpine glaciers dominated by small-sized glaciers. The average elevation of glaciers was approximately 5000 m; the slopes were mostly lower than 40 & DEG;, and the main aspect was southeast, followed by south and southwest. The glaciers retreated from the 1970s to 2020, and a total glacier area of approximately 2759.14 km(2) was degraded during this time, with an average annual melting rate of 0.45% yr(-1). Rising summer temperatures may be the driving force behind the continuous decline in the glacier area. Overall, the results obtained in this article showed relatively low uncertainty involved in the identification of glaciers compared to some previous studies. The results can provide accurate glacier information for glacier monitoring and modeling studies on the SETP.

TI  - An Integrated Method for the Generation of Spatio-Temporally Continuous LST Product With MODIS/Terra Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in the study of land surface processes. Currently, there are great progresses in LST retrieval based on thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. However, TIR-based LST suffers from serious spatial discontinuities due to clouds. Although there are methods developed to address this issue, the methods show high uncertainty in days with extremely clouds. Therefore, this study proposed an integrated method to reconstruct cloudy LSTs using Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the China land data assimilation system (CLDAS) LST. This method was separated into two parts according to the ratio of clear-sky pixels (RCP). On days with RCP more than 30%, a random forest reconstruction method was used to establish the complicated relationship between LST and its predicting variables, including solar radiation factor, vegetation index, water index, topographic information, and latitude, and then applied to cloudy pixels to derive LSTs. For the rest days, the CLDAS LST was selected to assist the reconstruction via downscaling it to 1 km and then merged with clear-sky data to generate spatially continuous results. The proposed method was applied to the Southwest China and generate daily LST product in 2019. Validation with ground measurements demonstrated a high accuracy with the correlation coefficient changing from 0.73 to 0.88. Additionally, the reconstructed LST dataset exhibits similar temporal variability as existing all-weather satellite-based and reanalysis LST products. The findings reveal that this method shows good potential in generating gap-free LST dataset, especially for the mountain regions with heavy clouds.

AB  - The first pair of satellite to satellite tracking gravimetric satellites from China (Chinese gravimetric mission) was successfully launched at the end of 2021. It adopts a hybrid measurement system of high-low satellite to satellite tracking (HL-SST) and low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking (LL-SST) to obtain measurements of the global gravity field and its time-varying information, which can be used to study groundwater changes, glacier ablation, space micro-gravity fluctuations, ocean tides, earthquakes, etc. The data can be used for scientific research and engineering construction in the fields of natural resources, ocean, aerospace, and water conservancy, et al. The Chinese gravimetric satellite platform is designed to be ultra-silent, ultra-stable and ultra-accurate. In-orbit test results show that the working state of the platform is normal and all indicators meet the design requirements with margin. This significantly improves the development level of the satellite platform and the level of space micro-gravity measurement, and will expand the prospect for scientific applications in various fields.Firstly, this paper briefly introduces the Chinese gravimetric satellite and discusses the technical characteristics of the integrated design of the satellite platform. This platform provides an environment with low vibrations, stable temperature, precise pointing and tiny deformation of the structure for the whole satellite, and ensures that the payloads of the inter-satellite ranging system and electrostatic suspension accelerometer work in suitable conditions.Secondly, the characteristics and performance figures of the inter-satellite ranging system, electrostatic suspension accelerometer, BDS/GPS common mode receiver and star sensors are analyzed. The inter-satellite ranging system is based on K/Ka-band ranging (KBR) in the dual-one way ranging configuration with stable performance and ranging noise level being better than 3 mu m/Hz(1/2) in the frequency band of 0.025-0.1 Hz. The accelerometer works with electrostatic suspension mode, which is highly sensitive to the residual thrust of the attitude control thruster, switching of the magnetic torquer and other small vibrations. The spectrum analysis shows its high-sensitive axis noise level is being 3x10(-10) m/(s(2) Hz(1/2)) near the frequency 0.1 Hz, and being 1x10(-9) m/(s(2) Hz(1/2)) for the less-sensitive axis. The three star sensors are designed integrally with the tiny deformation structure. To verify the attitude measurement accuracy, the angles between star sensor boresights arecalculated, then the average of the angles is removed, the standard deviation (STD) of residuals is better than 3 ''. The center of mass detection and adjustment system reaches the accuracy level of 100 mu m. The BDS/GPS common mode receiver observers BDS-3 signals and GPS signals simultaneously. The data from the BDS/GPS receiver are used for satellite precise orbit determination (POD) and time synchronization. The achieved accuracy of the satellite orbits is better than 2 cm determined from a comparison of the kinematic and reduced-dynamic orbits. Comparing the baseline of the KBR system with the POD yields RMS residuals of less than 1 mm.Finally, the time-varying Earth gravity field recovery is performed from April 1, 2022 to August 30, 2022 using the in-orbit satellite data, such as KBR data, attitude and orbit data as well as with measurements of non-gravitational accelerations obtained from accelerometers. The time-varying Earth gravity model with a maximum degree of 60 is named Chinese Earth Gravity Field Model 22-01 (CEGM22S-01), and it is converted into an equivalent water height which can be applied to Amazon terrestrial water storage monitoring. The results show that the model can well characterize global hydrological changes, such as the mass loss of Greenland and the terrestrial water storage changes of the Amazon River, and correlates strongly with the results of GRACE Follow-On with the root mean square (RMS) difference of 2 cm in global equivalent water height.Subsequently, with the accumulation of further satellite telemetry, the continuous time-varying gravity field, space atmospheric density, space horizontal ionosphere, space magnetic field and other products can be produced, which will provide abundant information services for the fields of geophysics, geodesy, earthquake, water resources environment, ocean, national defense, etc. The Chinese gravimetric mission will continue to serve relevant scientific research and engineering applications and continue to reveal more scientific application values.

TI  - Efficient Flow Recording with InheritSketch on Programmable Switches

AB  - Several studies have been proposed to deploy the flow recording (i.e., flow size counting and sketching algorithms) on programmable switches for high-speed processing, helping network management tasks like scheduling. Although programmable switches provide a remarkable packet processing speed, they are of compact resources and follow a restrictive pipeline programming. To fit these limitations, current algorithms either sacrifice the recording accuracy or harm the switch throughput. In this paper, we propose InheritSketch for further improvement. InheritSketch utilizes a separation counting fashion, which is memory-efficient for compact switches. It accurately records the more valuable heavy hitters in the large key-value counters (i.e., the primary table), while only sketching non-heavy flows in the small sentinel table. With the recording ongoing, InheritSketch intelligently summarizes the historical recording experience as the basis for flow inheritance. That is, flows with the same IDs as the previous heavy hitters are regarded as new heavy hitters, being recorded in the primary table. To correct some incorrect inheritance, we also propose the flow rebellion, which promotes flows of large sizes but wrongly stored in the sentinel table to the primary table. InheritSketch is also helpful in applications like differentiated scheduling. We compare InheritSketch with six previous recording algorithms on three public traffic datasets, and prototype InheritSketch on a commodity P4 switch. The results demonstrate that InheritSketch reduces the recording errors by at most similar to 7x, and that InheritSketch only consumes 10% of hardware resources on the switch.

TI  - A Geometric Calibration Method Without a Field Site of the GF-7 Satellite Laser Relying on a Surface Mathematical Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite, which is used for Earth observations, is equipped with China's first civil full-waveform laser altimeter. The geometric calibration of the GF-7 satellite laser is vital for ensuring its long-term stability and highly precise global measurements. In this study, a geometric of calibrating satellite laser is proposed. Notably, this method does not require an outdoor calibration field but instead relies on a mathematical surface model. This calibration method converts that to calibrate laser pointing angle error in traditional calibration method to calibrate the three-axis rotation angle error between the laser frame and the satellite body fixed-frame. Assuming that the laser footprints always fall on a fit spatial plane, a new satellite laser geometry calibration model is established. In addition, the GF-7 satellite laser is calibrated by using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds collected from the sloped terrain of Xinjiang. Taking the laser footprints that are captured by the laser ground detectors as the true values, the positioning error of GF-7 beam 1 is improved from 430 m before calibration to 1.8 m after calibration. And the beam 2 positioning error is improved from 1025 to 6.4 m. Finally, according to the surface elevation of the laser footprints that were measured by a real-time kinematic, the elevation error of the GF-7 laser on flat terrain was verified to be 0.14 m after calibration. In summary, the calibration method proposed in this study is effective and feasible and provides a new method for satellite laser calibration.

TI  - A new GEE-based App called "Crop Mapper" for crop mapping
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Software
AB  - A new web-based App named "Crop Mapper" for crop mapping was developed based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment. Users of Crop Mapper App can directly obtain the crop type maps for any of their study areas where the training samples were collected. The link to this App is available at https://code.earthengine.google.com/3646393cfe6ba1251ca376aa9ef9985b The detailed descriptions of the usage for Crop Mapper App are provided below. Before you start to use this App, all data you need to prepare are the study area and training samples data in shapefile format. Then you are supposed to upload these two shapefile data you prepared to GEE Assets by navigating to the Assets tabs - NEW - Table Upload (Shape files) located at the top left of the GEE Code Editor. IMPORTANCE: In your training sample data, the attribute indicating the land cover label of training sample is required to be named as "land_cover" and the field type of this attribute should be integer. In addition, the labels of crop land cover (e.g., wheat, soybean, maize) is required to be indicated using any integer number greater than 100, on the contrary, the labels of non-crop land cover (e.g., build-up, forest, water) should be indicated using any positive integer number less than 100. Once the shapefile upload process is complete, then all you need to do is the following several steps: 1) Type the asset ID of your study area shapefile you upload to GEE Assets into the Textbox of the "1) Study area" Panel. 2) Type the asset ID of your training samples shapefile you upload to GEE Assets into the Textbox of the "2) Training samples" Panel. 3) Move the slider in the "3) Year of mapping" Panel to identify the year for which the crop types are mapped, i.e., the year when the training samples were collected. 4) Click on the "Conduct crop mapping" button in the "4) Conduct crop mapping" Panel to activate the entire process of crop mapping. Once the button is clicked, the word "Finished" in blue will appear to the right of the button. The crop maps will be derived using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm and monthly gap-free Landsat Sentinel-2 time series data that was evaluated to be optimal and well documented in this paper. More specifically, the cropland mask was first generated based on the training samples divided into cropland and non-cropland class. The crop type map was then obtained based on the cropland mask and the training samples with the crop type labels. 5) You can choose to export the intermediate cropland maps or the final crop type maps of your study area to Google Drive by clicking on the "Export the cropland map" or "Export the crop type map" buttons in the Panels of "5) Export the cropland map" or "6) Export the crop type map" with the pre-specified file name and spatial reference in the corresponding Textbox. Once the button is clicked, the corresponding "RUN" button will appear in "Tasks" tabs located at the top right of the GEE Code Editor. The cropland maps or crop type maps will begin to be exported to Google Drive in TIF image format after the "RUN" button in "Tasks" tabs is clicked with Ctrl being pressed. You can download and view the crop maps of your study area when the export is completed.  EXAMPLE USAGE: We provide an example below to demonstrate the usage of our Crop Mapper App. OBJECTIVE: Crop types mapping for the State of Bayern, Germany using Crop Mapper.

TI  - Machine-Learning-Method-Based Inversion of Shallow Bathymetric Maps Using ICESat-2 ATL03 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of empirical methods for satellite-derived bathymetry is limited by the lack of in situ bathymetric data in remote, inaccessible areas. This challenge has been addressed with the launch of Ice, Cloud, and landElevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). This study provides an accurate bathymetric photon extraction process for ICESat-2 ATL03 data, and the R2 value of the bathymetric photons obtained using this process and airborne bathymetric LiDAR data is up to 99%. Next, based on two types of remote sensing data, ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2, machine learning models, including linear regression (LR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost), were trained to obtain bathymetric maps. The experimental results show that themean rootmeansquare error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) values of the LR models are less than 3.02 m, 2.38 m, and 86.03%, respectively. The mean RMSE, MAE, and MRE values of the LightGBM and CatBoost models are less than 0.91 m, 0.66 m, and 23.17%, respectively. It is concluded that the proposed denoising process for ICESat-2ATL03 data is effective, and the results of the bathymetric maps obtained using these data are satisfactory. Thus, the proposed approach is effective, and this strategy can be used to replace conventional bathymetric inversion methods to obtain high-accuracy bathymetric maps.

TI  - Performance of the Semi-Empirical Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval Algorithm Developed for Polarized Scanning Atmospheric Corrector (PSAC) in the Presence of Sensor Decay
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarized scanning atmospheric corrector (PSAC) is an optical sensor onboard HuanjingJianzai-2 (HJ-2) A/B satellite. One of its missions is to monitor precipitable water vapor (PWV) by using its near-infrared (NIR) channels. Since the accuracy of the commonly used NIR PWV retrieval algorithm developed based on the radiative transfer model (RTM) would be significantly affected by the radiometric decay of sensors, and the recalibration of decayed sensors is a complex process, it is interesting and necessary to find a robust PWV retrieval algorithm that is not affected by sensor decay. At present, a semi-empirical algorithm constructed based on the matching results between ground-based PWV data and the actual PSAC observations has been used for the PWV retrieval of PSAC. Since the systematic calibration error of PSAC is considered in constructing the algorithm, it should be able to remove the negative effects of sensor decay on PWV retrieval results. Because the above inference has not been confirmed quantitatively, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm in the presence of sensor decay. The evaluation results based on simulated data show that the accuracy of the semi-empirical algorithm does not change regardless of the presence or absence of radiometric decay in PSAC. Moreover, the algorithm is used for PWV retrieval of MODIS to test its effectiveness. Compared with the official PWV data developed based on RTM, the MODIS PWV data developed by using the semi-empirical algorithm are reduced by more than 50% in both absolute and relative errors (REs).

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data and Graph Theory to Identify Polycentric Urban Structure
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycentric urban structures determine the combination and correlation of urban resources. In the past, nighttime light data were often used to identify the center locations, but the borders of polycentric urban regions (PURs) could not be obtained. Using multisource remote sensing data and graph, this research proposes an effective method for polycentric structure identification. First, we regard nighttime light data as a continuous mathematical surface, which can be constructed as nighttime light intensity graphs (NLIGs). Then, the space-optimized Girvan-Newman (SGN) method is proposed to detect the communities, and the eigenvector centrality (EC) and gray value are used to discover the central node of each community. Finally, the geographical location mapping (GLM) between Landsat 8 data segmentation objects and nodes is established, and the PURs and centers can be mapped to the communities and central nodes. This study took Shenyang, Chengdu, and Xi'an as study areas and used monthly Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP-VIIRS) data in April 2019 and Landsat 8 data in January and August 2019. The average accuracies of PURs and centers identified by the proposed method were 86.24% and 72.5%, respectively. The developed method can provide technical support and data support for urban planning.

TI  - Unsupervised Pansharpening Method Using Residual Network With Spatial Texture Attention
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep learning has become one of the most popular tools for pansharpening; many relevant methods have been investigated and reflected great performance. However, a nonnegligible problem is the absence of ground truth (GT). A common solution is using degraded images as training input and the original images are used as GT. The learned mapping between low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) is simulated, which is not real, which may cause spectral distortion or insufficient spatial texture enhancement of fused images. To address the drawback, a novel unsupervised attention pansharpening net (UAP-Net) is proposed. The proposed UAP-Net mainly contains two major components: 1) the deep residual network (DRN) and 2) spatial texture attention block (STAB). The DRN aims to extract spectral features and spatial features from LR multispectral (LRMS) and panchromatic (PAN), and to fuse those features to make them more representative. The designed STAB adopts the high-frequency component of the corresponding input PAN as the weight to enhance the spatial details of the residual block output features. Moreover, a new loss function including two spatial losses and two spectral losses is established. The losses are calculated in the spatial and frequency domains, respectively. Experiments on Gaofen-2 and Worldview-2 remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed UAP-Net could fuse PAN and LRMS images effectively without the help of HR multispectral (HRMS). The proposed framework is fully general and can be used for many multisource remote sensing image fusion models and can achieve optimal performance in terms of both the subjective visual effect and quantitative evaluation.

TI  - Variability of clouds over Southeast Tibetan Plateau: The roles of aerosols
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the area with the most intensive human activities on the TP, and this place collects most of the precipitation of the TP during summer. In recent year, the characteristics of cloud and precipitation over this region have drawn more attention due to the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. Even though a lot of progress has been achieved by previous research, the effect of local aerosols on clouds and precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau is still unclear. With the combination of the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite data from 2015 to 2021 and MERRA-2 and ERA-5 reanalysis data, this study investigated the cloud effect of aerosols over the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau during summertime. The results show that the daily-averaged concentrations of local aerosols (including dust, carbonaceous aerosols and sulphate aerosols) over the southeastern part of the TP has remained stable in recent years, and the distribution of aerosols performs significant regional characteristic influenced by anthropogenic activities as well as transportation through strong westerlies during monsoon season. Based on domain averaged daily AOD, polluted and clean days are picked out for comparison. During polluted days, all three types of aerosols are seen more abundant near the surface associated with the anomalous downward motions, especially in the southeastern-central part of the selected region, leading to higher AOD over the whole region. For the carbonaceous and sulphate aerosols, we found that the increases in aerosol loading are mainly contributed by local emissions rather than strengthened transportation from the surrounding area such as the Sichuan basin. For the dust, of which mass concentration dominates the local aerosol loading, the anomalous northeastern wind distribution suggests that the higher accumulation is possibly due to the stronger transportation from the desert region of northern China. The cloud property trends are found associated with higher aerosol loading. With unfavorable water vapor transport conditions, an increase in aerosol loading leads to a decrease in the occurrence frequency of clouds, the cloud optical thickness (COD), and the effective radius of cloud droplet particles (re), findings consistent with the Twomey effect. However, the hygroscopicity and CCN forming potential of aerosols can be significantly enhanced by mixing with anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, leading to an increase in re and occurrence frequency of clouds with water vapor convergence. In addition, the orographic uplifting over the regions of Yarlung Zangbo river valley, Nyenchen Tanglha mountain range in the southern area and Tanggula mountain range in the northern area also contributes to the condensation and coagulation processes of activated aerosols, thus promoting the generation and development of clouds over the mountainous region. The impact of aerosols on the characteristics of convective clouds is more significant than that of stratus clouds, and its effect is subject to water vapor conditions. The occurrence frequency of convective clouds will increase when there is sufficient water vapor, while when the water vapor is insufficient, the effective radius of cloud droplet particles will decrease due to the Twomey effect, further leading to cloud optical thickness increase.The results of our research are of great significance for predicting and evaluating the characteristics of cloud and precipitation along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, and also warrant further investigations using both modeling and stationary observational studies.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Gaofen-1/6 for Crop Monitoring: Generating Daily Decametric-Resolution Leaf Area Index Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution time series of leaf area index (LAI) are essential for monitoring crop dynamics and validating coarse-resolution LAI products. The optical satellite sensors at decametric resolution have historically suffered from a long revisit cycle and cloud contamination issues that hampered the acquisition of frequent and high-quality observations. The 16-m/four-day resolution of the new-generation Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-6 (GF-6) satellites provide an unprecedented opportunity to address these limitations. Here, we developed an effective strategy to generate daily 16-m LAI maps combining GF-1/6 data and ground LAINet measurements. All high-quality GF-1/6 observations were utilized first to derive smoothed time series of vegetation indices (VIs). Second, a random forest regression (RF-r) model was trained to link the VIs with corresponding field LAI measurements. The trained RF-r was finally employed to generate the LAI maps. Results demonstrated the reliability of the reconstructed daily VIs (relative error (RE) <1%) and the derived LAI time series, which greatly benefited from GF-1/6 high-frequency observations. The direct comparison with field LAI measurements by LAI-2200/LI-3000 showed the good performance of retrieved LAI maps, with bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and R-2 of 0.05, 0.59, and 0.75, respectively. The LAI time series well captured the spatiotemporal variation of crop growth. Furthermore, the continuous GF-1/6 LAI maps outperformed Sentinel-2 LAI estimates both in terms of temporal frequency and accuracy. Our study indicates the potential of GF-1/6 to generate continuous decametric-resolution LAI maps for fine-scale agricultural monitoring.

TI  - Predicting the Evolution Trend of Water and Land Resource Carrying Capacity Based on CA-Markov Model in an Arid Region of Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of water and land resource carrying capacity significantly impacts optimal water and land resource allocation and regional sustainable development in arid regions. This study proposes a model that combines cellular automaton (CA) and Markov; this model aids in predicting spatial changes in water and land resource availability. In this study, taking the Jingdian Irrigation District in China's northwest arid region as an example, we used long-series monitoring data and a Landsat dataset to create a raster-weighted fusion of 18 indicators and quantitatively analyzed the carrying status of water and land resources from 1994 to 2018. The CA-Markov model was used to simulate the carrying status of water and land resources in 2018 and to perform accuracy correction. The validated CA-Markov model was used to predict water and land resource carrying status in 2026 and 2034. The results show (1) from 1994 to 2018, the area of "good carrying" zone increased by 10.42%, the area of "safe carrying" zone increased by 7%, and spatially rose in an arc from the town to the surrounding regions. The area of "critical carrying" zone remains almost unchanged. The area of "slight carrying" zone decreased by 5.18% and the area of "severe carrying" zone decreased by 11.99%. (2) Comparing the actual and predicted carrying state of water and land resources in 2018, it was found that the simulation accuracy of "good carrying", "safe carrying", "critical carrying", "slight carrying", and "severe carrying" reached 98.71%, 92.07%, 95.34%, 94.05%, and 93.73%, respectively. This indicates that the simulation results have high reliability and applicability. (3) The future medium and long-term carrying status of water and land resources are healthy, but this trend is gradually slowing. The "slight carrying" and "severe carrying" zones show the gradual spatial transition from land desertification to soil salinization.

TI  - Extraction and spatiotemporal evolution analysis of tidal flats in the Bohai Rim during 1984-2019 based on remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats, a precious resource that provides ecological services and land space for coastal zones, are facing threats from human activities and climate change. In this study, a robust decision tree for tidal flat extraction was developed to analyse spatiotemporal variations in the Bohai Rim region during 1984-2019 based on 9539 Landsat TM/OLI surface reflection images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The area of tidal flats significantly fluctuated downwards from 3551.22 to 1712.36 km(2) in the Bohai Rim region during 1984-2019, and 51.31% of tidal flats were distributed near the Yellow River Delta and Liaohe River Delta during 2017-2019. There occurred a drastic spatial transition of tidal flats with coastline migration towards the ocean. Low-stability tidal flats were mainly distributed in reclamation regions, deltas, and bays near the estuary during 1984-2019. The main factors of tidal flat evolution in the Bohai Rim region included the direct impact of land cover changes in reclamation regions, the continuous impact of a weakening sediment supply, and the potential impact of a deteriorating sediment storage capability. The extraction process and maps herein could provide a reference for the sustainable development and conservation of coastal resources.

TI  - A Relative Radiometric Normalization Method for Enhancing Radiometric Consistency of Landsat Time-Series Imageries
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric consistency of multitemporal satellite observations is affected by sensor stability and scene related issues. Relative radiometric normalization (RRN) is a widely used method to reduce these radiometric differences, its performance depends on the accurate identification of representative pseudoinvariant features (PIFs). However, existing RRN methods are mainly developed for bitemporal images and are limited to time-series imageries due to the complexity of identifying effective PIFs. In this study, we proposed a novel RRN method to enhance the radiometric consistency of Landsat time-series imageries. This method includes the following: first, a trend-based PIFs identification considering land cover changes and phenological trends from the entire time series; second, a PIFs optimization involving an automatic reference selection and a PIFs refining for each reference-target image pair; and third, a combined RRN modeling using the M-estimator sample consensus algorithm and robust linear regression. The Landsat surface reflectance products were used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the trend-based PIFs identification provided the consistent PIFs for all reference-target image pairs; aided by an automatic reference allocation, PIFs optimization filtered the proper PIFs with high spectral and spatial similarity for each image pair in monthly image stack; the proposed RRN method achieved good performance in model precision and radiance consistency improvement; the proposed RRN method outperformed seven commonly used RRN methods on majority images in image stack of December. The normalized images can help generate more comparable time-series analysis results by reducing the uncertainties from radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and sensor differences.

TI  - A Back Propagation Neural Network-Based Calibration Approach for Sentinel-3 OLCI Near-Infrared Water Vapor Product
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A back propagation neural network (BPNN)-based calibration method is developed to enhance the all-weather quality of official integrated water vapor (IWV) products from near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites. The model utilizes multiple variables that link with the derivation of satellite NIR IWV products, including official OLCI NIR IWV, latitude, land quality and science flag, month, and solar zenith angle. The in situ IWV observations, collected from 100 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, are employed as the desired IWV estimates. The model is evaluated using one-year water vapor data at additional 114 GPS stations and 97 radiosonde stations from June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020 in China and its surrounding regions. The results show that the BPNN-based calibration model reduces the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of official OLCI NIR all-weather IWV products by 24.52% from 3.10 to 2.34 mm for Sentinel-3A and by 25.00% from 3.44 to 2.58 mm for Sentinel-3B, when compared with in situ GPS-observed reference IWV. When compared with in situ radiosonde-observed IWV, the RMSE reduces 21.01% from 4.57 to 3.61 mm and 20.81% from 5.19 to 4.11 mm for Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, respectively.

TI  - Long-Term Calibration of Satellite-Based All-Weather Precipitable Water Vapor Product From FengYun-3A MERSI Near-Infrared Bands From 2010 to 2017 in China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) product, obtained from near-infrared (NIR) measurements of the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) from the FengYun-3A (FY-3A) spacecraft, has not been used in weather forecasting and climate monitoring so far because of its degraded accuracy. In this research, four machine learning-based correction approaches are for the first time developed to adjust the long-term observation accuracy of the official MERSI/FY-3A NIR all-weather water vapor product from 2010 to 2017 in China considering multiple influence factors-MERSI/FY-3A NIR PWV, latitude, longitude, month, and cloud. In addition to four machine learning models, the conventional multiple-parameter quadratic (MPQ) regression method is also utilized for intercomparison. The in situ PWV estimates, acquired from 100 global positioning system (GPS) stations in 2010-2017 across China, are utilized as reference PWV in model training. The validation results obtained from comparison with PWV from the other 114 GPS stations during 2010-2017 in China indicate that the methods notably enhance the long-term performance of FY-3A MERSI NIR water vapor observations under all-weather conditions, reducing root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 57.62%-71.61%. The calibrated MERSI NIR PWV, calculated using machine learning models, performs better than the conventional MPQ-estimated PWV. After the calibration, the new MERSI NIR water vapor estimates show a performance comparable to other satellite-observed NIR PWV products. The enhanced MERSI/FY-3A NIR all-weather PWV data can complement other water vapor data in the FengYun3 (FY-3) series to ensure a continuous long-term data record and benefit the FY-3 user community.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of MODIS Near-Infrared Water Vapor Product Under all Weather Conditions Based on Machine Learning Considering Multiple Dependence Parameters
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed six machine-learning-based calibration models to improve the all-weather accuracy of precipitable water vapor (PWV) product from near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, i.e., MOD05 PWV. The six machine learning approaches are: back propagation neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The input of the models included MOD05 PWV, latitude, longitude, elevation, cloud, season, and solar zenith angle, in association with the quality of the MOD05 PWV product. PWV data measured from in situ 453 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations in Australia in 2017 were utilized as the target water vapor data for model training. The validation results in Australia in 2018-2019 indicate that the models can significantly improve the all-weather quality [increased R-2, reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE), and reduced mean bias (MB)] of the MOD05 PWV product, exhibiting a reduction in RMSE of 53.33% for BPNN, 55.25% for GBDT, 53.24% for GRNN, 37.81% for KNN, 54.98% for MLPNN, and 55.16% for XGBoost. The R-2 was 0.58-0.79 and the MB was 0.12-0.72 mm, much better than the MOD05 all-weather PWV product ( R-2 = 0.26$ and MB = -1.75 mm). Different from previous studies that focused on clear-sky conditions only, this work is the first one to enhance the quality of official MODIS NIR PWV products under all weather conditions, reducing the impact of clouds on PWV products.

TI  - Identifying Alpine Lakes in the Eastern Himalayas Using Deep Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine lakes, which include glacial and nonglacial lakes, are widely distributed in high mountain areas and are sensitive to climate and environmental changes. Remote sensing is an effective tool for identifying alpine lakes over large regions, but in the case of small lakes, the complex terrain and extreme weather make their accurate identification extremely challenging. This paper presents an automated method for alpine lake identification developed by leveraging deep learning algorithms and multi-source high-resolution satellite data. The method is able to detect the outlines and types of alpine lakes from high-resolution optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. In this study, a total of 4584 alpine lakes (including 2795 glacial lakes) were identified in the Eastern Himalayas from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data acquired during 2016-2020. The average area of the lakes was 0.038 km(2), and the average elevation was 4974 m. High accuracy was reported for the dataset for both segmentation (mean Intersection Over Union (MIoU) > 72%) and classification (Overall Accuracy, User's and Producer's Accuracies, and F1-Score are all higher than 85%). A higher accuracy was found for the combination of optical and SAR data than relying on single-sourced data, for which the MIoU increased by at least 12%, suggesting that the combination of optical and SAR data is critical for improving the identification of alpine lakes. The deep learning-based method demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional spectral extraction methods.

TI  - A Cloud-Dependent 1DVAR Precipitation Retrieval Algorithm for FengYun-3D Microwave Soundings: A Case Study in Tropical Cyclone Mekkhala
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A cloud-dependent 1-D variational (1DVAR) precipitation retrieval algorithm applied to FengYun-3D microwave soundings (CD1DVAR-FY3DMS) is developed in this study. Compared with the current 1DVAR precipitation retrieval framework, cloud scene identification (CSI) is first proposed to delineate the different weather conditions including clear sky, stratiform clouds, and convective clouds. Results of this study in a typical tropical cyclone event demonstrate that: 1) the precipitation retrievals considering CSI (correlation coefficient similar to 0.72 and root mean square error similar to 1.63 mm/h) outperform those without distinguishing cloud scenes (correlation coefficient similar to 0.66 and root mean square error similar to 1.82 mm/h); 2) identifying cloud scenes in a variational scheme could significantly improve the accuracy of retrieving heavy precipitation volumes, with the capturing abilities improved by similar to 100%; and 3) the FengYun-3 constellation has great potential to complement global microwave retrievals. In addition, these findings could provide valuable references and pathfinders for further improving the retrieval accuracy of microwave-based precipitation estimates, especially for strong convective zones.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Remote-Sensed Forel-Ule Index for Inland Waters Across China During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, called COVID-19, poses a novel research point for water body. Based upon the extracted 199 large lakes and reservoirs across China, this study developed the water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule index (FUI) retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery from 2018 and 2022 to explore the spatiotemporal variance of water quality for the first time in the context of COVID-19. The studied results demonstrated marked spatial and temporal patterns. Temporally, 68.8% of the lakes experienced an increase tendency in recent years and there was a noticeable upward trend in water quality during the postepidemic period. Spatially, various changes in lake regions were observed. Water quality of east lakes responded swiftly and showed an obvious improvement after the lockdown, whereas western lakes responded belatedly in the first epidemic year due to fewer human activity and smaller number of confirmed cases and had a clear benefit in the second year owing to the long-term sustaining of lower human activity intensity. This finding emphasized the significant influence of human activities than natural processes. In addition, this work quantitatively demonstrated the association in FUI in terms of new confirmed cases, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and lake area, consistent with the extensive long-term researches. The study provided sufficient information for water color observation, and revealed the short-term improvement of water quality under epidemic situation. Additional attention of water resource management and sustainable strategies should be paid to inland water in order to maintain the short-term improvement.

TI  - Clinical application of double-capsule fecal catheter device in ICU patients with fecal incontinence.
T2  - American journal of translational research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore and analyze the clinical effect and potential value of a double-capsule fecal catheter device in patients with fecal incontinence in the intensive care unit (ICU).METHODS: A total of 107 patients with fecal incontinence who were admitted to the ICU of the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University from May 2017 to April 2023 were selected and randomly divided into the observation group and the control group, with 68 cases in the observation group and 39 cases in the control group. The observation group was given a double-capsule fecal catheter device, and the control group was given an ordinary fecal catheter device for drainage. The clinical baseline data, adverse events, skin conditions, changes of patients' quality of life (QoL), indicators from laboratory test, working pressure and burden of nursing, average length of stay (ALOS) and prognosis of patients were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension history, diabetes mellitus history and smoking history between the observation group and the control group (all P>0.05). The occurrence probability of the number of catheter obstructions, perianal leakage, catheter prolapse and the incidence of discomfort reactions in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). After the use of the double-capsule fecal catheter device, the skin condition of the patient's perineum and perianal area was significantly improved and remained dry and comfortable for a long time, and the recovery of the primary disease in patients with fecal incontinence was also more optimistic. After application of the double-capsule fecal catheter device, the scores of QoL significantly increased in patients from the observation group (P<0.05). After using the double-capsule fecal catheter device, the levels of WBC, neutrophils count, PCT and IL-6 in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group after nursing (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, albumin and prealbumin between the two groups (P>0.05). The responsible nurses of the patients in the control group expressed significantly higher nursing work burden than the observation group (P<0.05). Patients in the observation group had shorter ALOS and lower mortality than those in the control group (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: The application of the novel double-capsule fecal catheter device can reduce the adverse events and working pressure and burden of nursing, it also improved skin condition and patients' QoL. Correspondingly, it improved relevant prognostic indicators during the patient's hospitalization. It has beneficial clinical practicability and popularity for fecal incontinence in patients, and it is worthy of use and promotion.

AB  - Abstract: The La Plata basin, located in southeast South America, has the deepest convection on earth with flash floods and thick convective clouds, often accompanied by hail and lightning in austral spring. Based on previous studies, deep convection is related to the strong low-level jet directed by the Andes. Here we quantify the role of the Andes on intense convection in the La Plata basin using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), focusing on the seasonal cycle. To examine the influence of the Andes on these severe storms, we run two model experiments with and without the Andes. Consistent with high-resolution satellite data, the modeling results show that precipitation is strongest in October, and severe October precipitation does not exist without the Andes. The annual mean precipitation decreases by 35%, extreme precipitation decreases by 49% in the No Andes experiment, and the mean and extreme precipitation occurs in January. We find that vertical wind shear is strongest in October for both runs, with the highest equator-to-pole temperature gradient, creating a favorable environment for atmospheric disturbances. The Andes create the low-level jet with surface southwestward moisture transport, and when the large-scale condition is best for perturbation, severe storms occur in the La Plata basin in spring. Without the southward moisture transport, October precipitation is weak in the run without the Andes. The results imply the importance of the Andes as a barrier to the tropical easterly flow, suggesting that a low-resolution model that underestimates the elevation of the Andes cannot properly simulate the low-level jet, accompanying moisture flux, and precipitation extremes.

TI  - Cooperative Caching Strategy Based on Two-Layer Caching Model for Remote Sensing Satellite Networks
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Information Centric Networking (ICN) where content is the object of exchange, in-network caching is a unique functional feature with the ability to handle data storage and distribution in remote sensing satellite networks. Setting up cache space at any node enables users to access data nearby, thus relieving the processing pressure on the servers. However, the existing caching strategies still suffer from the lack of global planning of cache contents and low utilization of cache resources due to the lack of fine-grained division of cache contents. To address the issues mentioned, a cooperative caching strategy (CSTL) for remote sensing satellite networks based on a two-layer caching model is proposed. The two-layer caching model is constructed by setting up separate cache spaces in the satellite network and the ground station. Probabilistic caching of popular contents in the region at the ground station to reduce the access delay of users. A content classification method based on hierarchical division is proposed in the satellite network, and differential probabilistic caching is employed for different levels of content. The cached content is also dynamically adjusted by analyzing the subsequent changes in the popularity of the cached content. In the two-layer caching model, ground stations and satellite networks collaboratively cache to achieve global planning of cache contents, rationalize the utilization of cache resources, and reduce the propagation delay of remote sensing data. Simulation results show that the CSTL strategy not only has a high cache hit ratio compared with other caching strategies but also effectively reduces user request delay and server load, which satisfies the timeliness requirement of remote sensing data transmission.

TI  - Assessing the Reliability of the MODIS LST Product to Detect Temporal Variability
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) data acquired from satellites are used extensively in studying climate variability. Many researchers have used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST to detect the temperature trend, however, its reliability has not been fully investigated. Using in situ data acquired from 67 stations worldwide, this study examined the reliability of the detected temperature trends and investigated the associated influencing factors. The high-quality (HQ) MODIS data have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.44 and 3.70 K at nighttime and daytime, respectively. However, its trend detection had an RMSE of 0.81 and 0.98 K/decade at nighttime and daytime, respectively. Clear-sky bias, quality control, LST estimation uncertainties, trend magnitude, and length of time were factors that influenced the detected trends. Filling cloud-covered areas in MODIS data may effectively reduce biases in trend detection.

TI  - Prediction of Multi-Scale Socioeconomic Parameters from Long-Term Nighttime Lights Satellite Data Using Decision Tree Regression: A Case Study of Chongqing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) and the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) nighttime light (NTL) data provide an adequate proxy for reflecting human and economic activities. In this paper, we first proposed a novel data processing framework to modify the sensor variation and fit the calibrated DMSP/OLS data and NPP/VIIRS data into one unique long-term, sequential, time-series nighttime-lights data at an accuracy higher than 0.950. Both the supersaturation and digital value range have been optimized through a machine learning based process. The calibrated NTL data were regressed against six socioeconomic factors at multi-scales using decision tree regression (DTR) analysis. For a fast-developing city in China-Chongqing, the DTR provides a reliable regression model over 0.8 (R-2), as well explains the variation of factor importance. With the multi-scaled analysis, we matched the long-term time-series NTL indices with appropriate study scale to find out that the city and sub-city region are best studied using NTL mean and stander derivation, while NTL sum and standard deviation could be better applied the scale of suburban districts. The significant factor number and importance value also vary with the scale of analysis. More significant factors are related to NTL at a smaller scale. With such information, we can understand how the city develops at different levels through NTL changes and which factors are the most significant in these development processes at a particular scale. The development of an entire city could be comprehensively explained and insightful information can be produced for urban planners to make more accurate development plans in future.

TI  - Identification of Supercooled Cloud Water by FY-4A Satellite and Validation by CALIPSO and Airborne Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cold clouds are the main operation target of artificial precipitation enhancement, and its key is to find a supercooled cloud water area where the catalyst can be seeded to promote the formation of precipitation particles and increase precipitation to the ground. Based on the multi-spectral characteristics of the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite, a methodology for identifying supercooled cloud water is developed. Superimposed by a cloud top brightness temperature of 10.8 mu m, a combination of 0.46 mu m, 1.6 mu m, and 2.2 mu m red-green-blue (RGB) composites are used to identify the cloud phase and to obtain the real-time supercooled cloud water distribution every 5 min and in a 2 km resolution for the whole coverage of China. Based on the RGB composition, the supervised machine learning method K-mean clustering was applied to classify the cloud top phase. The results were validated extensively with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). It is worthwhile to highlight that the corresponding hit rate reached 87% over the full disk domain for both the summer and winter seasons. Furthermore, on 29 November 2019, microphysical properties were measured, and the data of supercooled cloud droplets and ice crystals were obtained using YUN-12 transport aircraft in Taiyuan. After simultaneously matching the satellite with an airborne track, the cloud particle image data were obtained near the cloud top and within the clouds during the climb and descending stages of the flight. The phase obtained from the microphysical properties of supercooled cloud droplets and ice crystals was compared with cloud phase results identified by FY-4A and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud phase products. The case study and comparison show that (1) the supercooled water clouds and ice particles identified by FY-4A are in good agreement with those from the airborne measurement at the cloud top and within the cloud and (2) the positions and shapes of water clouds and ice clouds identified by FY-4A correspond well with MODIS cloud phase products. However, there is a small deviation in the extent of ice clouds, which is mainly located in the transition area between ice clouds and water clouds. The extent of ice clouds identified by FY-4A is slightly larger than that of MODIS products. Combined with airborne detection, the comparison shows that the ice clouds identified by the FY-4A satellite are consistent with aircraft detection. The supercooled cloud water identified by FY-4A can meet the needs of the operational precipitation enhancement of cold clouds, improve operational effectiveness, and promote the application of satellite technology for weather modification.

TI  - Mapping Soil Organic Matter Content during the Bare Soil Period by Using Satellite Data and an Improved Deep Learning Network
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil function degradation has impaired global work in the implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs), and soil organic matter (SOM) is a basic and the most important indicator. The deep learning neural network (i.e., DL network) has become a popular tool for mapping SOM content at a regional scale. However, outlier sample data caused by environmental factors (e.g., moisture and vegetation) and uncertain noise (e.g., random noise and instability effects) have interfered with the determination of the function mapping relationship between target soil properties and spectral features, leading to DL networks with low generalization capability. Therefore, we introduced a spatial association module into a deep neural network to remove outlier sample data in order to construct an optimal sample set for calibrating an improved deep learning (IDL) network for SOM mapping. A total of 707 soil samples and a Sentinel-2B multispectral image were acquired during the bare soil period in Weibei, China. The variable importance in the projection approach was used to select the SOM-responsive spectral features for model inputs. Measured SOM contents were taken as the dependent variable, and the IDL network was constructed and applied to map SOM at the regional scale. The results showed that Band 11 was the most important band for SOM prediction. The band difference transformation method was able to integrate multiple-band information and enhance the absorption signal of SOM. The optimal SOM-responsive spectral features included B11, B1-B11, B2-B11, B3-B11, B4-B11, and B1-B12. The IDL network exhibited better performance (R-2 = 0.92; RPIQ = 4.57) regarding SOM estimation compared with the DL model performance (R-2 = 0.84; RPIQ = 2.84), being improved by 9.52% (for R-2) and 60.92% (for RPIQ). After introducing the spatial association module, the DL network generalization capability was enhanced. SOM distribution showed a high-value (>20 g kg(-1)) area in the south, and a low-value (<6 g kg(-1)) area in the north of the study area (the area affected by seawater intrusion). These results provide a strategy based on an IDL network and satellite data for effectively and accurately mapping SOM at the regional scale.

TI  - TCIANet: Transformer-Based Context Information Aggregation Network for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection based on remote sensing data is an important method to detect the earth surface changes. With the development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have excelled in the field of change detection. However, the existing neural network models are susceptible to external factors in the change detection process, leading to pseudo change and missed detection in the detection results. In order to better achieve the change detection effect and improve the ability to discriminate pseudo change, this article proposes a new method, namely, transformer-based context information aggregation network for remote sensing image change detection. First, we use a filter-based visual tokenizer to segment each temporal feature map into multiple visual semantic tokens. Second, the addition of the progressive sampling vision transformer not only effectively excludes the interference of irrelevant changes, but also uses the transformer encoder to obtain compact spatiotemporal context information in the token set. Then, the tokens containing rich semantic information are fed into the pixel space, and the transformer decoder is used to acquire pixel-level features. In addition, we use the feature fusion module to fuse low-level semantic feature information to complete the extraction of coarse contour information of the changed region. Then, the semantic relationships between object regions and contours are captured by the contour-graph reasoning module to obtain feature maps with complete edge information. Finally, the prediction model is used to discriminate the change of feature information and generate the final change map. Numerous experimental results show that our method has more obvious advantages in visual effect and quantitative evaluation than other methods.

TI  - Txt2Img-MHN: Remote Sensing Image Generation From Text Using Modern Hopfield Networks.
T2  - IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text descriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios. Although deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important remote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text descriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on the benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed Txt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing methods. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/Txt2Img-MHN).

TI  - Retrieving chlorophyll content and equivalent water thickness of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) forests under Pantana phyllostachysae Chao-induced stress from Sentinel-2A/B images in a multiple LUTs-based PROSAIL framework
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochemical components of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) are critical to physiological and ecological processes and play an important role in the material and energy cycles of the ecosystem. The coupled PROSPECT with SAIL (PROSAIL) radiative transfer model is widely used for vegetation biochemical component content inversion. However, the presence of leaf-eating pests, such as Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (PPC), weakens the performance of the model for estimating biochemical components of Moso bamboo and thus must be considered. Therefore, this study considered pest-induced stress signals associated with Sentinel-2A/B images and field data and established multiple sets of biochemical canopy reflectance look-up tables (LUTs) based on the PROSAIL framework by setting different parameter ranges according to infestation levels. Quantitative inversions of leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and leaf equivalent water thickness (LEWT) were derived. The scale conversions from LCC to canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and LEWT to canopy equivalent water thickness (CEWT) were calculated. The results showed that LAI, CCC, and CEWT were inversely related with PPC-induced stress. When applying multiple LUTs, the p-values were <0.01; the R2 values for LAI, CCC, and CEWT were 0.71, 0.68, and 0.65 with root mean square error (RMSE) (normalized RMSE, NRMSE) values of 0.38 (0.16), 17.56 mu g center dot cm-2 (0.20), and 0.02 cm (0.51), respectively. Compared to the values obtained for the traditional PROSAIL model, for October, R2 values increased by 0.05 and 0.10 and NRMSE decreased by 0.09 and 0.02 for CCC and CEWT, respectively and RMSE decreased by 0.35 mu g center dot cm-2 for CCC. The feasibility of the inverse strategy for integrating pest-induced stress factors into the PROSAIL model, while establishing multiple LUTs under different pest -induced damage levels, was successfully demonstrated and can potentially enhance future vegetation parameter inversion and monitoring of bamboo forest health and ecosystems.

AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change has become a crucial topic that needs to be addressed when the studying global and local sustainable development. In this research, time-series of Sentinel-2 images from 2019 to 2020 are used to derive LULC change in Mu Cang Chai (MCC) and Van Yen (VY) districts, Yen Bai province, Vietnam. We identified seven main land cover types and collected reference data from visual interpretation using Google Earth. The random forest (RF) classification algorithm is applied to construct the classified LULC map in these regions of Yen Bai province. The classification accuracy of the method is evaluated using producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, overall accuracy, and Kappa coefficient. We obtain a high overall accuracy (90.7%) with a corresponding Kappa coefficient of 0.85 for the classification in 2019. In the case of 2020, overall classification accuracy reaches about 91.1% and 0.87 of the Kappa coefficient. Then, the LULC change area in the period 2019-2020 of the study area is evaluated and discussed by using the transition matrix of LULC.

TI  - Two-Stream Translating LSTM Network for Mangroves Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Multivariate Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring mangroves is critical to protect the coastal ecosystems, and deep learning has gained great popularity in mapping mangroves using remote sensing. However, mangroves are usually submerged by cyclical tide since they are grown in land-sea interface places, resulting in some drawbacks of existing mangroves mapping models. On one side, the correlations between the vegetation index (VI) and the water index (WI) time series of mangroves are not fully considered. On another side, existing models rarely explored the local differences between mangroves and other land covers. Considering the above two aspects, we propose a novel two-stream translating long short-term memory network (TSTLN) for mangroves mapping. First, we construct multivariate time series (MTS) by compositing VI and WI based on Sentinel-2 time-series data. Second, we build a two-stream architecture and design a Siamese translating (ST) module in both streams. In the global stream, MTS is embedded into the ST module directly to get global features, whereas, in the local stream, a depthwise convolutional self-attention (DCA) module is conceived to capture local information first, and then, local features are further learned by the ST module. Finally, a fully connected layer and softmax are used to classify the representations extracted from the two streams. Experiments conducted over the Maowei Sea, the Dongzhai Port, and the Quanzhou Bay in 2019 demonstrate that: 1) TSTLN outperforms other methods, with improved OA of 0.49%-3.89%, 1.35%-6.85%, and 0.73%-3.65% in the three areas, respectively; 2) two-stream architecture, ST module, and DCA module all contribute to the good performance of TSTLN; and 3) TSTLN maintains higher accuracy with few parameters and less running time compared to other counterparts.

AB  - Identification of earth surface features or useful resources even at inaccessible locations for humans made possible with the help of spatial-spectral information provided by remote sensing data especially hyperspectral images. At present deep learning (DL) based models have become a best choice to address the issues and provide better solutions in many fields including remote sensing data analysis. Due to very subtle differences exhibited by mineral signatures and also lack of sufficient training samples, geo-science and remote sensing research community has not much explored the DL techniques in analyzing mineral data. Therefore, in this paper, a virtual sample generation technique using vector rotation is proposed to increase the mineral data for training DL models. The proposed virtual sample generation technique is explored on a spectral library of 5 minerals that is formed from Cuprite scene, a benchmark mineral data set. The quality of the mineral samples generated are assessed using visual inspection as well as a relative spectral discriminating power of target minerals with respect to non-target or remaining minerals. Results show that mineral samples generated by the proposed virtual sample generation technique are not only qualitative in nature but also helpful or encouraging in exploration of DL in mineral data analysis.

TI  - Detecting volunteer cotton plants in a corn field with deep learning on UAV remote-sensing imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volunteer cotton (VC) plants growing in the fields of inter-seasonal and rotated crops, like corn, can serve as hosts to boll weevil pests once they reach pin-head square stage (5-6 leaf stage). The VC plants therefore need to be detected, located, and destroyed or sprayed. In this paper, we present a study on using deep learning (DL) to detect VC plants in a corn field using RGB images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The ob-jectives were (i) to determine whether the YOLOv3 DL algorithm could be used for VC detection in a corn field based on UAV-derived RGB images, and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on images at three different pixel scales (320 x 320, S1; 416 x 416, S2; and 512 x 512, S3). The metrics used to evaluate the results were average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP) and F1-score at 95 % confidence level. It was found that YOLOv3 was able to detect VC plants in corn field at an average detection accuracy of more than 80 %, F1-score of 78.5 % and mAP of 80.38 %. With respect to images size, no significant differences existed for mAP among the three scales, but a significant difference was found for AP between S1 and S3 (p = 0.04) and between S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). A significant difference was also found for F1-score between S2 and S3 (p = 0.02). The overall goal of this study was to minimize boll weevil pest infestation by maximizing the true positive detection of VC plants in a corn field which is represented by the mAP values. The lack of significant differences of these at all three scales indicated that the trained YOLOv3 model can be used for VC detection irrespective of the three input image sizes. The capability of YOLOv3 to detect VC plants demonstrates the potential of DL algorithms for real-time detection and mitigation using computer vision and a spot-spray capable UAV.

ET can be employed to balance the water and energy budgets in basins, monitor droughts and agricultural water consumption. The objective of this study is to estimate ET from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite products in a trapezoidal framework. The model first calculates the evaporative fraction (EF) and then ET using the net radiation (Rn) products. The model outputs were validated against the ground observations collected at an eddy covariance flux tower in Yenicaga, Bolu between 2010 and 2014. The results indicate that the model was able to estimate EF very accurately, and modeled EFs were highly correlated with the ground EFs. However, there was an underestimation of ET by the model because Rn products underestimated Rn values observed at the flux tower. In summary, since the model can produce EFs with small errors, it is possible to estimate ET accurately with different Rn datasets from space.

TI  - A Hybrid Siamese Network With Spatiotemporal Enhancement and Two-Level Feature Fusion for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the popularization and development of deep learning (DL) technology, remote sensing (RS) image change detection (CD) has achieved remarkable success. However, an accurate CD has still been challenging due to the difficulties in achieving efficient feature extraction and effective difference feature enhancement and refinement. To address these limitations, this article proposes a hybrid Siamese network with spatiotemporal enhancement and two-level feature fusion (named the HSSENet) for CD. First, an efficient hybrid Siamese backbone is designed by combining a transformer's advantage to capture dense dependencies between features and convolutional neural network (CNN)'s advantage to provide local prior knowledge. In addition, to reduce irrelevant pseudo-changes and high-frequency noise while maintaining the high compactness of changed targets, a spatiotemporal enhancement module (STEM) that adopts the self-attention mechanism for context modeling in spatiotemporal dimensions and can separately process low and high frequencies is proposed for effective difference feature enhancement. Finally, three two-level feature fusion modules (TL-FFMs) are designed instead of standard decoders to aggregate low-level details and high-level semantics for refining the boundary information. The proposed HSSENet is verified by experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that it can obtain a better tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency than the state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms them with the F1-score of 91.48/91.55/91.17 points on the learning, vision, and RS (LEVIR)/Wuhan University (WHU)/deeply supervised image fusion network (DSIFN) test sets, respectively.

TI  - Biomass Estimation of Subtropical Arboreal Forest at Single Tree Scale Based on Feature Fusion of Airborne LiDAR Data and Aerial Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost UAV aerial photogrammetry and airborne lidar scanning have been widely used in forest biomass survey and mapping. However, the feature dimension after multisource remote sensing fusion is too high and screening key features to achieve feature dimension reduction is of great significance for improving the accuracy and efficiency of biomass estimation. In this study, UAV image and point cloud data were combined to estimate and map the biomass of subtropical forests. Firstly, a total of 173 dimensions of visible light vegetation index, texture, point cloud height, intensity, density, canopy, and topographic features were extracted as variables. Secondly, the Kendall Rank correlation coefficient and permutation importance (PI) index were used to identify the key features of biomass estimation among different tree species. The random forest (RF) model and XGBoost model finally were used to compare the accuracy of biomass estimation with different variable sets. The experimental results showed that the point cloud height, canopy features, and topographic factors were identified as the key parameters of the biomass estimate, which had a significant influence on the biomass estimation of the three dominant tree species in the study area. In addition, the differences in the importance of characteristics among the tree species were discussed. The fusion features combined with the PI index screening and RF model achieved the best estimation accuracy, the R2 of 0.7356, 0.8578, and 0.6823 were obtained for the three tree species, respectively.

TI  - IONPs-Based Medical Imaging in Cancer Care: Moving Beyond Traditional Diagnosis and Therapeutic Assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer-related burden of morbidity and mortality is rapidly rising worldwide. Medical imaging plays an important role in every phase of cancer management, including diagnosis, staging, treatment planning and evaluation. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) could serve as contrast agents or labeling agents to enhance the identification and visualization of pathological tissues as well as target cells. Multimodal or multifunctional imaging can be easily acquired by modifying IONPs with other imaging agents or functional groups, allowing the accessibility of combined imaging techniques and providing more comprehensive information for cancer care. To date, IONPs-enhanced medical imaging has gained intensive application in early diagnosis, monitoring treatment as well as guiding radio-frequency ablation, sentinel lymph node dissection, radiotherapy and hyperthermia therapy. Besides, IONPs mediated imaging is also capable of promoting the development of anti-cancer nanomedicines through identifying patients potentially sensitive to nanotherapeutics. Based on versatile imaging modes and application fields, this review highlights and summarizes recent research advances of IONPs-based medical imaging in cancer management. Besides, currently existing challenges are also discussed to provide perspectives and advices for the future development of IONPs-based imaging in cancer management.

TI  - A 3-D Cloud Detection Method for FY-4A GIIRS and Its Application in Operational Numerical Weather Prediction System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the first hyperspectral infrared sounder onboard a geostationary satellite, FengYun 4A (FY-4A) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) plays an important role in high-impact weather forecasting with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Because hyperspectral infrared data are highly sensitive to clouds and these cloud-affected data are currently challenging to assimilate, cloud detection is a necessary step to assimilate hyperspectral infrared data better. FY-4A GIIRS has been operationally assimilated in the Chinese operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) system China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS), which uses an imager-assisted cloud detection method to detect the clear-sky field of view. This article develops a new cloud detection method to detect clear channels for FY-4A GIIRS in CMA-GFS, extending the original method from two-dimensional (2-D) to three-dimensional (3-D) space. Compared to the original method, the 3-D cloud detection (3DCD) method increases the number of observations to two to three times for the middle- and lower-tropospheric channels and three to four times for the upper-tropospheric channels. The additional observations are of the same quality as those retained by the original cloud detection method, and the averaged observation minus background (OMB) biases after bias correction for upper-tropospheric channels decreased 54% compared to the original. Experiments results indicate that this method successfully achieves the cloud detection in 3-D for GIIRS data and shows the potential in improving data utilization. Also, the results show that 3DCD has a slightly positive impact on temperature and wind forecasts.

TI  - Sub-Annual Scale LandTrendr: Sub-Annual Scale Deforestation Detection Algorithm Using Multi-Source Time Series Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In cloudy and rainy regions, frequent cloud cover limits clear data obtained using a single optical sensor, posing a substantial challenge for detecting deforestation events on subannual scale. In this article, a subannual scale deforestation detection algorithm, namely, the subannual scale LandTrendr (SSLT) change detection algorithm, was developed using synergies from multiple data sources. First, a combined time series was constructed by combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. Second, a sliding window was applied to spatially normalize the normalized burn ratio and eliminate the effects of forest phenological changes and sensor differences. Finally, an integrated time series was created to fit the SSLT trajectory, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the fitted trajectory was calculated to determine the segmentation threshold. Pixels with a magnitude of change greater than the RMSE for three consecutive times were marked as deforestation pixels. Application of the algorithm to a subtropical forest with low density of clear observations resulted in spatial and temporal accuracies of 88% and 92.8%, respectively. Conclusively, this method provides accurate and timely identification of deforestation events on a subannual scale.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Methods for Algal Bloom Detection Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms are a major environmental challenge for lakes and reservoirs and pose severe threats to water on both aquatic and human health. Conventional algorithms used for algal bloom detection based on remote sensing reflectance proved to be effective in some lakes. However, it is still difficult to obtain high accuracy for multiple lakes using single-threshold-based detection. Currently, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to pinpoint algal bloom locations with excellent results, but the ability of different ML models to be applied in different lakes is still unknown. This article presents the performance of algal bloom detection with commonly used ML algorithms in Chinese eutrophic inland lakes based on Sentinel-2 images. A series of comprehensive tests for accuracy, stability, and robustness was designed for four ML models, including random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network, and support vector machine, which were tested in Lake Taihu, Lake Chaohu, and Lake Dianchi. In addition, the index-based methods, including floating algae index and adjusted floating algae index, were also calculated for comparison with ML methods. The results showed that the RF model outperformed other ML models. The comparison results between the RF model and algal indexes revealed that the overall accuracy of RF remained above 0.90. Even with a single lake dataset used as training samples, the RF still maintained a fairly high accuracy of 0.88 for other lakes. To summarize, the four ML models demonstrate promising potential for algal bloom detection across different lakes and provide a practical reference for further applications.

TI  - Inversion of Glacier 3D Displacement from Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 Images Based on Variance Component Estimation: A Case Study in Shishapangma Peak, Tibet, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offset tracking technology is widely studied to evaluate glacier surface displacements. However, few studies have used a cross-platform to this end. In this study, two heterogeneous data sources, Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8, from January 2019 to January 2021, were used to estimate the offset, and then the optimal estimation of the 3D deformation rate of a Himalayan glacier was obtained based on the joint model of variance component estimation. The results show that the maximum deformation rates of the glacier in the east-west direction, north-south direction, and vertical direction are 85, 126, and 88 mm/day, respectively. The results of the joint model were compared and analyzed with the results of simultaneous optical image pixel offset tracking. The results showed that the accuracy of the joint solution model increased by 41% in the east-west direction and 36% in the south-north direction. The regional flow velocity of the moraine glacier after the joint solution was consistent with the vector boundary of the glacier cataloging data. The time-series results of the glacier displacement were calculated using more images. These results indicate that the joint solution model is feasible for calculating temporal glacier velocity. The model can improve the time resolution of the monitoring results and obtain further information on glacier characteristics. Our results show that the glacier velocity is affected by local terrain slope and temperature. However, there is no absolute positive correlation between glacier velocity and slope. This study provides a reference for the joint acquisition of large-scale three-dimensional displacement of glaciers using multi-source remote sensing data and provides support for the identification and early warning of glacier disasters.

TI  - Assessment of FY-3D SST Data on Typhoon In-Fa Simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) plays an important role in the typhoon forecast. By comparison, satellite retrieval products can provide more accurate SST data than reanalysis data in typhoon simulations. However, the effect of SST data from Chinese Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellites on typhoon simulation hasn't been evaluated yet. In this paper, the impact of FY-3D SST retrieval data with ascending and descending orbits on the forecast of typhoon In-Fa, 2021, is investigated with the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model. Compared to the control experiments with SST data from Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data, the replacement experiments with FY-3D SST data significantly improve the forecast of typhoon central sea level pressure, track, and precipitation. Especially, the SST from the descending orbit satellite data provides the optimal track and intensity forecast, which are verified against the best track data from the Japan Meteorological Agency.

TI  - A Space-Time Downscaling Approach of Fengyun-4A Satellite based on Deep Learning
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE: FROM INFRARED TO TERAHERTZ, ESIT 2022
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth and Space - From Infrared to Terahertz (ESIT)
CL  - Nantong, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is the second-generation geostationary orbit meteorological satellite series with higher observation frequency and resolution compared with the first-generation in China. While, the spatial resolution (4km) of the infrared channel and water vapor channel is lower than that of the visible light channel (1km), which limits the application of FY-4A in extreme weather monitoring. At the same time, in order to adapt to the characteristics of the rapid time change of small and medium-scale meteorological disasters, this study based on the deep learning method to downscale the FY-4A satellite data in space and time. The approach consists of two main steps: first, FY-4A data is downscaled using a ESRGAN model transfer learning, which can extract spatially relevant information and reconstruct image resolutions such as infrared channels from 4km to 1km; second, based on the Super SloMo model, the time-related information can be extracted to effectively downscale the FY-4A data, and the temporal resolution of the FY-4A is reconstructed from 15min to 6min, making it comparable to the time resolution of weather radar. The spatial resolution evaluation based on the visible light channel shows that the method used in this study is superior to the spatial downscaling method of bicubic interpolation and Papoulis-Gerchberg in Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Correlation Coefficient (CC), and can more effectively convert low-resolution FY-4A satellite data to the corresponding high-resolution satellite data. At the same time, the time-related information can be extracted based on the time downscaling model, the time resolution is converted from 15min to 6min, and the movement direction of the cloud remains the same. Compared with traditional methods, this downscaling approach is a post-processing method of satellite data with higher precision, which can improve the application value of FY-4A in disaster weather warning.

TI  - A Monthly High-Resolution Net Primary Productivity Dataset (30 m) of Qinghai Plateau From 1987 to 2021
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP), as an indicator of ecological functioning, plays an important role in regional and global carbon cycles. Although many studies have estimated the NPP of vegetation on the Qinghai Plateau (QP), the existing NPP datasets over the QP are either of low spatial resolution or limited duration time-series. These shortcomings restrict our ability to explore the spatial distribution and long-term trends of NPP at a finer scale. To address this gap, we present a new monthly NPP dataset (QP_NPP30) at a high spatial resolution (30 m) over the QP for the period 1987-2021. We constructed this dataset using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) model and multisource data, including reconstructed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, reanalysis data, land cover, and other ancillary data. To reconstruct the NDVI, a harmonic regression model based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) was applied to the NDVI time series data. Statistical analysis of QP_NPP30 showed that the NPP in the QP has increased over the past 35 years (0.92 gC/m(2)/yr). Furthermore, we found that NPP is concentrated in June, July, and August, accounting for approximately 73% of the annual total. To validate our dataset, we compared it with measured NPP and with the MODIS NPP product (MOD-NPP). Our results demonstrated that QP_NPP30 has similar spatial patterns to MODNPP, but offers richer spatial detail. Specifically, QP_NPP30 has a higher accuracy than MOD-NPP, by comparing with the measured data (r = 0.695, RMSE = 132.823 gC/m(2)/yr for QP_NPP30; r = 0.328, RMSE = 158.586 gC/m(2)/yr for MOD-NPP).

TI  - Cross-Resolution Semi-Supervised Adversarial Learning for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have produced good pansharpened images. However, supervised DNN-based pansharpening methods suffer from performance degradation when fusing low spatial resolution multispectral (LR MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images at full resolution. Unsupervised DNN-based methods alleviate the issue, but their training becomes difficult owing to the absence of reference images. This article establishes a novel semi-supervised framework to jointly learn the reconstructions of fused images from reduced- and full-resolution datasets. Specifically, we propose a cross-resolution semi-supervised adversarial learning network (CrossNet), which is composed of a supervised module and an unsupervised module. In these two modules, reduced- or full-resolution source images are disentangled as resolution-invariant components and resolution-aware components by reconstructing the fused images. Moreover, cross-resolution fused images are synthesized to enhance the disentanglement of the two kinds of components. Through the reconstruction of cross-resolution fused images, supervised and unsupervised modules are also coupled efficiently. Then, the semi-supervised framework can simultaneously make use of the supervised information in reduced-resolution datasets and mitigate the performance degradation via full-resolution datasets. Besides, adversarial learning is employed to improve the consistency between resolution-invariant components of source images at different resolutions. Finally, extensive experiments on QuickBird, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate that the proposed CrossNet can produce state-of-the-art fusion results in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The source code is available at https://github.com/RSMagneto/CrossNet.

TI  - Digital Soil Mapping Based on Fine Temporal Resolution Landsat Data Produced by Spatiotemporal Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal Landsat-8 satellite images with fine spatial resolution (i.e., 30 m) are crucial for modern digital soil mapping (DSM). Generally, cloud-free images covering bare topsoil are common choices for DSM. However, the number of effective Landsat-8 data is greatly limited due to cloud contamination coupled with the coarse temporal resolution, and interference of material covering topsoil in most of the months, hindering the development of accurate DSM. To address this issue, temporally dense Landsat images were predicted using a spatiotemporal fusion method to improve DSM. Specifically, the recently developed virtual image pair-based spatiotemporal fusion method was adopted to produce simulated Landsat-8 time-series, by fusing with 500-m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer time-series with frequent observations. Subsequently, the simulated Landsat-8 data were used for distinguishing different soil classes via a random forest model. Training and validation samples of soil classes were collected from legacy soil data. Our results indicate that the simulated data were beneficial for improving DSM owing to the increase in class separability. More precisely, after combining the observed and simulated data, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were increased by 3.099% and 0.047, respectively. This article explored the potential of the spatiotemporal fusion method for DSM, providing a new solution for remote-sensing-based DSM.

TI  - Coupling Model-Driven and Data-Driven Methods for Estimating Soil Moisture Over Bare Surfaces With Sentinel-1A Dual-Polarized Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The microwave backscattering model is one of the most effective tools for surface soilmoisture (SSM) inversion, which has strong theoretical support, but the inverse problem is difficult to solve. Advance in artificial intelligence offers possibilities to learn complex nonlinear relationships in a data-driven way, but it lacks physical mechanism. To combine the advantages of model-driven and data-driven methods, an SSM inversion approach that couples the AIEM-Oh model with deep neural networks (DNNs) was proposed in this study. DNNs with different inputs were trained with a large number of simulation data generated from the AIEM-Oh model, thus embedding physical mechanisms in the data-driven scheme. Two field experiments at different scales were carried out to evaluate the performances of the proposed approach over bare surfaces. The effects of polarization modes and prior knowledge of surface roughness on SSM inversion were explored, and the accuracy of the approach was compared with the existing methods. The results suggest that satisfactory accuracy was obtained by the proposed approach, the RMSE between the measured and estimated values of SSM was 0.03-0.04 cm(3) . cm(-3) with prior knowledge of soil roughness, and the RMSE was 0.08-0.10 cm(3) . cm(-3) without the prior soil roughness information. VV polarization was more sensitive toSSMover bare surfaces thanVH polarization. Moreover, the approach showed stable performance in different experimental regions. The results demonstrate the capability and reliability of the coupled approach for SSM inversion over bare surfaces.

TI  - Examining the Consistency of Lidar Attenuation Coefficient <i>K</i><sub>lidar</sub> From ICESat-2 and Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> From MODIS
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The new generation photon-counting lidar on Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) can obtain the subsurface optical properties of sea waters. Recent studies highlight the applications of deriving the lidar attenuation coefficient K-lidar and then substituting K-lidar into the bio-optical model to obtain more information of sea waters. As commonly used bio-optical models are built for the diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d that are traditionally derived by passive ocean color sensors, whether K-lidar derived from ICESat-2 can be directly used as K-d is a fundamental question. Given that K-d is an apparent optical property (AOP) in the water column rather than an inherent optical property (IOP), K-d is closely related to the zenith angle of the incident light. The zenith angle of the incident light of the sunlight is normally tens of degrees for ocean color sensors, while the maximum laser off-nadir angle is similar to 1.5 degrees for the ICESat-2 lidar. To demonstrate this issue, we select hundreds of ground tracks of ICESat-2 in both open ocean and coastal sea waters and compare the derived K-lidar with their corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived K-d. The results indicate that the corrected results of 1.2 x K-lidar, instead of the direct results of K-lidar, are more consistent with MODIS K-d. This study is of great significance to the better fusion of active lidar data and passive optical data in ocean observations.

TI  - Improved Surface Soil Organic Carbon Mapping of SoilGrids250m Using Sentinel-2 Spectral Images in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator for the global carbon cycle and the overall carbon pool balance. Obtaining soil maps of surface SOC is fundamental to evaluating soil quality, regulating climate change, and global carbon cycle modeling. However, efficient approaches for obtaining accurate SOC information remain challenging, especially in remote or inaccessible regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is influenced by complex terrains, climate change, and human activities. This study employed field measurements, SoilGrids250m (SOC_250m, a spatial resolution of 250 m x 250 m), and Sentinel-2 images with different machine learning methods to map SOC content in the QTP. Four machine learning methods including partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to construct spatial prediction models based on 396 field-collected sampling points and various covariates from remote sensing images. Our results revealed that the RF model outperformed the PLSR, SVM, and ANN models, with a higher determination coefficient (R-2 of 0.82 is from the training datasets) and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD = 2.54). The selected covariates according to the variable importance in projection (VIP) were: SOC_250m, B2, B11, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), B5, and Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI). The predicted SOC map showed an overall decrease in SOC content ranging from 69.30 g center dot kg(-1) in the southeast to 1.47 g center dot kg(-1) in the northwest. Our prediction showed spatial heterogeneity of SOC content, indicating that Sentinel-2 images were acceptable for characterizing the variability of SOC. The findings provide a scientific basis for carbon neutrality in the QTP and a reference for the digital mapping of SOC in the alpine region.

TI  - Radar Composite Reflectivity Reconstruction Based on FY-4A Using Deep Learning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather radars are commonly used to track the development of convective storms due to their high resolution and accuracy. However, the coverage of existing weather radar is very limited, especially in mountainous and ocean areas. Geostationary meteorological satellites can provide near global coverage and near real-time observations, which can compensate for the lack of radar observations. In this paper, a deep learning method was used to estimate the radar composite reflectivity from observations of China's new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite FY-4A and topographic data. The derived radar reflectivity products from satellite observations can be used over regions without radar coverage. In general, the deep learning model can reproduce the overall position, shape, and intensity of the radar echoes. In addition, evaluation of the reconstruction radar observations indicates that a modified model based on the attention mechanism (Attention U-Net model) has better performance than the traditional U-Net model in terms of all statistics such as the probability of detection (POD), critical success index (CSI), and root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the modified model has stronger capability on reconstructing details and strong echoes.

TI  - Evaluation of Consistency Among MODIS Land Surface Temperature Products for Monitoring Surface Warming Trend Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua daily land surface temperature (LST) products are important data sets for global warming monitoring. To reveal the consistency and differences between MODIS Terra and Aqua daily LST products for monitoring LST trends, this study used these two products to extract the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) of the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020. Then, nine MAST combinations were constructed for daytime, nighttime, and daily average conditions separately with Terra and Aqua MAST series, including Terra only, Aqua only, and the integrated one. Finally, the Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to these series and obtained the spatiotemporal variability. The results indicated that there was high spatial consistency of the multi-year averaged MAST of different combinations at daytime/nighttime/daily average scales. Meanwhile, there are quite similar temporal trends in terms of spatial distribution and change rate. The MAST changes are dominated by warming trends, and the areas and change rates of the significant changing pixels at different elevations, vegetation cover ranges, and land cover types presented similar distribution patterns. Although there are some discrepancies in the detailed location for pixels with significant trends among different combinations, the proportion of the pixels with the same trends of daytime/nighttime/daily-average groups is as high as 68.88%, 66.75%, and 71.76%, respectively. These findings reveal that different MODIS LST products have similar performance in monitoring LST trends, indicating that the detection can well reflect the variation of surface thermal environment regardless of which MODIS LST product is used.

TI  - Fisheye-Based Forest LAI Field Measurements for Remote Sensing Validation at High Spatial Resolution
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) field measurements based on digital hemispherical photography (DHP) and LAI-2200 instruments have been widely used for remote sensing validation in forestry. Both DHP and LAI-2200 utilize fish-eye lens to capture the largest footprint of a canopy with a wide range of view zenith angle (VZA). However, accurately measuring field LAI at high spatial resolution poses a significant challenge since the view scope of fish-eye sensor is much larger than the size of high spatial resolution pixel. Therefore, selecting appropriate VZA ranges is crucial to address this issue. In this letter, we propose an improved geometry-based method that considers the average tree height, crown depth, and high-resolution pixel size. To validate this method, we designed four simulated forest scenes with different crown shapes through the LargE-Scale Remote Sensing Data and Image Simulation Framework (LESS) model and conducted field measurements. The results indicate that our proposed method significantly enhances the accuracy of fisheye-based LAI field measurements at high spatial resolution compared to previous method, with an almost 70% reduction in RMSE. In addition, our method exhibits greater improvement in measuring forest LAI at high resolution with DHP (RMSE < 0.3) compared to LAI-2200 (RMSE < 0.5). In conclusion, our method holds great potential in accurately measuring fisheye-based forest LAI for remote sensing validation at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Multitask Learning for Precipitation Estimation Using Satellite Observations From the GOES-R Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is the primary driver of the regional/global hydrological cycle. Accurate precipitation estimation is essential for disaster management and climate change studies. Geostationary meteorological satellites provide a wealth of temporal and spatial information for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), but how to extract useful precipitation-related information from raw satellite data has always been a challenge. As a result, there is still a gap between the current satellite precipitation products and ground-based precipitation observations. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques now allow the development of more accurate QPE algorithms. This letter proposes a PREcipitation estimation algorithm based on Multi-task learning (PREM) using satellite observations extracted from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) series. The key design points of PREM are as follows: 1) the detection (rain/no-rain separation) and rainfall rate estimation are integrated in PREM; 2) infrared (IR) radiance data are the main input to PREM, and ground-based radar precipitation products are used as the target in the training phase; and 3) in addition, PREM integrates lightning data (called PREM-L) to investigate its impact on heavy precipitation estimation. Independent verification shows that PREM performs better than the operational GOES-R products, and PREM-L outperforms PREM when precipitation is heavy.

TI  - Analytical Study of the Changes in Brightness Temperature Based on the Tectonic Field Associated With Three Earthquakes in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared brightness temperature (BT) of the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) was retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level-1B data. The multiyear averaged BT background field was subtracted from the punctual BT data to yield monthly BT spatial anomaly, and calculated time series of BT for the secondary blocks. Then, the spatial and temporal changes in the BT of the study area before the Menyuan M6.4, Zaduo M6.2, and Jiuzhaigou M7.0 earthquakes were investigated and analyzed based on the tectonic setting. The results show the following. The spatial BT radiation enhancement frequency rose remarkably before strong earthquakes; each of the three earthquakes was preceded by marked spatiotemporal continuous BT anomalies. The tectonic setting significantly influences the BT anomaly feature. The spatial BT anomaly was not notable in the Qaidam and Qilian block before the Menyuan earthquake; the spatial BT anomaly mainly appeared in the Qiangtang and Bayan Har blocks before the Zaduo and Jiuzhaigou earthquakes. The Qiangtang and Bayan Har block's BT time series curves have similar features. The Qaidam and Qilian block's BT time series curves have analogous shapes. The three earthquakes may be regarded as one seismic event induced by a stage of tectonic stress enhancement rather than three independent occasions. The spatial BT anomalous behavior before earthquakes is, to a great extent, like the result of the rock stress loading experiment; the rock compression and the lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) may be the main reasons for the intensification of the BT radiation.

TI  - Convective Cloud Detection and Tracking Using the New-Generation Geostationary Satellite Over South China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a core element of weather and climate change research, convective clouds have complex physical structures and dynamic processes, and knowledge of their evolution is limited by remote sensing data along with detection and tracking algorithms. In this study, we construct convective cloud detection and tracking algorithms for the Himawari-8 advanced Himawari-8 imager (AHI) data by combining machine learning models, area overlapping, and Kalman filter algorithms. First, we establish complicated and strict spatiotemporal data-matching conditions between the AHI and CloudSat Cloud Profile Radar (CPR) data, and a parallax correction model is developed to minimize the impact of parallax. To expand the sample volume of convective clouds, a region-growing algorithm is further used. Then, convective clouds during the day and night are detected based on the machine learning model which is trained through feature selection and hyper-parameter optimization. Finally, the automatic tracking of convective clouds, including those with relatively small scales or fast-moving speeds, is achieved by comprehensively using the area overlapping and Kalman filter algorithms. Validation results indicate that the algorithm developed can detect convective clouds of different scales with high accuracy, and the results show good continuity during day-to-night transitions. Moreover, the convective cloud detection algorithm can capture the convective clouds in advance compared with the traditional threshold algorithm. A case study of convective clouds demonstrates that the tracking algorithms we constructed can track convection at different scales. Overall, our study provides a new approach for convective cloud detection and tracking, which can contribute to a better understanding of weather and climate change.

TI  - Towards Scalable Within-Season Crop Mapping With Phenology Normalization and Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-type mapping using time-series remote sensing data is crucial for a wide range of agricultural applications. Crop mapping during the growing season is particularly critical in timely monitoring of the agricultural system. Most existing studies focusing on within-season crop mapping leverage historical remote sensing and crop type reference data for model building, due to the difficulty in obtaining timely crop type samples for the current growing season. Yet the crop type samples from previous years may not be used directly considering the diverse patterns of crop phenology across years and locations, which hampers the scalability and transferability of the model to the current season for timely crop mapping. This article proposes an innovative within-season emergence (WISE) phenology normalized deep learning model towards scalable within-season crop mapping. The crop time-series remote sensing data are first normalized by the WISE crop emergence dates before being fed into an attention-based one-dimensional convolutional neural network classifier. Compared to conventional calendar-based approaches, the WISE-phenology normalization approach substantially helps the deep learning crop mapping model accommodate the spatiotemporal variations in crop phenological dynamics. Results in Illinois from 2017 to 2020 indicate that the proposed model outperforms calendar-based approaches and yields over 90% overall accuracy for classifying corn and soybeans at the end of season. During the growing season, the proposed model can give satisfactory performance (85% overall accuracy) one to four weeks earlier than calendar-based approaches. With WISE-phenology normalization, the proposed model exhibits more stable performance across Illinois and can be transferred to different years with enhanced scalability and robustness.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation for Remote Sensing Image Using the Multigranularity Object-Based Markov Random Field With Blinking Coefficient
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation is one of the most important tasks in remote sensing. In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, some regions are repeatedly transformed between multiclasses, which affects the convergence speed and segmentation accuracy. This is because the increased spatial resolution makes the spectral distribution of geographic targets differ from the overall category distribution. The Markov random field (MRF) model is widely used for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images because of its outstanding spatial description ability. Some scholars have made improvements on MRF models to extract more information or enhance semantic inference. However, these improvements fail to capture the correlation between the multigranularity layers and the historical information. In this article, we propose a new MRF-based model that adopts multigranularity layers to realize the multigranularity correlation representation of targets and the spatial-temporal inference of segmentation labels. First, the algorithm constructs a multigrained layer structure based on remote sensing images to enhance feature extraction for targets of different sizes in images. Second, for the multilayer feature field, a cross-layer Gauss-Markov model is constructed based on intra-inter-layer feature correlation constraints. Then, for the multigranularity layer label field, a self-renewing pairwise spatial-temporal potential function with blinking coefficients is constructed based on the newly defined cross-layer augmented neighborhood system, which can accelerate the convergence of segmentation by using the history information and spatial neighborhood information. The proposed method is tested on texture images, SPOT-5, and Gaofen-2 images. Experiments show that the proposed method has a better performance compared to other state-of-the-art MRF-based methods.

TI  - A ConvLSTM Neural Network Model for Spatiotemporal Prediction of Mining Area Surface Deformation Based on SBAS-InSAR Monitoring Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface deformation caused by underground mining leads to damage to surface buildings and brings potential safety hazards and property losses. The demand for reliable prediction methods of surface deformation in mining areas is becoming increasingly significant. At present, most prediction methods are based on sampling points; however, these methods neglect to consider local and overall spatial features, and this oversight affects the spatial accuracy of prediction results. The data form of the prediction output is often discontinuous and not intuitive. In order to solve this problem, the spatiotemporal prediction method of surface deformation in mining areas is a very effective proposal. However, few scholars have proposed a solution based on this idea. In this study, a convolution long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network for surface deformation spatiotemporal prediction based on time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is proposed to directly predict the overall spatial deformation of the surface in the mining area. First, based on Sentinel-1A images of the Jinchuan Mining Area, Jinchang, Gansu province, China, the time-series InSAR surface deformation data of the study area from January 2018 to October 2020 (81 scenes) are obtained using small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology. Because of the large value scale of surface deformation in the mining area, we propose a method to fit the maximum and minimum values of time-series deformation, respectively, and carry out piecewise numerical compression. Then, based on the ConvLSTM neural network layer, construct the spatiotemporal prediction model of time-series InSAR surface deformation. Support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression, and the gray model [GM (1,1)] are used as benchmark methods. The prediction results of our models are compared with the three benchmark methods. The comparison results show that the prediction effect of the ConvLSTM model with optimal input time steps is significantly better than the benchmark methods in the comprehensive performance of various evaluation metrics, especially for the metrics used to evaluate the error. This shows that the ConvLSTM model has relatively fine spatiotemporal prediction performance for time-series InSAR surface deformation. Based on the InSAR time-series deformation monitoring results of the Jinchuan Mining Area, we carry out the spatiotemporal prediction of surface deformation in the subsequent 50 time steps (600 days). The results agree with the natural deformation development law in band collection statistics and 3-D representation of deformation; moreover, the reliability of numerical spatial distribution is relatively high. This result can be used to intuitively evaluate the overall surface deformation of the mining area in the monitoring range, find potential hazards in time, and take measures to address these hazards quickly. At the same time, this research process also provides a new concept design for such problems.

TI  - Cloud Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images With Deep Semi-Supervised and Active Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds hinder the surface observation by optical remote sensing sensors. It is of great significance to detect clouds and nonclouds in remote sensing images. Compared with the traditional cloud detection methods, deep learning methods usually achieve promising detection results. Moreover, large-scale, high-quality labeled datasets can effectively improve the accuracy and generalization of deep learning models. However, this incurs a great deal of label effort and cost. In this letter, we propose a cloud detection method based on deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) and active learning (AL) in optical remote sensing images named SSAL-cloud detection (SSAL-CD). SSL part of SSAL-CD is implemented by the cross-validation between two-way neural networks, which can effectively train in the case of insufficient labeled data and reduce the cost of labeling. AL part proposes a suitable query strategy based on the uncertainty, degree of divergence, and diversity information provided by the training model. The query strategy can screen out high-value samples for SSL, which further improves the detection effect. Repeat the process of SSL and AL until the accuracy meets requirements or the labeling budget is exhausted. Extensive experimental results in Landsat-8 Biome dataset demonstrate that SSAL-CD can achieve the state-of-the-art segmentation performance with a small number of labels.

TI  - Spatial Resolution Matching of Microwave Radiometer Measurements Using Iterative Deconvolution With Close Loop Priors (ICLP)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive multifrequency microwave sensors frequently struggle with difficulties of nonuniform spatial resolution among multiple channels. The raw measurements in the land-sea transition zone are seriously contaminated. Conventional analytical deconvolution techniques suffer from the tradeoff between spatial resolution enhancement and noise amplification, leading to low data integrity in the practical spatial resolution matching application. To provide multichannel microwave radiometer (MWR) data with matching levels of spatial resolution, a method based on iterative deconvolution with close loop priors (ICLP) is proposed. Specifically, a destriping module is first utilized as a preprocessing step to maintain high data integrity. Then, the close loop mechanism using sparse adaptive priors is proposed to balance the spatial resolution and data integrity enhancement. Also, progressively iterative deconvolution is introduced to realize controllable levels of spatial resolution enhancement (spatial resolution matching) for multichannel data to reach a consistent level. Experiments performed using both simulated and actual microwave radiation imager (MWRI) data demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Extracting Tea Plantations from Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Images Based on Deep Learning Networks
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea is a special economic crop that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. Timely and accurate access to the distribution of tea plantation areas is crucial for effective tea plantation supervision and sustainable agricultural development. Traditional methods for tea plantation extraction are highly dependent on feature engineering, which requires expensive human and material resources, and it is sometimes even difficult to achieve the expected results in terms of accuracy and robustness. To alleviate such problems, we took Xinchang County as the study area and proposed a method to extract tea plantations based on deep learning networks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) modules were combined to build an R-CNN model that can automatically obtain both spatial and temporal information from multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing images of tea plantations, and then the spatial distribution of tea plantations was predicted. To confirm the effectiveness of our method, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), CNN, and RNN methods were used for comparative experiments. The results show that the R-CNN method has great potential in the tea plantation extraction task, with an F1 score and IoU of 0.885 and 0.793 on the test dataset, respectively. The overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient for the whole region are 0.953 and 0.904, respectively, indicating that this method possesses higher extraction accuracy than the other four methods. In addition, we found that the distribution index of tea plantations in mountainous areas with gentle slopes is the highest in Xinchang County. This study can provide a reference basis for the fine mapping of tea plantation distributions.

TI  - ANALYZING LAND USE TYPES' EFFECTS ON LST USING THE GWR MODEL AND CASE STUDIES IN BEIJING
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of urbanization and the transformation of green lands into impermeable land increase temperature and create urban heat islands (UHIs). Our observations with remote sensing instruments of Landsat platforms show considerable changes in land use types in Beijing city with the shrinking of green lands, expansion of built environments, and a slight increase in the temperature during the recent four decades. Using remote sensing instruments of Landsat platforms and registered data from two meteorological stations in Beijing, this study finds the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and the increasing conversion of cultivated lands into built-up areas. This article presents innovative research that shows the mutual correlation well and recommends revisions in the land use policies for better weather. The geographically weighted regression model (GWR) with a Gaussian weighting kernel function analyzes the impact of various urban land use types on the LST and the increase UHIs. In Beijing city, green lands show fewer standard deviations (SD) in the average temperatures equal to 0.109, while the industrial spaces exhibit a high SD equal to 0.212. The outcomes of this paper contribute to finding optimal land use policies everywhere in the world with the increasing urbanization through simulating its model for a more comfortable life.

TI  - An Invisible School: Social-Cultural Work of the Mosque Organizations
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a knowledge gap in the contribution of socio-cultural work in Islamic organisations to the participants' learning and development. This article focuses on the role of the socio-cultural work of Islamic organizations as a form of non-formal education. Education is the internal process of a person which leads to a better understanding of themself and their situation, a critical appreciation of their situation and a conscious and targeted use of the possibilities in their social situation. Therefore, what volunteers learn when they participate in socio-cultural work in mosque organizations will be investigated. The research is based on the case study of a Turkish faith-based organization Milli Gorus Amsterdam-West (MGAW) and its volunteers. The method of the research is ethnographic field research. The research focuses on a specific group of participants, namely, the volunteers who are active at the MGAW. One of the results of the research is that the participants who follow the social-cultural activities of MGAW for a certain period develop a cohesive worldview whereby volunteering becomes a virtue.

T2  - GEOMATIK
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been many studies regarding agricultural crop classification using remotely sensed imagery in Turkiye. In such studies, crop reference datasets are needed to train classification models and validate the model results. However, some studies reported that there are some inaccuracies in these crop reference datasets. In this study, the accuracy of the crop reference dataset collected by a commercial company in the central district of Yozgat Province was investigated using the imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series of each agricultural parcel were constructed and iteratively compared to the average NDVI time series for a given crop. Later, statistic metrics such as correlation and average minimum distance were used to identify incorrectly labeled agricultural parcels. The method is fully automated and doesn't need any user intervention except for the steps such as the data download and the modification of parcel boundaries. Therefore, The automation of the method steps was carried out in Python programming language using various open-source Python libraries.

TI  - Meritocracy in Focus of Scientific Controversy: Catholic Church and Italian Intellectuals
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the analysis of the arguments used by Italian intellec-tuals, Church hierarchies, clergy representatives, professors of Catholic universities to explain their attitude to the idea of meritocracy, its prospects , restrictions. The fight against corruption and undeserved privileges is particularly relevant in today's Italy with its traditions of clientelism, nepotism and family ties. At the center of the scien-tific dispute there are two "sites": the Catholic University of Milan "Sacro Cuore" and the newspaper of the Italian episcopate "Avvenire." During the public discussions, views in defense and against the "merit society" were expressed and argued. Advocates of meritocracy believe that this model will make Italy more modern and competitive, will allow to build a fairer society. Opponents, on the contrary, consider this concept an ideological justification for inequality and a "direct antithesis of democracy." In the fu-ture, this situation can cause increased social tension, frustration and deep social pes-simism. Catholic thinkers presented the theological examination of "meritocracy". They explained that the Church's moral teaching considers the principle of "retributive" or rewarding justice as unjust and dangerous. The author comes to the conclusion that the polarity of opinions is explained by the conflict of ideological, religious and worldview attitudes of Italian intellectuals, who are not ready to hear the arguments of the opposing side. The stance of the clergy on meritocracy can be explained in the light of the Church's magisterium on the common good, rights and dignity of the person.

TI  - A New Method for the Rapid Determination of Fire Disturbance Events Using GEE and the VCT Algorithm-A Case Study in Southwestern and Northeastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are major disturbances in forest ecosystems. The rapid detection of the spatial and temporal characteristics of fires is essential for formulating targeted post-fire vegetation restoration measures and assessing fire-induced carbon emissions. We propose an accurate and efficient framework for extracting the spatiotemporal characteristics of fires using vegetation change tracker (VCT) products and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The VCT was used to extract areas of persistent forest and forest disturbance patches from Landsat images of Xichang and Muli, Liangshan prefecture, Sichuan province in southwestern China and Huma, Heilongjiang province, in northeastern China. All available Landsat images in the GEE platform in a year were normalized using the VCT-derived persisting forest mask to derive three standardized vegetation indices (normalized burn ratio (NBRr), normalized difference moisture index (NDMIr), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIr)). Historical forest disturbance events in Xichang were used to train two decision trees using the C4.5 data mining tool. The differenced NBRr, NDMIr, and NDVIr (dNBRr, dNDMIr, and dNDVIr) were obtained by calculating the difference in the index values between two temporally adjacent images. The occurrence time of disturbance events were extracted using the thresholds identified by decision tree 1. The use of all available images in GEE narrowed the disturbance occurrence time down to 16 days. This period was extended if images were not available or had cloud cover. Fire disturbances were distinguished from other disturbances by comparing the dNBRr, dNDMIr, and dNDVIr values with the thresholds identified by decision tree 2. The results showed that the proposed framework performed well in three study areas. The temporal accuracy for detecting disturbances in the three areas was 94.33%, 90.33%, and 89.67%, the classification accuracy of fire and non-fire disturbances was 85.33%, 89.67%, and 83.67%, and the Kappa coefficients were 0.71, 0.74, and 0.67, respectively. The proposed framework enables the efficient and rapid extraction of the spatiotemporal characteristics of forest fire disturbances using frequent Landsat time-series data, GEE, and VCT products. The results can be used in forest fire disturbance databases and to implement targeted post-disturbance vegetation restoration practices.

TI  - Calibration of MODIS-Derived Cropland Growing Season Using the Climotransfer Function and Ground Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global environment experienced notable changes in the recent past of planet Earth. Satellite remote sensing has played an increasingly important role in monitoring and characterizing these changes. Being recognized as a sensitive indicator of global climate change, land surface phenology (LSP) observations by satellite remote sensing have received much attention in recent years; however, much less attention has been paid to the calibration of these observations using standardized procedures. Here, we propose a new approach to calibrating the satellite LSP products by developing a climotransfer function (CTF) based on a polynomial regression of the satellite-ground observation difference in key crop phenophases against climatic factors. We illustrate the model development and evaluation process with a case study of the cropland growing season in Northeast China (NEC) from 2001 to 2010 using the MODIS LSP product MCD12Q2 Collection 6 and the ground-observed crop phenology and climatic data from 98 agrometeorological stations across the region. Our results showed that the start of the cropland growing season (SOS) derived from MODIS data compared well to the ground-observed SOS, whereas the MODIS-derived season end (EOS) was delayed by 15.5 d, relative to ground observation. The MODIS-derived EOS was, therefore, spatiotemporally calibrated using a CTF model fitted to the satellite-ground difference in EOS ( increment EOS) versus two climatic factors, namely, the growing degree-days on the base temperature of 10 degrees C (GDD10) and cloud cover (CL). The calibrated MODIS data revealed that the cropland growing season in NEC tended to shorten at 4.5 d decade(-1) during 2001-2010, mainly driven by a significant delay in SOS at a similar rate, whereas no trend was detected for EOS. The calibrated data also revealed a significant shortening gradient of 1.7 d degree(-1) of latitude northward. These spatiotemporal patterns would have been erroneously characterized if calibration had not been applied. More attention is therefore called to the proper calibration of satellite LSP products prior to any meaningful applications.

TI  - Ca-STANet: Spatiotemporal Attention Network for Chlorophyll-a Prediction With Gap-Filled Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) prediction has the potential to provide an early warning of red tide and support fishery management and marine ecosystem health. The existing learning-based Chl-a prediction methods mostly predict a single point or multiple points with monitoring data. However, the monitoring data are subject to sparse sampling and difficult to be measured in a large-scale and synchronous way. Moreover, the advanced learning-based models for point Chl-a prediction, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-LSTM, are unable to fully mine the spatiotemporal correlation of Chl-a variations. Therefore, by using the satellite remote sensing data with extensive coverage, we design a framework, namely, Ca-STANet, to simultaneously predict the Chl-a of all the locations in a large-scale area from the perspective of spatiotemporal field. Specifically, in our method, the original data are first divided into multiple subregions to capture the spatial heterogeneity of large-scale area. Then, two modules are, respectively, operated to mine the spatial correlation and long-term dependency features. Finally, the outputs from the two modules are integrated by a fusion module to fully mine the spatiotemporal correlations, which are exploited to attain the final Chl-a prediction. In this article, the proposed Ca-STANet is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the legacy methods based on the OC-CCI Chl-a 5.0 data of the Bohai Sea. The results demonstrate that the proposed Ca-STANet is highly effective for Chl-a prediction and achieves higher prediction accuracy than the baseline methods. Moreover, as the OC-CCI Chl-a 5.0 data have many missing areas, we introduce DINEOF method to fill the data gaps before using them for prediction.

TI  - Mid-Infrared Emissivity Retrieval from Nighttime Sentinel-3 SLSTR Images Combining Split-Window Algorithms and the Radiance Transfer Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity is a key parameter that affects energy exchange and represents the spectral characteristics of land cover. Large-scale mid-infrared (MIR) emissivity can be efficiently obtained using remote sensing technology, but current methods mainly rely on prior knowledge and multi-temporal or multi-angle remote sensing images, and additional errors may be introduced due to the uncertainty of external data such as atmospheric profiles and the inconsistency of multiple source data in spatial resolution, observation time, and other information. In this paper, a new practical method was proposed which can retrieve MIR emissivity with only a single image input by combining the radiance properties of TIR and MIR channels and the spatial information of remote sensing images based on the Sentinel-3 Sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) data. Two split-window (SW) algorithms that use TIR channels only and MIR and TIR channels to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) were developed separately, and the initial values of MIR emissivity were obtained from the known LST and TIR emissivity. Under the assumption that the atmospheric conditions in the local area are constant, the radiance transfer equations for adjacent pixels are iterated to optimize the initial values to obtain stable estimation results. The experimental results based on the simulation dataset and real SLSTR images showed that the proposed method can achieve accurate MIR emissivity results. In future work, factors such as angular effects, solar radiance, and the influence of atmospheric water vapor will be further considered to improve performance.

TI  - Mapping Surface Organic Soil Properties in Arctic Tundra Using C-Band SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil organic carbon (SOC) content is among the first-order controls on the rate and extent of Arctic permafrost thaw. There is a large discrepancy in current SOC estimates in Arctic tundra, where sparse measurements are unable to capture SOC complexity over the vast tundra region. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are sensitive to surface vegetation, roughness, and moisture conditions, and may provide useful information on surface SOC properties. Here, we investigated the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data for regional SOC mapping in the Arctic tundra through principal component analysis (PCA). Multiple in situ SOC datasets in the Alaska North Slope were assembled to generate a consistent surface (0-10 cm) SOC and bulk density dataset (n = 97). The radar VV backscatter shows a strong correlation with surface SOC, but the correlation varies greatly with surface snow, moisture, and freeze/thaw conditions. However, the first principal component (PC1) of radar backscatter time series from different years shows spatial consistency representing dominant and persistent surface backscatter behavior. The PC1 also shows a strong linear correlation with surface SOC concentration (R = 0.65, p < 0.01), and an exponential relationship with bulk density (R = -0.65, p < 0.01). The resulting predicted SOC maps show much lower soil bulk density and higher SOC concentration in the southern shrub tundra area than in the northern coastal region, consistent with in situ data. Our analysis shows that it is possible to separate the effects of different factors on the radar backscatter response using PCA and multitemporal SAR data, which may lead to more effective satellite-based methods for Arctic SOC mapping.

The study was conducted within the provincial boundaries of Erzincan, where there is not yet an ob-servatory. The study identified and analyzed meteorological, geographic and anthropogenic factors (cloud cover, precipitable water, wind speed, geology and landslides, active fault lines, digital elevation model, urban lighting, min-ing activities, distance to roads). The areas proposed as a result of the study were plotted on the city map. It is important to reduce the number of eligible areas to be site tested by performing the work prior to the site testing phase, which is one of the phases required for the construction of the observatory. This study will provide energy, time, and cost savings by reducing the number of alternative areas. As a result of the preliminary study we conducted to select the most suitable site for the observatory, the final decision should be made after the proposed areas have been subjected to the site test phases.

TI  - Synergistic estimation of soil salinity based on Sentinel-1 image texture and Sentinel-2 salinity spectral indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization, one of the important factors leading to global land degradation, seriously affects sustainable agricultural development. Accurate and frequent monitoring of soil salt content (SSC) contributes to the management and restoration of salinized soil. Our study aimed to evaluate the potential to synthetically estimate the salinity in bare soil with different remote sensing sensors (medium-resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). The salinity data of 134 surface soil samples were collected in the Shahaoqu irrigation area (SIA) in the Hetao Irrigation District of Inner Mongolia. Simultaneously, the remote sensing images of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of SIA were obtained. A total of 46 predictors, including 12 remote sensing data (10 multispectral bands, 1 VV, and 1 VH), 8 polarization combination indices, 16 salinity spectral indices, and 10 texture features, were obtained and calculated from the remote sensing image data. Three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM), were used for the construction of soil salinity prediction models based on different combinations of the 46 predictors. The results showed that the remote sensing image data from multiple sensors could be used to estimate soil salinity more accurately than that of a single sensor. Among the three regression models (RF, SVM, and ELM) in our study, RF was the best prediction model (R-v(2) = 0.71, RMSEv = 0.140%, and MAE = 0.094%). The RF model combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was the most effective in revealing the spatial distribution of soil salinity. The importance analysis of the predictor variables showed that texture features were the main explanatory variables for SSC prediction, with contrast being the most important predictor. The results of our study verified the potential to predict SSC by combining multisource remote sensing data and machine learning models in arid and semiarid regions, which could provide some reference for soil salinization monitoring and control in the bare soil.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an important variable for hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural studies and applications. The SM Operational Products System (SMOPS) was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) to operationally provide an integrated satellite SM data product. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM retrieval is an important component of the currently operational SMOPS. This study is proposed to refine the AMSR2 data product using an optimal machine-learning model, and this first paper of the two-part series is to intercompare the six commonly used machine-learning models including multiple linear regression (MLR), regression tree (RRT), random forest (RFT), gradient boosting (GBR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and artificial neural network (ANN). Results indicate that all of the six approaches can preserve the reference data information beyond the training time period, which ensures they predict past and future satellite retrievals without a new training procedure. Relative to other models, the XGB method is more successful to respect to the reference data SM Active Passive (SMAP) and the in situ observations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). It has a good implication for the implementation of the XGB model to refine the AMSR2 SM retrievals in the second paper.

TI  - Crop Classification of Multitemporal PolSAR Based on 3-D Attention Module With ViT
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal polarimertic SAR is considered to be very effective in crop classification and cultivated land detection, which has received much attention from researchers. Currently, for most multitemporal polarimetric SAR data classification methods, the simultaneous temporal-polarimetric-spatial feature extraction capability has not been exploited sufficiently. Also, the diversity of different time and different polarimetric features has not been taken into account sufficiently. In this letter, we propose a classification model that combines a dual-stream network as a temporal-polarimetric-spatial feature extraction module with vision transformer (ViT) called temporal-polarimetric-spatial transformer (TPST) to address the above problems. Second, a 3-D convolutional attention module that enables the network to weight the temporal dimension, polarimetric feature dimension and spatial dimension is developed, according to their importance. Experimental results on both the UAVSAR and RADARSAT-2 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms ResNet.

TI  - Combined Doxorubicin Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Effective Tumor Lymphatic Metastasis by Multi-Modal Chemo-Photothermal Treatment in vivo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first regional lymph node where tumor cells metastasize, and its identification and treatment are of great significance for the prevention of tumor metastasis. However, the current clinical modalities for identification and treatment of SLN are still far from satisfactory owing to their high cost, invasiveness and low accuracy. We aim to design a novel nanomedicine system for SLN imaging and treatment with high efficacy.Methods: We designed and prepared hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS) and loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), which is then modified with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain nanomedicine: HMCS-PVP-DOX.Results: HMCS-PVP with a size of about 150 nm could retain in the lymph nodes for a long time and stain the lymph nodes, which could be easily observed by the naked eye. At the same time, HMCS-PVP exhibited excellent photoacoustic and photothermal imaging capabilities, realizing multimodal imaging to locate lymph nodes precisely. Due to its high specific surface area, HMCS could be largely loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). HMCS-PVP-DOX displayed highly efficient synergistic chemotherapy-photothermal therapy for lymphatic metastases in both cellular and animal experiments due to its significant photothermal effect under 1064 nm laser irradiation. HMCS-PVP-DOX also displayed great stability and biosafety.Discussion: Multifunctional nanomedicine HMCS-PVP-DOX is expected to provide a novel paradigm for designing nanomedicine to the diagnosis and treatment of lymphatic metastases because of its good stability and safety.

TI  - Solubilization of Poorly Water-soluble Drugs with Amphiphilic Phospholipid Polymers
T2  - YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Review
AB  - Most drug candidates developed in recent years are poorly water-soluble, which is a key challenge in pharmaceutical science. Various solubilization methods have been investigated thus far, most of which require solubilizers that provide a local hydrophobic environment wherein a drug can dissolve or induce interactions with drug molecules. We have focused on amphiphilic 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphoryl choline (MPC) polymers. In addition to the ease of molecular design of amphiphilic MPC polymers owing to their chemical structures, they have been reported to possess high biocompatibility in various biomaterial applications. Additionally, amphiphilic MPC polymers have been applied in the pharmaceutical field, especially in solubilization. We have qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the effects of the chemical structure and physical properties of the solubilizer on the MPC polymers. In particular, MPC polymers with different chemical structures were designed and synthesized. The inner polarity and molecular mobility in the polymer aggregates were evaluated, indicating that the intrinsic properties reflect the chemical structure of the polymer. Additionally, amphiphilic MPC polymers were used to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs and as solid dispersion carriers, and they exhibited superior solubilizing abilities compared to a commonly used polymer. Furthermore, the solubility of biopharmaceuticals, such as peptides, was improved. It is possible to design and synthesize optimal structures based on the polarity of the hydrophobic environment and the intermolecular interaction with a drug. This research provides a unified interpretation of drugs and efficiently summarizes knowledge about drug development, which will facilitate the efficient and rapid development of drug formulations.

TI  - Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)-based high-resolution mapping of potential groundwater recharge zones on the hard rock terrains of the Cameroon volcanic line (CVL)
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the major water reserve in the present context of global warming-related droughts that appear to be more intense in hard rock terrains. The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies are increasingly beneficial to groundwater research, by allowing for low cost and larger-scale high-resolution mapping compared to conventional hydrogeological exploration methods. This study aimed at developing a high-resolution map of potential groundwater recharge (GWR(pot)) zones for the drought-stricken Banka hard rock terrain, straddling the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL). Shuttle Radar Tomography Mission (SRTM)-30m and Landsat 8 satellite images constituted the main data source that was ground-truthed through field mapping and used to produce various thematic GIS layers: geology slope, aspect, land use & land cover, drainage density and lineament density of spatial resolution 16m x 16m. The layers were each attributed a fixed score and weight to groundwater recharge, computed using Multi-Influencing Factor (MIF) and Analytical Hierarchy Process of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (AHP-MCDA) techniques. Lastly, a Weighted Overlay Analysis was done using the layers to produce the GWR(pot) zones for the study area. The resulting map shows that 60% of the study area, covering the south, west-northwest and the north-northeast portions of the map have moderate to very high recharge potentials. This result is particularly useful for groundwater targeting in the area and demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in hard rock terrains where traditional methods have been less efficient in properly delineating groundwater recharge zones.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in a resource- limited setting: a retrospective comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy before and after the introduction of Sentimag at an academic breast unit
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed for staging and prognostication of breast cancer (BC) in cases with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla. Using blue dye and a radioactive colloid injection is considered the gold standard for SLNB. This study aims to evaluate the SLNB outcomes before and after the introduction of Sentimag at an academic breast unit. Sentimag uses an injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide which is then detected in the sentinal lymph node using a magnetometer. Method: A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing SLNBs done from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. During 2017, a nuclear medicine technique was used for all SLNBs, while the Sentimag system was used in 2018. Results: There was no difference between the two groups comparing age, T-stage, size of tumour, and molecular status. The only statistically significant difference found was more higher-grade tumours in the group where a nuclear medicine technique was used in 2017 (p = 0.04). There was no difference in the type of surgery performed comparing mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery rates between the two groups. There was an 11% increase in the number of patients who had an SLNB done with the Sentimag technique (2018). In 2017, 42% (58/139) had an SLNB and in 2018, 53% (59/112) had an SLNB. Conclusion: This result demonstrates the feasibility of the magnetic technique for SLNB in a resource-limited setting. This new method shows promise as a safe and effective technique for SLNB - it is a valuable alternative in the absence of nuclear medicine (N.Med) facilities.

TI  - Extracting Deciduous Forests Spring Phenology From Sentinel-1 Cross Ratio Index
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deciduous forests spring phenology plays a major role in balancing the carbon cycle. The cloud cover affects images acquired from optical sensors and reduces their performance in monitoring phenology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can regularly acquire images day and night independent of weather conditions, which offers more frequent observations of vegetation phenology compared to optical sensors. However, it remains unclear how SAR data-derived indices vary across different growth stages of forests. Here, we explored the relationship between the cross ratio (CR) index derived from Sentinel-1 data and the deciduous forest growth process. We proposed a deciduous forests spring phenology extraction method using CR and compared the extracted start of growing season (SOS) with those extracted using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 optical satellite data and green chromatic coordinate (GCC) derived from ground PhenoCam data. We extracted the SOS of 41 PhenoCam sites over the Continental United States in 2018 using the dynamic threshold method. Our results showed that the variations of CR time series are closely related to the phenological processes of deciduous forests. The SOS extracted using CR data showed high consistency with those extracted using GCC (R-2 = 0.46), with slightly lower accuracy compared with NDVI-derived results (R-2 = 0.62). Our study illustrates the value and mechanism of deciduous forests spring phenology extraction using SAR data and provides a reference for using SAR data to improve forest phenology extraction in addition to using optical remote sensing data, especially in rainy and cloudy regions.

TI  - A Parallel Algorithm for Hyperspectral Target Detection Based on Weighted Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection for hyperspectral images (HSIs) is one of the significant techniques in remote sensing data processing. Targets generally comprise various object categories with complex features and of varying sizes. Target detection is often used in complex application scenarios in which accurately and efficiently acquiring detection results can be challenging. The development of advanced target detection approaches is becoming increasingly necessary in both military and civilian fields. This article proposes an alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)-based parallel approach for hyperspectral target detection. Different from existing methods performing target detection solely on HSIs, our approach performs the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral data to leverage both spectral and spatial information prior. For each task or data partition, the parallel processing of the computation load on multiple computing nodes can substantially reduce the computation time. In addition, we introduce a novel weighted ADMM, which takes the influence of different variables on convergence into account, to further enhance the computational efficiency of the target detection model. Experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed parallel method not only produces more accurate detection results than direct detection methods, but also achieves significant acceleration ratio compared with the serial processing flow.

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection and Analysis of Mts. Palay-Palay Mataas-Na-Gulod Protected Landscape, Philippines using Satellite Imagery
T2  - MINDANAO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have already proven the existence of unsustainable human activities or disturbances assumed to cause land cover change on the Mts. Palay-Palay Mataas-Na-Gulod Protected Landscape (MPPMNGPL)in the Philippines. However, there is a dearth of published works on how these disturbances affect the different land cover classes in this protected landscape. This study aimed to help fill such information gap by investigating the extent of land cover changes and potentially disturbed forest areas inside the MPPMNGPL. Using geographic information system and remote sensing, classified maps were produced from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images through supervised classification. The study described the land cover types and land cover changes in the area from 2015 to 2021 and identified potentially disturbed forest areas using the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI). The land cover classes identified in the area included forest, grassland, built-up, barren land and water. From 2015 to 2021, the largest land cover change came from the 510.92 ha of forest area in Ternate that turned into a grassland area as reflected in the NDMI result - an indicator of potential forest disturbance. Change detection showed that from 2015 to 2021, the grassland area had an increase of +14.05%, while the forest area had a decrease of-13.8%. Results showed that forest is still the most dominant land cover class in the protected landscape. Further studies and ground validation must be conducted to determine the specific causes of the land cover changes.

TI  - Fengyun-3E Low Light Observation and Nighttime Lights Product
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The payload MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager-low light (MERSI-LL) of Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) equipped with a low-light band (LLB) first enabled the FY series satellite to detect low lights at night. Due to the early morning orbit of FY-3E, MERSI-LL/LLB only obtains nighttime observations in one hemisphere during the winter half-year, and nighttime observations are only found at high latitudes for the ascending orbit (at dusk) and globally covered for the descending orbit (at dawn). Using MERSI-LL/LLB data, we developed FY nighttime lights (FY-NTLs) product for socioeconomic use. Publicly released FY-NTL data include monthly and annual products for both ascending and descending orbits, which are composited from multitemporal MERSI-LL/LLB data after quality control. At present, the quality control procedure consists of moonlit data identification, stray light removal, cloud screening, and natural illumination exclusion. The absolute radiometric accuracy of FY-NTL degraded in the stray light removal process, and the comparison results with VIIRS NTL suggested that FY-NTL may bear a negative bias. Nonetheless, FY-NTL first images global NTLs at dawn and provides us with an opportunity to study city lights in different periods of the night.

TI  - Attribution of Urban Diurnal Thermal Environmental Change: Importance of Global-Local Effects
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is causing various negative impacts on urban ecosystems and energy systems. To effectively mitigate and adapt to these changes, it is important to understand the contributions of background climate and local effects to urban thermal environment variation. This study utilized the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) approach to deconstruct long-term MODIS land surface temperature (LST) datasets to obtain the main features of change in daytime and nighttime thermal environments. Local bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore the underlying causes of these changes. The main EOF modes explained 73.14% and 81.33% of daytime and nighttime thermal environment variation, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the time coefficient of the main modes and the average LST was > 0.99, reflecting the role of global effect caused by background climate change. The secondary EOF modes explained 12.51% and 4.12% of daytime and nighttime thermal environment variation, respectively, and were spatially correlated with changes in landscape thermal intensity, reflecting local effect caused by landscape change and anthropogenic heat emissions. In expansion and renewal areas, industrial zones and compact high-rise buildings had the most obvious warming effect on the daytime thermal environment, while mid-to-high-rise buildings had the most obvious warming effect on the nighttime thermal environment. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of background climate and local effects on the urban thermal environment, and provide a reference for formulating effective strategies for mitigating and adapting to change in urban areas, and for promoting sustainable development.

Some well-known spatiotemporal fusion methods like the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM; Gao et al., 2006) and the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM; Zhu et al., 2010), which were originally developed to fuse surface reflectance data, may not be suitable for direct application in LST studies due to the temporal dynamics of LST.

In ubESTARFM (Yu et al., 2023), we implement a local bias correction on the central pixel and similar fine-resolution pixels within the moving window using the mean value of corresponding coarse-resolution pixels as reference. By applying this linear scaling approach, we can scale the systematic biases of the fine-resolution data to the same level as the corresponding coarse-resolution data in each moving window, while maintaining the variation and spatial details of fine-resolution data. The ubESTARFM algorithm is written in R. We recommend users use a multi-core processor that can allow ubESTARFM to run in parallel and to be more efficient.

TI  - RiceMapEngine: A Google Earth Engine-Based Web Application for Fast Paddy Rice Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping rice area is a critical resource planning task in many South Asia countries where rice is the primary crop. Remote-sensing-based methods typically rely on domain knowledge, such as crop calendar and crop phenology, and supervised classification with ground truth samples. Applying such methods on Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proven effective, especially at large scale owing to the comprehensive and up-to-date data catalog and massive server-side processing power. However, writing scripts through the code editor requires users to program in JavaScript and understand GEE application programming interface (API), which can be challenging for many researchers. Thus, this article presents a GEE-based web application that aims to eliminate the programming requirements for data selection, preprocessing, and visualizations so that users can easily produce rice maps and refine ground truth collections through intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUI). This software includes three submodule apps, namely the ground truth collection app, threshold-based rice mapping app, and classification-based rice mapping app. Users can customize data processing flow using GUI designed with Bootstrap, and the backend server uses GEE Python API, and a Google service account for authentication to execute the workflow on Google cloud servers. The experiment shows that both the overall accuracy and Kappa scores of the mapping result are higher than 0.9, which suggests that RiceMapEngine can significantly reduce the complexity and time costs it takes to produce the accurate rice area maps and meet the demands of real-world stakeholders.

AB  - In the oasis area adjacent to the desert, there is more complex land cover information with rich details, multiscales of interest objects, and blur edge information, which poses some challenges to the semantic segmentation task in remote sensing images (RSIs). In traditional semantic segmentation methods, detailed spatial information is more likely lost in feature extraction stage and the global context information is more effectively integrated into segmentation results. To overcome these land cover semantic segmentation model, FPN_PSA_DLV3+ network, is proposed in an encoder-decoder manner capturing more fine edge and small objects information in RSIs. In the encoder stage, the improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling module extracts the multiscale features, especially small-scale feature details; feature pyramid network (FPN) module realizes better integration of detailed information and semantic information; and the spatial context information at both global and local levels is enhanced by introducing polarized self-attention (PSA) module. For the decoder stage, the FPN_PSA_DLV3+ network further adds a feature fusion branch to concatenate more low-level features. We select Landsat5/7/8 satellite RSIs from the areas of north and south of Xinjiang. Then, three self-annotated time-series datasets with more small objects and fine edges information are constructed by data augmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the segmentation performance of small targets and edges, and the classification performance increases from 81.55% to 83.10% F1 score and from 72.65% to 74.82% mean intersection over union only using red-green-blue bands. Meanwhile, the FPN_PSA_DLV3+ network shows great generalization in cross region and cross sensor.

TI  - 57-Year Ice Velocity Dynamics in Byrd Glacier Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time-series glacier ice velocity reflects the local climate changes and can be used to estimate mass balance (MB) changes, which is a critical parameter for understanding of glacier- climate interactions and prediction of sea level rise. However, due to the difficulty in image matching caused by the poor quality of historical satellite images, there was insufficient glacier ice velocity data before 1999. Here, we proposed a multiple-constraint dense image matching approach for mapping historical ice velocity based on the early poor-quality images from ARGON, Landsat-1, and Landsat-4/5. We successfully applied this method to Byrd Glacier to generate its historical ice velocity maps from 1963 to 1999. Additionally, ice velocity maps of Byrd Glacier from 2000 to 2014 were generated by IMCORR software using Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 images. Combining with the ice velocity maps from the Global Land Ice Velocity Extraction from Landsat-8 dataset since 2014, we obtained the ice velocity of Byrd Glacier for 57 years. Our results showed that the glacier experienced slight fluctuations in ice velocity, which may not be due to the calving events in the studied portion of the Ross Ice Shelf or the air temperature changes, but by the activity of subglacial drainage systems. Furthermore, Byrd Glacier showed a positive MB (average rate of 2.6 +/- 2.0 Gt/year) from 1963 to 2020, indicating that global climate change may have a limited impact on it.

TI  - Risk of De Novo Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy After Exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 During the Period From Preconception to Delivery: Birth Cohort Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Particulate matter (PM) is detrimental to the respiratory and circulatory systems. However, no study has evaluated the lag effects of weekly exposure to fine PM during the period from preconception to delivery on the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).Objective: We set out to investigate the lag effect windows of PM on the risk of HDPs on a weekly scale.Methods: Data from women with de novo HDPs and normotensive pregnant women who were part of the Peking University Retrospective Birth Cohort, based on the hospital information system of Tongzhou district, were obtained for this study. Meteorological data and data on exposure to fine PM were predicted by satellite remote sensing data based on maternal residential address. The de novo HDP group consisted ofpregnant women who were diagnosed with gestational hypertension orpreeclampsia. Fine PM was defined as PM2.5 and PM1. The gestational stage of participants was from preconception (starting 12 weeks before gestation) to delivery (before the 42nd gestational week). A distributed-lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was nested in a Cox regression model to evaluate the lag effects of weekly PM exposure on de novo HDP hazard by controlling the nonlinear relationship of exposure-reaction. Stratified analyses by employment status (employed or unemployed), education level (higher or lower), and parity (primiparity or multiparity) were performed.Results: A total of 22,570 pregnant women (mean age 29.1 years) for whom data were available between 2013 and 2017 were included in this study. The prevalence of de novo HDPs was 6.7% (1520/22,570). Our findings showed that PM1 and PM2.5 were significantly associated with an elevated hazard of HDPs. Exposure to PM1 during the 5th week before gestation to the 6th gestational week increased the hazard of HDPs. A significant lag effect of PM2.5 was observed from the 1st week before gestation to the 6th gestational week. The strongest lag effects of PM1 and PM2.5 on de novo HDPs were observed at week 2 and week 6 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.024, 95% CI 1.007-1.042; HR 1.007, 95% CI 1.000-1.015, respectively, per 10 mu g/m3 increase). The stratified analyses indicated that pregnant women who were employed, had low education, and were primiparous were more vulnerable to PM exposure for de novo HDPs.Conclusions: Exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 was associated with the risk of de novo HDPs. There were significant lag windows between the preconception period and the first trimester. Women who were employed, had low education, and were primiparous were more vulnerable to the effects of PM exposure; more attention should be paid to these groups for early prevention of de novo HDPs.

TI  - Pre-Seismic Anomaly Detection from Multichannel Infrared Images of FY-4A Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research of seismic infrared remote sensing has been undertaken for several decades, but there is no stable and effective earthquake prediction method. A new algorithm combining the long short-term memory and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise models is proposed to extract the anomalies from the multichannel infrared remote sensing images of the Fengyun-4 satellites. A statistical analysis is used to validate the correlation between the anomalies and earthquakes. The results show that the correlation rate is 64.29%, the hit rate is 68.75%, and the probability gain is about 1.91. In the Madoi and YangBi earthquake cases, the infrared anomaly detected in this paper is correlated with the TEC anomaly found in the previous research. This indicates that it is feasible to combine multi-source data to improve the accuracy of earthquake prediction in future studies.

TI  - The effect of the tumor-to-skin distance on axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tumor-to-skin distance is known to have an effect on axillary lymph node metastasis but has no clinical use with nomograms. This study aimed to investigate the effect of tumor-to-skin distance on axillary lymph node metastasis alone and in combination with nomogram for clinical use. METHODS: A total of 145 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer (T1-T2 stage) and whose axillary lymph nodes were evaluated (axillary dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy) between January 2010 and December 2020 were included in the study. Tumor-to-skin distance and other pathological data of the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 145 patients, 83 (57.2%) had metastatic lymph nodes in the axilla. Tumor-to-skin distance was different in terms of lymph node metastasis (p=0.045). In the receiver operating characteristic curve for tumor-to-skin distance, area under curve was 0.597 (95%CI 0.513-0.678, p=0.046), area under curve of the nomogram was 0.740 (95%CI 0.660-0.809), p<0.001) and nomogram+tumor-to-skin distance was 0.753 (95%CI 0.674-0.820), p<0.001). No statistical difference was found for axillary lymph node metastasis between the nomogram+tumor-to-skin distance and the nomogram alone (p=0.433). CONCLUSION: Although tumor-to-skin distance demonstrated a significant difference in axillary lymph node metastasis, it had a poor association with an area under curve value of 0.597 and did not produce a significant improvement in predicting lymph node metastasis when combined with the nomogram. The tumor-to-skin distance may be unlikely to enter clinical practice.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Changes in the Allala Watershed Based on Object Based Image Analysis Using Landsat and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - EUROPEAN SPATIAL DATA FOR COASTAL AND MARINE REMOTE SENSING, EUCOMARE 2022
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference of European Spatial Data for Coastal and Marine Remote Sensing (EUCOMARE)
CL  - Saint Malo, FRANCE
AB  - The coastal city of Tenes, located in northwestern Algeria, is exposed to several natural hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and forest fires. Due to human activities, socio-economic constructions, agricultural activities, and the resulting population acceleration, land cover and land use (LULC) dynamics in the city are changing over time. Hence, the understanding of LULC changes and its interactions with human activities and natural hazards is essential for appropriate land management and decision-making. In this study, we investigate LULC changes in the Allala watershed, including the city of Tenes, using remote sensing methods and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) based on random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms was performed to provide LULC classification maps, and then, LULC changes were assessed using GIS. In order to assess LULC changes, we used three images acquired using remote sensing, corresponding to 3 years; 1999, 2009, and 2020. A Sentinel-2 image and two Landsat images were used as input data in our methodology. Our LULC classification results showed that RF outperformed SVM on the three input data periods, with an overall accuracy of 95.6% obtained with the Sentinel-2 image. Given the changes over time, it is clear that the Allala watershed has undergone significant changes over the years, particularly an increase in building infrastructure and agricultural land due to population and urbanization growth. Analyzing and mapping the trends of LULC changes in the study area pro-vide a basis for strategic planning and managing, and results of LULC changes can be used as a decision support tool and provide further help in regional and national land management.

TI  - Environmental Forest Fire Danger Rating Systems and Indices around the Globe: A Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of the present review is to analyze and evaluate the most used and well-performing environmental forest fire danger rating systems and indices globally, aiming to the creation of an integrated forest fire danger system for Greece. The analysis emphasizes the core input parameters that have been associated with forest fire danger (i.e., weather, vegetation, topography, and hydrology) and the computational procedure of each system index as well as the categorization of the output values. Online search engines such as Scopus, Google Scholar, WorldWideScience, ScienceDirect, and ResearchGate were used in the search for relevant literature published in scientific journals, manuals, and reports. The retrieved studies were classified and reviewed. Studies were selected for analytically describing the calculation process related to forest fire danger ignition and not being strictly geographically bound. A total of 210 studies were included in the current review, describing 63 forest fire danger systems and indices. These were analyzed and evaluated based on a scoring system. Overall, the top-rated indices were the: Nesterov's index, Sharples' index, Keetch and Byram's drought index, Telicyn logarithmic, and vapor pressure deficit, and the 3rd and the 4th also proved to be the most accurate for fire-prone regions. Remote sensing indices also proved to be promising in forest fire danger estimation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important technology for ship detection applications. It can provide timely information on small boat locations, which is important for security and safety applications. This letter describes the advantages of using very-high-resolution TerraSAR-X data acquired in staring spotlight mode for detecting small boats. Coincident to the SAR image acquisitions, electro-optical (EO) satellite imagery was used, together with field photographs of boats. The results demonstrate the ability to distinguish SAR signatures of small wooden and fiberglass vessels with the size of up to 4 m in length.

TI  - Prose of Russian Emigration Writers (V. A. Nikiforov-Volgin, I. A. Bunin, B. K. Zaitsev) in Context of Ivan Ilyin's Religious-Philosophical Thought
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors of this article aim to contextualize the religious-philosophical ideas of the prominent philosopher of Russian emigration, Ivan Ilyin, with the prose of Ivan Bunin, Boris Zaitsev, and Vladimir Nikiforov-Volgin. The novelty of the research lies in identifying the typological correlation between Ilyin's ideas about the essential characteristics of national character, manifested in the pursuit of perfection, and the artistic worldview of Russian writers who interpreted life in Russia during periods of social upheaval. The introduction of the insufficiently studied phenomenon of Vladimir Nikiforov-Volgin's creative work into the field of prose by well-known authors is also an aspect of the novelty of this work. The analysis confirms that the writers perceptively revealed, through various life circumstances, often critical, the ability of people, regardless of their social status or age, to exhibit traits of Christian mercy and selflessness. Equally significant is the ability of individuals to live with a sense of light from Christian faith, despite external circumstances, and to transmit this feeling to others. Actions based on "virtues of the heart and conscience" - these most valuable principles of life according to Ilyin's thought - are multifacetedly reflected on the pages of the works presented here.

TI  - A One-Class Classification Model for Burned-Area Detection Based on Mutual Ordering of Normalized Differences
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global-scale assessment of burned area (BA) is essential for climate studies and open access satellite-borne multispectral (MS) imagery is vital for the mapping purpose. Global characterization of BAs via MS analysis is difficult as it usually requires ancillary data to model local factors such as vegetation types and local ecoclimate systems. This article proposes a novel classification model that exploits certain mathematical properties of normalized difference indexes (NDIs) to build an abstract space of features where the BA class can be learned globally and solely using MS images. The core idea is that, although NDIs are subject to strong intraclass variations, their mutual order (i.e., the sign of their difference) can be robust enough for characterization. By encoding every possible such ordering relation in a binary domain, the feature space turns out to be hyperdimensional, with abstraction capabilities similar to that of neural network (NN) layers. The proposed classification model is one-class and, therefore, is very convenient as it only requires training samples for the positive class to be collected. The model is experimentally validated in an extensive BA detection exercise with Sentinel-2 images that involves recently published global BA reference data. Results are promising as we report higher F1-score than those reported for state-of-the-art BA products currently available, which are obtained through hybrid techniques and multiple data sources. The model also outperforms the well-known and largely used one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), which is tested in this work for the first time for BA detection at a global scale.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the behavior of the viruses responsible for acute respiratory infections before (2016-2019) and after (2020-2021) the start of the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in pediatric patients treated at a reference center from Barranquilla, Colombia.Materials and Methods: A descriptive observational study was carried out, and data were obtained by reviewing the influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection database in the pediatric population of the sentinel surveillance reference center in the district of Barranquilla during the years 2016-2021, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.Results: During 2016-2019, the average age of individuals was 1.3 (+/- 1.7) years, during 2021, it was 2.3 (+/- 3.5) years. The distribution by sex was similar, predominantly male. August and February were the months with the highest record of symptoms for 2016-2019 and 2021, respectively, the most frequent being cough, fever, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. By 2021 there was a higher use of antibiotics and antivirals reported than in 2016-2019. Most patients tested negative for viral detection. When comparing the percentage of viruses detected by age group and years of detection, positivity was lower in 2021 by every age group, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected.Conclusions: There was less virus positivity in viral detection tests in the pediatric population in 2021. RSV persists as the main etiology affecting this population, especially infants. The use of antibiotic therapy in viral infections continues to be a problematic practice in their management. Sentinel surveillance can be strengthened throughout the country.

TI  - Robust Surface Deformation and Tropospheric Noise Characterization From Common-Reference Interferogram Subsets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation estimates often suffer from tropospheric noise errors, and many study sites do not have global positioning system (GPS) or in situ measurements for validating InSAR surface deformation solutions. Here, we present a method for characterizing both surface deformation and tropospheric noise from interferogram subsets. Choosing different subsets of interferograms that use a common-reference SAR scene allows us to quantify tropospheric noise and deformation signals. We demonstrate this method using 95 C-band Sentinel-1 SAR scenes acquired over the Oman Ophiolite and 133 scenes over the Island of Hawaii. For the Oman case, our method suggests that there is no detectable deformation signal. In this scenario, the average of any subset of interferograms with a common-reference SAR scene estimates the tropospheric noise contribution on that reference SAR date. Achieving similar to 0.5 cm of uncertainty requires a subset size of 40 common-reference interferograms. The observed tropospheric noise is non-Gaussian and follows a seasonal pattern. Propagation of tropospheric noise leads to up to similar to 5 cm of false deformation signal when deriving either a stacking or Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) time-series solution. For the Hawaii case, our method shows that the observed InSAR phase on the south flank of Kilauea is due to a secular deformation signal, while the phase over Mauna Loa is mostly associated with tropospheric noise. Our results are validated with independent GPS tropospheric zenith delay and surface deformation time series with sub-cm RMS errors.

TI  - Challenges Facing E-government Implementation and Adoption in the Era of 5G, 6G
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Management-E-government projects are in the early stages in many emerging countries. They are facing several challenges regarding their implementation and adoption in the 5G and 6G environments. This research aims to identi-fy the most prominent challenges facing the e-government project in the 5G and 6G environments, especially in the implementation and adoption phases. At the same time, it contributes to identifying the relationships and gaps through identifying factors that directly affect both the implementa-tion and adoption such as security, privacy, and protection of personal data. In the implementation phase, the institutional theory was adopted as a study model, which was enriched through an analytical study of more than 35 studies. The studies were conducted to identify the most noticeable obsta-cles hindering the e-government implementation in emerging countries. The challenges were related to organizational, infrastructure, political and social themes. The factors were investigated through a study conducted with officials and in-fluential people in the e-government in the Northern Region of Iraq (case study, ministry of interior). The study findings indicated that the previously mentioned themes pose impact on e-government implementation. Furthermore, the study contributed to identifying new contributions that include capabilities, mentality acceptance, leadership vision, tele-communication, Internet accessibility, employee training, and citizen education. In the adoption phase, UTAUT model was augmented by trusting the system and ethics of the Internet since they were factors used in the study. The results indicat-ed that significant distinctions exist in age differences, level of education, excepting gender, and both effort expectancy and behavioral intention for utilizing e-government services in the 5G and 6G environment. Finally, the study identified a set of factors through which relationships and gaps are iden-tified concerning the implementation and adoption of e -gov-ernment in the 5G and 6G environments.

TI  - Accounting for Deciduous Forest Structure and Viewing Geometry Effects Improves Sentinel-1 Time Series Image Consistency
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave scattering from forests generates pixel geolocation shifts in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data that require an adequate representation within digital elevation models (DEMs) for preprocessing. We analyze the impact of DEM properties on the radiometry and geolocation of radiometric terrain corrected Copernicus Sentinel-1 imagery of forests to improve consistency in backscatter intensities for time series analyses. To account for the penetration depth of the C-band sensor, we approximate the structure of stands in a temperate deciduous forest using height percentiles from aerial laser scanning (ALS) point clouds in the Hainich National Park (HNP), Germany. Comparing the RTC results obtained using DEMs of SRTM, Copernicus, and ALS DEMs, the latter reduces topographically induced errors, resulting in visibly smaller effects from topography and spatially shifted information. Based on the P50 ALS vegetation elevation, the results show homogeneous intensities within the same orbit and reduce variance from 2.4 to 1.2 dB2 in the difference in mid-range data from ascending and descending azimuth directions. Over forest, we observe lower intensities on sensor-facing and increased intensities on away-facing slopes and correlations with the illuminated pixel area (IPA) and local incidence angle (LIA). We reduce this bias with linear regressions of intensity on IPA. ALS DEMs in RTC and the proposed regression correction increase the consistency of images across orbits, measured by the inter-orbit range (IOR), throughout the selected year at our study site. We suggest the proposed method applies to other areas, requiring further testing under different forest types and topography.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics of the Huge Anmangynda Aufeis in the North-East of Russia (1962-2021)
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The huge Anmangynda aufeis is located in the valley of the river of the same name in the Magadan region in North-East of Russia. This is the only in the world aufeis site with a 30-years period of ground-based observations (1962-1991 ). The materials of these observations were supplemented with data obtained from the analysis of Landsat and Sentinel satellite images for the period 2000-2021, as well as the results of field investigations carried out in 2020-2021. The long-term variability of the maximum area, volume and average thickness of ice, the dynamics of formation and destruction of the aufeis ice in the cold and warm periods of the year were analyzed. It was found that the maximum values of the area and volume of ice on the dates before the start of ablation decreased by 25 and 33%, respectively. In 2000-2021, the average values of the aufeis characteristics are estimated as 4.7 km2 and 7.1 million m3, while in 1962-1991 - 5.5 km2 and 8.5 million m3. The analysis of the intra-annual dynamics revealed that the Anmangynda aufeis being earlier the perennial formation has transformed to the seasonal one. Further researches of the Anmangynda aufeis will make possible to assess the influence of various factors, in-cluding climatic ones, on the processes of an aufeis formation and to forecast their changes in the future for the cryolitic zone of the North-East of our country.

TI  - Physics-Driven Probabilistic Deep Learning for the Inversion of Physical Models With Application to Phenological Parameter Retrieval From Satellite Times Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent Sentinel satellite constellations and deep learning methods offer great possibilities for estimating the states and dynamics of physical parameters on a global scale. Such parameters and their corresponding uncertainties can be retrieved by machine learning methods solving probabilistic inverse problems. Nevertheless, the scarcity of reference data to train supervised methodologies is a well-known constraint for remote sensing applications. To address such limitations, this work presents a new generic physics-guided probabilistic deep learning methodology to invert physical models. The presented methodology proposes a new strategy to combine probabilistic deep learning methods and physical models avoiding simulation-driven machine learning. The inverse problem is addressed through a Bayesian inference framework by proposing a new physically constrained self-supervised representation learning methodology. To show interest in the proposed strategy, the methodology is applied to the retrieval of phenological parameters from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. As a result, the probability distributions of the intrinsic phenological model parameters are inferred. The feasibility of the method is evaluated on both simulated and real Sentinel-2 data and compared with different standard algorithms. Promising results show satisfactory accuracy predictions and low inference times for real applications.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery Application to Monitor Soil Salinity and Calcium Carbonate Contents in Agricultural Fields
T2  - PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estuary tides affect groundwater dynamics; these areas are susceptible to waterlogging and salinity issues. A study was conducted on two fields with a total area of 60 hectares under a center pivot irrigation system that works with solar energy and belong to a commercial farm located in Northern Sudan. To monitor soil salinity and calcium carbonate in the area and stop future degradation of soil resources, easy, non-intrusive, and practical procedures are required. The objective of this study was to use remote sensing-determined Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using various soil indices to develop prediction models for the estimation of soil electrical conductivity (EC) and soil calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Geo-referenced soil samples were collected from 72 locations and ana-lyzed in the laboratory for soil EC and CaCO3. The electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract was represented by average values in soil dataset samples from two fields collected from the topsoil layer (0 to 15 cm) characteristic of the local salinity gradient. The various soil indices, used in this study, were calculated from the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The prediction was determined using the root mean square error (RMSE) and cross validation was done using coefficient of determination. The results of regression analysis showed linear relation-ships with significant correlation between the EC analyzed in laboratory and the salinity index-2 "SI2" (Model-1: R2 = 0.59, p = 0.00019 and root mean square error (RMSE = 1.32%) and the bare soil index "BSI" (Model-2: R2 = 0.63, p = 0.00012 and RMSE = 6.42%). Model-1 demonstrated the best model for predicting soil EC, and validation R2 and RMSE values of 0.48% and 1.32%, respectively. The regression analysis results for soil CaCO3 determination showed linear relationships with data obtained in laboratory and the bare soil index "BSI" (Model -3: R2 = 0. 45, p = 0.00021 and RMSE = 1.29%) and the bare soil index "BSI" & Normalized difference salinity index "NDSI" (Model-4: R2 = 0.53, p = 0.00015 and RMSE = 1.55%). The validation confirmed the Model-3 results for prediction of soil CaCO3 with R2 and RMSE values of 0.478% and 1.29%, respectively. Future soil monitoring programs might consider the use of remote sensing data for assessing soil salinity and CaCO3 using soil indices results generated from satellite image (i.e., Sentinel-2).

TI  - RSVG: Exploring Data and Models for Visual Grounding on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we introduce the task of visual grounding for remote sensing data (RSVG). RSVG aims to localize the referred objects in remote sensing (RS) images with the guidance of natural language. To retrieve rich information from RS imagery using natural language, many research tasks, such as RS image visual question answering, RS image captioning, and RS image-text retrieval, have been investigated a lot. However, the object-level visual grounding on RS images is still underexplored. Thus, in this work, we propose to construct the dataset and explore deep learning models for the RSVG task. Specifically, our contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we build the new large-scale benchmark of RSVG based on detection in optical remote sensing (DIOR) dataset, termed DIOR-RSVG, to fully advance the research of RSVG. This new dataset includes image/expression/box triplets for training and evaluating visual grounding models. Second, we benchmark extensive state-of-the-art (SOTA) natural image visual grounding methods on the constructed DIOR-RSVG dataset, and some insightful analyses are provided based on the results. Third, a novel transformer-based multigranularity visual language fusion (MGVLF) module is proposed. Remotely sensed images are usually with large-scale variations and cluttered backgrounds. To deal with the scale-variation problem, the MGVLF module takes advantage of multiscale visual features and multigranularity textual embeddings to learn more discriminative representations. To cope with the cluttered background problem, MGVLF adaptively filters irrelevant noise and enhances salient features. In this way, our proposed model can incorporate more effective multilevel and multimodal features to boost performance. This work can provide useful insights for developing better RSVG models.

TI  - CloudViT: A Lightweight Vision Transformer Network for Remote Sensing Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds inevitably exist in satellite images, which limit the processing and application of satellite images to a certain extent. Therefore, cloud detection is a preprocessing task in satellite image extraction and analysis processing. However, the existing methods are difficult to mine robust features, and the number of parameters and computation are large, which is not conducive to the deployment of the model. In this letter, cloud vision transformer (CloudViT), a lightweight vision transformer network for cloud detection from satellite imagery, is proposed. In detail, to utilize dark channel priors in multispectral imagery to guide the network to learn features, a multiscale dark channel extractor is used to first predict dark channels, and then, the dark channel features and image features are input to the attention mechanism-based dark channel-guided context aggregation module to enhance image features, which in turn makes cloud detection results more accurate. At the same time, to enhance the transfer ability of the network between different satellite sensors, a plug-and-play channel adaptive module is proposed to deal with the inconsistency of the number of different satellite sensor bands. The experimental results on the Landsat7 dataset show that our network CloudViT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while keeping the number of parameters and computation small. At the same time, the experimental results on transfer to three other datasets show that using the channel adaptation module can greatly improve the transfer ability of the model.

TI  - Linking repeat lidar with Landsat products for large scale quantification of fire-induced permafrost thaw settlement in interior Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The permafrost-fire-climate system has been a hotspot in research for decades under a warming climate scenario. Surface vegetation plays a dominant role in protecting permafrost from summer warmth, thus, any alteration of vegetation structure, particularly following severe wildfires, can cause dramatic top-down thaw. A challenge in understanding this is to quantify fire-induced thaw settlement at large scales (>1000 km(2)). In this study, we explored the potential of using Landsat products for a large-scale estimation of fire-induced thaw settlement across a well-studied area representative of ice-rich lowland permafrost in interior Alaska. Six large fires have affected similar to 1250 km(2) of the area since 2000. We first identified the linkage of fires, burn severity, and land cover response, and then developed an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to estimate fire-induced thaw settlement by relating airborne repeat lidar data to Landsat products. The model delineated thaw settlement patterns across the six fire scars and explained similar to 65% of the variance in lidar-detected elevation change. Our results indicate a combined application of airborne repeat lidar and Landsat products is a valuable tool for large scale quantification of fire-induced thaw settlement.

TI  - A General Thin Cloud Correction Method Combining Statistical Information and a Scattering Model for Visible and Near-Infrared Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination is inevitable in optical satellite images, especially for those in visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectra. A general thin cloud correction method for satellite VNIR images is proposed in this study by coupling statistical information with a scattering model to solve the abovementioned problem. A thin cloud map (TCM) is created by utilizing the characteristics of land surface and thin clouds to depict the thin cloud spatial distribution and relative intensity. Furthermore, different cloud reflectance estimation (CRE) algorithms are proposed for different VNIR bands by considering the scattering properties of thin clouds. For coastal and blue bands with short wavelengths, the images are divided into multiple layers to search for dark pixels based on TCM so that thin clouds can be estimated via robust regression. The CRE of the green, red, and near-infrared bands with long wavelengths is realized via the scattering model by taking the thin clouds of coastal or blue bands as a reference. Experiments are performed on cloud-covered VNIR images captured by different satellites to validate the universality of the proposed method. Two traditional methods and one deep learning method are utilized for comparison. Compared with the benchmark methods, the proposed method yields totally cloud-free images and more credible color. The quantitative measures obtained by the proposed method are the closest to the ideal values among the four methods. Discussions of the novelties of the proposed method, the extended applications of TCM, and the parallax problem in experiments are also performed to complete the evaluation.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Pattern of Net Ecosystem Productivity in China and Its Response to Climate Change in the Past 40 Years
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem productivity (NEP), which is considered an important indicator to measure the carbon source/sink size of ecosystems on a regional scale, has been widely studied in recent years. Since China's terrestrial NEP plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, it is of great significance to systematically examine its spatiotemporal pattern and driving factors. Based on China's terrestrial NEP products estimated by a data-driven model from 1981 to 2018, the spatial and temporal pattern of China's terrestrial NEP was analyzed, as well as its response to climate change. The results demonstrate that the NEP in China has shown a pattern of high value in the west and low value in the east over the past 40 years. NEP in China from 1981 to 2018 showed a significantly increasing trend, and the NEP change trend was quite different in two sub-periods (i.e., 1981-1999 and 2000-2018). The temporal and spatial changes of China's terrestrial NEP in the past 40 years were affected by both temperature and precipitation. However, the area affected by precipitation was larger. Our results provide a valuable reference for the carbon sequestration capacity of China's terrestrial ecosystem.

TI  - PrecipGradeNet: A New Paradigm and Model for Precipitation Retrieval with Grading of Precipitation Intensity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real-time precipitation retrieval plays an important role in the study of the evolutionary process of precipitation and the prevention of disasters caused by heavy precipitation. Compared with ground-based precipitation observations, the infrared precipitation estimations from geostationary satellites have great advantages in terms of geographical coverage and temporal resolution. However, precipitation retrieved from multispectral infrared data still faces challenges in terms of accuracy, especially in extreme cases. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for satellite multispectral infrared data retrieval of precipitation and construct a new model called PrecipGradeNet. This model uses FY-4A L1 FDI data as the input, IMERG precipitation data as the training target, and improves the precipitation retrieval accuracy by grading the precipitation intensity through Res-UNet, a semantic segmentation network. To evaluate the precipitation retrieval of the model, we compare the retrieval results with the FY-4A L2 QPE operational product to the IMERG precipitation. IMERG is considered as the ground truth. We evaluate the precipitation retrieval from the precipitation fall area identification, the precipitation intensity interval discrimination, and the precipitation quantification. Experimental results show that PrecipGradeNet has better overall performance compared with the FY-4A QPE product in precipitation fall area identification with POD increased by 48% and CSI and HSS improved by 21% and 14%. PrecipGradeNet also has better performance in light precipitation with POD increased by 114% and CSI and HSS improved by 64% and 52%, and better overall precipitation quantification, with RMSE and CC improved by 16% and 15%. In addition, PrecipGradeNet avoids the overall bias in the low and extreme high precipitation cases. Therefore, the new paradigm proposed in this paper has the potential to improve the retrieval accuracy of satellite precipitation estimation products. This study suggests that the application of semantic segmentation methods may provide a new path to correct the intensity bias of the satellite-based precipitation products.

TI  - Estimation of Gully Growth Rate and Erosion Amount Using UAV and Worldview-3 Images in Yimeng Mountain Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-homogeneous soil's high gravel content (also known as the "soil-rock dual structure") may render it more prone to erosion and the significant development of gullies. In order to reveal the morphological characteristics and erosion rate of gullies in "soil-rock dual structure" areas, this study focused on the Shagou Reservoir basin in the Yimeng mountain area as the study area. Based on a complete digital orthophoto map (DOM, 0.03 m) and a digital elevation model (DEM, 0.03 m) acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the researchers calculated the length (L), top width (TW), depth (D), area (A) and volume (V) of 19 gullies and built and optimized the volume estimation model. The DOM and the DEM were used to modify the morphological parameters of 43 gullies extracted from high-resolution remote sensing (RS) stereopair images (Worldview, 0.5 m), and the development and evolution of gully erosion were evaluated in large scale. The results showed that: (1) after correction, the average relative errors of parameters L, TW, D and A computed from the UAV data and the high-resolution RS stereopair image data fell below 0.005%; (2) the mean of TW/D was 5.20, i.e., the lateral erosion development of gullies far outweighed the downcutting erosion. The retrogressive erosion, lateral erosion and downcutting erosion rates of gullies were 0.01 similar to 0.83 m/a (averaged at 0.23 m/a), 0.01 similar to 0.68 m/a (averaged at 0.25 m/a) and 0.01 similar to 0.19 m/a (averaged at 0.09 m/a), respectively, between 2014 and 2021; (3) the volume-area (V-A) model for gullies is the optimal one (p < 0.01, R-2 = 0.944).A total of 90.7% of the gully volume was growing at an erosion rate of 0.42 similar to 399.39 m(3)/a and the total erosion rate of the gullies was 3181.56 m(3)/a from 2014 to 2021. These research findings can serve as a basis for the quantitative modeling of gully erosion in water-eroded locations with a large-dimension "soil-rock dual structure".

TI  - Detecting <i>Sargassum</i> Bloom Directly From Satellite Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance With High-Resolution Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive floating Sargassum blooms have occurred frequently in many parts of the global ocean, and satellite remote sensing provides an effective way to monitor their spatiotemporal variation. Coarse-resolution satellite data, however, often suffer from a data gap in nearshore waters and detection uncertainty of Sargassum amount, especially for smaller patches. These limitations may be ameliorated by high-resolution satellite data, yet such great potential is hindered by the lack of reliable and easy-to-implement methods to detect Sargassum slicks. Here, combining the visible and near-infrared (NIR) topof-atmosphere reflectance ( R-TOA) data with the random forest (RF) model, a new method, namely the RTOA-RF model, was designed to automatically detect Sargassum from high-resolution satellite imagery with four wavebands. Specifically, this model was successfully applied to various satellite sensors, including Gaofen1-wide field view multispectral camera (GF1-WFV; 16 m), GF2 multispectral scanner (GF2-MSS; 4 m), GF6-WFV (16 m), Huanjing1A/B charge-coupled device (HJ1A/B-CCD; 30 m), Haiyang1C/D coastal zone imager (HY1C/D-CZI; 50 m). Comparisons with visual inspection and cross-index indicated that all achieved satisfactory performance for detecting Sargassum slicks, with overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa values greater than 96% and 88%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the model as an example of different sensors suggested that the RTOA-RF model can effectively identify Sargassum features under complex ocean background, cloud cover, and sunglint, even under conditions of surface wave glitter and weak Sargassum feature with low false positive rate (<9.60%). The findings here not only pave the way for operational monitoring of fine-scale Sargassum, but importantly provide thought for developing detection method of macroalgae blooms in global water.

TI  - PREDICTING BANANA YIELD AT THE FIELD SCALE BY COMBINING SENTINEL-2 TIME SERIES DATA AND REGRESSION MODELS
T2  - APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - . Banana yield prediction at the field level offers significant benefits to growers, packinghouses, crop insurance companies, and researchers. This study explored a remote sensing-based approach for forecasting banana yield at the field scale by using Sentinel-2 (S2) image time series and regression models. First, S2 images of critical phenological periods for bananas were acquired from the Google Earth Engine platform, and these images were treated with cloud and cloud shadow removal. Second, the dataset was expanded by randomly selecting pixels for each field to improve the accuracy of yield prediction. Third, nine vegetation indices (VIs) with high correlation with crop yield were compared and analyzed. Chlorophyll Index Red Edge was selected with a particularly high predictive ability in banana yield prediction. Finally, six regression models, namely, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector regression (SVR), knearest neighbors (k-NN), random forest (RF), gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), were employed, and their performances were compared. Results showed that the best prediction of banana yield was when 70 pixels were selected for each banana field. Out of nine VIs, comparing different regression models, the XGBoost model emerged as the best learner (the average of R2 for 100 runs in 2019 and 2020 were 0.84 and 0.79, respectively). It was followed by the GBRT model with almost the same performance, which explained 82% and 79% of the banana yield variability for 2019 and 2020, respectively. The LASSO model exhibited the lowest performance of all, but it performed best in terms of stability. The proposed framework applied to satellite image time series can achieve reliable banana yield prediction across years at the field scale.

TI  - Multimodal Attention-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The attention mechanism is one of the most influential ideas in the deep learning community, which has shown excellent efficiency in various computer vision tasks. Thus, this article proposes the convolution neural network method with the attention mechanism to enhance the feature extraction of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Meanwhile, our elaborately designed cascaded block contains a short path architecture beneficial for multistage information exchange. With the full exploitation of elevation information from LiDAR data and efficient utilization of the spatial-spectral information underlying hyperspectral data, our method provides a novel solution for multimodal feature fusion. Experiments are conducted on the LiDAR and hyperspectral dataset provided by the 2013 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and multisource Trento dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results have shown the superior results of the proposed method on both LiDAR and multimodality remote sensing data in comparison with several popular baselines.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon Content Using Sentinel-1/2 and Machine Learning Algorithms in Swamp Wetlands in Northeast China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a sensitive indicator of climate change, and small changes in the soil carbon pool will affect the carbon balance. Accurate and robust SOC quantitative prediction is of great significance to studying the carbon budget of swamp wetlands and its response to climate change. In this study, a new framework was proposed and assessed for predicting the SOC content based on Sentinel-2 (S2), Sentinel-1 (S1), and the digital elevation model (DEM) together with the extreme gradient boosting with random forest (XGBRF) model. The determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) were applied to assess the performances of the models. The results revealed that the prediction performance of the XGBRF regression model was much better than that of extreme gradient boosting and random forest regression models. Compared with single sensor data, using multisensor data to predict the SOC content yielded more accurate results. The XGBRF model based on S1, S2, and DEM fusion yielded the highest prediction accuracy (R-2_testing = 0.6639, RMSE = 1.3236 g/kg, MAE = 1.2546 g/kg, LCCC = 0.7621). Regarding the importance of the variables, the S1 and S2 features were major contributors to the SOC content prediction (41% and 52%, respectively), followed by the topographic variables extracted from the DEM (7%). The proposed framework can be used for SOC prediction based on a small sample dataset, and it provides a method for long-term and rapid monitoring of the SOC contents in wetlands.

TI  - Research on the Establishment of Carbon Inversion Model in Engebei Ecological Demonstration Area of the Kubuqi Desert Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the changes of vegetation coverage and carbon storage in a terrestrial ecosystem will provide important information for ecosystem optimization. The Kubuqi Desert is a typical ecological fragile area, and its ecological construction is not only to build an ecological barrier to protect northern China but also to be a case of similar regions in the world. Engebei ecological demonstration area, located on the northern margin of the central Kubuqi Desert, was selected as the study area. The objective is to establish a carbon inversion model through the LASSO regression model in this area which can promote its ecological development. Taking Landsat, Sentinel-2A remote sensing data, and field sample data as data sources. The vegetation coverage was calculated through the remote sensing data. The carbon reserves in plots were calculated through the biomass equation. Then, the appropriate carbon storage estimation model was found, which was established by the LASSO regression model and the Sentinel-2A remote sensing images. Finally, the carbon reserves over the years were calculated by this estimation model. Research shows that: first, the overall vegetation coverage of the study area was not high, which was around 27%-37%; second, the proportion of lower (I) level vegetation coverage in the study area decreased overall, and the proportion of higher (V) level vegetation coverage generally stabilized; third, carbon reserves remain roughly above 71752.64t, up by 20,209.61t in 2021 compared to 2020, and up by 14,867.02t in 2021 compared to 1991.

TI  - MLBR-YOLOX: An Efficient SAR Ship Detection Network With Multilevel Background Removing Modules
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the remote sensing images of marine synthetic aperture radar (SAR), ship targets often occupy only a small part of an image, and the rest are all sea and coastal backgrounds. Existing neural networks based on SAR ship detection often directly detect an entire SAR image, which consumes a large amount of computing resources. In this article, a new marine SAR ship detection network, called multilevel background removing-you only look once X (MLBR-YOLOX), is proposed. First, a new plug-and-play module, called standalone spatial patch detector, is proposed to predetect the position of ships and filter out most of the sea backgrounds at the source image level. Second, a deep spatial feature detector is presented for detecting deep semantic features of the output of the backbone module to further reduce the computational cost of the neck and head modules. Finally, the original YOLOX network is adopted to locate and classify the pre-detected results. Experimental results on the SAR ship detection dataset and the high-resolution SAR images dataset indicate that the detection performance of MLBR-YOLOX is close to that of YOLOX, but the computational complexity is merely 23.97% and 12.50% of YOLOX's, respectively. Moreover, the experiment conducted on a large-scene Sentinel-1 SAR image illustrates that the proposed network has good migration application capability.

TI  - Intelligent crowd sensing pickpocketing group identification using remote sensing data for secure smart cities
T2  - MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a public infrastructure service, remote sensing data provided by smart cities will go deep into the safety field and realize the comprehensive improvement of urban management and services. However, it is challenging to detect criminal individuals with abnormal features from massive sensing data and identify groups composed of criminal individuals with similar behavioral characteristics. To address this issue, we study two research aspects: pickpocketing individual detection and pickpocketing group identification. First, we propose an IForest-FD pickpocketing individual detection algorithm. The IForest algorithm filters the abnormal individuals of each feature extracted from ticketing and geographic information data. Through the filtered results, the factorization machines (FM) and deep neural network (DNN) (FD) algorithm learns the combination relationship between low-order and high-order features to improve the accuracy of identifying pickpockets composed of factorization machines and deep neural networks. Second, we propose a community relationship strength (CRS)-Louvain pickpocketing group identification algorithm. Based on crowdsensing, we measure the similarity of temporal, spatial, social and identity features among pickpocketing individuals. We then use the weighted combination similarity as an edge weight to construct the pickpocketing association graph. Furthermore, the CRS-Louvain algorithm improves the modularity of the Louvain algorithm to overcome the limitation that small-scale communities cannot be identified. The experimental results indicate that the IForest-FD algorithm has better detection results in Precision, Recall and F1score than similar algorithms. In addition, the normalized mutual information results of the group division effect obtained by the CRS-Louvain pickpocketing group identification algorithm are better than those of other representative methods.

TI  - Dynamic Changes, Spatiotemporal Differences, and Ecological Effects of Impervious Surfaces in the Yellow River Basin, 1986-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces (IS) are one of the most important components of the earth's surface, and understanding how IS have expanded is vital. However, few studies on IS or urbanization have focused on the cradle of the Chinese nation-the Yellow River Basin (YRB). In this study, the Random Forest and Temporal Consistency Check methods were employed to generate long-term maps of IS in the YRB based on Landsat imagery. To explore the dynamics and differences in IS, we developed a spatiotemporal analysis and put forward regional comparisons between different research units of the YRB. We documented the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) in multiple circular zones to discuss the ecological effects of the expansion of IS. The IS extraction strategy achieved excellent performance, with an average overall accuracy of 90.93% and kappa coefficient of 0.79. The statistical results demonstrated that the spatial extent of IS areas in the YRB increased to 18,287.36 km(2) in 2020 which was seven times more than that in 1986, at rates of 166 km(2)/a during 1986-2001, 365 km(2)/a during 2001-2010, and 1044 km(2)/a during 2011-2020. Our results indicated that the expansion and densification of IS was slow in core urban areas with high initial IS fraction (ISF), significant in the suburban or rural areas with low initial ISF, and obvious but not significant in the exurb rural or depopulated areas with an initial ISF close to 0. The multiyear RSEI indicated that environmental quality of the YRB had improved with fluctuations. The ecological effects of the impervious expansion slightly differed in urban core areas versus outside these areas. When controlling the urban boundary, more attention should be paid to the rational distribution of ecologically important land. These results provide comprehensive information about IS expansion and can provide references for delineating urban growth boundaries.

TI  - The Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Glacier Activities in the Eastern Pamir Plateau Investigated by Time Series Sub-Pixel Offsets From Sentinel-2 Optical Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Pamir Plateau, with a mean altitude of 5000 m, forms a large-scale glacier region with a size of 2054 km2 that serves as an important environmental climate condition for central Asia. In this article, we estimated the spatio-temporal patterns of glacier activities in this region by using the time series sub-pixel offsets derived from 63 sentinel-2 optical images between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Our results indicated the mean glacier flow velocity in this region was 0.531 m/d +/- 0.007 m/d in 2021, and the Kongur Tagh Glacier was much more active than the Kingata Glacier and Muztagh Ata Glacier. The time series observations revealed that the glacier motion involves a pre-melting period (January-April) with a velocity of 0.600 m/d +/- 0.012 m/d, a melting period (May-August) with a velocity of 0.608 m/d +/- 0.003 m/d, and a post-melting period (September-December) with a velocity of 0.659 m/d +/- 0.006 m/d. In order to get insights into the characteristics of these glacier activities, we carried out a correlation analysis between the glacier flow velocity change and its potential caused reasons (i.e., topography, temperature, precipitation, glacier surges, debris-cover, and glacier thickness), and current results suggest that the glacier flow velocity is influenced by a combination of these factors.

TI  - Learning Deep Multiscale Local Dissimilarity Prior for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various deep neural networks (DNNs) have been constructed to inject the spatial information of the panchromatic (PAN) image into the low spatial resolution multispectral (LR MS) image. However, most of them ignore the local dissimilarity (LD) prior between MS and PAN images, which has a negative influence on the fused image. Considering the above-mentioned issues, we propose a deep multiscale LD network (DMLD-Net) to learn the LD prior at different scales and enhance the spatial and spectral information in the fused image better. Specifically, we first synthesize a downsampled PAN image from the original PAN image to match the scale of the LR MS image. Then, an LD metric is designed to calculate the dissimilarity map between the two images in feature space. According to the learned dissimilarity map, we use an LD-guided attention block (LDGAB) to suppress the impact of LD, which filters out the dissimilar information in the features of the PAN image. To learn the LD prior between MS and PAN images sufficiently, the multiscale architecture is considered and we infer the dissimilar maps hierarchically and inject filtered features into the LR MS image progressively. Finally, the fused image is generated by a reconstruction block. Through the LD learning at different scales, reasonable spatial information is extracted from the PAN image, by which the distortions in the fused image caused by LD can be reduced efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMLD-Net in terms of spatial and spectral preservation. The code is available at https://github.com/RSMagneto/DMLD-Net.

TI  - Spatial-Spectral Dual Back-Projection Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep unfolding networks have obtained satisfactory performance in the pansharpening task owing to their sufficient interpretability. Inspired by the back-projection (BP) mechanism, we propose a BP-driven model, spatial-spectral dual back-project network (S2DBPN), to fuse the low spatial resolution multi spectral (LR MS) and the high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images by exploiting the BP in spatial and spectral domains. Specifically, the proposed S2DBPN is made up of a spatial BP network, a spectral BP network, and a reconstruction network. In the spatial BP network, spatial down-and up projection modules are derived from BP, which is responsible for the projection of the LR MS image into the spatial domain. By analogy with the spatial BP, we reformulate the degradation between high spatial resolution multispectral (HR MS) and PAN images as spectral down-and up-projections. Then, the spectral BP network is constructed for the projection of the PAN image along the channel dimension. Finally, the features from spatial and spectral BP networks are integrated to produce the desired HR MS image through the reconstruction network. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on QuickBird, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2 datasets demonstrate that our (SDBPN)-D-2 produces better HR MS images in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics. The code of S2DBPN is released at: https://github.com/RSMagneto/S2DBPN.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics and Dynamic Persistence Analysis of Carbon Sources/Sinks in the Yellow River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is an important indicator for estimating regional carbon sources/sinks. The study focuses on a comprehensive computational simulation and spatiotemporal variation study of the NEP in the Yellow River basin from 2000 to 2020 using NPP data products from MODIS combined with a quantitative NEP estimation model followed by a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and dynamic procession persistence analysis based on meteorological data and land use data. The results show that: (1) The total NEP in the Yellow River basin had an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, with a Theil-Sen trend from -23.37 to 43.66 gCm(-2)a(-1) and a mean increase of 4.64 gCm(-2)a(-1) (p < 0.01, 2-tailed). (2) Most areas of the Yellow River basin are carbon sink areas, and the annual average NEP per unit area was 208.56 gCm(-2)a(-1) from 2000 to 2020. There were, however, substantial spatial and temporal variations in the NEP. Most of the carbon source area was located in the Kubuqi Desert and its surroundings. (3) Changes in land use patterns were the main cause of changes in regional NEP. During the 2000-2020 period, 1154.24 t of NEP were added, mainly due to changes in land use, e.g., the conversion of farmland to forests and grasslands. (4) The future development in 83.43% of the area is uncertain according to the Hurst index dynamic persistence analysis. In conclusion, although the carbon-sink capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem in the Yellow River basin is increasing and the regional carbon sink potential is increasing in the future, the future development of new energy resources has regional uncertainties, and the stability of the basin ecosystem needs to be enhanced.

TI  - Impacts of Direct Assimilation of the FY-4A/GIIRS Long-Wave Temperature Sounding Channel Data on Forecasting Typhoon In-Fa (2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the Advanced Weather Research Forecast model (WRF-ARW) is used to investigate the potential impacts of assimilating the FengYun-4A (FY-4A) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) long-wave temperature sounding channel data on the prediction of Typhoon In-Fa (2021). In addition, a series of data assimilation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the added value of the FY-4A/GIIRS data assimilation for typhoon forecasts. It is shown that the higher spectral resolution and broader coverage of GIIRS radiance data can positively impact the model analysis and forecasts with larger temperature and moisture increments at the initial time of simulations, thus producing a better simulation for the typhoon's warm core aloft, vortex wind structure, and spiral rainfall band. Moreover, the assimilation of the GIIRS data can also lead to better storm steering flows and, consequently, better typhoon track forecasts. Overall, the assimilation of FY-4A/GIIRS temperature sounding channel data shows some added values to improve the track and storm structure forecasts of Typhoon In-Fa.

TI  - A Polarimetric Decomposition and Copula Quantile Regression Approach for Soil Moisture Estimation From Radarsat-2 Data Over Vegetated Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a novel framework for probabilistic estimation of surface soil moisture (SSM) based on polarimetric decomposition and copula quantile regression, mainly focusing on solving the low correlation between synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering coefficients and SSM in corn-covered areas. Cloude-Pottier decomposition and adaptive nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition can extract more polarization parameters, explaining the implicit information in polarization data from different theoretical levels. Polarization parameters and the backscattering coefficients for different polarizations constitute predictor variable parameters for estimating the SSM. The dimensionality of the predictor variable parameters is reduced by supervised principal component analysis to derive the first principal component. SPCA ensures a high correlation between the first principal component and the SSM. Finally, the Archimedes copula function simply and effectively constructs the nonlinear relationship between SSM and the first principal component to complete the quantile regression estimation of SSM. Results show that the root-mean-square error range of SSM estimation is 0.039-0.078 cm(3)/cm(3) and the correlation coefficient (R) is 0.401-0.761. In addition, copula quantile regression constructs an uncertainty range for the SSM estimate, which can be used to judge the reliability of the estimate.

TI  - Unsupervised Ship Detection in SAR Images Using Superpixels and CSPNet
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is critical to ocean surveillance and rescue. Although many deep learning SAR ship detection methods have been proposed, the performance of these methods depends on the size and quality of the training samples. To resolve these issues, this letter presents an unsupervised ship detection method in SAR images using superpixel segmentation and cross stage partial network (CSPNet). First, the SAR image is over-segmented into superpixels based on our previously proposed superpixel generation algorithm. Then, the complex signal kurtosis (CSK) and a local superpixel contrast are integrated as a statistical indicator for the automatic identification of ship superpixels and background superpixels, thus leading to generation of training samples. Finally, the segmented superpixels are input to the CSPNet, which can learn a representative feature set with high discrimination ability between ships and backgrounds. Our method can achieve pixel-level detection map rather than the bounding box result. Experiments based on the Gaofen-3 and TerraSAR SAR data demonstrate that our method can achieve above 90% actual detection rate.

TI  - Enhanced Generalized Regression Neural Network With Backward Sequential Feature Selection for Machine-Learning-Driven Soil Moisture Estimation: A Case Study Over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is affected by many factors, such as soil characteristics, land cover, and meteorological conditions, making accurate remote sensing SM estimation a tough task. To fully explore the complementary information of multisource remote sensing data in SM estimation, it is necessary to explore the multiple feature variable selection method. Traditional filter methods may lead to feature redundancy and low accuracy, and embedding methods usually require complex parameter optimization. To overcome the above issues, we propose an enhanced generalized regression neural network with backward sequential feature selection (EBSFS) method for SM estimation. By using $k$-fold cross-validation to obtain the training set and validation set, and using the Pearson correlation coefficient to design evaluation criteria and an objective function, EBSFS searches for feature variables that minimize the objective function and updates the feature subset during iteration. EBSFS can adaptively obtain the optimal number of feature variables based on the evaluation criteria. Moreover, EBSFS does not require parameter optimization and can be flexibly and conveniently embedded into ensemble learning framework. Experiments conducted over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from April 2015 to March 2016 demonstrate that EBSFS greatly reduces the feature redundancy, produces a more compact feature subset, and achieves higher estimation accuracy. Precisely, EBSFS presents better performance with R = 0.9544 and RMSE = 0.0310 under 13 input feature variables.

TI  - High-Power Acoustol-Optic <i>Q</i>-Switched Nd:YLF Laser Operating at 1314 nm
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Lasers emitted in the 1. 3 mu m spectral region have received significant attention owing to increasing applications in remote sensing, timing systems, dermatologic procedures, and nonlinear frequency conversion. It is well known that Nd:YLF is a promising material for generating high-energy 1. 3 mu m pulsed laser because of its extended upper-laser-level lifetime. However, the power scaling of 1. 3 mu m Nd:YLF lasers is challenging because of their small stimulated emission cross-section and low thermal fracture limit. An end-pumped scheme with a broadband 880 nm laser diode (LD) is investigated to overcome these limitations. However, the power stability of the 1314 nm laser is reduced by the thermal wavelength shift and linewidth fluctuation of the broadband LD. When the broadband LD is used as the pump source, it is difficult to simultaneously improve the pump absorption efficiency, enhance the mode-to-pump overlap efficiency, and reduce the thermal stress of the laser crystal. Therefore, the high-power, high-efficiency laser output is greatly restricted. This paper introduces a wavelength-locked narrowband 880 nm LD as the pump source for generating a stable, efficient, and powerful 1314 nm laser.Methods Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. The pump source is a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) locked narrowband fiber-coupled LD with a numerical aperture of 0. 22 mu m and a core diameter of 200 mu m. Its center wavelength is stabilized at 879. 9 nm with a narrow spectral bandwidth of 0. 2 nm. A pair of coupling lenses with 1:5 magnification is used to re-image the pump beam with a spot diameter of approximately 1 mm into the gain medium. An a-cut 1. 0% (atomic fraction) Nd:YLF crystal with a size of 3 mmx3 mmx30 mm is selected as the gain medium, which is coated for high transmission at 880 nm and 1047-1321 nm on the entrance surface and high transmission at 1047-1321 nm and partial reflectivity at 880 nm (reflectivity R approximate to 60%) on the rear surface. Under non-lasing conditions, the pump absorption efficiency exceeds 90%. During the experiments, the gain medium is wrapped with indium foil and closely packed using a water-cooled copper holder at 16 degrees C. The Q-switched device is a 46-mm-long acousto-optic modulator plated with a 1314 nm antireflection coating on both surfaces and driven by a 27. 12-MHz ultrasonic frequency generator operating at a 100 W radio frequency. The linear resonator is composed of a plano-concave mirror M1 with a radius of curvature of 500 mm and a plane output coupler M2. The input mirror M1 is coated for high transmission at 880 nm and 1047-1053 nm and high reflection at 1314-1321 nm, whereas the plane mirror M2 coated for partial reflectivity at 1314 nm (coupling output rate T-OC=5%, 10%) is employed as the output coupler. Considering the thermally induced diffraction loss and energy transfer upconversion (ETU) effect, the optimized mode-to-pump ratio is approximately 0. 84. Consequently, the physical length of the resonator is set to approximately 250 mm based on the ABCD matrix theory.Results and Discussions When T-OC=5%, the maximum continuous-wave output power reaches 20. 4 W under an incident pump power of 70 W, resulting in optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 29. 1% and a slope efficiency of 32. 5% (Fig. 2). Under the full output power, the beam quality factors are M-x(2)=1. 65 and M-y(2)=1. 81 (Fig. 3), and the power stability (root mean square) is 0. 1% within 1 h. In addition, when T-OC=10%,the maximum output power reaches 19 W with an optical-to-optical efficiency of 27. 2% and a slope efficiency of 32% (Fig. 2). After inserting an acousto-optic Q-switcher, when T-OC=5%, the average output power increases from 9. 8 W at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 kHz to 16. 5 W at a PRF of 20 kHz, corresponding to a decrease in pulse energy from 9. 8 mJ to 0. 82 mJ (Fig. 6). The pulse duration increases from 119 ns at 1 kHz to 433 ns at 20 kHz, decreasing the peak power from 82. 3 kW to 1. 8 kW (Fig. 7). Under the full output power, the corresponding power stability (root mean square) within 1 h is 1. 2%.Conclusions A high-power end-pumped Nd:YLF laser operating at 1314 nm is demonstrated using a wavelength-locked narrowband 880 nm laser diode. The optimized mode-to-pump ratio is approximately 0. 84 considering the thermal and ETU effects. The Nd:YLF laser delivers the maximum continuous-wave output power of 20. 4 W with an optical-tooptical conversion efficiency of 29. 1% and a slope efficiency of 32. 5%. After Q-switching with an acousto-optic modulator, the laser system generates the maximum average output power of 16. 5 W at 20 kHz and the maximum pulse energy of 9. 8 mJ at 1 kHz. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate the highest average power and highest pulse energy from Q-switched end-pumped single-crystal 1. 3 mu m Nd:YLF lasers. Future upgrades to achieve higher output power and pulse energy will involve a multisegment-doped or diffusion-bonded Nd:YLF crystal and a double-end pumping scheme.

TI  - PixelScenePixelObject Sample Transferring: A Labor-Free Approach for High-Resolution Plastic Greenhouse Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important agriculture technique, plastic greenhouse (PG) has been widely used to increase crop yield and improve food security status in the world. The high-resolution spatial information of PG is of great significance to precise agricultural management and quantitative environmental assessment. Many studies have examined the role that remote sensing (RS) technology could play in mapping and monitoring PG coverage. However, these methods, which employ either the traditional machine learning algorithms or the deep learning models, depend on massive manually labeled samples. To address this problem, this article proposes a new cross-scale sample transferring method to generate high-resolution samples for automated PG mapping. The proposed method aims to transfer reliable label information from Sentinel-2 images (10 m) to high-resolution images (0.2 m) in a pixel-scene-pixel-object (PSPO) transferring process. In the proposed PG mapping workflow, the low-resolution label information of PG/non-PG can be obtained from an advanced plastic greenhouse index (APGI) which is calculated in Sentinel-2 images, and then, the label information is transferred to the corresponding high-resolution images using the proposed PSPO transferring method. Finally, the transferred high-resolution samples are used to train the deep semantic segmentation model and produce PG mapping results. The whole process is labor-free which requires no manually labeled samples. The experimental results on three collected datasets show that the proposed approach can automatically generate accurate and reliable high-resolution samples, and the final PG mapping results can achieve an overall accuracy (OA) of 89.52%-97.65%; and F1 score of 84.13%-94.03%, which is comparable to the fully supervised semantic segmentation model.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference on Environment Science and Engineering (ICESE)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - To estimate VKT on rural roads, an estimation method based on the fusion of satellite remote sensing images and traffic detection data was presented. The ratio of vehicle densities between different categories of highways was obtained with satellite remote sensing data. The speed of rural highways was estimated using the data from traffic detectors and the design speeds of highways. Taking the traffic volume of high-level highway obtained by the traffic detectors as the benchmark, the average traffic volume and VKT of rural highways were estimated according to the ratio of vehicle density and the ratio of vehicle speed of rural highways to those of high-level highways. We tested the method with data from random sampling areas. The results show that the traffic volume and VKT of rural roads in China are 187 vehicles/day and 8.35 x 108 vehicle:kilometers/day, respectively. The proposed method does not dependent on the image scale, so it is also applicable to unmanned aerial vehicle photography.

TI  - Why are glacial lakes in the eastern Tianshan Mountains expanding at an accelerated rate?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring alpine lakes is important for understanding the regional environmental changes caused by global warming. In this study, we provided a detailed analysis of alpine lake changes in the Tianshan Mountains (TS) and discussed their driving forces based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, WorldView-2, Bing, Google Earth, and ASTER imagery, along with climatic data from 1990 to 2015. The results showed that during the study period, the total number and area of alpine lakes in the eastern TS exhibited an increasing trend, by 64.06% and 47.92%, respectively. Furthermore, the continuous expansion of glacial lakes contributed 95.12% and 94.17% to the total increase in the number and area, respectively, of alpine lakes. Non-glacial lakes exhibited only intermittent expansion. Since the 1990s, the new glacial lakes in the eastern TS have been mainly proglacial and extraglacial lakes. Over the past 25 years, eastern TS has experienced a temperature increase rate of 0.47 & DEG;C/10a, which is higher than that in other TS regions. The rapidly warming climate and glacier recession are the primary causes of the accelerated expansion of glacial lakes in the eastern TS.

TI  - Internal Wave Signature Extraction From SAR and Optical Satellite Imagery Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal waves (IWs) are a common characteristic of oceans and serve a crucial role in transmitting energies between large-scale tides and small-scale mixing. This study developed a deep-learning-based method for extracting IW signatures on multiple satellite imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors in sun-synchronous and geostationary orbits with varying spatial resolution. We collected 1115 satellite images, including 116 Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) advanced SAR (ASAR), 839 MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and 160 Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) images with clear IW signatures in the South China Sea (SCS), Sulu Sea, and Celebes Sea for model training. Considering the distinct IW characteristics under different imaging mechanisms, the specially tailored IW extraction network (IWE-Net) leverages three modifications to improve the accuracy and robustness: online data augmentation, squeeze and excitation blocks, and Matthews correlation coefficient loss. The overall mean precision, recall, and F1-score of the IWE-Net model are 85.75%, 85.67%, and 85.71%, respectively, demonstrating that the model is accurate for IW signature extraction. We also proved the transferability of our method to sea areas worldwide, long-term periods, and Sentinel satellite sensors completely independent of the model training. Globally, the numbers of IW images and extracted pixels show an obvious tidal-related double-peak distribution. Furthermore, we processed 15461 MODIS images in the northeastern SCS to present a holistic IW distribution map over the past 22 years. An unreported IW silent zone caused by drastic topography changes has been discovered, indicating the great potential of deep learning in information retrieval from remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Downscaling Sentinel-3 Chlorophyll-a Concentration for Inland Lakes Based on Multivariate Analysis and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees Regression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration derived from satellite image is crucial for refined applications such as water quality monitoring. However, the precision of downscaling is usually constrained by various environmental factors. In this paper, we develop a downscaling method for Chl-a concentration to improve precision, especially for inland lakes with different surrounding environment. The method downscales the Sentinel-3 Chl-a concentration from 300 m to 30 m, based on the multivariate analysis (MVA) and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model. Firstly, we analyzed 21 Chl-a concentration related indices to identify optimal factors for Chl-a concentration variability. Secondly, a GBDT model is constructed to convey the non-linear relationship between the optimal factors and Chl-a concentration at coarse resolution. Finally, fine-resolution Chl-a concentrations were produced by employing the model to refine cofactors for 12 distinct lakes. The results indicated that the proposed MVA-GBDT method effectively inferred the variability of Chl-a concentration with a mean RMSE of 4.505 mg/m(3), an improvement of 5%-39% over other methods. Furthermore, for lakes with large water quality heterogeneity, the method led to a cross validation RMSE and a difference in accuracy of 5.371 mg/m(3) and 0.866 mg/m(3), respectively. In addition, this study examined the significance of the auxiliary factors and found that the NDCI and WST were the two most important factors for MVA-GBDT to detect Chl-a concentration distributions, particularly for NDCI in lakes with high nutrient contrasts. These findings contribute to the generation of fine-scale Chl-a concentrations in lakes and support related applications.

TI  - Himawari-8 High Temporal Resolution AOD Products Recovery: Nested Bayesian Maximum Entropy Fusion Blending GEO With SSO Satellite Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations derived from new-generation geostationary (GEO) satellites possess unique advantages in analyzing aerosol fast variation processes and thereby providing more accurate assessments of their climate effects and health risks. Unfortunately, the expected advantages and values are dramatically limited by a relatively large proportion of data missing in the GEO AOD products due to cloud obscuration and intrinsic retrieval algorithm. Although several data recovery algorithms have been proposed in recent years to improve the spatial coverage for GEO AOD products, most of them aim at filling up the data blanks rather than reconstructing the temporally continuous variation of aerosol. Accordingly, in this study, a novel framework of nested spatiotemporal fusion blending GEO with the sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite observations based on the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) theorem is developed for GEO Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) AOD recovery with the sufficient excavation of complementary information from GEO and SSO satellite observations, where the minute-stage and hour-stage BME fusion are jointly employed to reconcile temporal inconsistency and data discrepancies between GEO and SSO observations. The results demonstrate that the AOD spatial coverage is dramatically increased by 240.9% (from 20.5%to 70%) with ensured accuracy after Nested-BME fusion. Additionally, two case analyses, during the development and dispersion processes of haze respectively, both demonstrate that the proposed Nested-BME fusion framework could reconstruct the reliable aerosol diurnal variation trends on the basis of recovering missing data for Himawari-8 AHI AOD datasets, while the AHI official level-2 and level-3 AOD products fail to capture these key trends. Furthermore, the developed Nested-BME AOD fusion framework is also applicable for other GEO satellites over other regions, which could substantially enhance the availability and value of high temporal resolution AOD products for better scientific applications.

TI  - A Novel Knowledge-Driven Automated Solution for High-Resolution Cropland Extraction by Cross-Scale Sample Transfer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate cropland mapping is significant for food security and sustainable development. The existing cropland map based on remote sensing mainly focuses on moderate to coarse spatial resolution, and these products are generally unsuitable for precision agriculture due to the lack of spatial details. Therefore, there is an urgent need to produce highresolution (HR) cropland maps to meet current application demands. Recently, the typical classification workflow of HR images employs deep learning models combined with manually annotated samples, and visual interpretation of samples is usually labor-intensive and time-consuming, which is not conducive to large-scale applications. To address this problem, this article proposes an automated HR cropland extraction solution, namely, refinement-reclassification-extraction (RRE), including 1) refinement of 10-m spatial resolution cropland products; 2) reclassifying cropland using the refined product as a sample source; and 3) extracting HR cropland via designed cross-scale sample transfer. The strength of the proposed framework is that it leverages the existing moderate-resolution public products as prior knowledge and provides cross-scale transferable samples for HR images. The whole process does not require manual labeling of samples and is highly automated. Specifically, the experimental results in the three main grain production regions show that the RRE framework effectively reduces the interference of road networks and ridges, and F1 scores of extracted 1-m HR cropland reaches 87.71%-94.16%, which is comparable to the fully supervised (FS) cropland extraction method. In addition, the 10-m reclassified cropland, produced by the intermediate process of the RRE, outperforms current cropland product of Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) Land Cover and European Space Agency (ESA) World Cover.

TI  - Federated Deep Learning With Prototype Matching for Object Extraction From Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become the leading tools for object extraction from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. However, the label scarcity problem of local datasets hinders the prediction performances of DCNNs, and privacy concerns regarding remote sensing data often arise in the traditional deep learning schemes. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel federated learning scheme with prototype matching (FedPM) to collaboratively learn a richer DCNN model by leveraging remote sensing data distributed among multiple clients. This scheme conducts the federated optimization of DCNNs by aggregating clients' knowledge in the gradient space without compromising data privacy. Specifically, the prototype matching method is developed to regularize the local training using prototypical representations while reducing the distribution divergence across heterogeneous image data. Furthermore, the derived deviations across local and global prototypes are applied to quantify the effects of local models on the decision boundary and optimize the global model updating via the attention-weighted aggregation scheme. Finally, the sparse ternary compression (STC) method is used to alleviate communication costs. Extensive experimental results derived from VHR aerial and satellite image datasets verify that the FedPM can dramatically improve the prediction performance of DCNNs on object extraction with lower communication costs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that federated learning has been applied for remote sensing visual tasks.

TI  - Improved Three-Dimensional Inception Networks for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to hyperspectral image classification. Typically, fixed convolution kernel sizes are used in CNNs. This may be complicated by the high-dimensional features and the spatial-spectral features variability of hyperspectral data. In such cases, the fixed kernel size inhibits the ability to deal with different types of datasets flexibly. Therefore, we adopted a parallel architecture, an improved three-dimensional (3D) inception network, for hyperspectral image classification. Additionally, the dimensionality reduction based on interactive information entropy is used in the adaptive band selection of hyperspectral remote sensing data, then the low-redundant bands with more abundant and discriminative information can be selected. Experimental results based on the publicly available hyperspectral datasets demonstrated that the improved 3D inception network can perform well with limited training samples. Moreover, the combinations of different dimensional convolutions in the 3D-2D and 3D-2D-1D inception networks achieved comparable classification results. The experimental results indicate that the proposed networks are generalized classification models with high classification rates.

TI  - CIFNet: context information fusion network for cloud and cloud shadow detection in optical remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and automatically detecting cloud and cloud shadow is one of the key steps in the analysis of optical remote sensing imagery. Currently, most cloud and cloud shadow detection methods are prone to false detection, and some clouds and cloud shadows may be missing from the detection results. Due to the lack of contextual information extraction and fusion capabilities, the accuracy of these cloud detection algorithms cannot be guaranteed. This article proposes a deep learning-based convolutional neural network context information fusion network (named CIFNet) to solve the problem of cloud and cloud shadow detection on Gaofen-1 wide field of view optical remote sensing imageries. First, we preprocess the dataset and make the corresponding labels. Next, we design a Resblock-cloud to capture global and local features and prevent the network from degrading. Then, we utilize a global context fusion module to fuse different levels of global context information by dense skip-connections. Finally, a multiscale context fusion module is designed to extract multiscale contextual relations between cloud and cloud shadow. Experimental results show that the proposed CIFNet method can obtain better cloud and cloud shadow boundaries in complex situations and therefore outperforms the competing methods.

TI  - Coordination Analysis of Temporal and Spatial Variation of Land Surface Temperature and Urban Development in Shihezi Oasis
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important place for human habitation and prosperity development in arid and semi-arid regions, the oasis's unique "cold island effect" characteristics have profound impact on the quality of the environment for human living. Based on Landsat remote sensing images, the cold island index was calculated by inverse calculation for Shihezi City's land surface temperature ( LST) in 2006, 2011, 2017, and 2021 using the radiation transfer equation model, and the spatial autocorrelation of LST was then analyzed. After extracting land use information by adopting random forest classification, based on the Geodetector model, nine types of data, including five remote sensing indicators, NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI, SI, and NDMI, and land use, DEM, slope, and night lighting data, were selected to detect the spatial heterogeneity of LST in Shihezi City. The degree of coordination between town development and LST was finally determined by using the coordination model. The outcomes of the study show that, the construction land increased in all directions with the total area growing from 83.42 km(2) to 164.05 km(2) within 15 years; forest land increased gradually, while cultivated land, grassland, and water areas decreased year by year. The spatial distribution of LST is strongly influenced by land use type. The areas of extremely high temperature, high temperature, and medium temperature zones increased with the expansion of the city. The cold island index of the four periods, was 0.53, 0.47, 0.39, and 0.35, respectively, and the cold island intensity reached the highest decline rate since 2017 and slowed in 2021. The examination of the spatial autocorrelation of LST reveals that LST had a strong positive and significant spatial correlation. The results of factor detection show that the q value of NDBI was the highest, indicating that town development had a strong influence on LST; while the interaction detection results show that the influence of the two-factor interaction on LST was greater than that of the single factor, with the ex. planatory power of DEM boolean AND NDMI and DEM boolean AND NDBI on LST being the highest. Finally, in the early stage of town development, LST changes ahead of town development, but in the late stage of town development, LST and town development were restricted in some extent, and LST changes laged behind the town development.

TI  - Construction of Monitoring Index System for Ancient Sites to Address Flood Disaster Risk
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ancient sites in various locations have been frequently threatened by flood disaster, but there is no unified monitoring strategy; the monitoring methods using sensors, remote sensing, and other methods as well as the related monitoring data obtained are complicated and difficult to manage. Existing monitoring systems do not accurately reflect the relationship between the components of the system and the data. Knowledge graphs have attracted attention as semantic networks that can intuitively reflect the relationship between knowledge entities. In this study, a method of constructing a flood disaster risk knowledge graph for ancient sites was proposed and realized. First, the definition of a risk monitoring index system for ancient sites for flood disaster is proposed. Then, the knowledge graph structure of the monitoring index system is reorganized using semantic reasoning techniques, and the monitoring index bodies are extracted. The proposed method was used to monitor the Pujindu site in China. The results show that the knowledge graph has the advantages of visualization and a clear structure that can intuitively represent the relationship between entities, manage monitoring methods and data such as sensor and remote sensing data, and be effectively applied to the flood disaster risk monitoring of ancient sites.

TI  - Combined Immunotherapy and Targeted Therapies for Cancer Treatment: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives
T2  - CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Review
AB  - The previous year's worldview for cancer treatment has advanced from general to more precise therapeutic approaches. Chemotherapies were first distinguished as the most reliable and brief therapy with promising outcomes in cancer patients. However, patients could also suffer from severe toxicities resulting from chemotherapeutic drug usage. An improved comprehension of cancer pathogenesis has led to new treatment choices, including tumor-targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Subsequently, cancer immunotherapy and targeted therapy give more hope to patients since their combination has tremendous therapeutic efficacy. The immune system responses are also initiated and modulated by targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents, which create the principal basis that when targeted therapies are combined with immunotherapy, the clinical outcomes are of excellent efficacy, as presented in this review. This review focuses on how immunotherapy and targeted therapy are applicable in cancer management and treatment. Also, it depicts promising therapeutic results with more extensive immunotherapy applications with targeted therapy. Further elaborate that immune system responses are also initiated and modulated by targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents, which create the principal basis that this combination therapy with immunotherapy can be of great outcome clinically.

TI  - Real-Time Forecast of SMAP L3 Soil Moisture Using Spatial-Temporal Deep Learning Model with Data Integration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) has significant impacts on the Earth's energy and water cycle system. Remote sensing, such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, has delivered valuable estimations of global surface soil moisture. However, it has a 2 similar to 3 days revisit time leading to gaps between SMAP areas. To achieve accurate and comprehensive real-time forecast of SM, we propose a spatial-temporal deep learning model based on the Convolutional Gated Recursive Units with Data Integration (DI_ConvGRU) to capture the spatial and temporal variation in SM simultaneously by modeling the influence of adjacent SM values in space and time. Experiments show that the DI_ConvGRU outperforms the ConvGRU with Linear Interpolation (interp_ConvGRU) and the Long Short-Term Memory with Data Integration (DI_LSTM). The best performance (Bias = 0.0132 m(3)/m(3), ubRMSE = 0.022 m(3)/m(3), R = 0.977) has been achieved through the use of spatial-temporal deep learning model and Data Integration term. In comparison with interp_ConvGRU and DI_LSTM, DI_ConvGRU has improved the model performance in 74.88% and 68.99% of the regions according to RMSE, respectively. The predictability of SM depends highly on SM memory characteristics. DI_ConvGRU can provide accurate spatial-temporal forecast for SM with missing data, making them potentially useful for applications such as filling observational gaps in satellite data.

TI  - Toward Multi-Stage Phenotyping of Soybean with Multimodal UAV Sensor Data: A Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for Leaf Area Index Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important parameter which can be used for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. Many studies have been carried out to estimate LAI with remote sensing data obtained by sensors mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in major crops; however, most of the studies used only a single type of sensor, and the comparative study of different sensors and sensor combinations in the model construction of LAI was rarely reported, especially in soybean. In this study, three types of sensors, i.e., hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR, were used to collect remote sensing data at three growth stages in soybean. Six typical machine learning algorithms, including Unary Linear Regression (ULR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation (BP), were used to construct prediction models of LAI. The results indicated that the hyperspectral and LiDAR data did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy of LAI. Comparison of different sensors and sensor combinations showed that the fusion of the hyperspectral and multispectral data could significantly improve the predictive ability of the models, and among all the prediction models constructed by different algorithms, the prediction model built by XGBoost based on multimodal data showed the best performance. Comparison of the models for different growth stages showed that the XGBoost-LAI model for the flowering stage and the universal models of the XGBoost-LAI and RF-LAI for three growth stages showed the best performances. The results of this study might provide some ideas for the accurate estimation of LAI, and also provide novel insights toward high-throughput phenotyping of soybean with multi-modal remote sensing data.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Retrieval by Deep Attention Hashing With Distance-Adaptive Ranking
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the joint advancement of numerous related fields of remote sensing, the amount of remote sensing data is growing exponentially. As an essential remote sensing Big Data management technique, content-based remote sensing image retrieval has attracted more and more attention. A novel deep attention hashing with distance-adaptive ranking (DAH) is proposed for remote sensing image retrieval in this article. First, a channel-spatial joint attention mechanism is employed for feature extraction of remote sensing images to make the proposed DAH method focus more on the critical details of the remote sensing images and suppress irrelevant regional responses. Second, a novel balanced pairwise weighted loss function is proposed to enable discrete hash codes to participate in neural network training, which contains pairwise weighted similarity loss, classification loss, and quantization loss. The pairwise weighted similarity loss is designed to decrease the impact of the imbalance of positive and negative sample pairs. The classification loss and quantization loss are added to the loss function to decrease background interference and information loss during the quantization phase, respectively. Finally, a distance-adaptive ranking strategy with category-weighted Hamming distance is presented in the retrieval phase to utilize the category probability information fully. Experiments on benchmark datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DAH method.

TI  - A Back Propagation Neural Network-Based Radiometric Correction Method (BPNNRCM) for UAV Multispectral Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric correction is one of the most important preprocessing parts of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing data analysis and application. In this article, a back propagation (BP) neural network-based radiometric correction method (BPNNRCM) considering optimal parameters was proposed. First, we used different UAV multispectral sensors (K6 equipped on the DJI M600, D-MSPC2000 equipped on the FEIMA D2000) to collect training, validation, testing and cross-validation data. Second, the radiometric correction results of BP neural network with different input variables and hidden layer node number were compared to select the best combination of input parameters and hidden layer node number. Finally, the radiometric correction accuracy and robustness of BP neural network considering the optimal parameters were verified. When the number of nodes in the input layer was five (digital number, UAV sensor height, wavelength, solar altitude angle, and temperature) and the number of nodes in the hidden layer was eight, the BP neural network had the best comprehensive performance in training time of train set and accuracy of validation/test set. In the aspect of accuracy and robustness, the absolute errors of test and cross-validation images' surface reflectance obtained by the BPNNRCM were all less than 0.054. The BPNNRCM had smaller average absolute error (0.0141), mean squared error (0.0003), mean absolute error (0.0141) and mean relative error (7.1%) comparing with empirical line method and radiative transfer model. In general, the research results of this article prove the feasibility and prospect of BPNNRCM for radiometric correction of UAV multispectral images.

TI  - Cirrus Band-to-Band Registration of Landsat-8 OLI for Thin Cirrus Removal
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the troposphere or stratosphere, high-altitude cirrus clouds often distort remote-sensing images (RSIs). Despite the existence of various methods to eliminate these clouds using the cirrus detection band of the Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI), there may still be residual traces due to the parallax inherent in the OLI focal plane's design. To address this issue, we propose a technique called cirrus band-to-band registration (CB2BR) and provide evidence that these residual traces are a result of cirrus displacements between the visible bands (Bands 1-4) and Band 9. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed CB2BR, we conducted experiments using three Landsat-8 scenes. The results demonstrate that the CB2BR technique can eliminate artifacts in various algorithms, especially for aircraft-induced line-shaped contrail cirrus. Theoretically, the study investigates the relationship between satellite system parameters, cirrus altitude, and cirrus displacement. The value of the CB2BR technique in subsequent tasks like ship detection is illustrated.

TI  - Multimodal Transformer Network for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover classification of single-modal remote sensing (RS) data has recently reached a bottleneck. The joint use of multimodal RS data to improve the classification performances has received much attention. Convolutional neural networks are powerful tools in feature extraction and contextual modeling. While they have attendant drawbacks to capture the sequence attributes of spectral signatures and struggle to acquire discriminative spectral-spatial features from a global perspective due to limitations inherent in their network backbones. The transformer backbone is a promising approach for addressing these challenges and generating novel insights in the multimodal RS image classification. In this article, we present a new model called multimodal transformer network (MTNet) that leverages transformer advantages to capture both the specific and shared characteristics of hyperspectral (HS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. HS images contain a wide range of bands with rich spectral information and LiDAR data provide accurate elevation information without affecting by environmental factors. The well-designed module HS spectral transformer can learn spectrally local sequence information from neighboring bands of HS images, yielding groupwise spectral embeddings comprising rich diagnostic information about land covers. Furthermore, the HS and LiDAR spatial transformers aim to mine the pixelwise feature embedding relationships in a global manner, capturing spatial and elevation information of HS and LiDAR, respectively. Finally, the feature embedding tokens of two modalities are integrated jointly and a new transformer encoder is redesigned to explore the shared spatial characteristics between the two modalities. We evaluate the classification performances of the proposed MTNet on three public HS-LiDAR datasets by conducting extensive experiments, exhibiting superiority over conventional classifiers and state-of-the-art networks.

TI  - Multiinformation Fusion Network for Mapping Gapless All-Sky Land Surface Temperature Using Thermal Infrared and Reanalysis Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Toward fully exploring multidisciplinary research topics under global warming, the spatiotemporal discontinuities of land surface temperature (LST) products due to cloud contamination still challenge such research topics. Data fusion (DF) that seeks the best compromise between multiple data sources plays a key role in providing gapless LST data. However, most models only use information about the variation of LST at different times or the difference between different LST products without effectively combining the two pieces of information. With the rapid development of deep-learning methods, powerful modeling capabilities can solve this problem. This article proposes a novel multiinformation fusion network (MIFN) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms (AMs) to map gapless all-sky LST, taking temporal-changing (TC) and data-differentiated (DD) information into consideration. Temporal normalization (TN) is used as a preprocessing step to match the time of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Fifth-Generation (ERA5) LSTs. The MIFN extracts multiscale multitemporal TC and DD features by network constraints. Then, the weights of the target LST features reconstructed by TC and DD features are assigned through an AM to fuse them reasonably. Finally, we design a loss function that combines TC, DD, and LST reconstruction to improve the accuracy of LST prediction further. We performed comprehensive data experiments to validate the performance of the new method. Our technique is more advantageous in generating MODIS-like LSTs than four state-of-the-art methods and two CNN models using a single piece of information.

TI  - Applicability Analysis of GF-2PMS and PLANETSCOPE Data for Ground Object Recognition in Karst Region
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image with high spatial and temporal resolution is very important for rational planning and scientific management of land resources. However, due to the influence of satellite resolution, revisit period, and cloud pollution, it is difficult to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution images. In order to effectively solve the "space-time contradiction" problem in remote sensing application, based on GF-2PMS (GF-2) and PlanetSope (PS) data, this paper compares and analyzes the applicability of FSDAF (flexible spatiotemporal data fusion), STDFA (the spatial temporal data fusion approach), and Fit_FC (regression model fitting, spatial filtering, and residual compensation) in different terrain conditions in karst area. The results show the following. (1) For the boundary area of water and land, the FSDAF model has the best fusion effect in land boundary recognition, and provides rich ground object information. The Fit_FC model is less effective, and the image is blurry. (2) For areas such as mountains, with large changes in vegetation coverage, the spatial resolution of the images fused by the three models is significantly improved. Among them, the STDFA model has the clearest and richest spatial structure information. The fused image of the Fit_FC model has the highest similarity with the verification image, which can better restore the coverage changes of crops and other vegetation, but the actual spatial resolution of the fused image is relatively poor, the image quality is fuzzy, and the land boundary area cannot be clearly identified. (3) For areas with dense buildings, such as cities, the fusion image of the FSDAF and STDFA models is clearer and the Fit_FC model can better reflect the changes in land use. In summary, compared with the Fit_FC model, the FSDAF model and the STDFA model have higher image prediction accuracy, especially in the recognition of building contours and other surface features, but they are not suitable for the dynamic monitoring of vegetation such as crops. At the same time, the image resolution of the Fit_FC model after fusion is slightly lower than that of the other two models. In particular, in the water-land boundary area, the fusion accuracy is poor, but the model of Fit_FC has unique advantages in vegetation dynamic monitoring. In this paper, three spatiotemporal fusion models are used to fuse GF-2 and PS images, which improves the recognition accuracy of surface objects and provides a new idea for fine classification of land use in karst areas.

TI  - Enhanced Feature Extraction From Assimilated VTCI and LAI With a Particle Filter for Wheat Yield Estimation Using Cross-Wavelet Transform
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To further reveal the relationships between different variables and yield at each growth stage of winter wheat, an approach for estimating regional yields of winter wheat at multiple time scales was developed by assimilating the CERES-Wheat model simulations and remotely sensed observations. Specifically, the particle filter assimilation algorithm was chosen to assimilate the simulated soil moisture at the depth of 0-20 cm and leaf area index (LAI) and MODIS retrieved vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and LAI. The resonance periods of time series assimilated VTCIs and LAIs at different growth stages of winter wheat with crop yield were analyzed separately using the cross-wavelet transform to determine the variation relationships between the assimilated variables and yield at multiple time scales, and the calculated weights of assimilated VTCI and LAI at each growth stage of winter wheat were used to establish a yield estimation model. Both assimilated VTCI and LAI could comprehensively integrate the effects of the CERES-Wheat model simulations and remotely sensing observations, and cross-wavelet transformed time series VTCIs and LAIs at each growth stage had specific resonance periods with the time series yields, regardless of whether they were assimilated or not. Compared with the unassimilated variables, assimilated VTCI and LAI were given greater weights at the key growth stages, namely VTCI at the jointing and heading-filling stages and LAI at the heading-filling and milk maturity stages, enhancing feature extraction and the accuracy of yield estimation was improved.

TI  - Research on Rice Area Extraction Based on Sentinel SAR Data and Multi-spectral Data
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of rice distribution and area can provide scientific decision-making basis for rice yield estimation, agricultural water resource consumption and evaluation. Till now, there are few researches on rice recognition in single-cropping rice region of North China, so it has great value to find a recognition method suitable for northern rice growing areas. With Tianjin as the research area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 as the data sources, rice was extracted from the study area based on the temporal variation characteristics of rice backscattering coefficient and spectral characteristics of rice at different growth stages, and the extraction accuracy of both methods was compared. The results show that:(1) The combination of Sentinel-1 images at transplanting, jointing and heading stages can be used to identify rice, and the accuracy of rice producers and users are both above 90%; (2) At the transplanting and maturing stages of rice, the combination of Sentinel-2 near infrared, short wave infrared and visible red light bands could easyly identify rice, and the accuracy of identifying rice producers and users was above 96%. The combination effect of B12+ B8+B4 band was the best at the maturing stage; (3) Based on the combination of Sentinel- 2 B12+ B8+ B4 band at rice maturity stage, rice extraction using support vector machine method ( SVM) is a suitable method for single-cropping rice recognition in North China. Using this method, the rice planting area in 2016, 2018 and 2021 was about 399.04, 586.67 and 764.55 km2, respectively, with an increase of 365.51 km(2) in five years, which was consistent with the actual situation of Tianjin. This method is simple and feasible in technique and can provide reference for improving the efficiency and accuracy of rice monitoring in northern China's rice growing areas.

TI  - Improved Estimation of Leaf Area Index by Reducing Leaf Chlorophyll Content and Saturation Effects Based on Red-Edge Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator for monitoring vegetation growth and estimating crop yields. The empirical-based model using vegetation indices (VIs) is an effective method for LAI estimation at the regional scale. However, due to the complexity of canopy radiation interaction processes, the leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and saturation effects on canopy reflectance restrict the accuracy of VI-based LAI retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose a novel chlorophyll-insensitive VI (CIVI) using red, red-edge, and near infrared (NIR) bands to improve regional LAI mapping. The CIVI was developed based on the sensitivity analysis of red-edge band reflectance to LAI and C-ab using the simulation dataset from the PROSAIL model. Then, the performance of CIVI was carefully evaluated from two aspects: the sensitivity of VI to LAI and other parameters and the accuracy of LAI estimates using different VIs over homogeneous (cropland and grassland) and nonhomogeneous (forest) biome canopies. The results suggested that CIVI can capture LAI variations well while remaining insensitive to C-ab variations. Additionally, the sensitivity of CIVI to other vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters did not increase significantly compared to that of other VIs. Furthermore, CIVI exhibited the best performance of LAI retrievals over both homogeneous (R-2 = 0.938, RMSE = 0.447, and rRMSE = 21.3%) and nonhomogenous (R-2 = 0.635, RMSE = 0.693, and rRMSE = 14.0%) canopies among all selected VIs, especially for the high LAI. Our results indicated that the developed CIVI incorporating red-edge bands with a suitable formula can effectively reduce the C-ab and saturation effects, which is promising for improving VI-based LAI estimation.

TI  - Baseline-Based Soil Salinity Index (BSSI): A Novel Remote Sensing Monitoring Method of Soil Salinization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization leads to dehydration of plants, which seriously threatens ecologically sustainable development and food security guarantee. In the complex and diverse coastal wetland environment, the impervious surface and bare soil have similar spectral features with salinized soil, which make it difficult for traditional satellite data and algorithms to accurately and timely monitor the small surface features of salinization. This article presents a baseline-based soil salinity index (BSSI) for soil salinization monitoring using medium-resolution data. In BSSI, we construct a virtual salinization baseline by connecting the near-infrared (NIR) band and the short-wave infrared-2 (SWIR2) band to enhance the spectral feature of salinized soils which border on the impervious surface. In addition, we calculate the distance between the short-wave infrared-1 (SWIR1) band and the virtual salinization baseline as the BSSI, which can effectively improve the stability of salinity inversion for different soils. Through data comparison and model simulations, BSSI has shown advantages over a series of the traditional salinization spectral indices (SSIs). The results show that the saline soil extraction accuracy of BSSI exceeds 85% and the correlation coefficient of the BSSI and the degree of soil salinization exceeds 0.90. Since the related spectral bands, such as NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2, are available on many existing satellite sensors such as Landsat TM/ETM+, OLI, and sentinel 2, the BSSI concept can be extended to establish long-term records for soil salinization monitoring.

TI  - Reconstruction of Annual Glacier Mass Balance from Remote Sensing-Derived Average Glacier-Wide Albedo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual mass balance is an important reflection of glacier status that is also very sensitive to climate fluctuations. However, there is no effective and universal albedo-based method for the reconstruction of annual mass balance due to the scarcity of field observations. Here, we present an improved albedo-mass balance (IAMB) method to estimate annual glacier surface mass balance series using remote sensing techniques. The averaged glacier-wide albedo derived with the MODImLab algorithm during the summer season provides an effective proxy of the annual mass change. Defined as the variation in the albedo as a function of elevation change, the altitude-albedo gradient ( partial differential z/ partial differential alpha) can be obtained from a glacier digital elevation model (DEM) and optical images. The Chhota Shigri glacier situated in the western Himalayas was selected to test and assess the accuracy of this method over the period from 2003 to 2014. Reconstructed annual mass budgets correlated well with those from the observed records, with an average difference and root mean square error (RMSE) of -0.75 mm w.e. a(-1) and 274.91 mm w.e. a(-1), respectively, indicating that the IAMB method holds promise for glacier mass change monitoring. This study provides a new technique for annual mass balance estimation that can be applied to glaciers with no or few mass balance observations.

TI  - Analysis of the Effect of Enhanced FOV and Sampling Strategy on the Spatial Resolution Enhancement of Spaceborne Microwave Radiometer
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher spatial resolution can improve the application ability of spaceborne microwave radiometer data. To investigate the capability to enhance the spatial resolution of the radiometer measurements, we analyzed the effect of enhanced field of view (FOV) and sampling strategy on improving spatial resolution using the Backus-Gilbert (BG) method, with the scanning parameters of FengYun-3D Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) as an example. The results suggest that selecting an appropriate enhanced FOV and increasing the sampling overlap rate can yield better spatial resolution and effectively reduce the brightness temperature (BT) error that arises from resolution enhancement. As an example, the MWRI 18.7 GHz channel with a spatial resolution of 30 x 50 km is taken. When the spatial resolution of the enhanced FOV is set to 25 x 35 km, compared with other options, the average BT error caused by resolution enhancement is reduced to 0.38 K, and the spatial resolution is improved to 27.3 x 40.5 km. In addition, when the sampling overlap rate of cross-track and along-track directions is set to 91.4% x 92.4%, the highest in the experimental conditions, compared with the original sampling setting, the average BT error caused by resolution enhancement is reduced from 0.72 to 0.4 K, and the spatial resolution is improved to 22.8 x 35.7 km. These experimental findings may provide insights into designing future radiometers and applying the BG method.

TI  - Impact of Carbon Sequestration by Terrestrial Vegetation on Economic Growth: Evidence from Chinese County Satellite Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land vegetation plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, the impact of carbon sequestration of terrestrial vegetation on economic growth has not yet been reported in the literature, especially in the context of China's current high-quality economic development strategy, and clarifying carbon sequestration on high-quality economic development has an important research-support role in achieving the goal of "carbon peak" and "carbon neutral". Therefore, based on the panel data from 2735 countries and cities in China from 2000 to 2017, this statistical analysis adopts a dual-fixed-effect model to identify the heterogeneous impacts of land-based vegetation carbon sequestration on high-quality urban economic development. The results show that carbon sequestration by terrestrial vegetation has a significant positive impact on economic growth in northeast, central, south, and southwest China but not in north, east, or northwest China, and after a series of stability tests, the effect still holds. Terrestrial vegetation carbon sequestration affects economic growth mainly through upgrades of industrial structures, resource allocation effect, and vegetation coverage. This statistical model further clarifies the empirical evidence provided by vegetation carbon sequestration for high-quality economic development and the economic effects on afforestation and ecological conservation.

TI  - Classification Matters More: Global Instance Contrast for Fine-Grained SAR Aircraft Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since significant intraclass differences and inconspicuous interclass variations, fine-grained aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is challenging. Also, the inherent lack of detailed features and severe noise interference in SAR images make it difficult to learn class-specific feature representations. Current detection approaches focus more on localization accuracy and ignore classification performance, which is more critical in fine-grained detection. To address the above challenges, we present GICNet: global instance contrast (GIC) for fine-grained SAR aircraft detection a global instance-level contrast module is proposed to improve interclass divergences and intraclass compactness. With a specially constructed global instance set, GICNet can contrast a large number of different aircraft targets while keeping a small batch size. Furthermore, we design a novel quality-aware focal loss (QAFL) to facilitate the accurate classification of well-localized aircraft targets. Meanwhile, to maintain localization performance, we develop a new edge-aware bounding-box refinement (EABR) module to refine predicted coarse bounding boxes. Experimental results show that our GICNet outperforms current advanced detectors and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the GaoFen-3 SAR aircraft detection dataset. In particular, GICNet also has advantages in reducing misclassification and recognizing well-located targets.

TI  - An Efficient Polarimetric Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Algorithm for Dual-Pol Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With time-series PolSAR images, polarimetric persistent scatterer interferometry (PolPSI) algorithms can obtain optimized interferograms with overall better phase quality than any single-pol channel for ground deformation monitoring. Moreover, the open access of Sentinel-1 PolSAR data makes it possible for applications of PolPSI over large regions worldwide. However, the optimum scattering mechanism usually has to be searched in a high dimension solution space by PolPSI techniques from each pixel. This is with very high or even unacceptable computational costs if satisfactory results are expected. To this end, an efficient and effective PolPSI algorithm named as TP-ESM is proposed with Sentinel-1 data in this study, which optimizes pixels' interferograms by a weighted sum of their corresponding VV and VH channel interferograms. The effectiveness of TP-ESM is tested together with two other PolPSI techniques [i.e., TP-MSM and exhaustive search polarimetric optimization (ESPO)] over Beijing with 46 Sentinel-1 PolSAR images. The results show that TP-ESM can obtain similar optimized interferometric phases with ESPO over high quality pixels, and the ground deformation monitoring pixel density improvement achieved by TP-ESM and ESPO w.r.t. conventional PSI approach (with VV data) is 35% and 43%, respectively. On the other hand, the TP-MSM approach is found not applicable to Sentinel-1 data. Considering the negligible computational cost of TP-ESM w.r.t. ESPO, it presents a quite good performance on both interferograms' optimizations and ground deformation monitoring. Moreover, the proposed TP-ESM outperforms ESPO on distributed scatterers pxiels' optimization, and it is anticipated to have promising performances on other PolSAR images acquired by other sensors.

TI  - Joint Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using a Hierarchical CNN and Transformer
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The joint use of multisource remote-sensing (RS) data for Earth observation missions has drawn much attention. Although the fusion of several data sources can improve the accuracy of land-cover identification, many technical obstacles, such as disparate data structures, irrelevant physical characteristics, and a lack of training data, exist. In this article, a novel dual-branch method, consisting of a hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN) and a transformer network, is proposed for fusing multisource heterogeneous information and improving joint classification performance. First, by combining the CNN with a transformer, the proposed dual-branch network can significantly capture and learn spectral-spatial features from hyperspectral image (HSI) data and elevation features from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Then, to fuse these two sets of data features, a cross-token attention (CTA) fusion encoder is designed in a specialty. The well-designed deep hierarchical architecture takes full advantage of the powerful spatial context information extraction ability of the CNN and the strong long-range dependency modeling ability of the transformer network based on the self-attention (SA) mechanism. Four standard datasets are used in experiments to verify the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental results reveal that the proposed framework can perform noticeably better than state-of-the-art methods. The source code of the proposed method will be available publicly at https://github.com/zgr6010/Fusion_HCT.git.

TI  - An Optimization Method for Satellite Data Structure Design Based on Improved Ant Colony Algorithm
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The telemetry data structure is the embodiment of satellite telemetry format, the rationality and correctness of which determine the satellite telemetry capacity as well as transmission capability. Conventional satellite telemetry data structure designs excessively depend on manual experience, easily leading to problems such as waste of satellite resources, low telemetry transmission efficiency and unintuitive ground decoding. In this paper, a novel method was proposed to optimize the design of satellite telemetry data structure, based on rasterized modeling to visualize the design constraints, and an improved ant colony algorithm with grey relational analysis to optimize the telemetry data structure. The method is not only effective in preventing the deficiencies of conventional approaches, but also beneficial to the rational allocation of telemetry resources. The feasibility was verified by the telemetry data of a satellite with DFH-4 platform, and the results showed favorable convergence, along with valid improvement of the design process efficiency and application effect.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Sea Ice Classification With Sentinel-1 and AMSR-2 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the era of big data, how to utilize synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and passive microwave radiometer data for better sea ice monitoring by deep-learning technology has recently attracted wide attention. In this article, we first propose a universal and lightweight multiscale cascade network (MCNet) for Sentinel-1 SAR-based sea ice classification. In comparison with the previous local inference methods that split SAR images to small patches, our proposed global inference method MCNet is able to segment whole SAR images directly. Then, taking MCNet as a basis, we investigate four different fusion methods for Sentinel-1 SAR and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-2 data. These are the early fusion, deep fusion, late fusion, and the hybrid method, which fuse data at the input level, feature level, decision level, as well as both feature and decision levels, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that MCNet performs better than the commonly used U-Net in terms of accuracy, memory usage, inference speed, and in capturing small-scale local details. As for data fusion, compared with MCNet, significant improvements have been achieved for all data fusion methods, except the early fusion method. Both deep fusion and late fusion methods have their own advantages in classifying certain sea ice types. By combining them together, the proposed hybrid method achieves optimal performance. Finally, with regard to the class imbalance problem, we recommend the application of self-supervised learning to mine the value of massively unlabeled SAR images.

AB  - The essence of post-disaster reconstruction is the restoration and rebirth of the affected areas. The earthquake hitting Jiuzhaigou was the first earthquake that had its epicenter in the World Natural Heritage located in China. Ecological restoration and landscape reconstruction are essential for the sustainable development of tourism. This study uses high-resolution remote sensing images to monitor and evaluate the post-disaster restoration and reconstruction process of the leading lakes in Jiuzhaigou. It was found that the lake water quality, vegetation, and road facilities have undergone moderate reconstruction. However, the restoration and reconstruction still faced severe challenges. The ecological environment's stability and balance are prerequisites for the sustainable development of the World Natural Heritage sites. This paper combines the "Build Back Better" concept that advocates risk reduction, scenic spot restoration, and efficient implementation to ensure Jiuzhaigou's restoration and sustainable development. It comes up with specific measures for the resilience development of Jiuzhaigou from the eight principles of overall planning, structural resilience, disaster prevention and mitigation, landscape facilities, social psychology, management mechanisms, policies and regulations, and monitoring and evaluation to provide a reference for the sustainable development of tourism.

TI  - CNN, RNN, or ViT? An Evaluation of Different Deep Learning Architectures for Spatio-Temporal Representation of Sentinel Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rich information in multitemporal satellite images can facilitate pixel-level land cover classification. However, what is the most suitable deep learning architecture for high-dimension spatio-temporal representation of remote sensing time series remains unclear. In this study, we theoretically analyzed the different mechanisms of the different deep learning structures, including the commonly used convolutional neural network (CNN), the high-dimension CNN [three-dimensional (3-D) CNN], the recurrent neural network, and the newest vision transformer (ViT), with regard to learning and representing the temporal information for spatio-temporal data. The performance of the different models was comprehensively evaluated on large-scale Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series images covering the whole of Slovenia. First, the 3-D CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and ViT, which all have specific structures that preserve temporal information, can effectively extract the spatio-temporal information, with the 3-D CNN and ViT showing the best performance. Second, the performance of the 2-D CNN, in which the temporal information is collapsed, is lower than that of the 3-D CNN, LSTM, and ViT but outperforms the conventional methods. Thirdly,using both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images performs almost the same as using only optical images, indicating that the information that can be extracted from optical images is sufficient for land-cover classification. However, when optical images are unavailable, SAR imagescan provide satisfactorily classification results. Finally, the modern deep learning methods can effectively overcome the disadvantages in imaging conditions where parts of an image or images of some periods are missing. The testing data are available at gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of GF-1 and GF-6 WFV Images in Suspended Matter Concentration Inversion in Dianchi Lake
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is one of the important parameters of water environment assessment and an important index of remote sensing water retrieval. GF-1/WFV and GF-6/WFV are free and open satellite data of the gaofen series, which are widely used in remote sensing monitoring. However, there are few studies on the applicability of the new bands of GF-6/ WFV in water quality parameter inversion. This study takes Dianchi Lake in Yunnan province as the research area, based on the testing data synchronization with water transit (or similar) of the phase of GF-1/WFV and GF-6/WFV remote sensing image using statistics analysis method to the same band (blue, green, red and near-infrared) consistency analysis, regression method based on using the experience of the TSM inversion models of the two kinds of data, respectively, The model with GF-6/WFV added bands were compared with the model constructed by GF-1/WFV. The optimal model was applied to six GF-6/WFV images in 2020 to obtain the TSM distribution map of Dianchi Lake. The results show that the correlation coefficients of GF-1/ WFV and GF-6/WFV in blue, green, red and near infrared bands are 0. 98, 0. 98, 0. 97 and 0. 99, respectively. The apparent reflectance of the two kinds of data is highly consistent. The inversion accuracy of GF-1/WFV difference model "B2+B4-B1" based on blue, green and near-infrared red bands is high, and the root means square error of model inversion is 6. 35 mg center dot L (1) and the average absolute percentage error is 23. 60%. The ratio model "1/B5+B6" constructed by GF-6/WFV based on nearinfrared, red-edge 1 and red-edge 2 bands has a high inversion accuracy. Model inversion's root mean square error (RMSE) is 3. 07 mg center dot L (1) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 20. 65%. By comparing the difference model "B1 B4" constructed by GF-1/WFV with "B5B4" constructed by GF-6/WFV, it is found that the root means square error of the latter is reduced by 2. 61 mg center dot L (1), and the average absolute percentage is reduced by 32. 33%. The experiment shows that the inversion effect of the model with the red-edge band is better than other models. The TSM distribution map of Dianchi Lake in 2020 was obtained using the modeling formula. The TSM in Dianchi Lake varied from 4 to 45 mg center dot L (1), with an average value of 18. 23 mg center dot L (1). The overall spatial distribution showed a trend of heavy distribution in the north and light distribution in the south, and the time distribution of TSM in Dianchi Lake showed an upward and downward trend. This study can not only provide a reference for the sensor band setting of lake water quality monitoring but also provide technical support for water quality remote sensing monitoring by the water resources supervision department of Dianchi Lake.

TI  - A Spatial Downscaling Method for Deriving High-Resolution Downward Shortwave Radiation Data Under All-Sky Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is an essential parameter in land surface energy budget. However, current DSR products are mainly generated at coarse-resolution scales (more than 5 km) and fail to accurately depict DSR distribution over different topographic and land cover conditions. Meanwhile, the existence of frequent cloud cover constrains the highresolution DSR estimation. To overcome the above issues, a novel spatial downscaling method for high-resolution DSR estimation was proposed in this study by incorporating coarse-resolution Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) DSR product and Landsat-8 observations. Through decomposing the downscaling scheme into three separate models: fully cloudy, partial cloudy, and cloudfree, the 3-km MSG DSR data were spatially downscaled to 30-m scale under all-sky conditions, based on the assumption of scaleinvariant of the models established at 3-km scale. An empirical model for DSR estimation under cloud cover condition was constructed between the top of atmosphere radiance from Landsat-8 and MSG DSR. The downscaled results showed reasonable DSR values under different cloud cover conditions, and the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled DSR was also well depicted with the variation of surface topography. Meanwhile, the validation with in situ measurements also revealed the significant improvement in terms of the coefficient of determination ( R-2) (from 0.53 to 0.79) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) (from 198.5 to 140.41 W/m(2)). In general, the proposed downscaling method in this study shows good potential for high-resolution DSR estimation without regard to the atmospheric information required in traditional DSR estimation under all-sky condition.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking Binhu New Area (BNA) as a case study, based on multi-period (2005, 2012, 2020) Landsat remote sensing images, the landscape pattern index and grey relational analysis (GRA) were chosen to quantitatively examine the dynamic change process and driving mechanism of green space landscape patterns. The results showed: (1) From 2005 to 2020, the green space area in BNA showed increases at first and decreases later with the highest degree of dynamic change found in regional green space. (2) Urban green space showed increased diversity and good connectivity, but its green patch was simple with a decreased degree of sprawl. The green patch also showed a tendency towards homogenization, aggregation, and simplification. The patch shapes of park green space, attached green space, and protective green space are relatively simple and there are blind spots in the distribution. (3) Population growth and industrial structure changes are the main driving forces of the changes in green space landscape patterns in BNA. Besides, urban planning and policies also play a big part in these changes. The research results can provide a reference for green space planning and construction in BNA.

TI  - Retrieval of Rain Rates for Tropical Cyclones From Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for retrieving the rain rate fromC-band (similar to 5.3 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images during tropical cyclones (TCs). Seven dualpolarized (vertical-vertical [VV] and vertical-horizontal [VH]) Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR images were acquired in the interferometricwide (IW) swath mode during the Satellite Hurricane Observation Campaign. These images were collocated with rain rates measured by the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometers onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aircraft. Wind speeds were retrieved from theVH-polarized SAR images using the geophysical model function (GMF) S1IW.NR. We determined the difference between the measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS) based on VV-polarized SAR and the predicted NRCS derived using the GMF CMOD5.N forced with wind speeds retrieved from VH-polarized SAR images. Rain cells were identified as regions in the images where the NRCS difference was greater than 0.5 dB or smaller than -0.5 dB. We found that the difference in the NRCS decreased and theVH-polarized wind speed increased with increasing rain rate. Based on these findings, we developed an empirical function for S-1 SAR rain retrieval in a TC, naming it CRAIN_S1. The validation of the CRAIN_S1 results with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data resulted in a root mean square error of 0.58 mm/h and a correlation of 0.89. This study provides an alternate method for rain monitoring utilizing SAR data with a fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Water Chlorophyll a Estimation Using UAV-Based Multispectral Data and Machine Learning
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentration is an important parameter for evaluating the degree of water eutrophication. Monitoring it accurately through remote sensing is thus of great significance for early warnings of water eutrophication, and the inversion of water quality from UAV images has attracted more and more attention. In this study, a regression method to estimate chl-a was proposed; it used a small multispectral UAV to collect data and took the vegetation indices as intermediate variables. For this purpose, ten monitoring points were selected in Erhai Lake, China, and two months of monitoring and data collection were conducted during a cyanobacterial bloom period. Finally, 155 sets of valid data were obtained. The imaging data were obtained using a multispectral UAV, water samples were collected from the lake, and the chl-a concentration was obtained in the laboratory. Then, the images were preprocessed to extract the information from different wavebands. The univariate regression of each vegetation index and the regression using band information were used for comparative analysis. Four machine learning algorithms were used to build the model: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme learning machine (ELM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that the effect of estimating the chl-a concentration via multiple regression using vegetation indices was generally better than that via regression with a single vegetation index and original band information. The CNN model obtained the best results (R-2 = 0.7917, RMSE = 8.7660, and MRE = 0.2461). This study showed the reliability of using multiple regression based on vegetation indices to estimate the chl-a of surface water.

TI  - Detecting Spatiotemporal Differences in Cropland Abandonment and Reforestation Across the Three-North Region of China Based on Landsat Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-North region of China is an important ecological protection area. While the depopulation of rural areas and policy intervention has allowed cropland abandonment and reforestation (CAR), the spatial distribution and temporal differences underlying this landscape pattern have not been analyzed. CAR results in the gradual disappearance of the soil signal representing tilled or harvested crops, followed by a gradual increase in the interannual vegetation signal. This long-term gradual greening can be exploited to map the spatiotemporal distribution of CAR. In this study, Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) was applied to the 1990-2020 Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. The data were combined with a differential analysis of the phenological characteristics of the surveyed area to detect land-surface greening trends. The relationship with actual information on CAR was then determined. The results showed widespread long-term greening in the Three-North region, covering up to 80% of the region) during the annual growth (May-June) and harvest (September-October) periods. Together, these two periods indicated 7.5% of overall greening. The highest greening intensity was in areas where cropland had undergone conversion to forest, which strongly suggested CAR as the succession type. The average accuracy of CAR mapping was similar to 80% (a mapping accuracy of a greening intensity >0.4 was as high as 87%). This study demonstrates the utility of our method in studies of driving factors of CAR and ecological benefits of secondary forest restoration.

TI  - Feature Consistency Constraints-Based CNN for Landsat Land Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cascade of convolution layers and the end-to-end training process facilitate CNN feature extraction and transmission, and promote the success of CNN in image processing. However, the drawback of heavily relying on large-scale high-quality training samples restricts its applications. To avoid costly and unrealistic manual annotations for large-scale remote sensing images, existing land cover maps are considered as an alternative to manual annotations, in which noisy labels are inevitable. To alleviate the impact of noisy labels, this article proposes to improve the consistency feature learning ability of CNNs as a feasible solution in practical land cover mapping. First, an intraclass feature consistency constraint is introduced to maintain the consistency of CNN feature maps for the same class. Then, an inter-iteration feature consistency constraint is employed to guide the network to learn features that are consistent with the whole underlying distribution inside a minibatch. These two feature consistency constraints work in a cooperative and complementary manner with the traditional cross-entropy, and together improve the consistency feature learning ability of the proposed feature consistency constraints-based CNN (FCNet). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FCNet. Extensive experiments on different network structures validate the generalization of the proposed feature consistency constraints.

AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing plays an important role in the field of optical remote sensing because it can obtain the radiant brightness temperature of ground objects day and night, and provide basic data for quantitative applications such as surface temperature and evapotranspiration. In order to improve the observation efficiency of long-wave infrared remote sensing, after years of pre-research and model engineering development and test verification, a 360 degrees unidirectional uniform rotation scanning mirror is set in front of the optical lens, a small F-number optical lens is configured, and a high-sensitivity quadrangular integrated long-line TDI long-wave detector is set. The on-orbit application of a wide thermal infrared imager with a spatial resolution of 100m, NE Delta T better than 0.1K and width better than 1500km in four long wave infrared spectrum segments of 8 mu m similar to 12.5 mu m has been realized, which makes the comprehensive index of thermal infrared optical load in China reach the international advanced level.The stability of the high and low temperature blackbody of the large surface source can reach 20mK/25min, and the temperature difference can reach 21 degrees C, which provides a guarantee for the high-precision radiometric calibration and quantitative application in orbit.The payload can cover most of the regions in China in one day and the whole world in two days, which will greatly improve the application efficiency of thermal infrared remote sensing data, and provide powerful data support for thermal pollution emission monitoring, environmental assessment of nuclear power plants, water temperature monitoring of key rivers and lakes/coastal areas, drought monitoring, fire monitoring, etc.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 37th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)
CL  - St Petersburg, FL
AB  - High-resolution land cover mapping (LCM) is an important application for studying and understanding the change of the earth surface. While deep learning (DL) methods demonstrate great potential in analyzing satellite images, they largely depend on massive high-quality labels. This paper proposes SWLCM, a Scalable and Weakly-supervised two-stage Land Cover Mapping method on a new Sunway Supercomputer. Our method consists of a k-means clustering module as a first stage, and an iterative deep learning module as a second stage. With the kmeans module providing a good enough starting point (taking inaccurate results as noisy labels), the deep learning module improves the classification results in an iterative way, without any labelling efforts required for processing large scenarios. To achieve efficiency for country-level land cover mapping, we design a customized data partition scheme and an on-the-fly assembly for k-means. Through careful parallelization and optimization, our k-means module scales to 98,304 computing nodes (over 38 million cores), and provides a sustained performance of 437.56 PFLOPS, in a real LCM task of the entire region of China; the iterative updating part scales to 24,576 nodes, with a performance of 11 PFLOPS. We produce a 10-m resolution land cover map of China, with an accuracy of 83.5% (10-class) or 73.2% (25-class), 7% to 8% higher than best existing products, paving ways for finer land surveys to support sustainability-related applications.

TI  - Characterizing the Changes in Permafrost Thickness across Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost impacts the subsurface hydrology and determines the transport of buried biochemical substances. Current evaluations of permafrost mostly focus on the overlying active layer. However, the basic but missing information of permafrost thickness constrains the quantification of trends and effects of permafrost degradation on subsurface hydrological processes. Our study quantified the long-term variations in permafrost thickness on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) between 1851 and 2100 based on layered soil temperatures calculated from eight earth system models (ESMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (the sixth phase) and validated by field observations and previous permafrost pattern from remote sensing. The calculated permafrost distribution based on ESMs was validated by the pattern derived from the MODIS datasets and field survey. Our results show that permafrost thicker than 10 m covers approximately 0.97 million km2 of the total area of the TP, which represents an areal extent of over 36.49% of the whole TP. The mean permafrost thickness of the TP was 43.20 m between 1851 and 2014, and it would decrease at an average rate of 9.42, 14.99, 18.78, and 20.75 cm per year under scenarios SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 from 2015 to 2100, respectively. The permafrost thickness will decrease by over 50 cm per year in Qiangtang Basin under SSP585. Our study provides new insights for spatiotemporal changes in permafrost thickness and a basic dataset combined results of remote sensing, field measurements for further exploring relevant hydrological, geomorphic processes and biogeochemical cycles in the plateau cryospheric environment.

TI  - Cloud Identification and Properties Retrieval of the Fengyun-4A Satellite Using a ResUnet Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY4A) satellite has good cloud observation ability, but it still absents all-weather and high-precision official cloud products. This study develops a deep-learning ResUnet model for all-weather retrieval of cloud phase (CLP) and cloud properties using the brightness temperature from water vapor and longwave infrared channels of AGRI. The ResUnet model is trained with the Himawari-8 satellite Level-2 (H8-L2) cloud products as true targets and adopts image-by-image way to learn the spatial structure information of clouds, which compensates for the difficulty of retrieving thick clouds by thermal infrared radiation at night to some extent. On an independent testing dataset, the model has an overall accuracy of 90.64% for CLP identification and performs well at retrieving cloud top height (CTH). Even without using visible and near-infrared radiation, the root-mean-square error of cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud optical thickness (COT) estimations still reaches 7.14 mu m and 9.01 in the range of 0-60. To further illustrate the reliability and applicability, CLP and cloud properties provided by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used as benchmarks to assess the quality of cloud products from FY4A satellite Level-2 (FY4A-L2), H8-L2, and ResUnet model retrieval. The ResUnet model provides a significant improvement over FY4A-L2 for the accuracy of cloud identification and in the quality of CTH products. In the range of 0-40 mu m (0-60), the CER (COT) product of ResUnet model retrieval has a reliable and higher precision that is comparable with H8-L2.

TI  - A Self-Learning-Update CNN Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in semantic segmentation for remote sensing images, and it has achieved great success. Due to the diversity of the spatial distribution of terrestrial objects in remote sensing images, it is difficult to effectively learn general geographical laws and apply them to a specific image. To introduce geographical knowledge into the CNN model more effectively, a self-learning-update CNN model (SLU-CNN) is proposed in this letter. It learns the representation of specific spatial dependence among different objects according to the CNN result, and then incorporates it with the CNN result to make semantic inference available. The proposed method mainly involves two modules. First, geographical objects generated from the CNN result are used as inference units. Second, the spatial dependence between inference units is learned to build a specific adaptive geographical relationship. And then, it is embedded as an adaptive penalty term into an object-based Markov random field model (OMRF) to achieve the collaboration between the CNN result and the semantic inference. Our method provides a general data-knowledge dual-driven framework for the deep neural network. Experiments of the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) and Sentinel-2 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with different state-of-the-art CNN methods.

TI  - ChangE-4 Measurements of Lunar Surface Temperatures: Thermal Conductivity of the Near Surface Regolith
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar thermal conductivity is significantly important for understanding the geological processes of the Moon. The Apollo in situ heat flow experiments and diviner remote sensing data provide us with good constraints on the thermophysical properties of the lunar regolith fines layer. As the first farside in situ experiments, Chang'E-4 (CE-4) temperature sensors will further extend our understanding. In this study, a 1-D thermal model with updated bulk densities by the CE-4 lunar penetrating radar (LPR) data is used. Then, the nighttime surface temperatures from the sensors of the CE-4 lander are applied to retrieve the surface thermal conductivity at the CE-4 landing site. After minimizing the differences between the predicted temperature and CE-4 measurements, the range of surface layer contact conductivity ( ks) within the upper 1 cm is about (0.95-2.26) x 10(-3) Wm(-1) center dot K-1 for T1, (1.04-2.44) x 10-3 Wm(-1) center dot K-1 for T2, (0.60-1.40) x 10(-3) Wm(-1) center dot K-1 for T3, and (0.60-1.39) x 10(-3) Wm(-1) center dot K-1 for T4, respectively. In addition, the factors that may affect the inversion or the measurements were discussed, such as the shadowing effect, the rock abundance (RA), the lateral conduction from the rover transfer mechanism, and the densification effect during the measurements.

TI  - Semantic-Aware Region Loss for Land-Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating superpixel segmentation into convolutional neural networks is known to be effective in enhancing the accuracy of land-cover classification. However, most of existing methods accomplish such integration by focusing on the development of new network architectures, which suffer from several flaws: conflicts between general superpixels and semantic labels introduce noise into the training, especially at object boundaries; absence of training guidance for superpixels leads to ineffective regional feature learning; and unnecessary superpixel segmentation in the testing stage not only increases the computational burden but also incurs jagged edges. In this study, we propose a novel semantic-aware region (SARI) loss to guide the effective learning of regional features with superpixels for accurate land-cover classification. The key idea of the proposed method is to reduce the feature variance inside and between homogeneous superpixels while enlarging feature discrepancy between heterogeneous ones. The SARI loss is thus designed with three subparts, including superpixel variance loss, intraclass similarity loss and interclass distance loss. We also develop semantic superpixels to assist in the network training with SARI loss while overcoming the limitations of general superpixels. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that the SARI loss can facilitate regional feature learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with mIoU scores of around 97.11% and 73.99% on Gaofen Image dataset and DeepGlobe dataset, respectively.

TI  - Estimation of Near-Surface Air Temperature Lapse Rate Based on MODIS Data Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature lapse rate (NSATLR) is one of the key criteria for judging atmospheric stability. It is an important model parameter in glacier, hydrology, ecology, climate, and meteorology in high mountains such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, due to the complex interaction between the atmosphere and land surface, retrieving NSATLR from remotely sensed data is challenging. In this article, we develop a novel model based on the MODIS data to estimate the daily 5-km NSATLR over the TP. The input parameters of the model include digital elevation model and the near-surface air temperature estimated from the MODIS data. By combining moving window and specified criteria, the pixel-based NASTLR with a 5-km spatial resolution over the TP is estimated. In addition, we also estimate the NSATLR based on the meteorological data over the TP (NSATLR(in) (situ)) to evaluate the accuracy of NSATLR estimation model. Results demonstrate that the NSATLR estimate agrees well with NSATLR(in) (situ) in the eastern TP, with an overall root-mean-square error of 1.51 degrees C/km and a mean bias error of -0.78 degrees C/km. Larger deviation exists in the southern TP. Thanks to the evident advantages of simplicity, the availability of input parameters and the independence from the meteorological data, the developed model can be applied to larger areas.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice Lead Detection from Chinese HY-2B Radar Altimeter Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice thickness is one of the essential characteristics of sea ice. Sea ice lead detection is the key to sea ice thickness estimation from radar altimetry data. This research studies ten different surface type classification methods, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and threshold methods, being applied to the HY-2B radar altimeter data collected in October 2019 in the Arctic Ocean. The Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were used for training and validation of the classifiers. Compared with other classifiers, the supervised Bagging ensemble learning classifier showed excellent and robust performance with overall accuracy up to 95.69%. In order to assess the performance of the Bagging classifier in practical applications, lead fractions from January 2019 to March 2021 based on the HY-2B radar altimeter data were mapped using the trained Bagging classifier and compared to the CryoSat-2 L2I data product. The results of the lead fraction showed the monthly variability of ice lead, and the ice lead had a reasonable spatial distribution and was consistent with CryoSat-2 L2I data products. According to these results, the Bagging classifier can provide an essential reference for future studies of Arctic sea ice thickness and sea level estimation from HY-2B radar altimeter data.

TI  - Insulator Detection for High-Resolution Satellite Images Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of electrical insulators in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images using deep learning has made great progress in recent years, but little research has been conducted in the same field in remote sensing (RS) images. In this article, a novel method was proposed to detect insulators on 500-kV transmission towers in RS images. The proposed method consists of three components including 1) a super-resolution (SR) network to improve image resolution; 2) an object detection model to detect 110-, 220-, and 500-kV electrical power towers along transmission pipelines; and 3) a semantic segmentation network to identify insulators on the detected 500-kV towers. In addition, the online hard example mining (OHEM) method and class weight calculation method were utilized to handle the imbalanced data among different classes during training. The proposed model was evaluated on SuperView-1 and WorldView-3 satellite images collected in four regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect insulators in high-resolution satellite images and achieved the highest F1 score of 0.7952.

TI  - Deep Feature Enhancement Method for Land Cover With Irregular and Sparse Spatial Distribution Features: A Case Study on Open-Pit Mining
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification in mining areas (LCMA) is essential for the environmental assessment of mines and plays a crucial role in their sustainable development. The shapes of mine land occupation elements are irregular, and the overall proportion of their area is relatively small. Therefore, their features may be easily lost during feature extraction, which limits the interpretation accuracy in mining areas. This study attempts to address these issues. We propose a model named EG-UNet to enhance the features of elements with few samples and to capture long-range information. The proposed EG-UNet includes two main modules. First, the edge feature enhancement module, the edges of elements of mine land occupation contain more information than other spatial locations. Hence, during the feature extraction of elements, a Sobel operator is used to extract the object boundary, which increases the weight of these features before the pooling operation for their preservation. Second, the long-range information extraction module, long-range information helps extract tiny objects, such as dumping grounds in the mining area. We present a graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the long-range features and apply convolutional neural networks to learn the graph construction. A total of ten deep-learning networks were compared using the LCMA semantic segmentation dataset. Our model exhibited the best performance, especially in classifying classes with few samples. Furthermore, to evaluate the general ability of EG-UNet, a benchmark-Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) was used, and the result still reflected the superiority of our method.

TI  - Short Time Cloud-Free Image Reconstruction Based on Time Series Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A cost-effective method for cloud removal and reconstruction of remote sensing images has been a long-standing research challenge in remote sensing data processing. In this article, we address this challenge by presenting a fast and simple method for cloud detection and cloud-free image reconstruction using Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI series data. The proposed method utilizes the spectral difference between cloud pixels and transparent pixels to develop a fast and simple cloud detection algorithm for multispectral remote sensing sensors. Subsequently, the cloud-free data of the complementary image and the target image undergo histogram matching, and the cloud-free pixels of the complementary image are seamlessly integrated into the original image, leading to the generation of a cloud-free image reconstruction algorithm. Comparative analysis between the results obtained from our proposed method and the corresponding artificial results reveals an accuracy rate exceeding 90% and a high consistency in the reconstructed spatial spectrum. By addressing the need for cost-effective cloud removal and image reconstruction, our method contributes to the advancement of remote sensing data processing and applications.

TI  - Bathymetry Retrieval From Spaceborne Multispectral Subsurface Reflectance
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A few scholars have developed the models for retrieval of water depth from subsurface reflectance of multispectral images to avoid the influences of sun glitter. However, the models are only suitable for case I water. For this reason, this study proposes a bathymetry retrieval model using subsurface reflectance for both case I and case II water. The model first corrects the water surface reflectance image and then converts it into a subsurface reflectance image, and the subsurface reflectance image is used as the water depth retrieval image. Landsat 8 images were taken for experiments in case 1 water and case 2 water, and two water areas, Weizhou Island, Guangxi, China, and Molokai Island, Hawaii, USA, were used to verify the proposed model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model reduced the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved water depth in the Weizhou and Molokai areas from 3.113 to 2.903 m and 4.239 to 3.653 m, respectively, i.e., improve accuracy of water depth at 6.75% and 13.82% for Weizhou and Molokai areas, respectively. Therefore, the results demonstrate that the proposed model using subsurface reflectance can significantly improve the accuracy of bathymetry retrieval via spaceborne multispectral images.

TI  - InSAR Spatial-Heterogeneity Tropospheric Delay Correction in Steep Mountainous Areas Based on Deep Learning for Landslides Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology has been widely used for landslide monitoring in mountainous areas. The troposphere in steep mountainous areas is affected by the variable topography, temperature, and humidity, which differs from that in plain areas and thus exhibits large spatial heterogeneity. Traditional InSAR troposphere correction methods are limited in this area, and the accuracy of InSAR measurements will be significantly affected. In this article, we proposed a tropospheric delay correction method based on deep learning (AtmNet) without external data considering the spatial heterogeneity in each individual interferogram. The tropospheric correction and landslide monitoring based on Sentinel-1 SAR data was carried out in Mao County, a high landslide-prone area in southwest Sichuan Province (China). A simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the adaptability of the model and evaluate the effectiveness of the AtmNet method. Furthermore, we demonstrated the good performance of the AtmNet method through a comparison with the linear model (LM) and generic atmospheric correction model (GACOS), revealing that the proposed method could effectively model the spatial heterogeneity of tropospheric delay in steep mountains. The slope displacements that cannot be seen in the interferogram were very clear after the tropospheric delay correction. This method provides important technical support for the accurate DInSAR and time-series InSAR for landslide monitoring in steep mountainous areas in the future.

TI  - Enhancement of Nighttime Fire Detection and Combustion Efficiency Characterization Using Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS Instruments
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the second-generation FIre Light Detection Algorithm (FILDA-2), which includes advances in fire detection and retrievals of radiative power (FRP), fire visible energy fraction (VEF), and fire modified combustion efficiency (MCE) at nighttime from the holistic use of multiple-spectral radiances measured by the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) aboard Suomi-NPP (VNP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20/joint polar satellite system (JPSS)-1 (VJ1) satellites. Key enhancements include: 1) a new fast algorithm that maps VIIRS day/night band (DNB) radiances to the pixel footprints of VIIRS moderate (M) and imagery (I) bands; 2) identification of potential fire pixels through the use of the DNB anomalies and I-band thermal anomalies; 3) dynamic thresholds for contextual testing of fire pixels; and 4) pixel-specific estimates of FRP, VEF, and MCE. The global benchmark test demonstrates that FILDA-2 can detect approximately 25%-30% smaller and cooler fires than the operational VIIRS active fire 375-m I-band algorithm with the added benefit of providing daily global pixel-level characterizations of MCE for nighttime surface fires. The MCE derived by FILDA-2 is in good agreement with limited ground-based observations near the fires. Additionally, FILDA-2 reduces angular dependence in FRP estimates and significantly reduces the "bow-tie" (double-counting) effect in fire detection compared with the AF-I product. The cross-validation of FILDA-2 products from VNP and VJ1 retrievals confirms good consistency in FRP and MCE retrievals globally. FILDA-2 is being implemented by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to generate a new VIIRS data product for fire monitoring, chemical-speciated fire emission estimates, and fire line characterization.

TI  - Deep Feature and Domain Knowledge Fusion Network for Mapping Surface Water Bodies by Fusing Google Earth RGB and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping surface water bodies from fine spatial resolution optical remote sensing imagery is essential for the understanding of the global hydrologic cycle. Although satellite data are useful for mapping, the limited spectral information captured by some satellite systems can be suboptimal for the task. For example, the very high-resolution images of Google Earth (GE) only contain RGB bands, which often means many water bodies and land objects are confused. Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery has a spectral resolution more suitable for mapping water bodies, but its medium spatial resolution limits the ability for detailed mapping of water-land boundaries. This letter proposes a deep feature and domain knowledge fusion network (DFDKFNet) for mapping surface water bodies by fusing GE and S2 images while incorporating domain knowledge. DFDKFNet uses the remote sensing indices of normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the S2 image as the representative domain knowledge to better extract water bodies from terrestrial features. A similar pixel-based approach is used to downscale the NDWI and NDVI maps to match the spatial resolution between the GE and S2 images. The DFDKFNet uses the GE and downscaled NDWI and NDVI images to extract the deep semantic features of water bodies, which are fused with the domain knowledge extracted from the NDWI and NDVI images. DFDKFNet was compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results show that DFDKFNet can enhance water body mapping accuracy.

TI  - Digital Agriculture: Mapping Knowledge Structure and Trends
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - With the advancement of digital technologies, digital agriculture improves agricultural efficiency and sustainability, reducing resource waste and environmental burden. Hence, DA has emerged as a new catalyst for grain productivity and a driving force behind climate improvement, with broad prospects. However, digital agriculture is still in its early stage in most countries and there are few systematic reviews. In China, for example, there were only 3 non-core reviews out of 817 literatures on DA. Meanwhile, the use of Citespace is revolutionary as it leverages data visualization to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within literatures, aiding researchers in achieving their objectives. This study aims to address this research gap by using Citespace to produce a non-subjective and testable review on DA. In this study, we collected 2264 literatures by retrieving the WoS database in the timespan 1997-2022. The results show that 1) over time, the annual number of publications on DA has gradually increased and the research can be roughly divided into three stages: start-up, steady development, and rapid development stage; 2) research streams of DA can be further divided into six categories: Remote Sensing, Climate-Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data and System Integration; 3) development of research frontiers could be divided into three parts: "exploration of digital agriculture technologies," "operation management of digital agriculture" and "limitations of digital agriculture;" 4) future research should pay more attention to the innovation and scientific evaluation of digital technology and operation management. Also, effective DA policies should be put forward to provide a theoretical basis and decision-making reference.

TI  - A Large-Batch Orthorectification Generation Method Based on Adaptive GPU Thread Parameters and Parallel Calculation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Orthorectification reflects a large amount of real and objective information, such as the characteristics of images and the geometric accuracy of maps. Conducting a large batch of orthorectification is a process with high time cost owing to the pixelwise correction each image. A common approach is to use graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel computing to accelerate orthorectification processing. However, most of the existing GPU acceleration studies have adopted experimental testing methods to determine thread parameters, which are inapplicable to different GPUs and affect the GPU acceleration performance. We put forward an adaptive calculation method for GPU thread parameters based on the performance parameters of different GPUs and by simultaneously blocking the image automatically according to the GPU memory space. We used 112 ZY-3 images to test the adaptive GPU and compare it to a general GPU. The experimental results show the following: first, for a single ZY-3 image, the GPU acceleration by the adaptive calculation method presented in this article is 43.22% higher than that by the general GPU, and the correction time is 34.41 times faster than that of the central processing unit. The result of the automatic image blocking was the same as that of the artificial blocking. Second, the experimental performance on four different GPUs indicated that all GPUs exhibited a significant speed boost. Third, for large-batch images, the GPU acceleration by the adaptive GPU was 32.6% higher than that by the general GPU, which provides an adaptive optimization strategy for large-batch image orthorectification.

TI  - Robust Co-registration of External Laser Altimetry Points and Stereo Images
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-7 (GF-7) is China's first submeter stereo mapping satellite, and the laser altimetry system equipped on it is used to improve its elevation positioning accuracy. The elevation positioning accuracy of GF-7 may be limited by the absence of a laser altimetry system. Therefore, it is necessary to study the combined adjustment of external laser altimetry points (LAPs) and GF-7 stereo images. In this study, we proposed a method consisting of registering LAPs to GF-7 stereo images followed by combined adjustment. The registration method adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme: the LAPs are reprojected to stereo images to obtain coarse coordinates, then fine coordinates are acquired by least-squares matching and using the epipolar geometry constraint. The proposed method can effectively improve the registration accuracy: the root mean square error (RMSE) of the registration is subpixel, compared with about three pixels when only random sample consensus (RANSAC) is applied. At the same time, the number of LAPs is also increased tenfold when using the proposed method. In the subsequent combined adjustment, the RMSE of the elevation positioning is decreased from about 5.5 to 1.3 m.

TI  - Landscape dynamics and human disturbance processes in wetlands in a mining city: a case study in Huaibei, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are fragile ecosystems that are sensitive to human activities. In mining cities with high groundwater tables, underground mining, urbanization, and land reclamation cause severe disturbance to wetland landscape patterns, which poses a serious threat to the integrity and sustainability of the regional wetland ecosystems. This paper extracted the dynamic patterns of wetlands in Huaibei, China, from the Landsat TM/ETM remote sensing images with a time duration of 30 years from 1991 to 2021. The land-use transfer matrix and the landscape metrics were used to analyze the dynamic evolution of the wetland landscape patterns in this typical mining city. Afterwards, the human disturbance changes in the wetlands during the past 30 years were analyzed by the human disturbance transformation index (HTI). The correlation between the HTI and the changes in the landscape metrics were analyzed to reflect the influences of different human disturbance mechanisms on the evolution of the wetland landscape patterns. The results indicated that the wetland areas gradually increased with rising human disturbance levels from 1991 to 2021. However, the wetland landscape patterns showed a trend of declining landscape connectivity and fragmentation. The human disturbance levels to the wetlands were found significantly increased from 1991 to 2005 and from 2010 to 2015, and declined from 2005 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2021. The correlation between the HTI and landscape metrics indicates that current ecological restoration planning has limitations in improving the wetland landscape patterns. In the future, it is necessary to formulate systematic wetland landscape patterns restoration planning that covers the overall area according to the evolutionary trend of wetlands.

TI  - A New Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) Radiance-Based Hybrid Method for Estimating Clear-Sky Surface Longwave Upwelling Radiation From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave upwelling radiation (SLUR) is a critical parameter for studying the water-energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this study, we proposed a new hybrid method for estimating the clear-sky SLUR from the bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) radiance (new BOA-hybrid method) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). There are two key parts in the developed new BOA-hybrid method. First, a physical four-channel algorithm was developed to estimate the atmospheric terms (atmospheric upwelling radiance and transmittance), which were used to calculate MODIS BOA radiance. Second, a linear model linking SLUR and MODIS BOA channel radiances was constructed using a large number of samples generated by extensive radiative transfer simulations. In situ measurements from 27 sites in four flux networks were collected to validate the new BOA-hybrid method. The average bias and root mean square error (RMSE) were 1.65 and 16.23 W/m(2) for the new BOA-hybrid method, which was superior to the original BOA-hybrid method whose bias and RMSE were 3.52 and 18.51 W/m(2), and slightly better than the classical hybrid method that estimates SLUR using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance (TOA-hybrid method) whose bias and RMSE were -1.64 and 17.44 W/m2, respectively. The performance of the new and original BOA-hybrid methods was similar when the total precipitable water (TPW) vapor was less than 1.5 cm. However, under a large TPW (i.e., TPW > 3 cm), especially in the case of a large viewing zenith angle (i.e., VZA > 45(?)), the accuracy of the original BOA-hybrid method decreased significantly, while the physical four-channel algorithm could effectively improve the accuracy of atmospheric correction, and the RMSE of the SLUR estimated by BOA-hybrid could be reduced by more than 10 W/m(2). In summary, the developed new BOA-hybrid method can estimate SLUR accurately and has great potential to produce a long-term high spatial resolution environmental data record of SLUR.

TI  - High Accuracy Georeferencing of GF-6 Wide Field of View Scenes Toward Analysis Ready Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis ready data (ARD) has recently become a popular standard for medium-resolution satellite images. The most representative datasets, namely Sentinel-2 Level-2A products and Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Science Products, have met ARD standards, with public access. The Chinese Gaofen (GF) series Level-1A wide field of view (WFV) product, which has a similar ground sampling distance (GSD) to Sentinel-2 Level-2A products, is open to the public for its scenes and rational function model (RFM). However, the lower geometric processing accuracy of WFV products of approximately 3-pixel geolocation deviation restricts their wide application and further development toward ARD. The causes of low accuracy are twofold, namely the impact of calibration errors and the inaccuracy of the exterior orientation parameters. In terms of improving the accuracy of RFM, bundle adjustment and the bias compensation model (BCM) are currently the most widely accepted methods. However, existing approaches do not account for the imaging characteristics of WFV scenes, which are only for narrow field-of-view scenes and do not help with nonlinear internal distortions. To address the shortcomings of these methods, a joint orientation method for WFV cameras is proposed in this study. Owing to the high level of geometric accuracy of Sentinel-2 Level-1C reference scenes, this study analyzed the expression of WFV camera attitude errors on the image side. A polynomial exterior orientation model suitable for WFV cameras is also provided. We performed a refined calibration of the nonlinear internal distortions using multitemporal GF-6 Level-1A WFV images because of the additional error introduced by the cross-track inconsistency of the Sentinel-2 reference data. The method developed in this study has been experimentally verified to achieve satisfactory geometric positioning accuracy with GF-6 WFV products from 3-pixel to 0.3-pixel (5 m). This study allows optimization of the geometric performance of GF-6 Level-1A WFV products to the level of Sentinel-2 Level-1C products, which is of considerable importance in developing GF WFV images to ARD.

TI  - Bayesian Model Averaging Ensemble Approach for Multi-Time-Ahead Groundwater Level Prediction Combining the GRACE, GLEAM, and GLDAS Data in Arid Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate groundwater level (GWL) prediction is essential for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. However, the prediction of GWLs remains a challenge due to insufficient data and the complicated hydrogeological system. In this study, we investigated the ability of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) data, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data, and the publicly available meteorological data in 1-, 2-, and 3-month-ahead GWL prediction using three traditional machine learning models (extreme learning machine, ELM; support vector machine, SVR; and random forest, RF). Meanwhile, we further developed the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) by combining the ELM, SVR, and RF models to avoid the uncertainty of the single models and to improve the predicting accuracy. The validity of the forcing data and the BMA model were assessed for three GWL monitoring wells in the Zhangye Basin in Northwest China. The results indicated that the applied forcing data could be treated as validated inputs to predict the GWL up to 3 months ahead due to the achieved high accuracy of the machine learning models (NS > 0.55). The BMA model could significantly improve the performance of the single machine learning models. Overall, the BMA model reduced the RMSE of the ELM, SVR, and RF models in the testing period by about 13.75%, 24.01%, and 17.69%, respectively; while it improved the NS by about 8.32%, 16.13%, and 9.67% for 1-, 2-, and 3-month-ahead GWL prediction, respectively. The uncertainty analysis results also verified the reliability of the BMA model in multi-time-ahead GWL predicting. This highlighted the efficiency of the satellite data, satellite-based data, and publicly available data as substitute inputs in machine-learning-based GWL prediction, particularly for areas with insufficient or missing data. Meanwhile, the BMA ensemble strategy can serve as a powerful and reliable approach in multi-time-ahead GWL prediction when risk-based decision making is needed or a lack of relevant hydrogeological data impedes the application of the physical models.

TI  - A Comparison of Machine Learning and Empirical Approaches for Deriving Bathymetry from Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the precise water depth in shallow areas of the ocean is of great significance to the safe navigation of ships and hydrographic surveying. Compared with traditional bathymetry, satellite remote sensing for water depth determination makes it possible to cover large areas by dynamic observation. In this paper, we conducted an optically shallow water bathymetric inversion study using a Stumpf empirical model, random forest model, neural network model, and support vector machine model based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and Ganquan Dao measured bathymetry data. We compared and analyzed the inversion results based on the empirical model and different machine learning models. The results show that the Stumpf empirical and machine learning models are capable of inverting optically shallow water depth. Moreover, the machine learning models had better fitting ability than the Stumpf empirical model with a sufficient number of samples, especially when the water depth was greater than 15 m. In addition, the random forest model had the highest overall accuracy among these models, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.41 m and a regression coefficient (R-2) of 0.96 for the test data.

TI  - Improving GEDI Forest Canopy Height Products by Considering the Stand Age Factor Derived from Time-Series Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study in Fujian, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height plays an important role in forest resource management and conservation. The accurate estimation of forest canopy height on a large scale is important for forest carbon stock, biodiversity, and the carbon cycle. With the technological development of satellite-based LiDAR, it is possible to determine forest canopy height over a large area. However, the forest canopy height that is acquired by this technology is influenced by topography and climate, and the canopy height that is acquired in complex subtropical mountainous regions has large errors. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating forest canopy height by combining long-time series Landsat images with GEDI satellite-based LiDAR data, with Fujian, China, as the study area. This approach optimizes the quality of GEDI canopy height data in topographically complex areas by combining stand age and tree height, while retaining the advantage of fast and effective forest canopy height measurements with satellite-based LiDAR. In this study, the growth curves of the main forest types in Fujian were first obtained by using a large amount of forest survey data, and the LandTrendr algorithm was used to obtain the forest age distribution in 2020. The obtained forest age was then combined with the growth curves of each forest type in order to determine the tree height distribution. Finally, the obtained average tree heights were merged with the GEDI_V27 canopy height product in order to create a modified forest canopy height model (MGEDI_V27) with a 30 m spatial resolution. The results showed that the estimated forest canopy height had a mean of 15.04 m, with a standard deviation of 4.98 m. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the GEDI_V27 and the MGEDI_V27 using the sample dataset. The MGEDI_V27 had a higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 m, MAE = 1.85 m) than the GEDI_V27 (R-2 = 0.39, RMSE = 3.35 m, MAE = 2.41 m). R-2, RMSE, and MAE were improved by 71.79%, 33.13%, and 22.53%, respectively. We also produced a forest age distribution map of Fujian for the year 2020 and a forest disturbance map of Fujian for the past 32 years. The research results can provide decision support for forest ecological protection and management and for carbon sink analysis in Fujian.

TI  - A Novel Two-Stage Destriping Algorithm Based on MWIR Energy Separation and Image Guidance (MES-IG)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-wave infrared (LWIR) bands in multispectral datasets are extremely useful in many applications. However, the LWIR bands usually suffer from undesirable stripe noise, which impedes their further application. Compared with emission-dominated LWIR, the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands containing both emitted and reflected radiation usually exhibit higher image quality. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage MWIR energy separation and image guidance (MES-IG) algorithm to destripe the LWIR images with the assistance of the MWIR bands. In the first stage, we decompose the MWIR image into the emitted and reflected components by solving a constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we impose the low-rank penalty to enforce the similarities between MWIR and LWIR, and we use the total variation (TV) regularization to exploit the similarities between MWIR and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) images. In the second stage, the obtained emitted component of MWIR is considered as the guidance image to remove the stripes in the LWIR images by adopting the 1-D guided filter algorithm. Numerical experiments on the Chinese Gaofen-5 satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in providing improved LWIR image destriping performance over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI  - A Comparative Study of a Typical Glacial Lake in the Himalayas before and after Engineering Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main glacier-related natural hazards that are common to alpine locations is the occurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which can seriously harm downstream towns and infrastructure. GLOFs have increased in frequency in the central Himalayas in recent years as a result of global warming, and careful management of glacial lakes is a crucial step in catastrophe prevention. In this study, field surveys were conducted on 28 August 2020 and 1 August 2021 with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a boat bathymetric system on an unmanned surface vessel (USV), combined with 22 years of Landsat series imagery and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery data. Spatial analysis was then used to investigate changes in lake surface conditions, dam stability, and surrounding topography before and after an integrated project of the Jialong Co lake. The results show that: (1) from 2000 to 2020 (before engineering management), the area of the Jialong Co glacial lake increased from 0.2148 +/- 0.0176 km(2) to 0.5921 +/- 0.0003 km(2). The glacial lake expansion rate from 2000 to 2010 (0.0145 km(2)/a) was greater than the rate from 2011 to 2020 (6.92 x 10(-6) km(2)/a). In 2021 (after engineering treatment), the glacial lake perimeter, area, and volume decreased by 0.6014 km, 0.1136 km(2), and 1.90 x 10(7) m(3), respectively. The amount of excavation during the project treatment was 8.13 million square meters, and the amount of filling was 1.24 million square meters. According to the results of the unmanned surface vessel (USV), the elevation of the lake surface dropped from 4331 m to 4281 m, and the water level dropped by 50 m (the designed safe water level line dropped by 30 m). (2) The results of the UAV topographic survey and geomorphological analysis showed that the engineered reinforcement of the outlet channel and surrounding dam effectively mitigated severe scouring of the foot of the final moraine at the outlet of the spillway, as well as the likelihood of glacial lake outbursts caused by ice avalanches and landslides. (3) The comprehensive engineering treatment of this typical glacial lake effectively lowered the water level and improved the stability of the moraine ridge and lake dam, providing a scientific foundation for other glacial lake outburst risk assessments and disaster mitigation and management measures. Thus, it is critical to evaluate the impact of comprehensive engineering management of key glacial lakes to support glacial lake management.

AB  - In this study, we present a data-driven approach for predicting solar irradiance by applying dimensionality reduction techniques to a dataset comprising of ground meteorological station data and FY-4A remote sensing data collected from January 1st to December 31st, 2018. Specifically, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Next, we employ a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network-based short-term irradiance prediction model to realize the short-term prediction of solar irradiance. We then evaluate the performance of the GRU model by comparing its prediction results with those obtained using a traditional Backpropagation (BP) neural network model with measured solar irradiance. The results indicate that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the GRU neural network model is 41% lower than that of the BP neural network model, indicating the improved performance of the proposed model.

TI  - An Algorithm Measuring Urban Building Heights by Combining the PS-InSAR Technique and Two-Stage Programming Approach Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban building heights offer critical information in studying urbanization. An approach with adequate accuracy is of significant interest. Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques and multibaseline (MB) InSAR observations can be an alternative to fill the interest. Since the MB InSAR observations are achieved through multitemporal SAR observations with different baselines, temporal decorrelation is unavoidable, affecting most existing MB-based phase unwrapping (PU) approaches. Also, the quality of the derived heights depends on a PU approach. Thus, by combing the permanent scatterers (PS) InSAR technique and the two-stage programming approach (TSPA) framework, we proposed an algorithm to estimate urban building heights with the multitemporal SAR observations, calling it the PS-TSPA algorithm. It takes advantage of the global phase gradient information used in the single baseline PU approaches, not considering the phase continuity assumption. The algorithm should be robust to the temporal decorrelation or noise effect. With the time series of 17 TerraSAR-X data, we estimated building heights in the southern urban area of Chengdu, China. The derived building heights were satisfactory overall and assessed by in situ measurements. In comparison, the Tomo-PS method estimated the heights in the same area and with the same SAR data. Quantitative analyses indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Tomo-PS method. Finally, with routine SAR observations and SAR data downloadable through the Internet, the PS-TSPA algorithm can be inexpensive in estimating urban building heights with reasonable accuracy.

T2  - EMERGING NETWORKING ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES, ICENAT 2022
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Emerging Networking Architecture and Technologies (ICENAT)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - For lowearth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, the high-speed movement of satellitesmakes the inter-satellite links time-varying, resulting in increased user content access delay. In this paper, we introduce information-centric networking (ICN) architecture in satellite networks, reasonably distribute data content cache on different nodes to improve inter-satellite data transmission, and propose a caching strategy for information center satellite networks based on the importance of nodes (CSNI). By preserving stable inter-satellite links, the LEO satellite network is modeled as a series of steady-state topological graphs. Local clustering coefficients, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality are calculated for each node in the steady-state topology graph. And the contentwith high popularity is cached in the appropriate nodes by these three metrics, which improves the data transmission efficiency. Simulation results show that the strategy proposed in this paper can effectively improve the cached content hit ratio ate and reduce average user request delay compared with the LCE, LCD, Prob, and Betw.

TI  - Fusion of Multisource Satellite AOD Products via Bayesian Maximum Entropy With Explicit A Priori Knowledge
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing multiple satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products to produce high-quality aerosol records is necessary for climate-related research. The Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) approach has unique advantages in this regard. However, the large accuracy differences and redundancy characteristics between aerosol products are not considered by BME resulting in limited fusion quality and large computational consumption. Therefore, in this study, we try to explicitly introduce a priori knowledge about the multisource AOD product accuracy, called the accuracy ranking matrix, into the BME fusion process to test whether the above issues can be alleviated. Eight publicly released aerosol products over China are used in the fusion experiments, and the fusion results are validated with ground-based measurements. Results suggest that, compared with fusion directly, the fusion accuracy and efficiency are significantly improved by introducing the accuracy ranking matrix; the proportion of satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) accuracy requirements increases by 12.2%, and the consumption time decreases by 74.6%. Specifically, the accuracy improvement in vegetated and clean air conditions outperforms that in arid and polluted conditions, with the most significant improvement in clean conditions, where the GCOS fraction increased by 22.9%. Moreover, the spatial distribution of fusion results in typical regions indicates that the introduction of the accuracy ranking matrix makes the AOD spatial variation smoother. These results demonstrate that introducing the accuracy ranking matrix can generate higher quality AOD distributions with improved efficiency, which is expected to guide the fusion of AOD products or other remote sensing products.

AB  - Extreme precipitation events have caused severe societal, economic, and environmental impacts through the disasters of floods, flash floods, and landslides. The coarse-resolution of satellite-derived precipitation data, however, makes it difficult to quantitatively capture certain fine-scale heavy rainfall processes. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of satellite-based precipitation extremes, a downscaling-calibration scheme based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost_DC) was proposed in this study, where the XGBoost algorithm was applied in both downscaling and calibration procedures. The performance of XGBoost_DC was evaluated with two other comparative methods, in which XGBoost was only used in either downscaling (XGBoost_Spline) or calibration (Spline_XGBoost) process. The results showed that: 1) XGBoost_DC achieved the best performance, as it obtained the highest accuracy and well reproduced the occurrence and the spatial distribution of precipitation during typhoon events; 2) XGBoost_DC could capture the spatial variations of the precipitation. Although Spline_XGBoost obtained results only slightly worse than the XGBoost_DC, it significantly underestimated the spatial variability; and 3) the model assessment between the XGBoost_DC and Spline_XGBoost illustrated the essential contribution of XGBoost algorithm in downscaling process, and improved our understanding of the capability of machine learning (ML) algorithm in reproducing spatial variance of precipitation. These findings imply that our proposed downscaling-calibration scheme can be applied for generating high-resolution and high-quality precipitation extremes during typhoon events, which would benefit water and flood management, as well as other various applications in hydrological and meteorological modeling.

TI  - A Coupled Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Multidimensional Information Change Detection Framework Method: A Case of the 1990-2020 Tianjin, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image time-series change detection methods have become an effective means of obtaining information on land cover change. However, the temporal, spectral, and spatial features and their derived features of land cover objects are of great importance for time-series change detection. The existing studies have made insufficient use of these features, which may affect the results of land cover change detection. In order to fully integrate the above features to portray and represent change information, this study proposes a coupled temporal-spectral-spatial multidimensional information change detection framework (TSSF) method. First, the derived index features are calculated to construct intra-annual temporal-spectral information to reduce the underutilization of spectral features. Second, the intra-annual temporal-spectral information is extended to the spatiotemporal domain by the simple noniterative clustering method and the SG filtering method to increase the exploitation of spatial features. Then, the value and shape-based dynamic time warping method and the change vector analysis in the posterior probability space method are employed to obtain change information from the spectral, index, and class probability perspectives. Finally, the change type in the change region is obtained from the class probability information of the change magnitude according to the Bayesian criterion. Tianjin City was used as the study area to explore the land cover change from 1990 to 2020. The results show that the TSSF method is feasible in expressing temporal-spectral-spatial change information compared with the existing methods and is conducive to the efficient acquisition and identification of change areas and change types.

TI  - Merging Microwave, Optical, and Reanalysis Data for 1 Km Daily Soil Moisture by Triple Collocation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatiotemporal resolution soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in optimized irrigation, agricultural droughts, and hydrometeorological model simulations. However, producing high-spatiotemporal seamless soil moisture products is challenging due to the inability of optical bands to penetrate clouds and the coarse spatiotemporal resolution of microwave and reanalysis products. To address these issues, this study proposed a framework for multi-source data merging based on the triple collocation (TC) method with an explicit physical mechanism, which was dedicated to generating seamless 1 km daily soil moisture products. Current merging techniques based on the TC method often lack seamless daily optical data input. To remedy this deficiency, our study performed a spatiotemporal reconstruction on MODIS LST and NDVI, and retrieved seamless daily optical soil moisture products. Then, the optical-derived sm(1), microwave-retrieved sm(2) (ESA CCI combined), and reanalysis sm(3) (CLDAS) were matched by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) method to eliminate bias, and their weights were determined by the TC method. Finally, the least squares algorithm and the significance judgment were adopted to complete the merging. Although the CLDAS soil moisture presented anomalies over several stations, our proposed method can detect and reduce this impact by minimizing its weight, which shows the robustness of the method. This framework was implemented in the Naqu region, and the results showed that the merged products captured the temporal variability of the SM and depicted spatial information in detail; the validation with the in situ measurement obtained an average ubRMSE of 0.046 m(3)/m(3). Additionally, this framework is transferrable to any area with measured sites for better agricultural and hydrological applications.

TI  - FPCI and SPCI Are Proposed to Distinguish the Frontal and Saturated Precipitation Systems Based on FY-4A
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared (IR) observations from geostationary satellites have been widely used in estimating the precipitation with high spatiotemporal resolutions. Currently, it is acknowledged that single-channel IR observations are capable to extract the properties of cloud tops, while are insufficient for deeper vertical information. However, based on developments of multispectral IR imagers onboard geostationary satellites, distinguishing different precipitation regions with different vertical structures becomes possible, which has not been fully explored yet. Therefore, combining FengYun-4A/advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (FY-4A/AGRI) and global precipitation measurement/dual-frequency precipitation radar (GPM/DPR), we innovatively proposed frontal precipitation cloud index (FPCI) and saturated precipitation cloud index (SPCI) for IR signals by exploiting the characteristic responses of channel combinations to different precipitation systems. It is proven that multispectral IR observations are capable of responding to certain precipitation systems with different vertical structures. Meanwhile, IR imagers onboard geostationary satellites have significant advantages on tracking developing processes of precipitation systems with high spatiotemporal resolutions than microwave detectors onboard low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. In addition, this study is beneficial for impelling IR precipitation estimation to consider more radiation-based physical theory, especially for FY-4A official precipitation product.

TI  - Estimating Near-Surface Concentrations of Major Air Pollutants From Space: A Universal Estimation Framework LAPSO
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Like many other countries, China is still facing severe air pollution issues after extensive efforts. The difficulties in deriving near-surface concentrations from satellite measurements restrict the application of remote sensing of large-scale surface air quality. Aiming at providing daily accurate nearsurface ail pollution estimates (PM2.5, PM10, O-3, NO2, SO2, and CO), we propose a robust estimation framework called learning air pollutants from satellite observations (LAPSO). The principle of LAPSO is to derive a nonlinear relationship between surface pollutant concentrations of interest and satellite observations with the aid of meteorological reanalyzes based on deep learning techniques. The LAPSO framework is superior to other algorithms due to its robust retrieval performance, independence from chemical transport models (CTMs), lower hardware requirements, and a user-friendly interface. The retrieval results of LAPSO were in good agreement with ground-level measurements according to extensive cross-validation at 1628 sites (R-2 > 0.8 in polluted areas and uncertainty << 5 mu g/m(3) for most pollutants) in China. The framework also showed a strong capability to capture the temporal variability of different air pollutants. By comparing with the estimation results from different satellite platforms, TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5P demonstrated marginally better performance for estimating PM2.5. Although the selection of satellite observations did not significantly affect the results of O-3 estimation, the number and spatial sampling density of in situ sites imposed large impacts on O-3 estimation performance. The success of LAPSO for estimating near-surface concentrations from satellite remote sensing at an enhanced spatiotemporal resolution is expected to serve the continuous and dynamical monitoring of regional and global air pollution.

TI  - Data Augmentation and Few-Shot Change Detection in Forest Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest remote sensing change detection provides an important technical support for forest management decisions and analysis of forest disturbance factors. However, lack of data in specialized fields leads to the detection accuracy-improved difficulty. In this study, a forest remote sensing change detection model in the context of few-shot learning is proposed. The proposed model achieves end-to-end change detection algorithm for forest scenes from two perspectives of data augmentation and updated few-shot algorithm. First, forest fragments images are jointly generated by using feature extraction network and generative adversarial network. Then, forest fragments are blended into the original change detection dataset by Poisson blending method to achieve effective augmentation. Furthermore, the end-to-end change detection network is also updated using a few-shot learning. In addition, Metalearning module is added to the slow feature analysis algorithm based on the multiattention mechanism to realize the detection effect improvements. The proposed model improves the F1 score from 86% to 91% on the two datasets. Moreover, it increases the F1 score by 6.52% on average.

TI  - Weakly Annotated Residential Area Segmentation Based on Attention Redistribution and Co-Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Residential area (RA) segmentation is of great significance in the remote-sensing (RS) field. Training the segmentation network with image-level weakly annotated data (WAD) has become a research hot spot due to the easy access to classification labels. The quality of class activation maps (CAMs) is crucial for obtaining accurate segmentation results. Limited to irregular shapes, tortuous boundaries, and greatly varied scales of targets in RS images, generating high-quality CAMs is still a great challenge. To solve these problems, a novel weakly annotated RA segmentation model based on attention redistribution and co-learning (ARC) is proposed in this letter. We develop aggregate-and-distribute-based feature coupling (ADFC) to achieve the redistribution of attention on channel and spatial dimensions, which deals with multilevel features at the same time and makes them fully embedded together. Such an arrangement can effectively capture the shape characteristic of targets and filter out complicated backgrounds. To mitigate the impact of ambiguous regions like surroundings of boundaries and potential scattered houses, a confusion co-learning (CCL) strategy is designed to jointly explore the class-specific features and refine the cross-class features through a two-stream classifier with sharing weights, which helps generate sharper edges and discover ignored targets. Experimental results on GeoEye-1, SPOT5, and Landsat8 datasets reveal that our proposal outperforms the competing methods by a large margin in both subjective and objective assessments.

TI  - UAV Flight Height Impacts on Wheat Biomass Estimation via Machine and Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is widely prevalent to estimate crop aboveground biomass (AGB). Nevertheless, limited knowledge of the UAV flight height (mainly characterized by different image numbers and spatial resolutions) influences the crop AGB estimation accuracy across diverse sensing datasets and machine-/deep-learning models. This article assessed the impacts of flight height and integration of multiscale sensing information on wheat AGB estimation. The multispectral UAV flight missions with 30, 60, 90, and 120 m heights were conducted at the wheat grain filling phase in 2018 and 2019. To estimate AGB, we used the UAV-based crop surface model (CSM), spectral, texture indices, and their combinations along with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN with AlexNet architecture), random forest, and support vector machine models. Results showed the CSM and textures exhibit sensitivity to flight height, with estimation accuracy declining by 48% and 41%, respectively, as the flight height increased from 30 to 120 m. Spectral indices displayed lesser sensitivity with accuracy decrease of 25%. Integrating data from different heights exhibited better performances in texture and spectral indices while reducing performance when CSM was input. The DCNN performed best particularly at high spatial image scales, whereas more sensitive to flight height, as the AGB estimation accuracy decreased by 30% and 47% from 30 to 120 m for machine learning and DCNN, respectively. Integrating texture and spectral information derived from images with moderate spatial resolutions (4-6 cm), and the integration of multiscale textures, are optimal for grain-filling wheat AGB estimation.

TI  - Multi-Temporal InSAR Deformation Monitoring Zongling Landslide Group in Guizhou Province Based on the Adaptive Network Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the influence of atmospheric phase delays and terrain fluctuation in complex mountainous areas, traditional PS-InSAR technology often fails to select enough measurement points (MPs) and loses effective MPs during phase unwrapping. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive network construction algorithm, which combines the permanent scatterer (PS) points with the distributed scatterer (DS) points. Firstly, to ensure the extraction quality of the DS points, the covariance matrix of DS points is estimated robustly. Secondly, based on the traditional Delaunay triangulation network, an adaptive network construction method is proposed, which can adaptively increase edge redundancy and network connectivity by considering the edge length, edge coherence, edge number, and spatial distribution. Finally, a total of 31 RADARSAT-2 SAR images that cover the Zongling landslide group in Guizhou Province were used to prove the effectiveness of proposed method. The results show that the quantity of available DS points can be increased by 23.6%, through the robust estimation of the covariance matrix. In addition, it is demonstrated that the proposed network construction algorithm can balance the number, distribution, and quality of edges in the dense and sparse areas of MPs adaptively. This adaptive network construction approach can maintain good connectivity and avoid losing effective MPs to the greatest extent, especially when the scattering points are far away from the reference points. In short, the proposed algorithm improves the number of effective MPs and accuracy of phase unwrapping.

TI  - An Innovative Scheme to Confront the Trade-Off Between Water Conservation and Heat Alleviation With Environmental Justice for Urban Sustainability: The Case of Phoenix, Arizona
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in warmer climate zones have experienced extreme heat and unbearable drought conditions due to climate change. Developing a practical and integrated framework to tackle the trade-off between land surface temperature (LST) reduction and water conservation is essential for heat mitigation and resilience planning. We developed a multi-objective framework of spatial optimization for priority areas that considers environmental justice. We identified the priority areas (i.e., residential districts, socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, hotspot regions, and opportunity areas) using ECOSTRESS-based LST, actual evapotranspiration (ETa, as a proxy to outdoor water use [OWU]), Landsat-based LST and ETa changes (2000-2020), and the evaporative stress index. The configuration of vegetation was spatially optimized to achieve the highest co-benefits by equally balancing both objectives. We found that LST decreased and OWU increased as the vegetation percentage rose from 25% to 45%. The trade-off between heat reduction and water conservation indicates that LST is not significantly reduced, as OWU reaches above the mid-level if we focus mainly on LST reduction. The associated green space configurations suggest that grass coverage gradually increases as tree coverage decreases slightly in unmanaged soil. Overall, hotspot regions have a higher potential to lower LST by consuming less water than other areas with the same percentage of new vegetation. Based on this perspective, we suggest that urban planners and city managers prioritize hotspot regions by considering environmental justice and co-benefits to ensure highly efficient LST amelioration and OWU conservation.

TI  - Soviet ideological propaganda in secondary schools Central Chernozem region in the early 30s of the XX century
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines various aspects of propaganda of Soviet ideas in secondary schools in the Central Chernozem region. The purpose of this work is to analyze practical measures taken in schools in the Central Black Earth region as part of the educational reform of the early 1930s, aimed at implementing the new requirements of the Communist authorities to organize ideological propaganda in Soviet schools. The source base of the research primarily includes materials from the state archive of socio-political history of the Voronezh region, and materials from the State archive of the Russian Federation and the Russian state archive of socio-political history are also used. Many sources are introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. The people's Commissariat of Education formulated the following ideological tasks of Soviet education: providing Communist education, developing students ' dialectical and materialistic views on nature and society, and strengthening the fight against anti-proletarian ideology. The paper focuses on the ideologies that are subsequently introduced into the academic programs of various school disciplines. The article shows that the main ideological load was placed on history and social science. Educational classes in Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Foreign Language, Nature Science also received an ideological content and had to contain elements of anti-religious education, propaganda of proletarian internationalism, heroization of the revolutionary past, praise of the party leaders, achievements and prospects of the Soviet system. The Communist education of Soviet students went beyond the acquisition of the school curriculum in certain disciplines. The Pioneer and Komsomol organizations with the school authorities organized participation of schoolchildren in such organized events as the celebration of the First of May, the anniversary of the October revolution, in meetings. These events broadcast formulas, cliches and images of official propaganda and carried an emotional load aimed at fixing value-semantic stereotypes corresponding to the tasks of Soviet ideological propaganda in the mind. The article the author analyzes the difficulties and shortcomings in the organization of Pioneer groups, socialist competition among students, and the work of children's self-government bodies. The paper deals with the forms of organized leisure of Soviet schoolchildren, which are rich in ideological content: the activities of clubs, organization of campings, trips to the libraries. As a result, the paper concludes, that the Soviet propaganda was largely consonant with the worldview of Soviet youth, who did not have the experience and sufficient knowledge to critically comprehend Marxist ideology and Soviet reality. Despite the presence of anti-Communist sentiments and people who adhere to non-Soviet life practices, ideological propaganda in Soviet schools played a major role in the formation of a loyal and patriotic majority.

Special attention is paid not only to the training course called "Aesthetics", but to all training sessions where aesthetic knowledge is in demand. The understanding inherent in the works of Nikolai I. Kiyashchenko and important for scientific research devoted not only to art as a well-known sphere of aesthetic activity, but also to research devoted to man, his moral sphere and socio-cultural activity is noted. It is emphasized that aesthetics is of crucial importance for modern educational process at all its levels, from school to higher education, from postgraduate studies to scientific studies of experienced scientists. This follows from the idea that aesthetics is a broad field of human intellectual activity. We present the efforts of Nikolai I. Kiyashchenko to unite researchers (at the level of conferences, joint scientific publications, work on grants). The attention of Nikolai I. Kiyashchenko, teacher, mentor in a broad sense, to young researchers and their works is particularly noted. The fact that Kiyashchenko, an aesthetician, was also an educator is specifically evaluated, in connection with which the unique publication "Aesthetics of Life" is analyzed. It was intended for school-children and teachers who can work with teenagers. Problematization of aesthetic knowledge and educational pathos turn the works of Nikolai I. Kiyashchenko into a solid corpus, aesthetically significant and relevant.

TI  - Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Images and Lightweight U-Nets Trained on Synthesized Events
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods cause loss of lives and multibillion dollar damages every year. When these events strike, automated tools using remote sensing for quick mapping of the affected areas are critical for planning rescue activities and assessing impact. The most recent techniques to map floods are based on semantic segmentation and deep learning, which require large datasets and ground truth for training, which are difficult to get. To overcome this challenge, we propose an effective method for synthesizing patches of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images containing open-land flooded areas. With bitemporal image acquisitions, we replace portions of land areas in the second acquisition with water pixels borrowed from permanent water bodies. Spatial patterns derived from elevation data help guide the process. With this approach, we build a large dataset with pre-and post event Sentinel-1-based VH-polarized radar intensity images to train deep neural networks to map real-life floods. In a case study, we use an established U-Net architecture and show that a model version with less than 2% of the number of original parameters achieves almost identical flood detection accuracy. This allows for faster processing and is a clear advantage from an operational perspective. For comparison, we provide empirical segmentation results of four flood cases. F1 scores agree between 0.80 and 0.90 when compared with reference flood maps from the Copernicus service. This confirms that the approach is valuable for mapping areas affected by floods, e.g., during or immediately after catastrophic events, even in areas that were not included during model training.

TI  - A New Semisupervised Method for Detecting Semantic Changes in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing availability of high-quality remote sensing imagery has led to increased interest in semantic change detection (SCD). Supervised methods for this task have shown significant performance improvements, but acquiring labeled data is often challenging and expensive. To confront this challenge, we propose a semisupervised approach for SCD in remote sensing images using an innovative teacher-student model. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the teacher model and a fusion design combining CNN and vision transformer in the student model, with the rationale that the CNN requires fewer training samples compared with vision transformer, and fusion network allows us to leverage the advantages of both. To further enhance the model's performance, we propose a novel data augmentation approach by interchanging bitemporal images as well as their labels. The principle for that is the change from one moment to another and vice versa are two different changes and can, therefore, be used to augment the training dataset. More importantly, this method does not reduce its reliability, because no noise is brought to the remote sensing images. By adopting this approach, we are able to better utilize the small labeled dataset to increase the precision of the model while maintaining the robustness. According to the experimental results, the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and achieves an improvement compared with bi-temporal semantic reasoning network (Bi-SRNet) in mean intersection over union (mIoU)/separated kappa (SeK)/overall accuracy (OA) of 3.25/4.42/1.78, 6.37/11.72/2.91 on the SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets, respectively.

TI  - SPATIAL RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT OF THE LAND SURFACE THERMAL FIELD IMAGERY BASED ON MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS ON MULTISPECTRAL DATA FROM VARIOUS SPACE SYSTEMS
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The methodology has been developed for enhancing the spatial resolution of the land surface thermal field satellite imagery based on the following steps: coupling images in the visible, thermal, and radar ranges into the single multispectral data product; constructing regression models of the images' relationship; performing the linear regression of the pseudo-thermal product with enhanced spatial resolution from the visible and radar ranges data. The methodology is implemented on the Google Earth Engine open cloud platform using the Earth Engine API and the software scripts created in the JavaScript language with the processing of multispectral image col-lections of various space systems at specified time intervals. The possibility of practical synthesis of the pseudo-thermal image with an enhanced spatial resolution of 10 m based on the thermal image with the resolution of 100 m and the multispectral composite with the layers' resolution of 10 m and 30 m is shown. The technology has been developed for synthesis and calibration of the land surface temperature product with enhanced spatial resolution and daily data providing rate based on the brightness temperature product in the B10 band of Landsat 8 and linear regres-sion on the MODIS, ASTER, and Sentinel 1 products with daily to moderate data providing rates. The software in JavaScript has been developed, and technology has been implemented in the interactive web service form with open access on the Google Earth Engine Apps cloud platform. The final data product provides the satisfactory relative root mean square error of the brightness temperature recovery of not more than 6 % according to the reference cross-calibration data of the B10 Landsat 8 band in the moderate thermal field (up to 100 degrees C). The relative root mean square errors of the synthesized data according to the reference data on high-temperature sites (fire, hot lava) up to 28 % are due to the fact that the synthesized product contains information from high-temperature spectral bands (B07-B09 from ASTER), while the reference product (B10 from Landsat 8) does not contain such information. Technology implementation examples show that cross-calibration of the synthesized product can be performed during the year from March to October according to reference thermal images of natural or artificial objects. Objects selected for calibration must have stable thermal characteristics at the time of the satellite flight during the data acquisition period.

AB  - The city of Carcassonne in the south of France hopes to obtain UNESCO World Heritage certification for its sentinel mountain castles, better known as Les Chateaux Cathares. Built in the 13(th) century, the castles are an exceptional example of the military architecture and construction of the time. The Association Mission Patrimoine Mondial (AMPM) was created to manage the process for the city. As a part of the certification process, it needed to provide 3D models that could identify known archaeological remains and possibly detect new ones for future exploration to ensure that they are all protected by the UNESCO certification. L'Avion Jaune was mandated to fly the mission using the YellowScan Explorer Lidar solution.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrates remote sensing data via Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and satellite gravity data to detect geologic structurs at Borena and the surrounding regions in the Southern Main Ethiopia Rift (SMER). Shading from different sun azimuths with 45-degree intervals and the tilt angle method was used to map lineaments and detect edges of anomalies from the DEM and gravity data, respectively. The area's geology comprises quaternary alluvial and eluvial sediments , pre-rift and rift volcanic rock , and Precambrian banded gneiss. The Ririba, Mega and Chew Bahir rift systems make the main structural fabric of the area. About 793 lineaments from DEM data and 441 from gravity data were outlined, and their orientations were analyzed using rose diagrams. These are trending dominantly in NW to SE and N to S directions. From the gravity data analysis, the depth of anomalies ranges from 300 m to more than 7 km below the ground, with most of the lineaments being at shallow depth. The results obtained agree with the main tectonic features found in the study area. The integration of remote sensing data has facilitated delineating structural features in studying the regional geology of the large area.

TI  - Comparison of spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 images to map plastic covered greenhouses through an object-based approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important challenges of agriculture today is increasing its productivity gains, while controlling its environmental footprint. Because of that plastic covered greenhouses (PCG) mapping via remote sensing is receiving a great attention throughout this century. In this study, a fair comparison was carried out in four PCG study areas around the world to test 14 spectral indices mainly focused on the detection of plastic. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first research that fairly compares all these spectral indices in such variable number of study sites. The applied OBIA approach was based on the combined use of very high-resolution satellite data (Deimos-2 pansharpened images) to address the segmentation process and Sentinel-2 time series to compute the spectral indices. When dealing with Sentinel-2 single images, the Plastic GreenHouse Index (PGHI) stood out among all the indices tested in the study areas dedicated to the cultivation of vegetables, such as the cases of Almeria (Spain), Agadir (Morocco) and Antalya (Turkey). Better Overall Accuracy (OA) values of 94.09%, 92.27%, 92.77% and 92.17% were achieved for Almeria, Agadir, Bari and Antalya study sites, respectively, when using statistical seasonal spectral indices based on Sentinel-2 time series, being the maximum and mean values of PGHI (MAX (PGHI) and MEAN (PGHI)) the best ranked. Meanwhile, the PCG area of Bari (Italy), with a monoculture in vineyards, presented the worst and most irregular results.

TI  - Exploring surface water as a transmission medium of avian influenza viruses - systematic infection studies in mallards
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are an abundant anseriform migratory wild bird species worldwide and an important reservoir for the maintenance of low pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIV). They have also been implicated in the spread of high pathogenicity (HP) AIV after spill-over events from HPAIV-infected poultry. The spread of HPAIV within wild water bird populations may lead to viral contamination of natural habitats. The role of small shallow water bodies as a transmission medium of AIV among mallards is investigated here in three experimental settings. (i) Delayed onset but rapid progression of infection seeded by two mallards inoculated with either LP or HP AIV to each eight sentinel mallards was observed in groups with access to a small 100 L water pool. In contrast, groups with a bell drinker as the sole source of drinking water showed a rapid onset but lengthened course of infection. (ii) HPAIV infection also set off when virus was dispersed in the water pool; titres as low as 10(2) TCID50 L-1 (translating to 0.1 TCID50 mL(-1)) proved to be sufficient. (iii) Substantial loads of viral RNA (and infectivity) were also found on the surface of the birds' breast plumage. "Unloading" of virus infectivity from contaminated plumage into water bodies may be an efficient mechanism of virus spread by infected mallards. However, transposure of HPAIV via the plumage of an uninfected mallard failed. We conclude, surface water in small shallow water bodies may play an important role as a mediator of AIV infection of aquatic wild birds.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of remote sensing and traditional based drought monitoring indices at global and regional scale
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Review
AB  - This study reports a comprehensive review on drought indices used in monitoring meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socio-economic drought. Drought indices have been introduced as an important approach to quantitative and qualitative calculations of drought's severity and impact. There were 111 drought indices reviewed in this study, which fall into two categories: traditional (location-specific/model) and remote sensing (RS). Out of 111 indices, 44 belong to the traditional indices and 67 belong to the RS section. This study shows that meteorological drought monitoring has the highest number (22) of traditional indices, about 20% overall, while the lowest (7) agricultural drought monitoring is 6.3%. The specialty is that when considering remote sensing-based drought indices, 90% are used for agricultural drought monitoring and 10% for hydrological and meteorological drought monitoring. However, the study found that advances in satellite technology have accelerated the design of new drought indices and that replacing traditional location-specific data with satellite observation makes it easier to calculate more spatial distribution and resolution.

TI  - Detection of grassland mowing frequency using time series of vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Management intensity deeply influences meadow structure and functioning, therefore affecting grassland ecosystem services. Conservation and management measures, including European Common Agricultural Policy subsidies, should therefore be based on updated and publicly available data about management intensity. The mowing frequency is a crucial trait to describe meadows management intensity, but the potential of using vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 imagery for its retrieval has not been fully exploited. In this work we developed on the Google Earth Engine platform a four-phases algorithm to identify mowing frequency, including i) vegetation index time-series computing, ii) smoothing and resampling, iii) mowing detection, and iv) majority analysis. Mowing frequency during 2020 of 240 ha of grassland fields in the Italian Alps was used for algorithm optimization and evaluation. Six vegetation indexes (EVI, GVMI, MTCI, NDII, NDVI, RENDVI783.740) were tested as input to the proposed algorithm. The Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) showed the best performance, resulting in mean absolute error of 0.07 and 93% overall accuracy on average at the four sites used for optimization, at pixel resolution. A slightly lower accuracy (mean absolute error = 0.10, overall accuracy = 90%) was obtained aggregating the maps to management parcels. The algorithm showed a good generalization ability, with a similar performance between global and local optimization and an average mean absolute error of 0.12 and an overall accuracy of 89% on average on the sites not used for parameters optimization. The lowest accuracies occurred in intensively managed grasslands surveyed by one satellite orbit only. This study demonstrates the suitability of the proposed algorithm to monitor very fragmented grasslands in complex mountain ecosystems. Google Earth Engine was used to develop the model and will enable researchers, agencies and practitioners to easily and quickly apply the code to map grassland mowing frequency for extensive grasslands protection and conservation, for mowing event verification, or for forage system characterization.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud computing facilities can provide crucial computing support for processing the time series of satellite data and exploiting their spatio-temporal information content. However, dedicated efforts are still required to develop workflows, executable on cloud-based platforms, for ingesting the satellite data, performing the targeted processes, and generating the desired products. In this study, an operational workflow is proposed, based on monthly Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) anomaly, and implemented in cloud-based online Virtual Earth Laboratory (VLab) platform, as a demonstration, to monitor European agricultural water stress. To this end, daily time-series of actual and reference evapotranspiration (ETa and ET0), from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor, were used to execute the proposed workflow successfully on VLab. The execution of the workflow resulted in obtaining one decade (2011-2020) of European monthly agricultural water stress maps at 0.04 spatial resolution and corresponding stress reports for each country. To support open science, all the workflow outputs are stored in GeoServer, documented in GeoNetwork, and made available through MapStore. This enables creating a dashboard for better visualization of the results for end-users. The results from this study demonstrate the capability of VLab platform for water stress detection from time series of SEVIRI-ET data.

TI  - Seasonal and diurnal surface urban heat islands in China: an investigation of driving factors with three-dimensional urban morphological parameters
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat island (SUHI) can considerably influence the urban environment and the quality of life. It is vital to examine how underlying surface properties impact seasonal and diurnal SUHIs. However, the influence of three-dimensional (3D) urban morphological parameters (UMPs) on SUHIs has not been thoroughly studied under varying climatic settings. To fill this knowledge gap, the present study investigated seasonal and diurnal changes in SUHI intensities (Delta T) in 208 cities in China from 2014 to 2016 using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature products. In addition, the influence of potential factors in urban surface energy balance, including two-dimensional (2D) and 3D UMPs, socio-economic indices, urban greening, and surface albedo, on seasonal and diurnal Delta T were assessed under different climatic settings and with different city sizes using the method of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Results show that negative summer daytime Delta T was observed in some cities under dry climates. Generally, in summer, the Delta T during daytime was higher than at nighttime. The 3D UMPs (i.e. building height and volume) yielded more decisive influences on Delta T than 2D UMP (i.e. building coverage). This is particularly true for the summer diurnal cycle and under dry climatic settings. Building height was found to be negatively correlated with surface temperatures, while building volume was positively correlated. Additionally, the 3D UMPs yielded more influences on winter Delta T than summer Delta T. The capability of vegetation to regulate Delta T was more potent in dry climates than in wet climates and in small cities than in large cities. Varying climates and city sizes can modify the significance of the 2D and 3D UMPs on the urban surface energy balance, suggesting that urban thermal mitigation should consider climate background and population size.

TI  - Characterizing surface water changes across the Tibetan Plateau based on Landsat time series and LandTrendr algorithm
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has experienced dramatic climate change, which influence atmospheric and hydrological cycles. The understanding of surface water dynamics is essential to further investigate the water balance and the hydrologic cycle in this region. In this study, we used all available Landsat Surface Reflectance imagery that generated Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) overlapped the TP in time-series for 1996-2019. We detected the annual changes in surface water using the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and examined impact factors on surface water area dynamics. During 1996-2019, the area of 17,065 km(2) had changed from land to water body and 3511 km(2) had changed from water to land in the entire TP. The drivers of surface water change are spatially heterogeneous. Precipitation is a main cause of surface water variability in the central, northern and eastern parts of the TP. Meanwhile, temperature is the dominant factor affecting the western and southern parts of the TP. Our results proved that LandTrendr could be applied to monitor surface water changes over larger spatial and temporal scales. In conclusion, our study focus on understanding the process of climate change and the hydrological cycle across the TP.

TI  - Remote sensing-based deformation monitoring of pagodas at the Bagan cultural heritage site, Myanmar
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a World Cultural Heritage site with sacred landscape featuring an exceptional range of Buddhist art and architecture, much attention has been focused on the sustainable development of Bagan (Myanmar). Particularly, the monitoring of landscape surface subsidence and monument instability is of great importance to the protection and development planning of the Bagan heritage site. In this study, we applied high resolution TerraSAR-X imagery acquired from 2019 to 2020 for deformation monitoring based on the small baseline subset (SBAS) and persistent scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) approaches. We identified several hotspots and pagodas with displacement anomalies linked to land cover change and previous earthquakes. The cross comparison between SBAS and PSInSAR and the precision of height estimates derived by PSInSAR indicated a millimetric precision of the derived deformation products. The combination of the two multi-temporal SAR interferometry approaches satisfies the two-scale monitoring requirements from landscapes to monuments, particularly for large-scale World Heritage sites. The non-contact monitoring method has potential when traditional methods using field accessibility and surveillance are constrained.

TI  - Analysis of spatial-temporal evolution of landscape patterns in ancient large city-sites based on multi-temporal Landsat imagery: a case study of the Zhouyuan site region in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study takes the Zhouyuan site region, which is the most representative Western Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC-771BC) large city-site in China, as an example. Based on the interpretation results of satellite remote sensing images from 1973 to 2021, the paper systematically analyzed the evolution of landscape patterns in the Zhouyuan site region spanning for about 50 years using 4 methods, including land use classification, land use transfer matrix, landscape pattern distribution gravity center model and landscape pattern index. Additionally, the results show that nowadays Zhouyuan site is still in a period of accelerated invasion and destruction by natural and human factors, which indicates that the protection of the Zhouyuan site has been inadequate or even unsuccessful for a long time. For the purpose of making more accurate and better protection of the Zhouyuan site, four challenges and six protection recommendations have been put forward. Based on remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS), this paper contributed a method combining 4 models to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of landscape pattern of ancient large city-sites, in order to provide more basis for the formulation of cultural relic protection strategies.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of crop irrigation dynamics in Central Italy through the use of MODIS NDVI data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent study has proposed and tested a semi-empirical method to estimate crop irrigation based on a water balance logic and Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) NDVI imagery. The current paper aims at extending the same approach to the analysis of the main irrigation patterns occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) during the 2000-2019 period. This operation was made possible by feeding the irrigation water (IW) estimation method with 250-m spatial resolution Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images. The results of this operation were first assessed versus various reference datasets available for the region; next, the annual maps of IW estimated for the 20 study years were analyzed at province scale in conjunction with relevant agricultural statistics. The use of MODIS in place of MSI images reduces the IW estimation accuracy irregularly at local scale, depending on the size and spatial arrangement of irrigated and non-irrigated fields; the reduction in accuracy is, however, marginal over relatively large areas. Irrigated crops are decreasing throughout most Tuscany provinces, while they are increasing in the most southern and driest province. The possible reasons and implications of these findings are finally discussed in relation to the main environmental issues affecting the region.

TI  - Infection and transmission of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha variant in pregnant white-tailed deer
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 was first reported circulating in human populations in December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. Recent history involving SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks have demonstrated the significant role of intermediate hosts in viral maintenance and transmission. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species has been demonstrated, and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer (WTD) are amongst the most abundant and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the US. Recently, WTD fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult WTD. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the alpha variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 through co-infection of WTD. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult WTD are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in WTD, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, and from the genome of virus present in tissues of principal infected deer, fetuses and contact animals.

TI  - Citizen science supporting agricultural monitoring with hundreds of low-cost sensors in comparison to remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ever-increasing importance of irrigation monitoring and water-use optimization in agriculture calls for new solutions for a more complete understanding of the plant growth dynamic and the agricultural water cycle. In this study, the fitness for use of the Flower Power low-cost sensors, not designed for scientific applications, is evaluated in an integrated agricultural monitoring context in contrast to freely available satellite information from Landsat 8, Sentinel 1 and 2. Measurements of air temperature, solar radiation, leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture are considered. 456 sensors have been deployed in the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium (Italy) as part of the GROW Observatory project with local farmers collaborating as citizen scientists to either deploy these sensors, monitor the environmental variables and control irrigation management. The main results are: (i) positive agreement between Flower Power sensors and high-quality professional stations for measurements of meteorological variables (5.6 degrees C RMSE for Air Temperature); (ii) acceptable estimates of crops LAI (RMSE = 0.55 m(2) m(-2)) and mixed ones of Surface Soil Moisture (m = 0.75, R-2 = 0.23) from Flower Power sensors in respect to different satellite data; (iii) potentiality of these sensors combined with remote sensing in providing suitable tools for irrigation management.

TI  - Analyzing the interactions among multiple ecosystem services in a rural mining region in Central Appalachians
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the interactions among a set of ecosystem services (ES) and derived ES bundles in the Headwaters of Coal River West Virginia (WV), in the Central Appalachians, an area historically characterized by surface mining and coal extraction. ES were modeled using the InVEST system, while a custom model was used to link water quality to freshwater ES, deriving information at two different spatial scales based on hydrologic units. High-resolution remote sensing data (1-2 m resolution) were used to incorporate historical information from land-cover (LC) transitions since 1976 to differentiate reclamation processes and characterize the forest class. Consistent ES tradeoffs were confirmed in areas characterized by surface mining processes that reported significant losses of carbon sequestration, habitat quality , and freshwater ES. The interaction of complex anthropogenic processes within the specific landscape led to the definition of different ES bundles, characterized not only by coal mining processes but also by the distribution of settlements and developed areas. The utilization of relatively small hydrologic catchments (1-25 km(2)), the comparison with a more extensive set of spatial units, and the inclusion of high-resolution data with multiple LC classes that included historical information, allowed the authors to infer knowledge about the interactions between ES changes and their drivers in the study area. The results can be used to implement conservation, as well as development-restoration strategies, by including ES assessments to promote a more sustainable land management approach in the rural-mining region of Central Appalachians and support future alternatives to extractive economies.

TI  - Interpretation and sensitivity analysis of the InSAR line of sight displacements in landslide measurements
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are major geological hazards and frequently occur in mountainous areas with steep slopes, often causing significant loss. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been widely used in landslide measurement over the last three decades. However, InSAR only can measure one-dimensional displacements (i.e. those in the radar's line of sight (LOS) direction), resulting in the uncertainty between LOS displacement and the real slope displacement. In this paper, based on ascending and descending data from Sentinel-1 satellite, a wide-area potential landslide early identification was carried out using SBAS-InSAR in the whole of Mao County, a mountainous area in western Sichuan (China), with a total of 41 potential landslides successfully detected. Based on the quantitative analysis, the results show that the InSAR LOS measurement values are slope aspect and gradient-dependent. Finally, we innovatively derived a LOS displacement sensitivity map of InSAR in landslide measurement, revealing the relationship between LOS displacement, real displacements on slopes with arbitrary aspects and gradients, and SAR geometric distortion. This is a generalized finding useful for any slopes. It provides theoretical support to acquire and understand the real slope displacement from InSAR landslide measurement, which is vital to assist in correctly interpreting LOS displacement and carrying out subsequent quantitative geological engineering analysis.

TI  - Integrated use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and open-source machine learning algorithms for land cover mapping in a Mediterranean region
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to develop a supervised classification integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S2) data for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping in a heterogeneous Mediterranean forest area. The time-series of each SAR and optical bands, three optical indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI; normalized burn ratio, NBR; normalized difference red-edge index, NDRE), and two SAR indices (radar vegetation index, RVI; radar forest degradation index, RFDI), constituted the dataset. The coherence information from SAR interferometry (InSAR) analysis and three optical biophysical variables (leaf area index, LAI; fraction of green vegetation cover, fCOVER; fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fAPAR) of the single final month of the time-series were added to exploit their correlation with the canopy structure and improve the classification. The random forests (RF) algorithm was used to train and classify the final dataset, and an exhaustive grid search analysis was applied to set the optimal hyperparameters. The overall accuracy reached an F-score(M) of 90.33% and the integration of SAR improved it by 2.53% compared to that obtained using only optical data. The whole process was performed using freely available data and open-source software and libraries (SNAP, Google Earth Engine, Scikit-Learn) executed in Python-script language.

TI  - Regional-scale burned area mapping in Mediterranean regions based on the multitemporal composite integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fires are among the main factors affecting the surrounding territory in terms of ecological and socioeconomic changes at different temporal and spatial scales. In the Mediterranean environment, although fire can positively influence some bio-physical dynamics of habitats, it acts as a pressing disturbance on ecosystems when the severity, spatial scale, and/or frequency are high, thereby determining their degradation. Therefore, knowing and mapping the accurate quantitative spatial distribution of all areas affected by fire during an entire high-frequency fire season and on a relatively large scale (regional/national scale) is an essential step to initialize the numerous subsequent effect monitoring analyses that can be carried out. This work proposes a reliable and open-access workflow to map burned areas on regional and national scales during the entire fire season. To achieve this, we integrated optical (Sentinel-2, S2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1, S1) free high spatial and temporal resolution data into a multitemporal composite criterion. Open-source software and Python-based libraries were used to develop the workflow. In particular, the second-lowest near infra-red (NIR) image composite (secMinNIR) criterion, based on the retrieval of the second minimum values that the NIR values reached in each pixel during the entire time frame considered, was applied to cloud-free S2 imagery to optimize the separability between burned and unburned areas. Subsequently, a second temporal composite criterion was developed and applied to the S1 time series, relying on the SAR capacity to detect vegetation fire-induced structural and humidity changes. It was based on retrieving the S1 pixel value of the first next (or the same) date to the corresponding date of the pixel value previously found by secMinNIR. The burned area map was created using an object-based geographic analysis (GEOBIA) process, using two optical and SAR composite images as input layers. The large-scale mean-shift (LSMS) algorithm was employed to segment the image, while the random forest (RF) classifier was the machine-learning model used to perform supervised classification. GEOBIA-based burned area classification was also performed using only the optical composite. The resulting accuracy values were compared using the precision (p), recall (r), and F-score accuracy metrics. The classification achieved high accuracy levels (F-score value greater than 0.9) in both cases (S1+ S2, 0.956; S2, 0.914), highlighting the increased effectiveness of this approach in detecting burned areas, heterogeneous in terms of amplitude, and affected site-specific characteristics that occurred during the fire season. Although the use of only optical data is sufficient to map the fire-affected areas early, some commission errors, represented by small regions scattered over the entire study area, remain, proving that the integration of SAR data improves the quality of the obtained results.

TI  - AutoML for estimating grass height from ETM plus /OLI data from field measurements at a nature reserve
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) is now a standard tool used for grassland monitoring thanks to the availability of data at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The approaches to monitor grasslands often rely on the use of vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI) and empirical models trained on field data collected in tandem with the RS data. The best combination of models and features is often found by ad-hoc experimentation by the expert. This "classic" approach does not necessarily result in the best possible model. Automatic machine learning (AutoML) allows to automate this procedure by identifying the best possible pipeline in a data-driven manner. This study assesses the applicability of two distinct AutoML algorithms - AutoSklearn and AutoGluon - to monitor grass height from RS data and to systematically compare them to "classic" RS approaches. Grass height was estimated from Landsat ETM+ and OLI for a well-known conservation area as a case study. The "classic" RS approach emulated all possible ad hoc decisions by comparing all combinations of bands and vegetation indices against a naive use of the AutoML systems. While model selection and optimization are automated within AutoML models, for the "classic" RS approach, we used Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. We found that AutoML methods outperformed "classic" methods with the test error varying between similar to 1.73 cm +/- 0.02 and similar to 1.78 cm +/- 0.03 while for the "classic" methods it varied between similar to 1.84 cm +/- 0.03 and similar to 2.81 cm +/- 0.02. In the case of the "classic" methods, our exhaustive exploration of the possible feature combinations showed that while vegetation indices were always selected for the best models, which index got selected depended on the algorithm. The performance of AutoML compared to "classic" RS approaches clearly demonstrates the ability of these methods to quickly and effectively identify high-performing models. However, as this work focused on a single case-study, the results cannot be directly generalized to other study areas. Nevertheless, it provided a number of insights into future research opportunities to improve the use of AutoML in RS.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon stocks in the forest lands of Dominican Republic
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in lands covered by tropical forests is important to understand the relationship and dynamics of SOC in this type of ecosystem. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to map SOC stocks of topsoil (0-15 cm) in forest lands of the Dominican Republic. The methodology was developed using geospatial datasets available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform combined with a set of 268 soil samples. Twenty environmental covariates were analyzed, including climate, topography, and vegetation. The results indicate that Model A (combining all 20 covariates) was only marginally better than Model B (combining topographic and climatic covariates), and Model C (only combining multispectral remote sensing data derived from Landsat 8 OLI images). Model A and Model B yielded SOC mean values of 110.35 and 110.87 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Model A reported the lowest prediction error and uncertainty with an R-2 of 0.83, an RMSE of 35.02 Mg C ha(-1). There was a strong dependence of SOC stocks on multispectral remote sensing data. Therefore, multispectral remote sensing proved accurate to map SOC stocks in forest ecosystems in the region.

TI  - Satellite thermographies as an essential tool for the identification of cold air pools: an example from SE Spain
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The processes involved in the formation of nocturnal temperature inversions (NTIs) are of great relevance throughout the year, notably influencing the surface distribution of minimum temperatures during nights of atmospheric stability. The low density of surface meteorological stations in the study area motivated the use of thermographies for the mapping and identification of cold air pools CAPs. Thermal distribution during stable nights leads to the formation of CAPs in valley areas and depressed areas, and in areas with warmer air (WAM) in orographically complex areas. The thermographies carried out with satellite products from AQUA and SUOMI-NPP (MODIS and VIIRS LST) represent the only tool capable of fully radiographing the territory under study, thus overcoming the limitations in the interpolation of minimum surface temperatures. The main objective of the research was, therefore, to value thermography as an important tool in the identification of CAPs. The products used were subjected to statistical validation with the surface temperatures recorded in meteorological observatories (R-2 0.87/0.88 and Bias -1.2/-1.3) with a new objective of making thermal distribution maps in nocturnal stability processes horizontal ellipsis

TI  - Evaluation water scarcity based on GIS estimation and climate-change effects: A case study of Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to evaluate water scarcity in Thi-Qar governorate, Iraq, based on GIS estimation, environmental data, climate-change effects, and detection of the changes in marshes over the last three decades (1991-2021). The methodology process included collecting and analysing the related data sets such as water quality indicators, surface water quantity, climatic data, and Landsat's images. GIS-based data and spatial data were acquired from the USGS website. Arc GIS 10.4.1 software was used to create a hydrological analysis. The results showed that generally, in Iraq, the annual volume of water available per person is 1,390.95 m(3)/cap/year, which is lower than the threshold for water scarcity (1700 m(3)/cap/year). The average daily potable water per person in Thi-Qar governorate was 284 L/cap/day, lower than the general average daily potable water per person of Iraq (340 L/cap/day). Meanwhile, 6% of the months along 1998-2018 did not meet the water demands. Water quality tests exhibited some high amounts of pollutants in drinking water, e.g., biological pollution was recorded in 55% of the total number of annual samples. Landsat's images illustrated a high variation in water areas of marshes over the selected period, whereas the highest marshes area was 1548.21 km(2) in 1991 compared to the lowest area, 65.45 km(2) found in 1999. To sum up, the research outcomes revealed that the study area faced a serious water scarcity, which had a negative impact on the local people. Also, this research offered a scientific view for the decision-makers to mitigate and manage the water scarcity problem.

TI  - Evaluation of the relationships and uncertainties of airborne and ground-based sea ice surface temperature measurements against remotely sensed temperature records
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice surface temperature (IST) is an important indicator of environmental changes in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, the relative performance of four mainstream IST records, i.e. airborne IST, infrared radiometer measured IST (IR IST), longwave radiation derived IST (LWR IST), and snow and ice mass balance array buoy derived IST (Buoy IST), were evaluated against the MODIS IST product. Bias, standard deviation (STD), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the data quality. Results revealed that airborne IST had the best accuracy, which was 0.21 K colder than MODIS IST, with STD of 1.46 K and RMSE of 1.47 K. Ground-based ISTs were biased with each other but all warmer than the MODIS IST. The IR IST had the best overall accuracy (bias = 0.55 K; STD = 1.52 K; RMSE = 1.61 K), while the LWR IST was the noisiest measurement with the largest outlier data percent. Besides, co-located IR and LWR ISTs were more consistent than any type of evaluated IST against MODIS IST (correlation coefficient = 0.99). Airborne and IR ISTs are thus the premier choice for monitoring the rapidly changing Arctic sea ice, together with satellite observations.

TI  - Multitemporal impervious surface estimation via an optimized stable/change pixel detection approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques have proved its efficacy for the impervious surface mapping, which is a significant indicator of urbanization process and environmental status. However, systematic and random errors in the existing methods still impact the reliability of subpixel impervious surface estimation, generating compounded errors when conducting multitemporal monitoring. The compounded errors of the conventional methods often significantly impact the temporal consistency of the results. In this study, a novel method based on a straightforward pixel change detection approach was put forward to improve the estimation of multitemporal impervious surface area. Two experimental areas located in Rome in Italy and Shenzhen in China were chosen to testify the generality of the proposed method to estimate different types of impervious surfaces worldwide. By reducing the compounded errors, the proposed method demonstrated its efficiency in achieving higher accuracy in both study areas without involving extensive data sources and intensive manual tasks. Compared with the conventional classification and regression tree algorithm, the overall mean average error and root mean square error of this study declined by more than 15.55% and 8.63%, respectively, and R-2 increased from approximately 0.93 to 0.96. The proposed method also drastically reduced the standard deviation of the multitemporal percent ISA of the stable pixels. The accurate change estimation of percent ISA has been a fundamental but challenging issue associated with monitoring and understanding the urban environment. Therefore, our proposed method, with its improved ability to estimate impervious surface change both spatially and temporally, can provide accurate information required for urban environment research.

TI  - Can time-series Sentinel images be used to properly identify wetland plant communities?
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the distribution of wetland plant communities is critical to biodiversity conservation and wetland habitat sustainable management, especially for migratory birds. However, limited road accessibility and low spectral discriminability make the mapping of wetland plant communities inadequate for wetland health assessment, necessitating the improvement of classification methods. In this study, we proposed a random forest classifier that combined multi-source remote sensing features for wetland plant community classification and evaluated this method for the Momoge Ramsar wetland site (MRWS) in China. The major result of this work was that the phenological and time-series features based on Sentinel-2 images were the most valuable discriminators for wetland plant community classification in the MRWS. The SAR_sum extracted from Sentinel-1 images also had high importance for classification. Moreover, the spatial pattern of different wetland plant communities was revealed, and the resultant classification map had a high overall accuracy (91.3%) and Kappa coefficient (0.90). And the six important features prompted the classification accuracy to reach 84.8%. In 2020, the total coverage area of natural wetland plant communities in MRWS reached 628.5 km(2) (42.1%), of which Carex meyeriana distributed the most widely, followed by Suaeda glauca, Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triquater. The findings of this study can provide scientific decision-making support for the protection and management of migratory birds and plants in the MRWS. The proposed method employed freely available Sentinel 1/2 satellite images and fully automated programs on Google Earth Engine, and has guiding significance for large-scale and long-time-series wetland classification.

TI  - Automated classification of A-DInSAR-based ground deformation by using random forest
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wide-area ground motion monitoring is nowadays achievable via advanced Differential Interferometry SAR (A-DInSAR) techniques which benefit from the availability of large sets of Copernicus Sentinel-1 images. However, it is of primary importance to implement automated solutions aimed at performing integrated analysis of large amounts of interferometric data. To effectively detect high-displacement areas and classify ground motion sources, here we explore the feasibility of a machine learning-based approach. This is achieved by applying the random forest (RF) technique to large-scale deformation maps spanning 2015-2018. Focusing on the northern part of Italy, we train the model to identify landslide, subsidence, and mining-related ground motion with which to construct a balanced training dataset. The presence of noisy signals and other sources of deformation is also tackled within the model construction. The proposed approach relies on the use of explanatory variables extracted from the A-DInSAR datasets and from freely accessible informative layers such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and geohazard inventories. In general, the model performance is very promising as we achieved an overall accuracy of 0.97, a true positive rate of 0.94 and an F1-Score of 0.93. The obtained outcomes demonstrate that such transferable and automated approach may constitute an asset for stakeholders in the framework of geohazards risk management.

TI  - Global crop calendars of maize and wheat in the framework of the WorldCereal project
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop calendars provide valuable information on the timing of important stages of crop development such as the planting or Start of Season (SOS) and harvesting dates or End of Season (EOS). This information is critical for many crop monitoring applications such as crop-type mapping, crop condition monitoring, and crop yield estimation and forecasting. Spatially detailed information on the crop calendars provides an important asset in this respect, as it allows the algorithms to account for specific local circumstances while also maximizing their robustness and global applicability. Existing global crop calendar products, as produced by the Group on Earth Observations' Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Crop Monitor, the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA-FAS), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the European Commission Joint Research Center's Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production (ASAP), generally provide this information only at national or subnational level. In this work, we present gridded SOS and EOS maps for wheat and maize that represent the crop calendars' spatial variability at 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. These maps are generated in the framework of WorldCereal, which is a European Space Agency (ESA) funded project whose cropland and crop-type wheat and maize algorithms at global scale and at 10 m spatial resolution require this information. The proposed maps are built leveraging the above noted global products (Crop Monitor, USDA-FAS, FAO, ASAP) whose datasets are combined into a baseline map and sampled to train a Random Forest algorithm based on climatic and geographic data. Their evaluation against test data from the baseline maps set aside for validation purposes show a good performance with SOS (EOS) R (2) of 0.87 (0.92) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 27 (26) days for wheat, showing the lowest errors (RMSE <15 days) in North America, Central Europe, South Africa, and Australia, all critical areas for global wheat production and trade. Meanwhile, the largest errors (RMSE between 40 and 60 days) occurred in regions of South America close to the Amazon Forest and in Africa close to the Congo Basin. In the case of maize, the SOS (EOS) evaluation shows an R (2) of 0.88 (0.79) and an RMSE of 24 (28) days for maize, with the best performing regions (RMSE < 15 days) located in the Northern Hemisphere, South Africa, and Australia, important areas for global maize production and trade. Meanwhile, the worst performing regions were in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and India. Additionally, the crop calendars were evaluated using a simple Land Surface Phenology (LSP) model based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Earth Observation data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 over known wheat and maize fields. The results show a SOS (EOS) R (2) of 0.75 (0.88) and an RMSE of 25 (18) days for wheat and SOS (EOS) R (2) of 0.80 (0.88) and an RMSE of 35 (24) days for maize. Therefore, the presented calendars present an advancement over the existing crop calendar products in terms of capturing spatial coverage and variability and reporting their accuracy.

TI  - Marine aquaculture mapping using GF-1 WFV satellite images and full resolution cascade convolutional neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing demand for seafood and reduced fishery harvests have raised intensive farming of marine aquaculture in coastal regions, which may cause severe coastal water problems without adequate environmental management. Effective mapping of mariculture areas is essential for the protection of coastal environments. However, due to the limited spatial coverage and complex structures, it is still challenging for traditional methods to accurately extract mariculture areas from medium spatial resolution (MSR) images. To solve this problem, we propose to use the full resolution cascade convolutional neural network (FRCNet), which maintains effective features over the whole training process, to identify mariculture areas from MSR images. Specifically, the FRCNet uses a sequential full resolution neural network as the first-level subnetwork, and gradually aggregates higher-level subnetworks in a cascade way. Meanwhile, we perform a repeated fusion strategy so that features can receive information from different subnetworks simultaneously, leading to rich and representative features. As a result, FRCNet can effectively recognize different kinds of mariculture areas from MSR images. Results show that FRCNet obtained better performance than other classical and recently proposed methods. Our developed methods can provide valuable datasets for large-scale and intelligent modeling of the marine aquaculture management and coastal zone planning.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The co-existence of diverse plant forms in densely vegetated savanna environments presents a challenge when mapping species diversity using single remotely sensed data type that carries either optical or structural information. In the present study, Sentinel-1 RADAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data were combined to classify morphologically similar woody plant species (n =27) and three coexisting land cover types using Deep Neural Network (DNN). The fused image recorded a higher overall classification accuracy (76%) than the sole use of Sentinel-2 (72%) and Sentinel-1 RADAR data (71%). Slightly more species (15) recorded accuracies exceeding 75% using fused image compared to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data (13 species >75%). Analysis of relative band contributions resulted in high importance from Sentinel-1 C-band ratio of VH/VV polarization (8.6%) as well as a select Sentinel-2 bands (Near infrared (9.86%), Shortwave (9.5%), and Vegetation red edge (8%)). Parallel to continual efforts to improve the accuracies of fused RADAR-optical data, the services of such data for regional-scale applications should be explored to inform timely biodiversity assessments.

TI  - Greenhouse area detection in Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China: spatio-temporal change and suitability classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive use of greenhouses has brought soared economic benefits for farming practitioners in China and an overview of the spatio-temporal distribution of greenhouses is of great interest to agricultural practitioners and decision-makers. In this study, Landsat image based greenhouse maps in Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China were made using random forest classification algorithm through visual interpretation on the Google Earth Engine. The 7-year's changes in greenhouse areas were investigated (i.e. 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2015 and 2019) with yearly overall accuracy more than 90%. The results showed that the total area of greenhouses in Guanzhong Plain demonstrated an increasing trend, from 5.92 km(2) in 2000 to 194.42 km(2) in 2019 with a considerable growth between 2010 and 2015. The dominant drivers for the increase are largely attributed to the government policy as well as economic profitability. The distribution of greenhouse shifts to central and eastern regions of Guanzhong Plain. Greenhouses preferentially expand to the area near to rural roads, main rivers, and high elevation, with more than 45% greenhouses distributed within 1 km of the county rural road. The principal component analysis based suitability evaluation showed that a total of 38.44% of the area was suitable for greenhouse.

TI  - Susceptibility of sheep to experimental co-infection with the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha variant
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic that has had significant impacts on human health and economies worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 in humans. A wide range of animal species have also been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by experimental and/or natural infections. Sheep are a commonly farmed domestic ruminant that have not been thoroughly investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies which consisted of infection of ruminant-derived cells and experimental challenge of sheep to investigate their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that sheep-derived kidney cells support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the experimental challenge of sheep demonstrated limited infection with viral RNA shed in nasal and oral swabs at 1 and 3-days post challenge (DPC); viral RNA was also detected in the respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues at 4 and 8 DPC. Sero-reactivity was observed in some of the principal infected sheep but not the contact sentinels, indicating that transmission to co-mingled naive sheep was not highly efficient; however, viral RNA was detected in respiratory tract tissues of sentinel animals at 21 DPC. Furthermore, we used a challenge inoculum consisting of a mixture of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the B.1.1.7-like alpha variant of concern, to study competition of the two virus strains. Our results indicate that sheep show low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and that the alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A strain.

TI  - Variation of XCO<sub>2</sub> anomaly patterns in the Middle East from OCO-2 satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The anthropogenic CO2 emission is contributed to the rapid increase in CO2 concentration. In the current study the anthropogenic CO2 emission in the Middle East (ME) is investigated using 6 years column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) observation from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. In this way, the XCO2 anomaly (Delta XCO2) as the detrended and deseasonalized term of OCO-2XCO(2) product, was computed and compared to provide the direct space-based anthropogenic CO2 emission monitoring. As a result, the high positive and negative Delta XCO2 values have corresponded to the major sources such as oil and gas industries, and growing seasons over ME, respectively. Consequently, the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) emission and the gross primary productivity (GPP) were utilized in exploring the Delta XCO2 relation with human and natural driving factors. The results showed the capability of Delta XCO2 maps in detecting CO2 emission fluctuations in defined periods were detectible in daily to annual periods. The simplicity and accuracy of the method in detecting the man-made and natural driving factors including the main industrial areas, megacities, or local changes due to COVID-19 pandemic or geopolitical situations as well as the vegetation absorption and biomass burning is the key point that provides the environmental managers and policymakers with valuable and accessible information to control and ultimately reduce the CO2 emission over critical regions.

TI  - Contribution of anthropogenic consolidation processes to subsidence phenomena from multi-temporal DInSAR: a GIS-based approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper introduces an approach based on the combination of multi-temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and geographical information systems analysis to investigate and separate several contributions to subsidence phenomena over the municipality of Ravenna (Emilia Romagna, Italy). In particular, the relationship between displacements detected over built environment and consolidation processes after construction was assessed and filtered out from the subsidence map to quantify the local overestimation of subsidence phenomena due to the mentioned processes. It requires descriptive attributes related to the age of construction and intended uses. The outcomes of the present study highlight ground consolidation processes that seem to be active over areas settled in the last 30 years with a component contributing to vertical rates up to 3 mm/yr. Such contribution represents the 20% of the cumulative displacements reported for coastal villages where different sources of subsidence increase the vulnerability to coastal erosion. We discuss the contribution of consolidation processes over a couple of recently settled areas to separate among contributions and avoid the misinterpretation of effects due to other anthropogenic sources of subsidence.

TI  - Active versus passive: evaluating the effectiveness of inoculation techniques in relation to misinformation about climate change
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The current study evaluated whether an active inoculation (interactive skill development) or a passive inoculation message (provision of information) were effective tools for conferring resistance to misinformation about climate science in the context of extreme weather events. Method Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: a control condition (no training); a passive inoculation condition; or an active inoculation condition. Participants completed demographic questions followed by training or no training and then evaluated a misinformation and factual article for reliability and persuasiveness. Results Participants in the active inoculation condition rated the reliability and persuasiveness of the misinformation article and the reliability of the factual article lower than participants in the control condition. Participants in the passive inoculation training did not rate the reliability and persuasiveness of a misinformation and factual article significantly differently to those in the control condition. When factors such as ideological worldview and climate change beliefs were controlled for however, the inoculation interventions had no significant effect on ratings of reliability and persuasiveness for a misinformation or factual article. Conclusion Inoculation seems to be a promising method of preventing the acceptance of misinformation on climate science. However, this analysis highlights that more investigation is required in order to determine the most effective inoculation training design.

TI  - Interpreting the uncertainty of model-based and design-based estimation in downscaling estimates from NFI data: a case-study in Extremadura (Spain)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data are increasingly used together with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to improve the spatial precision of forest variable estimates. In this study, we combined data from the 4th Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI-4) and from the 2nd nationwide Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) survey to develop predictive forest inventory variables (total over bark volume (V), basal area (G), and annual increase in total volume (IAVC)) and aboveground biomass (AGB) models for the eight major forest strata in the region of Extremadura that are included in the Spanish Forest Map (SFM). We generated maps at 25 m resolution by applying an area-based approach (ABA) and 758 sample plots measured with good positional accuracy within the SNFI-4 in Extremadura (Spain). Inventory performance is mainly influenced by spatial scale and vegetation structure. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of statistical inference methods that can characterize forest inventory variables and AGB uncertainty across multiple spatial scales and types of vegetation structure. Predictions at pixel level were used to produce county, provincial, and regional model-based estimates, which were then compared with design-based estimates at different scales for different types of forest. We developed and tested both methods for forested area (cover, 19,744.15 km(2)), one province (9126.78 km(2)), and two counties (1594.42 km(2) and 2076.76 km(2), respectively) in Extremadura. The resulting relative standard error (SE) for regional level forest type-specific model-based estimates of V, G, IAVC, and AGB ranged from 3.34%-14.46%, 3.22%-12.50%, 4.46%-16.67%, and 3.63%-12.58%, respectively. The performance of the model-based approach, as assessed by the relative SE, was similar to that of the design-based approach at regional and provincial levels. However, the precision of SNFI model-based estimates was higher than that of estimates based on only the plot observations in small areas (e.g. at county level). The standard errors (SE) for model-based inferences were stable across the different scales, while SNFI design-based errors were higher due to the small sample sizes available for small areas. The findings indicate that SNFI-model based maps could be used directly to estimate forest inventory variables and AGB in the major forest strata included in the Spanish Forest Map, leading to potentially large economic savings.

TI  - Aboveground biomass mapping by integrating ICESat-2, SENTINEL-1, SENTINEL-2, ALOS2/PALSAR2, and topographic information in Mediterranean forests
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides an extraordinary opportunity to support global large-scale forest carbon mapping, but further research is needed in order to obtain wall-to-wall forest aboveground biomass (AGB) maps with this technology. The effects of vegetation structure on the performance of canopy height and AGB modeling using ICESat-2 photon-counting light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data in Mediterranean forest areas have not been previously studied in the literature. In this study, we combined recent ICESat-2 vegetation (ATL08) data, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)- and field-based estimates, and a multi-sensor earth observation composite for extrapolation of AGB estimates and AGB mapping. A diverse gradient of forest Mediterranean ecosystems, distributed over 19,744.15 km(2) of forest area in the region of Extremadura (Spain), with different species and structural complexity forming 5 different forest types (3 Quercus spp. dominated and 2 Pinus spp. dominated forests), was used to (i) evaluate the precision of ICESat-2 canopy height estimations, (ii) develop ICESat-2-based AGB models, and (iii) generate a spatially continuous prediction of AGB by using data from the satellite missions Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS2/PALSAR2), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). First, ALS- and ICESat-2-derived metrics that best described canopy height (p98 and rh98, respectively) were compared at the ATL08 segment level. Second, ALS-based AGB values were derived at the ATL08 segment scale. Third, ALS-based AGB estimates at the ICESat-2 segment level were used as dependent variables to fit ICESat-2-based AGB models. Fourth, a multi-sensor approach was then implemented to predict ICESat-2-derived AGB, by means of a Random Forest (RF) modeling technique, with predictors retrieved from S1, S2, ALOS2/PALSAR2, and SRTM. Finally, RF was used to generate wall-to-wall AGB maps that were compared with field-, ALS- and ICESat-2-based observations. The agreement between the ALS- and ICESat-2-derived metrics related to the canopy height distribution was higher for Pinus spp. forest than for the Quercus spp-dominated forests. The ICESat-2-based AGB models yielded model efficiency (Mef) values between 0.56 and 0.80, with a RMSE ranging from 7.76 to 17.71 Mg ha(-1) and rRMSE from 19.04 to 55.21%. The multi-sensor RF models provided the following results when compared with the ICESat-2- and ALS-based AGB observations: R (2) values of 0.63 and 0.64, and RMSE values of 11.10 Mg ha(-1)(rRMSE = 28.15%) and 12.28 Mg ha(-1) (rRMSE = 31.45%), respectively, and an approximately unbiased result (0.03 Mg ha(-1) and 0.09 Mg ha(-1)). When applied to the field-based validation data set (4th Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI-4) plots = 508), the RF-derived AGB model showed a relatively lower predictive capacity (R (2) = 0.45), a higher RMSE value (25.88 Mg ha(-1)) and slightly biased results (-1.47 Mg ha(-1)), especially for larger field-derived AGB intervals. The results of this study serve to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the ICESat-2 ATL08 data for large-scale AGB estimation. The findings suggest that a multi-sensor approach may be feasible for extrapolating ICESat-2-derived AGB estimates over areas where field or ALS reference data are not available.

TI  - Multiple agricultural cropland products of South Asia developed using Landsat-8 30 m and MODIS 250 m data using machine learning on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud and spectral matching techniques (SMTs) in support of food and water security
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland products are of great importance in water and food security assessments, especially in South Asia, which is home to nearly 2 billion people and 230 million hectares of net cropland area. In South Asia, croplands account for about 90% of all human water use. Cropland extent, cropping intensity, crop watering methods, and crop types are important factors that have a bearing on the quantity, quality, and location of production. Currently, cropland products are produced using mainly coarse-resolution (250-1000 m) remote sensing data. As multiple cropland products are needed to address food and water security challenges, our study was aimed at producing three distinct products that would be useful overall in South Asia. The first of these, Product 1, was meant to assess irrigated versus rainfed croplands in South Asia using Landsat 30 m data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The second, Product 2, was tailored for major crop types using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m data. The third, Product 3, was designed for cropping intensity (single, double, and triple cropping) using MODIS 250 m data. For the kharif season (the main cropping season in South Asia, Jun-Oct), 10 major crops (5 irrigated crops: rice, soybean, maize, sugarcane, cotton; and 5 rainfed crops: pulses, rice, sorghum, millet, groundnut) were mapped. For the rabi season (post-rainy season, Nov-Feb), five major crops (three irrigated crops: rice, wheat, maize; and two rainfed crops: chickpea, pulses) were mapped. The irrigated versus rainfed 30 m product showed an overall accuracy of 79.8% with the irrigated cropland class providing a producer's accuracy of 79% and the rainfed cropland class 74%. The overall accuracy demonstrated by the cropping intensity product was 85.3% with the producer's accuracies of 88%, 85%, and 67% for single, double, and triple cropping, respectively. Crop types were mapped to accuracy levels ranging from 72% to 97%. A comparison of the crop-type area statistics with national statistics explained 63-98% variability. The study produced multiple-cropland products that are crucial for food and water security assessments, modeling, mapping, and monitoring using multiple-satellite sensor big-data, and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms by coding, processing, and computing on the GEE cloud.

TI  - A novel-optimal monitoring index of rocky desertification based on feature space model and red edge indices that derived from sentinel-2 MSI image
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies of monitoring rocky desertification based on Sentinel-2 MSI image with higher spatial and temporal resolutions have been reported. In this paper, nine typical surface parameters that derived from Sentinel-2 MSI image including three red edge indices have been introduced to establish two types of feature space monitoring index: point-to-line type and point-to-point type. The results show that: (1) The feature of space monitoring index based on Sentinel-2 MSI image has a higher applicability in obtaining rocky desertification information for karst zones; (2) The point-to-line BSI (bare soil index)-NDre1 (red edge index 1)feature space monitoring index of rocky desertification has the best applicability with R-2=95.1% and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.872; (3) The feature space monitoring indexes that composed of red edge indices have a higher inversion accuracy, which indicates that the red edge indices are sensitive indicators of the rocky desertification condition and process;(4) The intensive and severe rocky desertification zones are mostly located in the southeast and central parts. The 3-dimensional or multidimensional feature space model will be constructed to improve the inversion accuracy of rocky desertification in further studies. The research results can provide methodological supports for revealing the rocky desertification evolution laws.

TI  - Decadal changes of Campbell Glacier Tongue in East Antarctica from 2010 to 2020 and implications of ice pinning conditions analyzed by optical and SAR datasets
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in ice shelf dynamics significantly impact the discharge rate of grounded ice, sea ice formation, and marine environments. In particular, changes of a sub-shelf pinning point induce complex dynamics of an ice shelf. In this study, we investigated decadal changes (2010-2020) in the area, ice velocity, and grounding line position of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in East Antarctica, which has an ice pinning point at the southwestern end, and analyzed the effect of the pinning conditions on the dynamics of CGT. Panchromatic band images of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, COSMO-SkyMed X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data sets were employed. The surface area of CGT digitized from the optical and SAR imagery decreased by 8% in the last decade, during which four ice calving events that caused icebergs with an area range of 3.8-5.4 km(2). The largest calving at the ice pinning point occurred in March 2014, which created an iceberg with 4 km(2). The ice velocity of CGT was measured via the normalized cross-correlation-based image matching of the Landsat panchromatic images. The ice velocity along the flow direction and its anomaly of CGT hardly changed in the hinge zone from 2011 to 2020. The ice velocity increased by similar to 7% and the flow direction steered abruptly similar to 7 degrees to the east in the freely floating zone after the 2014 calving at the ice pinning point. Considering the retreat of the local grounding line at the pinning point analyzed by COSMO-SkyMed double-differential interferometric SAR, the advancing glacier tongue came in contact with the sloping eastern flank of the locally elevated seabed at the pinning point after the calving, and the ice-bed contact area decreased, causing a sudden acceleration and eastward rotation of ice flow. It is expected that continuous calving at the ice pinning point of CGT may lead to an abrupt changes in glacier tongue dynamics again, and continuous monitoring is necessary.

TI  - Small baselines techniques of time series InSAR to monitor and predict land subsidence causing flood vulnerability in Sidoarjo, Indonesia
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are the most common sort of natural disaster that occurs when a body of water overflows and submerges on dry terrain. Several regions in Sidoarjo District, East Java such as Kedungbanteng and Banjarasri Village, have experienced floods with varying heights since 2018 due to heavy rainfall in the areas. According to the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG), rainfall intensity in these areas reach 100 mm/day. Furthermore, the physical environment in both areas shows land subsidence that causes a change in the flow pattern, which triggers its occurrence. This research incorporated different small baseline techniques of InSAR time series analysis and used GPS measurement to evaluate and monitor the land subsidence in both areas. The reseachers used Sentinel-1 SAR data both from ascending and descending for the period between 2017 and 2021. The results showed significant subsidence value by up to -200 mm/year both in Kedungbanteng and Banjarasri Village, and GPS observation also confirmed approximately -3.2 cm of subsidence value during 2 months of sampling observations. Using the neural network analysis, the reseachers predicted the time series displacement for one year and showed that a continuous trend of deformation still existed.

TI  - Generating annual high resolution land cover products for 28 metropolises in China based on a deep super-resolution mapping network using Landsat imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution of global land cover dynamic is indicative for understanding the influence of anthropogenic activity on environmental change. However, most of the land cover products are based on Landsat image that only has 30 m resolution, which is insufficient to distinguish the heterogenous urban structure; while very high spatial resolution image usually has low temporal resolution, which is difficult to monitor the urban dynamic. Deep-learning-driven super-resolution mapping is a prevailing way of achieving very-high-resolution land cover dynamic products in aspect of alleviating the mixed pixel problem of Landsat image. However, two limitations are obvious: 1) the fixed grid of kernel during the upsampling process favors spatial homogeneity and suppresses the learning of spatial heterogeneity of urban composition and 2) geometric or radiation variation over large spatial and long temporal extent in remote sensing images makes the super-resolution mapping approach difficult to transfer for application. Here, we attempt to solve these two limitations: 1) a progressive edge-guided super-resolution architecture is designed to allow nonuniformed kernel specific at the low-confidence edge region and intensify the learning of heterogenous compositions' patterns and 2) an alternating optimization strategy is designed to minimize the resultant entropy and modulate the classification hyperplane to accommodate to the manifold of the discrepant region. Validation experiments are investigated based on a fine-grained and large-extent super-resolution (FLAS) dataset constructed in this study, and it is found that our approach remarkably enhances rich detailed patterns of heterogenous region and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Besides, we applied DETNet to the large spatial extent of 28 metropolises in China (>40,000 km(2)) and the large temporal extent of continuous 21-year (2000-2020) in Wuhan city to examine transferability. From the land cover areas variation, we find that the expansion rate of cropland is faster than the urban expansion over the past 10 years, which are gradually becoming the principal source for the encroachment of forest and lakes. From detailed urban dynamic reflected by the 21-year products, we find that urban-villages between the old city zone and the outer high-tech development zone are gradually disappeared. The captured dynamic is consistence with the urban-village renovation policy during this period, which is meant to redistribute the spatial configuration of the city for a more sustainable urban structure. We believe that the proposed method can facilitate a seamless and fine-grained observation system that can fill the weakness of the existing land cover activities and provide a brand-new insight into the urban dynamic and its underlying mechanism.

TI  - Mapping Australia's precipitation: harnessing the synergies of multi-satellite remote sensing and gauge network data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coverage, resolution, and accuracy in the spatial and temporal estimates of remotely sensed precipitation from space satellites, along with the number of instruments deployed to deliver these observations, are increasing. Of key interest in this study is the unsurpassed opportunity offered by their broad and continuous coverage to complement sparse, but more accurate, in situ rain gauge measurements for building climate resilience at the local, regional, and global scales. For many parts of the globe, this opportunity remains untapped. Australia is no exception and provides a unique challenge, given the small fraction of the continent that has rain gauges, the highly diverse climate due to its large size, and the apparent worsening of extreme weather events in both frequency and intensity. Notwithstanding this great impetus, a continent-wide record of multi-satellite-gauge fused precipitation data for Australia remains lacking. This missing data asset is a prerequisite for understanding the emerging spatiotemporal dynamics of precipitation, without which reliable forecasts would be difficult if not impossible. This study seeks to address this need. Here, we develop a method which can synergistically fuse precipitation data from different sources. More specifically, the aim of this study is to develop Precipitation Profiler-Observation Fusion and Estimation (PPrOFusE), a tool to deliver high-quality gauge and multi-satellite fused precipitation data. We test and apply this tool for Australia, but it is by no means limited in scope to this region. By design, PPrOFusE has a built-in capability to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. In this case study, we fused data for a period of 22 years (2000-2022) using the rain gauge network data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) together with satellite data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH). Our proposed precipitation data fusion method consists of two steps. Step 1, the relationship among the three sources of data is modeled by multiple linear regression at each rain gauge location, returning the least squares estimates for the associated regression coefficient vector. Step 2, such regression coefficient vector estimates for all rain gauge locations are fitted by a spatial autoregression model, whereafter the multiple linear regression coefficient vectors for those locations void of rain gauges are predicted by spatial interpolation. Key findings are twofold. First, CMORPH is more accurate for most regions of Australia than GSMaP. Second, a clustering analysis of the fused precipitation over the last 20 years suggests two key trends on Australia's changing climate, relative to BOM's six major climate zones, from the previous century: (a) increased spatial variability to the north, consistent with meteorological expectations, amid a southwards expansion of the wet summer dominant zones across the continent; (b) the edge of the arid region shifts southwards and pushes out Mediterranean climate and winter dominant rainfall zones across southern Australia.

TI  - Modelling agricultural drought: a review of latest advances in big data technologies
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Review
AB  - This article reviews the main recent applications of multi-sensor remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence techniques in multivariate modelling of agricultural drought. The study focused mainly on three fundamental aspects, namely descriptive modelling, predictive modelling, and spatial modelling of expected risks and vulnerability to drought. Thus, out of 417 articles across all studies on drought, 226 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed to provide a global overview of the current state of knowledge on multivariate drought modelling using the inclusion criteria. The main objective is to review the recent available scientific evidence regarding multivariate drought modelling based on the joint use of geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. The analysis focused on the different methods used, the choice of algorithms and the most relevant variables depending on whether they are descriptive or predictive models. Criteria such as the skill score, the given game complexity used, and the nature of validation data were considered to draw the main conclusions. The results highlight the very heterogeneous nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought, and the very original nature of studies on multivariate modelling of agricultural drought in the recent literature. For future studies, in addition to scientific advances in prospects, case studies and comparative studies appear necessary for an in-depth analysis of the reproducibility and operational applicability of the different approaches proposed for spatial and temporal modelling of agricultural drought.

TI  - Tracking transient boreal wetland inundation with Sentinel-1 SAR: Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta and Yukon Flats, Alaska
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and frequent mapping of transient wetland inundation in the boreal region is critical for monitoring the ecological and societal functions of wetlands. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has long been used to map wetlands due to its sensitivity to surface inundation and ability to penetrate clouds, darkness, and certain vegetation canopies. Here, we track boreal wetland inundation by developing a two-step modified decision-tree algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) time-series data as inputs. This approach incorporates temporal as well as spatial characteristics of SAR backscatter and is evaluated for the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta (PAD), and Yukon Flats, Alaska (YF) from May 2017 to October 2019. Within these two boreal study areas, we map spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation classes of Open Water (OW), Floating Plants (FP), Emergent Plants (EP), and Flooded Vegetation (FV). Temporal variability, frequency, and maximum extents of transient wetland inundation are quantified. Retrieved inundation estimates are compared with in-situ field mapping obtained during the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a multi-temporal Landsat-derived surface water map. Over the 2017-2019 study period, we find that fractional inundation area ranged from 18.0% to 19.0% in the PAD, and from 10.7% to 12.1% in the YF. Transient wetland inundation covered similar to 595 km(2) of the PAD, comprising similar to 9.1% of its landscape, and similar to 102 km(2) of the YF, comprising similar to 3.6%. The implications of these findings for wetland function monitoring, and estimating landscape-scale methane emissions are discussed, together with limitations and uncertainties of our approach. We conclude that time series of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter, screened with Sentinel-2 MSI optical imagery and validated by field measurements, offer a valuable tool for tracking transient boreal wetland inundation.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Early mapping of winter wheat in Henan province of China using time series of Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of winter wheat in its early stages is crucial for crop growth monitoring and crop yield forecasting. However, early mapping of winter wheat using remotely sensed data is challenging because remote sensing observations can only be used for a part of the growth period. In this study, a framework was proposed for early season mapping of winter wheat using spectral and temporal information of Sentinel-2 images. First, time series of temporal and spectral features were derived using Whittaker smoothing. Subsequently, sensitivities of different parameters (i.e. input features, time interval, and length of time-series data) to early mapping were analyzed. Finally, early maps of winter wheat were generated based on optimal parameters. Results show that the earliest identifiable timing was delayed as the time interval of the time series increased. Winter wheat can be mapped in the early overwintering period (5 months before harvest) with an overall accuracy of 0.91, which is comparable to that of post-season mapping (0.94). In addition, the misclassification in early mapping was caused by uneven sample spatial patterns, natural conditions, and planting management; however, most errors can be gradually amended during the green-up and jointing periods, and the overall accuracy remained stable after the jointing stage. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement large-scale early mapping of winter wheat using satellite observations. The proposed approach potentially provides a reference for early mapping of other crop types in agricultural regions worldwide.

TI  - Phenological piecewise modelling is more conducive than whole-season modelling to winter wheat yield estimation based on remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the existing remote sensing-based yield estimation methods adopt the mean or cumulative value of meteorological factors within the whole growing season, which may ignore the impact of adverse meteorological conditions on the growth of winter wheat in a certain phenological period. In this study, we distinguished the developmental progression of winter wheat as three phenological periods. In each phenological period, the vegetation indices and meteorological factors were optimized. Then the accuracy and spatiotemporal transferability of the phenological piecewise modelling was compared with that of the whole-season modelling based on four regression methods (i.e. multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest). The results showed that the optimal combinations of variables for the whole-season modelling and the phenological piecewise modelling were different. Compared with the whole-season models, the R-2 for the phenological piecewise models improved by 1.4% to 7.6%, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 1.1% to 8.2% among four regression methods . In addition, compared with the whole-season models, the spatiotemporal transferability for the phenological piecewise models was generally better. The accuracies after spatiotemporal transfer for the phenological piecewise models were still higher than that for the whole-season models.

TI  - Land surface temperature and human thermal comfort responses to land use dynamics in Chittagong city of Bangladesh
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense urbanization alters the microclimate and ecology of cities by converting naturally vegetated and permeable surfaces into impervious built-up surfaces. These artificial impermeable surfaces re-balance the surface energy budget by storing solar heat due to their higher thermal conductivity, and consequently, increase the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The higher LST affects the city dwellers' Human Thermal Comfort (HTC). To address these issues, unlike most prior research, we assess not only the influence of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) alterations on summer LST but also on winter LST in Chittagong City of Bangladesh between 1993 and 2020 by using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Additionally, the study evaluates the impact of LULC changes on the HTC during summer as LST substantially affects HTC in summer. The LULC analysis shows an increase in built-up area by 204% from bare lands, vegetated lands, lowlands, and water bodies between 1993 and 2020. In contrast, bare lands were converted from naturally vegetated surfaces, followed by lowlands and water bodies because of anthropogenic activities. The LSTs of Chittagong city, derived from remote sensing data, show a strong upward trend, with summer (winter) ranges of 20.62-34.07 degrees C (7.50-27.52 degrees C), 22.82-37.62 degrees C (14.92-29.32 degrees C), and 22.32-43.52 degrees C (17.08-31.83 degrees C) for 1993, 2007, and 2020, respectively. Between 1993 and 2020, the spatial mean winter and summer LSTs increased by 4.04 degrees C and 6.45 degrees C, respectively, or 0.15 degrees C and 0.24 degrees C per year. Chittagong had the highest mean LST in built-up areas for all the years. In addition, the study area's HTC gradually shifted to intense heat stress. The summer LST strongly correlated with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) while winter LST exhibited poor correlation with these indices.

TI  - Wheat leaf traits monitoring based on machine learning algorithms and high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf, which is a crucial indicator for evaluating crop status, plays an important role in plants' functions. Determining and monitoring leaf parameters can facilitate the detection and estimation of crop yield, which is essential for food security. Crop monitoring by remote sensing technology is critical to support crop production, especially over large scales. In this study, we developed a methodology to estimate leaf parameters based entirely on vegetation indices (VIs) from remotely sensed imagery in wheat under different management practices. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the utility of VIs calculated from the sentinel-2 data in estimating the Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf parameters at wheat farms using machine learning algorithms. Leaf parameters included leaf dry weight (LDW), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf specific weight (SLW), and machine learning algorithms were SVM (support vector machine), ANN (artificial neural network) and DNN (deep neural network). Leaf parameters were measured at several developmental stages of wheat in two contrasting envi-ronments in the southern Iran. The results demonstrated that the DNN algorithm could efficiently predict leaf parameters in the southern Iran with an overall precision of >72%, which assessed the potential of employing DNN to achieve the temporal and spatial distribution data of wheat based on the Sentinel-2 imagery. The validation of the DNN model generally showed high accuracy (R = 0.80, RMSE = 1.19, and MAE = 0.98) be-tween observed and estimated LAI values when this model was used. NDVI was also highly sensitive to wheat LDW and SLA parameters, with a good correlation between field measurements and those predicted by the DNN model from sentinel-2 imagery, with the R values of 0.66 and 0.85, respectively. Further, NDVI and PVI (Perpendicular Vegetation Index) were linearly correlated with SLW across both temporal and spatial scales (R = 0.79). Among VIs considered from sentinel-2 imagery to predict wheat leaf parameters, NDVI was more sensitive than other VIs. This research, thus, indicated that using sentinel-2 data within a DNN model could provide a comparatively precise and robust prediction of leaf parameters and yield valuable insights into crop management with high temporal and spatial accuracy.

TI  - Multi-sensor and multi-platform consistency and interoperability between UAV, Planet CubeSat, Sentinel-2, and Landsat reflectance data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite data have considerable complementarity for platform inter-operability, data fusion studies, calibration and validation efforts, and various multiscale analyses. To optimize cross-platform synergies between field-deployable UAV and space-based satellite systems, an understanding of spectral characteristics and compatibility is required. Here, we present the assessment of spectral consistency, undertaking a pixel-to-pixel similarity assessment of co-registered reflectance maps using corresponding spectral bands from UAV and satellite multispectral imagery. A high-resolution centimeter-scale UAV-mounted MicaSense RedEdge-MX sensor is intercompared against variable-resolution multi-spectral sensors on-board PlanetScope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 platforms. Sampling from within an urban environment that covers a range of both natural and man-made surfaces, we employ ground-based spectroradiometer data to evaluate pixel-level responses, using regression analysis and measurements of relative root mean square error (rRMSE) to assess for factors such as spatial and spectral misalignment. Using two radiometric correction approaches for the UAV data, we found that a vicarious radiometric correction was more accurate than a linear empirical line method, with the former improving rRMSE by between 1.6% and 20.11% when assessed against spectroradiometer measurements. Spectral band misalignment between the UAV and satellite sensors affected their spectral consistency, causing different reflectance values for the same object in the corresponding UAV and satellite bands, with the issue amplified over specific land-cover classes (e.g. grass in the red edge part of the spectrum). Using the standard deviation of a UAV-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a metric of spatial heterogeneity, larger differences between the UAV and satellite-based NDVI were observed for different ground features in response to both land-cover boundary and shadow effects. Interestingly, higher spatial heterogeneity did not necessarily lead to higher spectral inconsistencies. It was also determined that as spatial scale differences between the UAV and satellite platforms increased, the lower was the impact of geometric misregistration on their consistency. Indeed, the rRMSE between the reflectance values of the UAV-based spectral bands and the corresponding satellite imagery was smaller at lower resolution (e.g. Landsat 8) than higher resolution (e.g. PlanetScope). Overall, the study provides insight into the collective effect of spectral and spatial misalignments on the degree of spectral consistency that can be expected between UAV and satellite data, guiding robust radiometric intercalibration efforts and the potential for improved synergy and interoperability between UAV and satellite data.

TI  - Near real-time mapping of burned area by synergizing multiple satellites remote-sensing data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have significant impacts on human lives, critical infrastructures, and Earth's ecosystems. Accurate and timely information on burned area (BA) affected by wildfires is vital to better understand the drivers of wildfire events, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, and air quality, and to aid wildfire management. Single satellite data have been used to detect the characteristics of wildfires, retrospectively mapping BAs at a variety of spatial resolutions in previous studies. However, due to the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions, single-source satellite data are not sufficient to characterize the explicit dynamics of BAs at high resolutions in both space and time. Thus, a two-stage near real-time BA mapping method was developed in this study to take advantage of the high temporal frequency of coarse resolution sensors and the fine spatial resolution of medium resolution sensors in BA mapping by synergizing freely available coarse and medium spatial resolution (MSR) sensors. First, high temporal frequency sensors such as MODIS and VIIRS were used to identify wildfires and potential BAs. Then, multiple MSR sensors such as Sentinel-2A/2B, Landsat OLI, and Resourcesat AWiFS were synthesized for extracting the BAs with more spatial details in near real-time. We applied the method in California, USA, where wildfires occurred in northern and southern parts in 2017. The results showed that the proposed method is promising for BA mapping with an overall accuracy of 0.84 and 0.85 for wildfires in northern and southern California, respectively. Additionally, the proposed method greatly improved the frequency and reduced the latency, with an average interval of 3.5 days (3 days) and latency of 4 days (sub-daily) for wildfires in southern (northern) California. The extracted BAs illustrated accurate spatial details with MSR sensors. Our method can significantly take advantage of multi-source remote-sensing observations to accurately map the BAs of active wildfires in near real-time. More importantly, the method can be applied to other geographic regions where wildfires risk humans and ecosystems.

TI  - Retrieval and validation of long-term aerosol optical depth from AVHRR data over China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites can provide over 40 years of global remote sensing observations, which can be used to retrieve long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD). This is of great significance to the study of global climate change. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to jointly calculate AOD and land surface properties from AVHRR observations. With assumptions that AOD doesn't vary in adjacent space and earth surface property doesn't vary in two days, the algorithm considered non-Lambertian surface reflection based on the shape of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF shape) and obtained AOD and surface property by optimal estimation (OE) method. The algorithm has been applied to NOAA-7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, and 19 satellites and AVHRR-retrieved AOD with 5 x 10 km over China (15 degrees-60 degrees N, 70 degrees-140 degrees E) has been obtained from 1982 to 2016. Comparisons of AVHRR-retrieved AOD against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) (in and around China) and China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET) AOD show good consistency with 62.62% points within the uncertainty of Delta tau = +/- (0.05 + 0.25 tau) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26. Further comparison of the monthly mean AOD of multiple AOD datasets in the 'Beijing', 'Dalanzadgad', 'NCU_Taiwan' and 'Kanpur' stations shows that the results of the algorithm are stable. The yearly averaged AOD data also has similar agreements with MERRA-2 (The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) and AVHRRDB data (AVHRR 'Deep Blue' aerosol data set). The multi-year mean correlation coefficient is 0.70 and 0.61 and the percentages within the uncertainty are 80.01% and 67.29% compared with MERRA-2 AOD and AVHRRDB AOD respectively.

TI  - A novel AI approach for modeling land surface temperature of Freetown, Sierra Leone, based on land-cover changes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) indices can be considered while developing land surface temperature (LST) models. The relationship between LST and LULC indices must be established to accurately estimate the impacts of LST changes. This study developed novel machine learning models for predicting LST using multispectral Landsat images data of Freetown city in Sierra-Leon. Artificial neural network (ANN) and gene expression programming (GEP) were employed to develop LST prediction models. Images of multispectral bands were obtained from Landsat 4-5 and 8 satellites to develop the proposed models. The extracted data of LULC indices, such as normal difference vegetation index (NDVI), normal difference built-up index (NDBI), urban index (UI), and normal difference water index (NDWI), were utilized as attributes to model LST. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the ANN and GEP models were 0.91(o)C and 1.08 C-o, respectively. The GEP model was used to yield a relationship between LULC indices and LST in the form of a mathematical equation, which can be conveniently used to test new data regarding the thematic area. The sensitivity analysis revealed that UI is the most influential parameter followed by NDBI, NDVI, and NDWI towards contributing LST.

TI  - A deep learning model using geostationary satellite data for forest fire detection with reduced detection latency
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although remote sensing of active fires is well-researched, their early detection has received less attention. Additionally, simple threshold approaches based on contextual statistical analysis suffer from generalization problems. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning-based forest fire detection algorithm, with a focus on reducing detection latency, utilizing 10-min interval high temporal resolution Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager. Random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were utilized for model development. The CNN model accurately reflected the contextual approach adopted in previous studies by learning information between adjacent matrices from an image. This study also investigates the contribution of temporal and spatial information to the two machine learning techniques by combining input features. Temporal and spatial factors contributed to the reduction in detection latency and false alarms, respectively, and forest fires could be most effectively detected using both types of information. The overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.97, 0.89, 0.41, and 0.54, respectively, in the best scheme among the RF-based schemes and 0.98, 0.91, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively, in that among the CNN-based schemes. This indicated better performance of the CNN model for forest fire detection that is attributed to its spatial pattern training and data augmentation. The CNN model detected all test forest fires within an average of 12 min, and one case was detected 9 min earlier than the recording time. Moreover, the proposed model outperformed the recent operational satellite-based active fire detection algorithms. Further spatial generality test results showed that the CNN model had reliable generality and was robust under varied environmental conditions. Overall, our results demonstrated the benefits of geostationary satellite-based remote sensing for forest fire monitoring.

TI  - Land use/cover spatiotemporal dynamics, and implications on environmental and bioclimatic factors in Chingola district, Zambia
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses remote sensing and GIS techniques to examine the intensity and dynamics of land use/cover change and environmental indices across a four-decade period in the Chingola district of Zambia, from 1972 to 2020 using five classification stages (1972, 1992, 2001, 2013, and 2020). A total of 10 key climate change detection monitoring indices were generated using RClimDex to examine the implications of land degradation on the bioclimatic factors from 1983 to 2020. The findings revealed a significant expansion in Built-ups (7.3%/year), farmlands (3.18%/year), and mining areas (0.82%/year) at the expense of natural resources. The highest human pressure was exerted on Savannah woodlands (-0.78), through agriculture (0.76) and infrastructure development (0.44) between 1992 and 2001.The analysis of the bioclimatic indices revealed a significant decline in rainfall quantity and intensity, and a rising in temperature (warmer days and nights). The Annual rainfall has decreased by -3.25%, while the potential evapotranspiration has increased by 0.04% from 1983 to 2020, resulting in an Aridity Index of 0.60 and a moisture deficit index of -0.42. To offset agriculture's propensity to spatially expand and further encroach into savannah woodlands and forests, urban containment policies and programs that stimulate agricultural intensification are needed to reduce urban sprawl and protect the city's remaining forestlands.

TI  - Urban growth nexus to land surface temperature in Ghana
T2  - COGENT ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation in Ghana has been associated with significant effects on the land surface temperature which has its impacts on the natural environment. Conventional literature exhibits that land surface temperature associated with urbanisation have concentrated in the developed world leaving the African terrain unattended to. Hence, its knowledge and implications in Africa and for that matter Ghana is deficient. This study is two-pronged a) examines the relationship between land surface temperature coupled with its spatial patterns (b) examines the surface urban heat island and urban-rural gradient in Greater Accra region of Ghana. Landsat images for 1991, 2002, 2012 and 2020 were used where demarcations for spatial integrity were done. The use of machine learning algorithms were adopted in the land use classification. It was observed that Accra would experience high impervious surface mostly due to rural-urban migration purposely to seek for employment. It was concluded that in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (especially goals 3,6,11 and 13) more efforts should be made to improve the conditions in the rural areas in order to curtail the migration drive which does not only put pressure on the social amenities in the urban areas but also exacerbate in the land surface temperature situation.

TI  - Model-driven estimation of closed and open shrublands live fuel moisture content
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is a crucial variable affecting the ignition potential of shrublands. Different remote sensing-based models (either empirical or physical) have been adopted to estimate LFMC in shrublands but with mixed success potentially owing to differences in vegetation cover (closed vs. open shrublands). This study aimed to evaluate and discuss LFMC estimation in open and closed shrublands using different remote sensing approaches. For each case, three broadly used radiative transfer models (RTMs) (PROSAILH, PROGeoSail, and PROACRM), and two empirical models were selected and compared. The empirical models were calibrated by a stepwise regression approach using a spectral index (SI) and its normalized form (SImax-min). Results showed that both RTMs and empirical models performed well in retrieving LFMC of closed shrublands (RTMs: R-2 = 0.60-0.66, RMSE = 14.96-18.51%, bias = -5.99-4.36%, and empirical models: R-2 = 0.69-0.72, RMSE = 10.67-11.30%, bias = 0.18-0.35%). However, all RTMs failed to retrieve LFMC for open shrublands (R-2 = 0.01-0.09, RMSE = 45.21-48.66%, bias = 9.76-14.75%) potentially due to the high heterogeneity of vegetation in this vegetation type. In contrast, the SImax-min-based model outperformed the RTMs for the open shrublands LFMC estimation (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 32.32%, bias = -0.34%) but saturated at high LFMC values (> 120%). In conclusion, PROACRM and the empirical model using SImax-min as an explanatory variable are recommended to model closed and open shrublands LFMC, respectively. This study gives insights into developing effective models for improving shrubland LFMC estimation by considering various fractions of covers of shrublands that were not previously considered.

TI  - InSAR-derived land subsidence in Wuhan between 2015 and 2020
T2  - ALL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence has become a challenging problem with urbanization and underground exploitation. The land subsidence in Wuhan, China, was inferred from 47 Sentinel-1A images acquired between June 2015 to October 2020 based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) technology. Results show that significant subsidence mainly occurred in Houhu, Qinshan, Baishazhou, and Zhuankou areas, and the most significant subsidence occurred in Baishazhou, reaching an annual subsidence rate of 41.0 mm/a with accumulated subsidence of 219.4 mm., The subsidence was more significant in the carbonate solution zone with the overlying Holocene strata compared to the rest carbonate karst belts. Analysis shows thatland building construction is a major reason for land subsidence in Wuhan. The construction of subway underground stations is another factor causing land subsidence. The effect of water level fluctuations of the Yangtze River on long-term trends is negligible. Our study provides further insight into the temporal-spatial pattern of Wuhan's displacements and suggests that the land subsidence should be continuously monitored for alleviation of potential destructive hazards, especially during the period of construction of a land building, such as residential, public facilities, and subway.

TI  - Error budget analysis of geocoding and geometric correction for KOMPSAT-5 SAR imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geocoding geometrically rectifies a remote sensing image according to a specific map projection, and is an essential process for utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images. The accuracy of geocoding is affected by various intercorrelated error sources. In this study, we propose a framework for improving the geocoding accuracy of SAR images. Our framework consists of two major theoretical and computational steps: 1) calculating and setting the error budget of the SAR image geocoding accuracy and checking their quality and 2) applying a geometric correction model if the quality is lower than the predefined threshold. Error budget analysis was performed by utilizing the law of variance propagation, considering the correlations among the primary error sources. During the second (geometric correction) step, the non-multicollinearity (N-MC) model, a ground control point (GCP)-based geometric correction model without multicollinearity, was proposed. Experiments were conducted using two KOMPSAT-5 SAR images from Daejeon City, Korea to verify the framework. The geocoding accuracy of SAR images #1 and #2 exceeded the error budgets of all confidence levels, except for the row direction of SAR image #2, despite the vendor's internal calibration. In the second step, two SAR images were geometrically corrected by applying the N-MC model. The use of geometric correction improved the geocoding accuracy of the two SAR images by approximately two to five pixels in the row and column directions. The final geocoding accuracy of the SAR images was within the error budget.

TI  - A snow cover mapping algorithm based on a multitemporal dataset for GK-2A imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow plays a crucial role in the climate. In particular, snow controls the surface temperature and stabilizes the energy budget due to its spectral characteristics. However, snow can be affected by climate change. If the snow cover extent (SCE) diminishes due to global warming, the rate of introducing radiance to the surface increases because non-snow areas can absorb more solar radiance. Therefore, it is highly important to accurately detect snow-covered areas. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for deriving a daily snow cover map of East Asia using Geostationary-Korean Multi-Purpose SATellite-2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A, GK-2A) imagery. After processes for cloud masking and misclassification removal are conducted, a threshold with consideration for the characteristics of a geostationary satellite is applied to the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and a daily snow cover map is generated utilizing a stacking process. In the case of the cloud mask, the angle-time variation and displacement by clouds proposed in this study were used to enhance the accuracy of cloud detection. For the quantitative validation, the F1 score was 0.89 for Landsat-8 and 0.79 for the interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system (IMS). In addition, when the snow cover extent calculated from the IMS was compared, the correlation reached 0.91 from December 2020 to January 2021.

TI  - An alternative approach to estimating agglomeration and productivity using geography, demography and evidence from satellite imagery
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we combine novel geographical, demographic and satellite data with an instrumental variables (IVs) estimation approach to tackle a thorny set of data and econometric issues. Studies of agglomeration effects on economic productivity at the city scale have been growing in popularity in both the literature and the interests of urban policymakers in recent years. Despite growing sophistication in econometric approaches, underlying weaknesses in the quality and availability of data at the city scale have hindered efforts to unravel the endogeneity issues, or circularity between city scale, amenity and productivity. We set out both to extend the agglomeration literature to the case of Australia - which hitherto has been lightly studied in this field - and to take advantage of Australia's unique geography and reliance on migration to drive population change. We also draw on satellite data measuring night-time luminosity as a proxy for economic productivity. We demonstrate the construction of convincing and robust IVs that proxy for population at the city scale. Our econometric estimates indicate that a 1% increase in city populations causes productivity to be enhanced by 0.24-1.70% on average.

TI  - Retrieval of eucalyptus planting history and stand age using random localization segmentation and continuous land-cover classification based on Landsat time-series data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining robust change-detection results and reconstructing planting history are important bases for conducting forest resource monitoring and management. The existence of multiple change points in a very short period can lead to a global segmentation method incorrectly locate the change points, because they could impact each other during model initialization. This is especially true for monitoring plantations such as eucalyptus, which has a unique growth cycle with short rotation periods and frequent disturbances. In this study, we proposed a method to find critical change points in a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series by combining random localization segmentation and the Chow test. Features of the NDVI time series calculated on the divided segments and change points were used to train a Random Forest classifier for continuous land-cover classification. The proposed method was successfully applied to a eucalyptus plantation for identifying the management history, including harvest time, generation, rotation cycle, and stand age. The results show that our method is robust for different lengths of NDVI time series, and can detect short-interval (cut and stability) change points more accurately than the global segmentation method. The overall accuracy of identification was 80.5%, and successive generations in 2021 were mainly first- and second-generation, accounting for 69.0% and 27.9% of the total eucalyptus area, respectively. The rotation cycle of eucalyptus plantation is usually 5-8 years for 66.9% of the total area. The eucalyptus age was accurately estimated with an R-2 value of 0.91 and RMSE of 13.3 months. One-year-old eucalyptus plantations accounted for the highest percentage of 14.5%, followed by seven-year-old plantations (12.9%). This study provides an important research basis for accurately monitoring the rotation processes of short-period plantations, assessing their timber yield and conducting carbon- and water-cycle research.

TI  - Multi-Scale Segmentation Method of Remote Sensing Big Data Image Using Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Remote sensing image (RSI) segmentation is an effective method to interpret remote sensing information and an important means of remote sensing data information processing. Traditional RSI segmentation methods have some problems such as poor segmentation accuracy and low similarity difference measurement. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale segmentation (MSS) method for remote sensing big data image. First, the segmentation scale of RSI is divided, and the quantitative value of histogram band is used to calculate the similarity index between different objects; Second, the parameters in the same spot are improved based on the maximum area method to determine the shape factor of RSI; Finally, the object closure model is established to clarify the region conversion cost, and the RSI is dynamically segmented based on Multi-scale convolutional neural networks; The MSS algorithm of RSI is designed, and the MSS method of RSI is obtained. The results show that the maximum similarity difference measure of the proposed method is 0.648, and the similarity difference measure always remains the largest. The maximum recall of RSI is 0.954, and the highest recall is 0.988, indicating that the RSI segmentation accuracy of the proposed method is good.

TI  - Time-series surface water reconstruction method (TSWR) based on spatial distance relationship of multi-stage water boundaries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal continuity of surface water datasets widely known for its significance in the surface water dynamic monitoring and assessments, are faced with drawbacks like cloud influence, which hinders the direct extraction of data from time-series remote sensing images. This study proposes a Time-series Surface Water Reconstruction method (TSWR). The initial stage of this method involves the effective use of remote sensing images to automatically construct multi-stage surface water boundaries based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). Then, we reconstructed regions the reconstruction of regions with missing water pixels using the distance relationship between the multi-stage water boundaries in previous and later periods. When applied to 10 large rivers around the world, this method yielded an overall accuracy of 98% for water extraction, an RMSE of 0.41 km(2). Furthermore, time-series reconstruction tests conducted in 2020 on the Lancang and Danube rivers revealed a significant improvement in the image availability. These findings demonstrated that this method could not only be used to accurately reconstruct the surface water distribution missing water images, but also to depict a more pronounced time variation characteristic. The successful application of this method on GEE demonstrates its importance for use on large scales or in global studies.

TI  - <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Rituximab sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy, the effective technique avoids axillary dissection and predicts prognosis in 533 cutaneous melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the efficiency of a novel lymph node radiotracer Tc-99m-rituximab in sentinel lymph node (SLN) lymphoscintigraphy and SLN biopsy (SLNB), and the influence of SLNB results on the prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) patients. Methods A retrospective study was performed on 533 patients with CMM who underwent lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB. All patients received a preoperative peritumoral injection of 11.1-18.5 MBq of Tc-99m-rituximab 0.5 to 1 h before lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB. Results The detection rate of lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB was both 99.81% (532/533), and the average number of detected SLNs was 2.1 (range 1 to 8) and 2.7 (range 1 to 11) per patient, respectively. 12.1% SLNs and 22.2% patients were found metastatic, with an average of 1.5 (range 1 to 5) metastatic SLNs per patient. The SLN metastatic rates were different in patients with different Breslow thickness, Clark levels, ulceration, mitotic counts, and HMB45 expression (p < 0.05). Ninety patients were proceeded with the regional lymph node dissection (RLND) after SLNB, and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of SLNB in metastatic diagnosis is 97.4, 100 and 96.7%, respectively. And SLNs with metastases was an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS by multivariate prognostic analyses (HR was 5.9 and 4.3, p < 0.001). For patients with metastatic SLNs, the non-SLNs with metastasis and non-SLNs without metastasis in RLND, and observation groups showed different mean PFS as 14.9, 24.8 and 25.5 months (p = 0.018), but no statistically significant difference existed in the OS. ConclusionThe novel radiotracer Tc-99m-rituximab could identify SLNs specifically in SLN lymphoscintigraphy and SLNB in CMM patients, and the pathology obtained from SLNB rather than from RLND better indicated the staging and long-term prognosis.

TI  - Impervious surface expansion in the China-Laos border area under the context of geo-economic cooperation: a case study of the Mohan-Boten Economic Cooperation Zone
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geo-economic cooperation among neighboring countries has promoted landscape changes across their borders, including impervious surface expansion and/or agriculture-forest conversion, which are often presented but usually ignored. Short-revisit multispectral imagery lays a foundation for delineating these gradual or seasonal landscape changes in border regions. China-Laos Mohan-Boten Economic Cooperation Zone (ECZ), which has been launched in March 2016, has recently witnessed a rapid expansion of impervious surfaces. In this study, Sentinel-2 A/B 10 m images over the Mohan-Boten ECZ from 2017 to 2021, and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm, which combines spatial filtering and temporal consistency check, have been utilized to identify, correct and reconstruct monthly time-series of impervious surface area (ISA). In addition, the patterns and characteristics of impervious surface expansion under the context of China-Laos geo-economic cooperation have been analyzed and the response of impervious surface expansion to geo-economic cooperation has been evaluated. The results show that Mohan-Boten ECZ and China-Laos Railway are two geo-economic contributors to the expansion of impervious surface in both sides of the border. ISA in the ECZ nearly doubled in only five years. ISA in the Boten side expanded much faster than that of the Mohan side in the first half of the study period and exceeded its counterpart for the first time in February 2019. Moreover, the scale and rates of expansion in the dry seasons were much larger in both sides. Three expansion patterns were recognized in the ECZ. This study highlights the potentials of time-series stack of land cover products in quantifying the impacts of geo-economic cooperation on land use change in border areas and in clarifying how border land use change responds to geo-economic cooperation and/or competition.

TI  - Evaluation of nine machine learning methods for estimating daily land surface radiation budget from MODIS satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The all-wave net radiation (Rn) at the land surface represents surface radiation budget and plays an important role in the Earth's energy and water cycles. Many studies have been conducted to estimate from satellite top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data using various methods, particularly the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). However, few studies have been conducted to provide a comprehensive evaluation about various ML and DL methods in retrieving. Based on extensive in situ measurements distributed at mid-low latitudes, the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA observations, and the daily from the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) used as a priori knowledge, this study assessed nine models for daily estimation, including six classic ML methods (random forest -RF, adaptive boosting - Adaboost, extreme gradient boosting -XGBoost, multilayer perceptron -MLP, radial basis function neural network -RBF, and support vector machine -SVM) and three DL methods (multilayer perceptron neural network with stacked autoencoders -SAE, deep belief network -DBN and residual neural network -ResNet). The validation results showed that the three DL methods were generally better than the six ML methods except XGBoost, although they all performed poorly in certain conditions such as winter days, rugged terrain, and high elevation. ResNet had the most robust performance across different land cover types, elevations, seasons, and latitude zones, but it has disadvantages in practice because of its highly configurable implementation environment and low computational efficiency. The estimated daily values from all nine models were more accurate than the corresponding Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product.

TI  - A new method for surface water extraction using multi-temporal Landsat 8 images based on maximum entropy model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral matching algorithm based on the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm (SMDPSO) sometimes overestimates extracted surface water areas. Here we constructed a new method (MEDPSO) by coupling discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to extract water bodies using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. To compare the accuracy of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), SMDPSO, and MEDPSO, we selected six areas , i.e. thermokarst lakes, Coongie Lakes National Park, the Amazon River, urban water bodies mixed with buildings, Erhai Lake that is surrounded by mountains, and high-altitude lakes. Our results show that the average overall accuracy of the MEDPSO for the six areas is 97.4%, which is higher than those of MNDWI and SMDPSO. The average commission errors and omission errors of MEDPSO (6.4% and 0.8%) are lower than those of MNDWI and SMDPSO. The MEDPSO has a higher accuracy because the maximum entropy model is a machine learning method that uses all the bands of Landsat imagery and four surface water indices in the calculation of the probability of surface water. Our study established a novel, high-precision water extraction method.

TI  - A forest type-specific threshold method for improving forest disturbance and agent attribution mapping
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting forest disturbances and attributing their contributing agents with Landsat time series (LTS) images has advanced substantially in recent years; however, whether different forest types require individual disturbance indices or specific disturbance thresholds to accurately map forest disturbances and their causes over a vast region remains limited known. This study investigated the effectiveness of six spectral indices (SIs) and two threshold methods (a forest-specific threshold and a common threshold) for detecting forest disturbances among four forest types, namely, evergreen broad-leaved forests (EBFs), cold-temperate evergreen needle-leaved forests (CENFs), and subtropical evergreen needle-leaved forests mainly dominated by Pinus yunnanensis (SENF1) or Pinus kesiya (SENF2), across Yunnan Province with the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm and yearly Landsat time series (LTS) recorded from 1990 to 2020. A random forest (RF) model was applied to classify the forest disturbance agents from aggregated patches of disturbed forest pixels. The results indicated that the normalized burn ratio (NBR) outperformed the five other SIs and achieved consistently high overall accuracies (OAs; 93.04%+/- 0.17% to 96.09%+/- 0.28%) when mapping forest disturbances across all four forest types. The forest-specific NBR disturbance thresholds led to considerable increases in overall (0.14-3.92%), producer (0.25-13.47%) and user accuracies (0.88-3.01%). The total mapped area of disturbed forest was 9831.48 km(2) (5.31%), of which approximately 79% occurred in the EBF and SENF1 distribution areas. Forest disturbances were predominantly caused by wildfires in CENF and SENF1 and by commodity-driven plantations in EBF and SENF2; these two agents together contributed approximately 93.15% of the forest disturbances in Yunnan province. These findings highlight that the optimal selection of SIs and forest-specific disturbance thresholds can significantly improve forest disturbance detection performance.

TI  - Slight change of glaciers in the Pamir over the period 2000-2017
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Pamir are the water tower of arid Central Asia, and more than 50 million people depend on meltwater from them. Many studies have reported glacier changes in the Pamir, but the glacier inventories employed in the previous investigations are both outdated and lack comparability. In this study, we present a new multitemporal glacier inventory for the Pamir based primarily on the Landsat ETM+/OLI scenes from the period around 2000 and 2017. Glacier outlines in 2000 and 2017 were delineated manually using Landsat images, SRTM digital elevation model (DEM), and high-resolution Google Earth images, using the same criteria and methods. We mapped 12,186 glaciers covering 10,396.20 +/- 421.16 km(2) in 2017 for the Pamir and demonstrated that the Pamir lost 124.28 +/- 81.33 km(2) of its glacier areas with a shrinkage rate of 1.17 +/- 0.77 percent or 0.07 +/- 0.05 percent center dot a(-1) from 2000 to 2017. Based on the new inventories and the existing elevation change data sets of High Mountain Asia (HMA) from 2000 to 2016, we calculated a weaker glacier mass loss of -0.05 +/- 0.06 m w.e. a(-1). Spatial heterogeneity of glacier changes has been found in both the area and mass balance, but our results still suggest that the Pamir glaciers changed slightly since 2000.

TI  - Capturing the crack process of the Antarctic A74 iceberg with Sentinel-1 based offset tracking and radar interferometry techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the crack process of the A74 iceberg is carefully monitored in different aspects by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, a offset tracking strategy is designed to retrieve the temporal evolution of the glacier velocity field. Secondly, a signal coherence factor (SCF) is proposed to analyze the interferometric signals. The resulting SCF maps can present a more distinct rupture pattern than the SAR magnitude images, which enables the development of rift to be tracked more precisely. Thirdly, a new approach is proposed to explore the temporal change of the ice flow. Since this approach is based on interferometric phase signals, it is more sensitive than the offset tracking technique. Consequently, the abnormal variation signals associated with the rupture process can be discovered from the experimental results in an earlier stage. The results also show that the area with abnormal signals is almost identical to the region of the calved ice, which demonstrates that the scale of the iceberg might be predicted at least two months before the rupture event. Furthermore, such a consistent pattern may indicate a total alteration of ice characteristics, implying that the complete separation between A74 and BIS is inevitable.

TI  - Mapping the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 of global terrestrial systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) is a useful tool to analyze the carbon balance of different areas. Since it is impossible to measure NEE in-situ at a regional or global scale, this study has conducted a NEE estimation model to map the NEE of global terrestrial systems. By training the model with 2774 series of data collected from the database of AmeriFlux and Fluxnet, and relevant studies, the model has achieved a substantial global NEE estimation with R2 = 0.60, 0.68, and 0.67 for arable land, forest, and grassland systems. According to the estimation, the average annual global NEE was-18.41 billion tons C. Asia was the continent who had the highest NEE (33.93% of global NEE), and forests were the ecosystems who contributed most to global CO2 absorption (51.75% of global NEE). When comparing with the global CO2 emissions, the model results also showed that Asia, North America, and Europe have run out of their ecosystem potential to absorb the CO2 emitted. The countries with top 10 greatest C emission had smaller effective NEEs to deal with their own emitted C except Russia and Canada. Considering the economic contribution of different countries, NEE estimation model could be a helpful tool to achieve a better fairness of controlling C emission tasks by considering both C emission gen-eration and natural C emission handling ability.

TI  - Satellite and instrument entity recognition using a pre-trained language model with distant supervision
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observations, especially satellite data, have produced a wealth of methods and results in meeting global challenges, often presented in unstructured texts such as papers or reports. Accurate extraction of satellite and instrument entities from these unstructured texts can help to link and reuse Earth observation resources. The direct use of an existing dictionary to extract satellite and instrument entities suffers from the problem of poor matching, which leads to low recall. In this study, we present a named entity recognition model to automatically extract satellite and instrument entities from unstructured texts. Due to the lack of manually labeled data, we apply distant supervision to automatically generate labeled training data. Accordingly, we fine-tune the pre-trained language model with early stopping and a weighted cross-entropy loss function. We propose the dictionary-based self-training method to correct the incomplete annotations caused by the distant supervision method. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both precision and recall compared to dictionary matching or standard adaptation of pre-trained language models.

TI  - Urban hazards caused by ground deformation and building subsidence over fossil lake beds: a study from Taipei City
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread land subsidence has become an increasing problem in urban areas worldwide and is caused by a combination of effects, of which in particular climate change, growing urbanization trends, and unbalanced groundwater extraction are considered to be the primary ones. While groundwater extraction can be a dominant reason for inland subsidence, other factors comprise excessive surface load of buildings or unsuitable substrate for foundations. In this study, a closer look is taken at Taipei City, which has been facing challenges of ground subsidence, and whose ground movement has been investigated using time series of Sentinel-1 remote sensing data. The results indicate that a specific region of the city experiences significant surface subsidence in local areas of former (dormant) river and lake beds with rates of up to 60 mm between 2017 and 2020. Furthermore, a precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity of deformation was identified upon combination of precipitation and groundwater level data. It can be shown that widespread monitoring using remote-sensing data is a feasible tool to identify and track locations exposed to subsidence hazards for urban planning and urban development phases in the future.

TI  - A comparative analysis of modeling approaches and canopy height-based data sources for mapping forest growing stock volume in a northern subtropical ecosystem of China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar has been regarded as the most accurate data source for forest-growing stock volume (FGSV) estimation, but inconsistent acquisition dates of lidar data with field survey often result in poor FGSV estimation accuracy. Spaceborne stereo imagery is captured at regular intervals, providing new opportunities for mapping and updating FGSV spatial distributions. Digital Surface Model derived from spaceborne stereo imagery and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) derived from airborne lidar can be used together to produce a canopy height model (CHM) (LS-CHM), which can then be used to predict FGSV spatial distributions, but this methodology has yet to be explored. Our research attempts to compare the performance of LS-CHM and lidar-CHM (L-CHM) for FGSV modeling and to explore the advantages of using the hierarchical Bayesian approach (HBA) over traditional linear regression and random forest modeling approaches when sample size is small. Considering different forest types and topographical conditions, as well as the number of sample plots for each forest type, HBA is used to develop the FGSV estimation model, and the results are compared with those from linear regression and random forest approaches. The research results in a northern subtropical forest ecosystem indicate that overall, L-CHM provides better predictions than LS-CHM using the same modeling approaches, and L-CHM is especially valuable when FGSV is small or large, but when FGSV falls within 100-200 m(3)/ha, LS-CHM-based variables produce better modeling accuracy than L-CHM-based variables using linear regression or HBA. The HBA based on stratification of both forest type and slope aspect provides the best FGSV estimation, using either L-CHM or LS-CHM, and solves the modeling problem due to limited sample sizes for forest types. Our research provides new insights to using the combination of satellite stereo images and lidar-derived DTM for mapping and updating FGSV in a large area.

TI  - Mapping burned areas and land-uses in Kangaroo Island using an object-based image classification framework and Landsat 8 Imagery from Google Earth Engine
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - In Australia, fire has become part of the natural ecosystem. Severe fires have devastated Australia's unique forest ecosystems due to the global climate change. In this study, we integrated a multi-resolution segmentation method and a hierarchical classification framework based on expert-based knowledge to classify the burned areas and land-uses in Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Using an object-based image classification framework that combines colour and shape features from input layers, we demonstrated that the objects segmented from the multi-source data lead to a higher accuracy in classification with an overall accuracy of 90.2% and a kappa coefficient of 85.2%. On the other hand, the single source data from post-fire Landsat-8 imagery showed an overall accuracy of 87.4% which is also statistically acceptable. According to our experiment results, more than 30.44% of the study area was burned during the 2019-2020 'Black-Summer' fire season in Australia. Among the burned areas, high severity accounted for 12.14%, moderate severity for 11.48%, while low severity was 6.82%. For unburned areas, farmland accounted for 45.52% of the study area, of which about one-third was affected by the disturbances other than fire. The remaining area consists of 19.42% unaffected forest, 3.48% building and bare land, and 1.14% water. The comparison analysis shows that our object-based image classification framework takes full advantage of the multi-source data and generates the edges of burned areas more clearly, which contributes to the improved fire management and control.

TI  - Simultaneous retrieval of land surface temperature and emissivity from the FengYun-4A advanced geosynchronous radiation imager
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper extends a new temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm for retrieving land surface temperature and emissivity (LST and LSE) to the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard Fengyun-4A, China's newest geostationary meteorological satellite. The extended TES algorithm was named the AGRI TES algorithm. The AGRI TES algorithm employs a modified water vapor scaling (WVS) method and a recalibrated empirical function over vegetated surfaces. In situ validation and cross-validation are utilized to investigate the accuracy of the retrieved LST and LSE. LST validation using the collected field measurements showed that the mean bias and RMSE of AGRI TES LST are 0.58 and 2.93 K in the daytime and -0.30 K and 2.18 K at nighttime, respectively; the AGRI official LST is systematically underestimated. Compared with the MODIS LST and LSE products (MYD21), the average bias and RMSE of AGRI TES LST are -0.26 K and 1.65 K, respectively. The AGRI TES LSE outperforms the AGRI official LSE in terms of accuracy and spatial integrity. This study demonstrates the good performance of the AGRI TES algorithm for the retrieval of high-quality LST and LSE, and the potential of the AGRI TES algorithm in producing operational LST and LSE products.

M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the weak information about cultural targets in the complex marine environment, an omission problem exists in large-scale mariculture extraction using single-view and single-source images. To overcome this problem, we developed a mariculture extraction method that combines dense time-series Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data. A high-precision Chinese mariculture distribution map for 2020 was produced with an overall accuracy of 94.00% and a kappa coefficient of 0.91. The results show that (1) the total area of mariculture was 1173249.22 ha on the national scale, which was significantly larger than the previous studies (459595.70 and 205920.28 ha, respectively), with Shandong Province (39.09%) having the largest proportion; (2) China's mariculture presented a spatial distribution characteristic of 'Denser North and Sparser South', and mariculture was centralized in the coastal zones of the northern provinces (60.76%) rather than the southern provinces; (3) the official production statistics and remote sensing-derived mariculture area revealed a highly corresponding trend at the provincial level, with an R-2 reaching 0.78, which is much higher than the 0.07 and 0.41 values of the comparison data. The results directly provide data reference for mariculture production estimation and site selection or ideas for mariculture extraction in other regions and globally.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data are fundamental for environmental remote sensing applications; however, their quality is often influenced by complicated factors such as atmospheric aerosols and cloud coverage. Hence, in the current study, a robust reconstruction method based on envelope detection and the Savitzky-Golay filter (ED-SG) was developed to reduce noise in the NDVI time-series. To verify the performance of ED-SG, simulation experiments were implemented and NDVI time-series samples were selected for different land cover types derived from MOD09GQ, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI of Yangtze River Basin, between December 2018 and December 2019. The experimental results yielded an agreement coefficient and variance of 0.9599 and 0.0006, respectively on simulated time-series, Additionally, the smoothness metrics of evergreen broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, herbaceous, and croplands were 0.0019, 0.0017, 0.0012, 0.0012, and 0.0013, respectively. Ultimately, the reconstructed time-series metrics showed significant improvements in robustness and smoothness over conventional methods. Moreover, the simplistic mechanisms of the ED-SG model enabled it to run effectively in the Google Earth Engine over the NDVI time-series of the whole Yangtze River Basin.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important agroecological physiological parameter affecting vegetation growth. To apply the genetic algorithms neural network model (GANNM) to the remote sensing inversion of winter wheat LAI throughout the growth cycle and based on GaoFen-3 Synthetic aperture radar (GF-3 SAR) images and GaoFen-1 Wide Field of View (GF-1 WFV) images, the Xiangfu District in the east of Kaifeng City, Henan Province, was selected as the testing region. Winter wheat LAI data from five growth stages were combined, and optical and microwave polarization decomposition vegetation index models were used. The backscattering coefficient was extracted by modified water cloud model (MWCM), and the LAI was obtained by MWCM inversion as input factors to construct GANNM to invert LAI. The root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R (2)) were used as evaluation indicators of the model. The fitting accuracy of winter wheat LAI in five growth stages by GANNM inversion was better than that of the BP neural network model; the R (2) was higher than 0.8, and RMSE was lower than 0.3, indicating that the model could accurately invert the growth status of winter wheat in five growth stages .

TI  - Snow detection in alpine regions with Convolutional Neural Networks: discriminating snow from cold clouds and water body
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately monitoring the variation of snow cover from remote sensing is vital since it assists in various fields including prediction of floods, control of runoff values, and the ice regime of rivers. Spectral indices methods are traditional ways to realize snow segmentation, including the most common one - the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), which utilizes the combination of green and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. In addition, spectral indices methods heavily depend on the optimal threshold to determine the accuracy, making it time-consuming to find optimal values for different places. Convolutional neural networks ensemble model with DeepLabV3+ was employed as sub-models for snow segmentation using (Sentinel-2), which aims to distinguish clouds and water body from snow. The imagery dataset generated in this article contains sites in global alpine regions such as Tibetan Plateau in China, the Alps in Switzerland, Alaska in the United States, Southern Patagonian Icefield in Chile, Tsylos Provincial Park, Tatsamenie Peak, and Dalton Peak in Canada. To overcome the limitation of DeepLabV3+, which only accepts three channels as input features, and the need to use six features: green, red, blue, near-infraRed, SWIR, and NDSI, 20 three-channel DeepLabV3+ sub-models, were constructed with different combinations of three features and then ensembled together. The proposed ensemble model showed superior performance than benchmark spectral indices method, with mIoU values ranging from 0.8075 to 0.9538 in different test sites. The results of this project contribute to the development of automated snow segmentation tools to assist earth observation applications.

TI  - Characterization of spatio-temporal patterns of grassland utilization intensity in the Selinco watershed of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2001 to 2019 based on multisource remote sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations of spatial quantification methods, the spatio-temporal patterns of grassland utilization intensity (GUI) in the Selinco watershed (SLCW), the core region of ecological security on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, is unclear under multiple utilization modes. This paper quantified GUI by constructing the association between the potential and actual Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of grasslands in terms of interannual variability. To obtain an accurate spatio-temporal dataset of potential EVI, the following two components were considered on. Firstly, the temporal lag effects of each raw climate factor were investigated to determine the optimal climate variables affecting vegetation productivity. Secondly, four machine learning (ML) algorithms, including an artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and gradient boosting regression tree combined with the Bayesian model average, were used to construct grassland potential EVI models involving EVI, grassland type, and environmental factors (topography, soil, raw climate, and bioclimatic). Meanwhile, to maximize the performance of ML models, variable selection, variable transformation, and hyperparameter optimization were systematically implemented, where the hyperparameter optimization algorithms employ the grid search algorithm, Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization. Then, the spatio-temporal dataset of GUI in the SLCW from 2001 to 2019 was established by using the above quantification method based on multisource remote sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms. The analysis of spatio-temporal variation in GUI showed that the implementation of ecological restoration projects leads to a significant and rapid decline in the overall GUI of the SLCW after 2010 (declining by 4.8%), which is more obvious in the non-nature reserve (declining by 9.3%). In the Qiangtang Nature Reserve within the SLCW, although the GUI shows a declining trend after 2010 because of the implementation of ecological restoration projects, it shows an insignificant increase from 2001 to 2019 due to the recovery increase of wildlife populations in recent decades. Besides, by exploring the effects of elevation and slope on the GUI, it is found that grasslands on higher slopes at lower elevations are at a greater risk of degradation due to more intensive grassland utilization.

TI  - Satellite based bio-thermal impact insights into MSW open dumps: a pair-unified proximity scenario
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions from open Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dumps are a serious threat to ecology in their close vicinity. Proper assessment of associated damage and its radial extent of influence constitute basic information to plan a sustainable remedial approach. This study emphasizes on twin dumping facilities as unified source of pollution in a geotechnical environment, and is limited to the use of freely available medium resolution satellite imagery to provide alternative of expensive ground measurements for obtaining base-level monitoring data to aid decision support systems in developing world. Proximity statistics have been applied to products derived from Landsat-8, with range and severity of hazardous influence being computed using curve flattening analysis of distance dependent profiles of various products. The combined average bio-influence and thermal-influence ranges of pair-unified dumps are 705 m and 1035 m, respectively. The developed methodology leads towards deeper understanding of seasonal changes in the influence zones, correlation amongst the two types of influence zones and relationship between severity and range of influence. The proximity statistical sequence has rendered the analysis sensitive enough to distinguish land covers having potential to cause misinterpretation of results by introducing effects in the bio-thermal continuum, similar to those of MSW emissions.

TI  - Filtering ground noise from LiDAR returns produces inferior models of forest aboveground biomass in heterogenous landscapes
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne LiDAR has become an essential data source for large-scale, high-resolution modeling of forest aboveground biomass and carbon stocks, enabling predictions with much higher resolution and accuracy than can be achieved using optical imagery alone. Ground noise filtering - that is, excluding returns from LiDAR point clouds based on simple height thresholds - is a common practice meant to improve the `signal' content of LiDAR returns by preventing ground returns from masking useful information about tree size and condition contained within canopy returns. However, ground returns may be helpful for making accurate aboveground biomass predictions in heterogeneous landscapes that include a patchy mosaic of vegetation heights and land cover types. In this paper, we applied several ground noise filtering thresholds while mapping forest AGB across New York State (USA), a heterogenous landscape composed of both contiguously forested and highly fragmented areas with mixed land cover types. We fit random forest models to predictor sets derived from each filtering intensity threshold and compared model accuracies, paying attention to how changes in accuracy correlated with landscape structure. We observed that removing ground noise via any height threshold systematically biases many of the LiDAR-derived variables used in AGB modeling, with mean correlation (Spearman's rho ) between variables increasing from 0.183 to 0.266. We found that that ground noise filtering yields models of forest AGB with lower accuracy than models trained using predictors derived from unfiltered point clouds, with RMSE increasing by up to 2.2 Mg ha(-1) statewide. Although we only modeled AGB for forest cover types, models fit to predictors derived from filtered point clouds performed worse as landscape heterogeneity (as measured by patch density and edge density) increased, suggesting ground returns are particularly useful when modeling edge forests. Our results suggest that ground filtering should be a carefully considered decision when mapping forest AGB, particularly when mapping heterogeneous and highly fragmented landscapes, as ground returns are more likely to represent useful `signal' than extraneous `noise' in these cases.

TI  - Progressive destabilization and triggering mechanism analysis using multiple data for Chamoli rockslide in 7 February 2021
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic rockslide occurred on 7 February 2021 in Chamoli area in the high Himalaya. In the absence of field data, multiple satellites data of decade span have been used to investigate and understand the progressive destabilization of rockslide body. A 3D geometric model was developed using geospatial information about geology, terrain, and ice cover to understand the triggering mechanism. Several causes are uncovered as: the pronounced long-term change of land surface temperature facilitated local permafrost degradation and led to ice cover shrinking since 2010; the occurrence of ice avalanche nearby in 2016 accompanying with sidewall-to-bedrock fracturing enhanced the ice segregation beneath the rockslide body; and the development of side cracks in early February 2021 led to dropping of side support and percolating of surface water. Heavy precipitation several days before favoured the destabilization, top-corner cracks developing and top-side bergschrund breaking abruptly two days before, and ice strength reduction owing air temperature rising few hours before the event triggered finally the rockslide. The frequent disasters such as cloudburst, extreme precipitation, landslides, and snow avalanches responding to global warming and climate change in the Himalayan region needs immediate attention to the chain-like geohazards and collaborative observation with satellites and other platforms.

TI  - DESIGN THINKING AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR ARCHITECTURAL PEDAGOGY: Challenges and benefits for Ghanaian schools
T2  - COGENT ARTS & HUMANITIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Design Thinking is a methodological advent to design, acknowledged in many design schools, and marketing establishments. This design approach although recognized as efficient in several business avenues, is not noticeable in architectural pedagogy in Ghana. This paper employs an exploratory study, aimed at identifying the current concepts used in architectural teaching and learning, as well as challenges encountered by students who refer to the Design Thinking approach. Ghanaian students will also be enlightened about its potential to significantly improve creativity and ingenuity. Considering reviewed literature reveals diminutive application of Design Thinking process in architectural pedagogy, this study recommends further research in the adaptation of the Design Thinking methodology in architectural design. The pragmatic philosophical worldview is what drives my research. This is because it is concerned with applications and solutions to problems. Instead of focusing on methods, researchers emphasize the research problem and use all approaches available to understand the task.

TI  - A systematic review on the use of remote sensing technologies in quantifying grasslands ecosystem services
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The last decade has seen considerable progress in scientific research on vegetation ecosystem services. While much research has focused on forests and wetlands, grasslands also provide a variety of different provisioning, supporting, cultural, and regulating services. With recent advances in remote sensing technology, there is a possibility that Earth observation data could contribute extensively to research on grassland ecosystem services. This study conducted a systematic review on progress, emerging gaps, and opportunities on the application of remote sensing technologies in quantifying all grassland ecosystem services including those that are related to water. The contribution of biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Canopy Storage Capacity (CSC) as water-related ecosystem services derived from grasslands was explored. Two hundred and twenty-two peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science, Scopus, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers were analyzed. About 39% of the studies were conducted in Asia with most of the contributions coming from China while a few studies were from the global south regions such as Southern Africa. Overall, forage provision, climate regulation, and primary production were the most researched grassland ecosystem services in the context of Earth observation data applications. About 39 Earth observation sensors were used in the literature to map grassland ecosystem services and MODIS had the highest utilization frequency. The most widely used vegetation indices for mapping general grassland ecosystem services in literature included the red and near-infrared sections of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remote sensing algorithms used within the retrieved literature include process-based models, machine learning algorithms, and multivariate techniques. For water-related grassland ecosystem services, biomass, CSC, and LAI were the most prominent proxies characterized by remotely sensed data for understanding evapotranspiration, infiltration, run-off, soil water availability, groundwater restoration and surface water balance. An understanding of such hydrological processes is crucial in providing insights on water redistribution and balance within grassland ecosystems which is important for water management.

TI  - Using high-resolution imagery and deep learning to classify land-use following deforestation: a case study in Ethiopia
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National-scale assessments of post-deforestation land-use are crucial for decreasing deforestation and forest degradation-related emissions. In this research, we assess the potential of different satellite data modalities (single-date, multi-date, multi-resolution, and an ensemble of multi-sensor images) for classifying land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia using the U-Net deep neural network architecture enhanced with attention. We performed the analysis on satellite image data retrieved across Ethiopia from freely available Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Planet-NICFI satellite data. The experiments aimed at an analysis of (a) single-date images from individual sensors to account for the differences in spatial resolution between image sensors in detecting land-uses, (b) ensembles of multiple images from different sensors (Planet-NICFI/Sentinel-2/Landsat-8) with different spatial resolutions, (c) the use of multi-date data to account for the contribution of temporal information in detecting land-uses, and, finally, (d) the identification of regional differences in terms of land-use following deforestation in Ethiopia. We hypothesize that choosing the right satellite imagery (sensor) type is crucial for the task. Based on a comprehensive visually interpreted reference dataset of 11 types of post-deforestation land-uses, we find that either detailed spatial patterns (single-date Planet-NICFI) or detailed temporal patterns (multi-date Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) are required for identifying land-use following deforestation, while medium-resolution single-date imagery is not sufficient to achieve high classification accuracy. We also find that adding soft-attention to the standard U-Net improved the classification accuracy, especially for small-scale land-uses. The models and products presented in this work can be used as a powerful data resource for governmental and forest monitoring agencies to design and monitor deforestation mitigation measures and data-driven land-use policy.

TI  - Improved forest cover mapping by harmonizing multiple land cover products over China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine resolution land cover products are becoming increasingly more available for many regions. These products, however, may not meet the quality requirements of many applications. This study provides an approach for improving land cover mapping by leveraging existing products and clear view Landsat composites. Assessments using independent reference datasets revealed that the CAF-LC30 2020 product derived using this approach over China was more accurate than four existing land cover products. Its overall accuracy with field observations was 2.94% to 10.28% higher than those of the four existing land cover products in northeast China and was 2.10% to 8.18% better across China. It provided a more accurate representation of the land cover types in many regions where the existing land cover products had large classification errors. Forest areas calculated using the CAF-LC30 2020 for the 31 provinces and autonomous regions and municipalities (PARM) in mainland China were better correlated with those reported by the most recent National Forest Inventory (NFI) survey than areas calculated using the other four existing land cover products. Therefore, the CAF-LC30 2020 product should be a better alternative for understanding China's forests in 2020 than the other four existing land cover products.

TI  - Estimation of the total dry aboveground biomass in the tropical forests of Congo Basin using optical, LiDAR, and radar data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this investigation, optical (SPOT-7 NAOMI), airborne LiDAR, and PolInSAR L-band data, along with forest inventories, were employed to develop models for estimating total dry aboveground biomass (AGB) over the tropical forests in the Congo Basin (Gabon) of Central Africa. Remote sensing-based variables like texture (from SPOT), median canopy height (from LiDAR), and backscattering coefficient along with canopy surface heights (from PolInSAR) were used to estimate the AGB. These variables were used individually (or combined) to develop the AGB models based on the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach. Validation indicated that in case of the single variable models, the LiDAR-based model yielded the lowest estimation root-mean-square error (RMSE = 28%). The error decreased further when the median canopy height was combined with the texture or with the radar variables (RMSE <25%). The texture derived from the Fourier transform textural ordination (FOTO) approach was more effective in improving the results as compared to the gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) approach. Model validation indicated that the best performance in AGB estimation was achieved by combining optical, LiDAR, and radar data (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 24%).

TI  - Classification of ground deformation using sentinel-1 persistent scatterer interferometry time series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Displacement time series (TS) provides temporal and spatial information related to ground deformation. This study aims to investigate temporal behavior of ground deformation TS, including classification of displacement trends and periodicity evaluation, which ease the interpretation of movements. To this end, we propose several modifications to an existing automatic classification workflow of Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) TS using new tests to classify ground deformations into seven main trends: Stable, Linear, Quadratic, Bilinear, Phase Unwrapping Errors (PUE), Discontinuous with constant and different velocities. We illustrate our approach over 1500 km(2) of the Granada region and the metropolitan area of Barcelona, which were monitored using Sentinel-1 images and a PSI technique. This study provided the spatial distribution of different ground movement types and was useful to detect several TS anomalies due to PUE. The proposed approach also identified stable targets, which were wrongly classified as moving scatterers by the existing classification method. A periodicity analysis was finally performed using the Welch's power spectral density estimator to investigate seasonal and yearly fluctuations. The method was validated using simulated data, where the classified TSs characterized by probable phase unwrapping errors were verified by PSI experts. The overall classification accuracy was 77.8%, indicating that the proposed method has a considerable TS classification potential.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal trends of satellite-based aerosol optical depth using Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator model
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are an inextricably linked component of the atmosphere. Nowadays the study of aerosols has attracted the attention of the world community due to the increasing concerns over air pollution and climate change. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is the measure of aerosols distributed within the atmospheric column from the Earth's surface to the top of the atmosphere. This study was conducted to examine the trend in AOD between latitudes 22 degrees and 24.62 degrees N, and longitudes 83.26 degrees and 87.01 degrees E, covering the entire part of the Indian state of Jharkhand. Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and Sen's slope estimator model were used to examining the trend over 18 years (period: 2000-2017) AOD data obtained from satellite-based sensor namely MODIS. The highest AOD was observed in the north-eastern part, while the lowest was observed in the state's southwestern part. The mean relative percentage change (RPC) analysis showed that the AOD increased from 20 to 60%. Jharkhand State comprises various sub-regions; all the sub-regions, including major cities, have shown a remarkable positive trend. In particular, Dhanbad, Sahibganj, Chaibasa, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, and Hazaribagh demonstrate statistically significant positive trends (99% confidence level). It was observed that the highest positive trend (0.1228) and the lowest negative trend (-0.02587) were in Sahibganj and Gumla districts, respectively. This study revealed a statistically robust significant correlated pattern of AOD with the variability of meteorological factors.

TI  - Glacial burst triggered by triangular wedge collapse: a study from Trisul Mountain near Ronti glacier valley
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan mountain ranges separate the Tibetan plateau from the Indian subcontinent, where challenging topography, ongoing orogeny, and weather conditions are significant factors behind mass movements. The detachment of a composite rock-ice mass occurred on 7-Feb-2021 over the north-eastern slope of the Trisul mountain resulting in devastation along the Rishiganga-Dhauliganga valley, Uttarakhand. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the failure mechanism of the overhang wedge, where prolonged glacial mobility is seen as a possible factor behind the formation of such a structure. The temporal movement (2020-2021; annual & seasonal) of metamorphosed ice is assessed using sub-pixel offset tracking of Sentinel-1A-GRD data. Kinematic analysis checks failure susceptibility due to joint sets within the rockmass. Slope stability analysis is performed using probabilistic back analysis for three values of coefficient of variation (CoV), i.e., 10%, 15%, and 20% considering cohesion (c) and angle of internal friction (phi) as random variables. The detachment impact is quantified using rockfall simulation and parameters such as maximum bounce height, total kinetic energy, and translational velocity. Finally, probabilistic analysis of parameters is performed that may be useful in developing a mitigation system.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry using machine learning and optimal Sentinel-2 imagery in South-West Florida coastal waters
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the use of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) in Sentinel-2 satellite in combination with regression-based random forest models to estimate bathymetry along the extended southwestern Florida nearshore region. In this study, we focused on the development of a framework leading to a generalized Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) model applicable to an extensive and diversified coastal region (>200 km of coastline) utilizing multi-date images. The model calibration and validation were done using airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB). As ALB surveys are very expensive to conduct, the proposed model was trained with a limited and practically feasible ALB data sample to expand the model's practicality. Out of the three different sub-models introduced using varying combinations of historical satellite imagery, the combined-band model with the largest feature pool yielded the highest accuracy. The results showed root mean square error (RMSE) values of 8% and lower for the 0-13.5 m depth range (limit of the lidar surveys used) for all areas of interest, indicating the model efficiency and adaptability to varying coastal characteristics. The influence of training sample locations on model performance was evaluated using three distinct model configurations. The difference between these configurations was less than 5 cm, which highlights the robustness of the proposed SDB model. The quality of the satellite imagery is a significant factor that influences the accuracy of the bathymetry estimation. A preliminary methodology incorporating spectral data embedded in Sentinel-2 imagery to effectively select the most optimal satellite imagery was also proposed in this study.

TI  - Axillary staging and management of cN plus breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: results of a survey among breast cancer surgeons in Spain
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Given the high rate of complete nodal response, the role of axillary lymph node dissection on staging the axilla has been questioned. This survey, addressed to breast cancer surgeons in Spain, has the objective of assessing current clinical trends on axillary staging of cN + patients treated with NAC. Methods An online survey was conducted among breast surgeons from the Spanish Society of Surgery (AEC), Spanish Surgical Oncology Society (SEOQ), Spanish Breast Cancer Surgeons Society (AECIMA) and Spanish Gynecology and Obstetrics Society (SEGO). It was structured in 5 sections: general information and clinical practice, knowledge of clinical trials, diagnosis work-up and nodal marking, axillary staging, and axillary treatment. Results 150 breast cancer surgeons completed the full survey (96.7%). 81.8% of respondents performed SLNB or targeted axillary dissection in cN1 patients treated with NAC. Radiological axillary response was the preferred parameter guiding the surgical strategy. The excision of the clipped node (92.0%), use of dual tracer (73.2%), and axillary US (65.9%) after treatment were the most important variables considered by respondents, to increase the accuracy of SLNB in cN + patients. Conclusion This survey confirms a trend toward a less invasive approach for axillary staging in cN + patients treated with NAC among breast cancer surgeons in Spain. While there is widespread agreement in less invasive approaches to axillary staging, there is, however, a lack of consensus around treatment strategy. Further, it shows a wide heterogeneity in their clinical practice. This study highlights the need for clear evidence concerning less invasive staging procedures and their oncological safety, to ensure consistent recommendations in surgical practice.

TI  - Paddy crop insurance using satellite-based composite index of crop performance
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The well-known area-yield crop insurance contract, guaranteeing a certain percent of normal yield over an insured area, is losing its effectiveness due to poor quality yield data. This paper introduces a "satellite-derived crop health index" as an alternative to yield data in such an insurance model. The new approach was implemented in the 2020 crop season, covering 3.5 million ha of paddy crop over 3200 Insurance Units in the West Bengal state of India. Data of Sentinel satellites, gridded weather data, and Mobile-app based field data were analyzed to generate paddy crop map and crop health indicators, namely NDVI, LSWI, Backscatter and FAPAR for the current (2020) and past years (2016-2019). Using the metrics derived from these indices and entropy technique, a composite index of crop performance called Crop Health Factor (CHF), ranging from 0-1, was generated. Deviations of CHF and yield between the years showed good correlation. The CHF data has successfully replaced the yield data for indemnity and pay-out assessments in 2020, as notified by the Government in advance. Thus, this project makes an entry point for developing remote sensing based transformative crop insurance solutions to enhance risk transfer in agriculture which perhaps the most plausible way forward.

TI  - Fractal and multifractal spatiotemporal patterns of land surface temperatures in a coastal city
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to discover the fractal and multifractal nature of land surface temperature (LST) spatiotemporal patterns, this study computed the LST in thecoastal city, Xiamen, southeastern China using Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images from 1994 to 2015, and introduced two-dimensional box-counting and two-dimensional multifractal box-counting methods to quantitatively characterize the LST pattern. Results suggest that increasing the binarization threshold decreased the box-counting dimensions with values from 1.86 to 1.65 in 1994, 1.67 in 2000, 1.56 in 2004, 1.57 in 2010, and 1.56 in 2015, respectively. The two-dimensional multifractal approach employs a set of intertwined nonfractal subsets over different spatial scales to describe the LST patterns. LST pattern possesses a increased multifractality and the similar multifractal spectra of left-hook shapes throughout the study period, suggesting the increasing trends of the spatial heterogeneity in LST distribution. The probability of a given pixel having a high LST value is consistently high in the study area, as indicated by the positive ratio between the regions in which the probability measure appears most concentrated and those in which it is most sparse. Rapid urbanization and the large-scale urban land surface changes in the coastal city determine the variation in the multifractal parameters.

TI  - Assessing the heat stress tolerance potential of tomato lines under poly-house and open field conditions
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomato, an important vegetable crop cultivated worldwide is an essential component of the Ghanaian diet. However, production in Ghana is hampered by heat stress (HS) during certain periods of the year. Tomato is sensitive to HS, especially during the reproductive stage, inducing pollen sterility, floral and fruit abortion, and culminating in low yield. This necessitates development of HS-tolerant tomato varieties. The HS-tolerance potential of 13 tomato lines was assessed under both poly-house and open field conditions at day temperatures of similar to 35 degrees C. Evaluation was based on agro-morphological and physiological traits. Most lines had their highest fruit yield (FY) under poly-house conditions, but declined drastically (up to 92%) in the field when day/night temperatures reached 40/28 degrees C respectively. A second field experiment revealed that the low FY was due to poor fruit set despite the many flowers produced. Correlations between days to 50% fruiting and physiological traits (phi(II) , chlorophyll content, and leaf temperature) were high and significant, whereas those between FY and all physiological parameters were negligible. Lines KAC13 and KAU03 consistently had high FY, phi(II), and chlorophyll content. Nevertheless, KAU01 had the highest FY in two out of three experiments in addition to having the highest percentage fruit set. The lines that show high potential tolerance to HS may be incorporated into breeding programmes to further improve the tolerance of tomatoes to HS.

TI  - Operational continental-scale land cover mapping of Australia using the Open Data Cube
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To comprehensively support national and international initiatives for sustainable development, land cover products need to be reliably and routinely generated within operational frameworks. Coupled with consistent semantics and taxonomies, ensuring confidence in mapping land cover for multiple time periods, facilitates informed decision-making at scales appropriate to multiple policy domains. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) provides a taxonomy that comparable at different scales, level of detail and geographic location. The Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative offers a framework for operational continental-scale land cover mapping using analysis-ready Earth Observation data. This study utilised the FAO LCCS framework and the Landsat sensor data through Digital Earth Australia (DEA; Australia's ODC instance) to generate consistent and continent-wide land cover mapping (DEA Land Cover) of the Australian continent. DEA Land Cover provides annual maps from 1988 to 2020 at 25 m resolution. Output maps were validated with similar to 12,000 independent validation points, giving an overall map accuracy of 80%. DEA Land Cover provides Australia with a nationally consistent picture of land cover, with an open-source software package using readily available global coverage data and demonstrates a pathway of adoption for national implementations across the world.

TI  - Solar park detection from publicly available satellite imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in large-scale photovoltaic installations, or solar parks, causes a need to monitor their amount and allocation, and assess their impacts. While their spectral signature suggests that solar parks can be identified among other land covers, this detection is challenged by their low occurrence. Here, we develop an object-based random forest (RF) classification approach, using publicly available satellite imagery, which has the advantage of requiring relatively little training data and being easily extendable to large spatial extents and new areas. First, we segmented Sentinel-2 imagery into homogenous objects using a Simple Non-Iterative Clustering algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Thereafter, we calculated for each object the mean, standard deviation, and median for all 10- and 20-meter resolution bands of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. These features are subsequently used to train and validate a range of RF models to select the most promising model setup. The training datasets consisted of subsampled presence/absence data, oversampled presence/absence data, and multiple land-cover categories. The best-performing model used an oversampled dataset trained on all 10- and 20- meter resolution spectral bands and the radar backscatter properties of one period. Independent test results show an overall classification accuracy of 99.97% (Kappa: 0.90). For this result, the producer accuracy was 85.86% for solar park objects and 99.999% for non-solar park objects. The user accuracy was 92.39% for solar park objects and 99.999% for non-solar park objects. These high classification accuracies indicate that our approach is suitable for transfer learning and is able to detect solar parks in new study areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS & CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sudden flourishing of reflections on light, nature and poetry that occurred from the mid-80s onwards in the cinema of Jean-Luc Godard, Daniele Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub, could not fail to surprise. Between their reputation as Brechtian, materialist filmmakers and these seemingly apolitical reflections, developed in conjunction with their appeal to Holderlin's "idealist" poetry, there seems to be an insurmountable rift. By situating their aesthetics in the broader framework known as "aesthetic modernity", i.e. art and philosophy of art since the end of the 18(th) century (cf. J.M. Schaeffer, J. Ranciere), I demonstrate how films such as Der Tod des Empedokles (1986) and Allemagne annee 90 neuf zero (1991), not so much exhibit a shift to conservatism with this "sudden" interest in nature and poetry, but, rather, the manifestation of a Romantic contradiction characteristic of modern aesthetics. In a period of disillusionment, these "Brechtian" filmmakers increasingly turned to a German literary and philosophical tradition that praised the "revelationist" potential of poetry, while they, simultaneously and still with revolutionary fervour, reflected on Germany's troubled political past and present. I will argue that we can understand this alignment of revolution and revelationism from the perspective of their indebtedness to an antimodern worldview that perceives of the modern age as being in decline, to which these filmmakers oppose a utopian striving towards a "new world", captured in a Romantic discourse of light and vision.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has resulted in severe landslides in Maskun, Iran. This study evaluates and monitors the displacement caused by the landslide mass in Bam using Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) techniques, as well as identifies relationships between climatic conditions and mass displacement. Temperature and precipitation data from 2007 to 2019 were combined with satellite images and the DInSAR method was used to determine the mass displacement differences after selecting eighteen radar images from the ASAR sensor of the ENVISAT satellite. Additionally, Sentinel 1 satellite images were acquired and analyzed using the PSI method from November 5, 2014, to June 24, 2019. The highest displacement level at the surface of the Maskun landslide mass was then extracted. The ASAR images show a monthly displacement rate of 7.3 mm. The smallest displacement, on the other hand, occurred between May and September 2009, at a rate of 3.1 mm/month. PSI results also revealed that the maximum Line Of Sight (LOS) velocities detected by PSI are -64.5 mm/yr (away from the satellite) and 32.45 mm/yr (toward the satellite). Rainfall is one of the main triggers for increasing the deformation of the Maskun landslide according to the time-series analysis.

TI  - Multi-year mapping of flood autumn irrigation extent and timing in harvested croplands of arid irrigation district
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood irrigation after crop harvest, e.g. autumn irrigation (AI), is a common irrigation practice in arid and semi-arid regions like Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in Northwest China to increase soil moisture and leach soil salt. Detailed information about the extent, timing, and amount of AI is imperative for modeling agro-hydrological processes and irrigation management. However, little attention is given to the identification of the above AI factors. There are basically three major difficulties in estimating the annual changes in AI, including a suitable index to identify AI, temporal instability of thresholds, and an effective validation method for irrigation timing. Therefore, this study proposes a simple and effective threshold-based method to extract the extent and timing of AI in the HID using MODIS water indices at a daily timescale. The Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI) time series is first reconstructed using an adaptive weighted Savitzky-Golay filter and then used to identify the AI extent and time. The proposed model has a stronger generalization capability both in time and space due to robust thresholds selected from the Z-score normalized feature variable. The model is validated both at pixels generated by the segmentation of Sentinel-derived MBWI using a threshold-based model and at sampling points from the field survey. Results show that the model performed well with an overall accuracy of more than 90.0% for the irrigation area. The overall accuracies of irrigation timing are 76.4% and 91.7% based on the middle-to-late and whole irrigation periods, respectively. We found a decreasing trend in the AI area and a gradual delay in the starting time of AI in the HID, mainly due to changes in cropping patterns, climate, and irrigation fees. Overall, the model is promising in identifying flood irrigation extent and timing in large irrigation districts and is helpful for irrigation scheduling.

TI  - De-recidivism, not de-radicalisation: Understanding the cognitive left-to-right markprocess among de-radicalised Indonesian terrorist returnees
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the looming public scepticism towards de-radicalisation, this paper argues for the reform of de-radicalisation programme from an effort to change terrorist's worldview toward one that focuses on preventing terrorist recidivism. It contends that the lacklustre result of mainstream de-radicalisation programme can be attributed to its flawed assumption in viewing terrorist motivation as purely psychological without paying attention to the social context. To remedy this flaw, it takes inspirations from French theories to propose a new approach dubbed de-recidivism to understand the cognitive process and the social dynamics that lead individuals to quit terrorism. It then demonstrates how de-recidivism can be applied by analysing the experienceof 20 Indonesian terrorist returnees who have decided to quit terrorism voluntarily. It concludes that in order to prevent terrorist recidivism, a de-recidivism-inspired programme must be able to create a condition that (1) enables individuals to deconstruct their terrorist ideology, (2) decolonise themselves from the cognitive clutch of their ideologues, and by way of (3) decapitalising the latter's modality in the social field.

TI  - Updated trends of water management practice in the Italian rice paddies from remotely sensed imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rice growing district in northwestern Italy, where paddies were traditionally flooded throughout spring, was interested by a general decrease of standing water presence caused by the adoption of dry seeding crop practices, with consequences for water management and for the ecology of breeding waterbirds. This communication analyses changes in flooding dynamics in the last four years, estimating them from MODIS data and comparing results with previous knowledge of the same study area. Results highlighted an intensification of the phenomenon in the north-western regions (-3.3 +/- 0.6% per year in the period 2013-2021) and the almost complete loss of flooded surfaces east to the Ticino river (reaching in 2021 5% of the flooded extension estimated in 2000). Such findings highlight the importance of monitoring this phenomenon - considered by other authors as the biggest anthropogenic change in surface water of all Europe since 2000 - in near real time from remotely sensed data to monitor dynamics and support sustainable management of water usage at the district level.

TI  - Assessing the effect of volcano-tectonic activity on the spatial distribution of surface temperature in the Main Ethiopian Rift, using integrated approach of remote sensing data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat energy continuously flows from the interior of the earth's layers to the surface, usually associated with rifting and faulting the earth's crust. So, the spatial distribution of heat energy in the earth's crust differs laterally and vertically depending on several factors, such as radioactive isotopes in the area's rock, volcano-tectonic, and hydrological nature. The study was conducted in the Northern segment of the Main Ethiopian Rift. Geological and volcanic structures have been considered to determine the effect of volcano-tectonic activity on the spatial variability of surface temperature. The surface kinetic temperature was retrieved from Landsat 8 imagery using the Emissivity Modulation method, resulting in minimum and maximum values of 21 and 45.9 degrees C. The higher surface temperature anomalies (>45 degrees C) has been found in the region of densely concentrated geological and volcanic structures. Based on this present study's analysis, the effect of volcano-tectonic activity has been observed on the spatial distribution of surface temperature over the study area. Most of these areas have been found in Dofan to Fantale volcanic fields. Moreover, it is observed along the Main Ethiopian rift axis in which recent volcano-tectonic activity was found.

TI  - High-spatial resolution UAV multispectral data complementing satellite imagery to characterize a chinstrap penguin colony ecosystem on deception island (Antarctica)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has evolved as an alternative to traditional techniques in the spatio-temporal monitoring of the Antarctic ecosystem, especially with the rapid expansion of the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), providing a centimeter-scale spatial resolution. In this study, the potential of a high-spatial resolution multispectral sensor embedded in a UAV is compared to medium resolution satellite remote sensing (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) to monitor the characteristics of the Vapor Col Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colony ecosystem (Deception Island, South Shetlands Islands, Antarctica). Our main objective is to generate precise thematic maps of the typical ecosystem of penguin colonies derived from the supervised analysis of the spectral information obtained with these remote sensors. For this, two parametric classification algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, MLC, and Spectral Angle, SAC) and two non-parametric machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, SVM, and Random Forest, RFC) are tested with UAV imagery, obtaining the best results with the SVM classifier (93.19% OA). Our study shows that the use of UAV outperforms satellite imagery (87.26% OA with Sentinel-2 Level 2 (S2L2) and 70.77% OA with Landsat 8 Level 2 (L8L2) in SVM classification) in the characterization of the substrate due to a higher spatial resolution, although differences between UAV and S2L2 are minimal. Thus, both sensors used in tandem could provide a broader and more precise view of how the area covered by the different elements of these ecosystems can change over time in a global climate change scenario. In addition, this study represents a precise UAV monitoring that takes place in this Chinstrap penguin colony, estimating a total coverage of approximately 20,000 m(2) of guano areas in the study period.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS-Landsat and AVHRR-Landsat NDVI data fusion using a single pair base reference image: a case study in a tropical upstream catchment on Java, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Image blending is one of the alternative methods to fill temporal gaps in the monitoring of historical vegetation properties using continuous NDVI derived from Landsat 5 TM / 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI images. Frequent cloud occurrence in the tropical upstream catchment limits the use of image blending methods that allow to employment of a single pair base reference. This study aims to evaluate two image blending methods with nine input data configurations to select the most applicable one. Scatter plots and statistical indices such as ME, RMSE, model efficiency and structure similarity showed FSDAF outperforms STARFM in generating both synthetic Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and Landsat 5 TM / 7 ETM+ NDVI when employing unsupervised and supervised classification images, respectively, where both were applied along with MODIS NDVI 250 m v.005. When generating synthetic Landsat 5 TM / 7 ETM+ NDVI using AVHRR NDVI, both algorithms performed similarly. However, when considering the temporal over spatial variance ratio between base reference and predictor images, both algorithms performed almost similar when the value close to minimum. This study shows that selection of image blending algorithm with use single pair base reference image should consider input data configuration and temporal over spatial variance ratio.

TI  - Spectral-based regression model for destriping of abnormal pixel values in PRISMA hyperspectral image
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imageries are often degraded by systematic sensor-based errors known as "striping noises ". This study implements a spectral-based regression algorithm from highly correlated consecutive bands, i.e. left band, right band or both, to model and reconstruct the abnormal pixel values, stripe noises, in various bands of PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) imagery. The modeling performance was evaluated based on the statistical difference between the reconstructed images' pixel values (reflectance) and their corresponding original pixel values. Results referred to the model's high accuracy in R (2), RMSE, rRMSE and skewness in most bands ( 0.9492 < R 2 < 0.9995 ; 0.0008 < R M S E < 0.0254 ; 0.0116 \break < r R M S E < 0.5713 - 0.9280 < s k e w n e s s < 0.2708 ). Furthermore, the results indicated that the combination of both bands had higher accuracy and pixels' homogeneity preservation compared to single-band modeling. Our findings suggested that the algorithm significantly depends on the spectral similarities between neighboring bands so that the higher spectral similarities lead to the higher model performance and vice versa. Subsequently, the minimum model performance was observed in band 143 due to lower spectral similarity, lower spectral correlation and higher wavelength differences with its adjacent right band. Finally, the study suggests that alongside other methods, our algorithm may be used as a reliable, straightforward and accurate alternative for destriping different Earth observation satellite imageries. Limitations of the proposed approach are also discussed.

TI  - Satellite flood detection integrating hydrogeomorphic and spectral indices
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a highly valuable data source useful in the monitoring of surface water dynamics and an essential tool in flood risk management although several factors can interfere with the detection of water features. This study explores an approach that integrates satellite optical images and DEM-based hydrogeomorphic features to enhance real-time identification of river flooding. Spectral indices, namely MNDWI and the combination of NDWI/NDTI, were taken from Sentinel-2 images and used to detect flooded areas, while DEMs were used to identify areas more exposed to river flooding using the Geomorphic Flood Index. The integration/overlapping of these layers allowed us to refine the final map with a significant detection improvement compared to those based exclusively on the segmentation of a spectral index. The proposed integrated approach was tested in five areas of the Piave river (Northern Italy) where a flooding event caused by the Vaia storm took place in October 2018. Results have been evaluated against reference maps produced manually in five selected areas, demonstrating good capabilities of the proposed procedure (mean accuracy 0.90), significantly reducing false alarms (Matthews Correlation Coefficient improvements among 0.02-0.43 in 4 out of 5 areas). The key advantages of such a procedure are the rapid application and the free and easy availability of the data that, in turn, allow for the investigation of large areas in the aftermath of an event.

TI  - Mapping of aeolian deposits of an industrial site in the arid region using the TIR bands of ASTER and study of physicochemical characters and stabilization of sand erosion
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the spectral emissive character of silicate and carbonate minerals of aeolian deposits and maps the deposits and sand encroachments that occurred in and around the site 5/6 of Qatar Fertilizer Company (QAFCO), Qatar using thermal infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER. The results of studies show that the quartz and unaltered silicates have spectral features between 8.12 and 9.27 mu m, and the calcite and dolomite have emissivity minima near 11.4 and 11.2 mu m, respectively. The mapping of deposits, dunes, and carbonate formations using the bands, and quartz index (QI), and carbonate index (CI) displayed their occurrence, distribution, and direction of sand movement from NW to SE. The sand encroachment was mapped using high spatial resolution satellite data of WorldView-2. The study of physicochemical characteristics of field samples showed the occurrence of sand grains up to 99.81% and the XRD and geochemical analyses represented the presence of quartz, calcite, dolomite, albite, and halite minerals in the deposits. In addition, the bacterial strains isolated from the samples indicated high urease activity leading to precipitation of carbonate minerals via microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) processes, and demonstrated high potential for utilization for sand stabilization of the QAFCO site.

TI  - Using Bayesian multitemporal classification to monitor tropical forest cover changes in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant areas of native forest in Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo, have been cleared for the expansion of plantations of oil palm and rubber. In this study multisource remote sensing was used to develop a time series of land cover maps that distinguish native forest from plantations. Using a study area in east Kalimantan, Landsat images were combined with either ALOS PALSAR or Sentinel-1 images to map four land cover classes (native forest, oil palm plantation, rubber plantation, non-forest). Bayesian multitemporal classification was applied to increase map accuracy and maps were validated using a confusion matrix; final map overall accuracy was >90%. Over 18 years from 2000 to 2018 nearly half the native forests in the study area were converted to either non-forest or plantations of either rubber or oil palm, with the highest losses between 2015 and 2016. Trending upwards from 2008 large areas of degraded or cleared forests, mapped as non-forest, were converted to oil palm plantation. Conversion of native forests to plantation mainly occurred in lowland and wetland forest, while significant forest regrowth was detected in degraded peatland. These maps will help Indonesia with strategies and policies for balancing economic growth and conservation.

TI  - Yelling from the sidelines? How German parties employ populist and crisis-related messages on Facebook
T2  - POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibilities of unfiltered communication in social media provide the perfect opportunity structure for spreading populist ideas. Generally, populist communication features an antagonistic worldview that blames elites for betraying the people and promises to reverse a 'downward societal trend' by bringing the people's 'real' interests back into politics. Although populist success is often attributed to crisis-induced dissatisfaction, research remains unclear on whether and how political actors foster such negative societal perceptions. Building on the German case, our paper accomplishes two things: It explores the use of populist social media communication and relates it to the exploitation of crisis-related messages among political parties. Conducting a manual content analysis of 3,500 Facebook posts by German parties and leading politicians, we find that the outsider parties AfD and the Left use and combine populist and crisis-related messages by far the most. Insider parties also spread crisis-related content to some extent. However, like the government parties, they are very reluctant to communicate in a populist way. By explaining the communicative output with their relative position in the party system, we deepen the understanding of parties' social media behaviour. Overall, this study offers more in-depth insights into how politicians influence perceptions of the societal state.

TI  - Monitoring ecological status of wetlands using linked fuzzy inference system- remote sensing analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study develops an applicable model to simulate the ecological status of saltwater lakes in which depth and total dissolved solids are selected as the effective factors on aquatic habitats. First, spectral images of the operational land imager of Landsat 8 were used to simulate distribution of depth and total dissolved solids by applying two feed forward neural networks. Next, a Mamdani fuzzy inference system was used to develop habitat suitability rules of Artemia and Flamingo as the selected target species in which expert opinions were considered. Finally, habitat suitability maps of target species were generated by linking distribution maps of selected effective parameters and fuzzy inference system. Based on the results in the Urmia lake as a case study, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of depth and total dissolved solids are 0.88 and 0.5 which indicates the proposed method for simulating distribution of these parameters is reliable. Average depth in the simulated date is 227 cm, while average simulated total dissolved solids is 264 g per litre. Simulation of habitat suitability maps demonstrated that average habitat suitability of Artemia is less than 30% in the most areas of the lake. Moreover, average habitat suitability of the Flamingo is less than 10% which implies the ecological status of the lake is critical and ecological restoration is necessary. The main advantage of the proposed method is to develop a framework for combining the expert opinions with remote sensing data processing to generate habitat suitability maps in lakes.

TI  - Preliminary analysis of wave retrieval from Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagery in the <i>Arctic</i> Ocean
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for sea surface monitoring. The 2017-2020 mission of the Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) over the Arctic Ocean provided a unique opportunity to investigate the feasibility of wave retrieval in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, several GF-3 SAR images acquired in quad-polarization (QPS) mode were applied for wave retrieval using two theoretical-based algorithms, i.e. the parameterized first-guess spectrum method (PFSM) (with improved tilt modulation) and quad-polarization (Q-P). These images were collocated with wave fields simulated using the third-generation numeric wave model WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) and measurements from the Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) altimeter. A comparison of the HY-2B winds with the wind speeds generated by the geophysical model function (GMF) CMOD5.N showed a 3.36 m/s root mean square error (RMSE) with a correlation (COR) of 0.66. The retrieved significant wave height (SWH) validated against the WW3-simulated results had a 0.50 m RMSE using PFSM and 0.91 m RMSE with the Q-P algorithm. These results show that PFSM is suitable for wave retrieval from GF-3 SAR images. We also used PFSM to investigate the characteristics of the wave spectrum in the presence of sea ice. Although the analysis concludes that GF-3 SAR has the capability for wave monitoring in Arctic Ocean due to the high spatial resolution of SAR-derived wave spectra, an optimal wave retrieval algorithm needs to be developed for improving the retrieval accuracy.

TI  - Fine-scale multi-temporal and spatial analysis of agricultural drought in agro-ecological regions of Zimbabwe
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilised multi-temporal satellite data to characterize droughts across the five Agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of Zimbabwe at monthly, seasonal, sub-seasonal and annual scales (2000 to 2018) using a combination of Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation (VGT) and Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The characterized droughts were validated, using maize yield and meteorological station derived Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The study showed differential spatial and temporal expression of drought in Zimbabwe, over the 19-year study period. November had the highest frequency of drought while the first quarter of the season experienced more droughts than the second quarter. Spatially, virtually all AEZ in Zimbabwe are prone to droughts and the frequency is increasingly, with the Agro-ecological region five (southern Zimbabwe) being the worst affected. Further, the study found a strong positive relationship between the VCI and maize yield (r = 0.701, P = 0.000), demonstrating the utility of the index in drought monitoring at national level. Overall, findings from this work highlight the significance of using multi-date and national-scale analysis of agricultural drought occurrence and trends. Moreover, this work provides critical baseline information for developing drought resilience and mitigation strategies in drought-prone areas.

TI  - Analysing the spatial patterns and trends of urban growth in Rohtak city, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenomenon of urban growth is a complicated one. It is the outcome of numerous social, economic, ecological, cultural, and even political circumstances. Rapid urbanization generally occurs due to the disbursement of peripheral prime agricultural land, destroying the natural landscape in the process. Rohtak city is a fast-growing city in India's National Capital Region (NCR). The physical development of the city and land use/land covers are measured using Landsat satellite data. ArcGIS and Erdas software have been used for making the map, image processing and classification. In this study, five major land use and cover categories, built-up area, agricultural land, vegetation, bare/open land and water bodies, are used. The spatial arrangement and urban growth trends in Rohtak are examined using Shannon's Entropy index. Results show that Rohtak city has witnessed four-fold growth in its built-up area (from 1640.79 hectares in 1991 to 6686.36 hectares in 2021) in thirty years of the study. However, the planned and unplanned residential and commercial arrangements have appeared on all sides throughout the periods. Yet, the city expanded its limits mainly in north, north-eastern and south-eastern sides along with the major transport routes to New Delhi, Sonipat and Panipat. It is primarily a result of government policies and proximity to the capital city.

TI  - Remote sensing-derived land surface temperature trends over South Asia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal changes in land surface temperature (LST) over South Asia were estimated using MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) data from 2000 to 2021. We calculated the monthly and annual LST trends and magnitudes by applying the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator at both ecoregion and pixel level. More ecoregions experienced daytime cooling than warming. Central and west South Asia showed the highest daytime cooling in December compared to the nighttime warming in the central and northwest in July and September. Nineteen ecoregions demonstrated monthly daytime cooling trends at the 99% confidence level (CL), with the highest record observed in ecoregion 'Indus Valley desert' in March with the magnitudes of -0.26 degrees C/yr. While the monthly and annual nighttime warming magnitude was the maximum in 'Gissaro-Alai open woodlands' in December (0.19 degrees C/yr at 95% CL), and 'Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves' at annual scale (0.06 degrees C/yr at 99% CL). To understand the influence of large-scale atmospheric oscillations on the trends, we also correlated the estimated LST trends with the selected oscillation indices. Sea surface temperature (SST) Nin similar to o 3.4 showed the most significant influence on the trends, where it was positively correlated with 38 ecoregions during nighttime over the year. A better understanding of temperature trends and impacts on South Asia would guide sustainable development and ensures the excessive demands on food, water, and energy supplies coping with the growing population.

TI  - Trends analysis of rangeland condition monitoring assessment and projection (RCMAP) fractional component time series (1985-2020)
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangelands have a dynamic response to climate change, fire, and other anthropogenic disturbances. The Rangeland Condition, Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (RCMAP) product aims to capture this response by quantifying the percent cover of eight rangeland components, associated error, and trends across the western United States using Landsat from 1985 to 2020. The current generation of RCMAP has been improved with more training data, regional-scale Landsat composites, and more robust change detection. We assess the temporal patterns in each component with a linear model and a structural change method that determines break points using an 8-year temporal moving window. The linear and structural change methods generally agreed on patterns of change, but the latter found breaks more often, with at least one break point in most pixels. The structural change model provides more robust statistics on the significant minority of pixels with non-monotonic trends, while detrending some interannual signal potentially superfluous from a long-term perspective. Although break point density within one year of fire and vegetation treatments was similar to 10x and similar to 4x that of unburned areas, respectively, break point detection in the correct year of fire was only moderately accurate. Climate responses in break points proved more robust, with strong spatiotemporal relation in break point density with both aridity index values and aridity index change. Break point density strongly responds to both increased and decreased aridity and is reflective of ecosystem resilience. Data provide spatiotemporal information on the occurrence of breaks, but even more importantly, attribute those change events to specific component(s).

TI  - Inferring decelerated land subsidence and groundwater storage dynamics in Tianjin-Langfang using Sentinel-1 InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet the growing demand for socioeconomic development, a large amount of groundwater is extracted from confined aquifers worldwide. The North China Plain has experienced considerable groundwater depletion and subsidence during the past six decades. In this study, we use Sentinel-1A/B SAR images from 2015 to 2020 to map the ground subsidence of the Tianjin-Langfang area. Three subsiding zones centered at Guangyang, Wuqing-Bazhou, and Jinghai are identified with maximum subsidence rates of 98.1, 121.8, and 104.7 mm/yr. Seasonal and long-term signals are separated from time series subsidence and hydraulic measurements using continuous wavelet transform to retrieve aquifer parameters. The long-term subsidence, which fits well with an exponential decaying model, remarkably slows down in our study area. The elastic skeletal storage coefficients range between 0.52x10(-3) and 9.66x10(-3). We then retrieve the spatial-temporal variations of total groundwater storage, recoverable groundwater storage, and irreversible groundwater storage. Groundwater storage depletion rates are apparently reducing, which benefits from the operation of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and local groundwater management practices.

TI  - Combining post-disturbance land cover and tree canopy cover from Landsat time series data for mapping deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery across Cambodia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery is essential to characterize country-level forest change and formulate mitigation actions. Previous studies have mainly used a simple forest/non-forest classification after forest disturbance to identify deforestation and forest degradation. However, a more flexible approach that is applicable to different forest conditions is desirable. In this study, we examined an approach for mapping deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery using disturbance types and tree canopy cover estimates from annual Landsat time-series data from 1988 to 2020 across Cambodia. We developed models to estimate both disturbance types and tree canopy cover based on a random forest algorithm using predictor variables derived from a trajectory-based temporal segmentation approach. The estimated disturbance types and canopy cover in each year were then used in a rule-based classification of deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery. The producer's and user's accuracies ranged from 59.1% to 72.9% and 60.8% to 91.6%, respectively, for the forest change classes of mapping deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery. The approach developed here can be adjusted for different definitions of deforestation, forest degradation, and recovery according to research objectives and thus has the potential to be applied to other study areas.

TI  - Near-real time deforestation detection in the Brazilian Amazon with Sentinel-1 and neural networks
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical-based near-real time deforestation alert systems in the Brazilian Amazon are ineffective in the rainy season. This study identify clear-cut deforested areas through Neural Network (NN) algorithm based on C-band, VV- and VH-polarized, Sentinel-1 images. Statistical parameters of backscatter coefficients (mean, standard deviation, and the difference between maximum and minimum values - MMD) were computed from 30 Sentinel-1 images, from 2019, used as input parameters of the NN classifier. The samples were manually selected, including forested and deforested areas. After deforestation, mean backscatter signals decreased on the average of 2 dB for VV and 2.3 dB for VH from May to September-October. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network was used for detecting near-real time forest disturbances larger than 2 ha. Case studies were performed for both polarizations considered the following input sets to the MLP: mean; mean and standard deviation; mean and MMD; and mean, standard deviation, and MMD. For the 2019 dataset, the latter showed the best performance of the NN algorithm with accuracy and F1 score of 99%. Automatic extraction using 2018 Sentinel-1 images reached accuracy and F1 score of 89% with the MapBiomas reference data and accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 79% with the PRODES reference data.

TI  - Earth observation data sets in monitoring of urbanization and urban heat island of Delhi, India
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and land use transformation coupled with climate change impact are witnessed for development urban heat island worldwide and make it major environmental concerns for human health. National Capital Region (NCR) is one of the fast sprawling National Capital city of India. The aim of the present study is to explore the spatial changes in major biophysical parameters of city over last 20 years from 2000 to 2020 using satellite data. The spatial variation in the land surface temperature and its relation with Land use, NDVI and Built-up area were evaluated and discussed in the present work. The major changes were observed in minimum and maximum temperature of the city, in 2000 minimum temperature was 23.20 degrees C and maximum 34.85 degrees C, which increased to 26.31 and 39.92 degrees C in 2010; and 31.70 to 44.74 degrees C in 2020 . Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) decrease from 82 to 62%, Non-Vegetated area has reduced to 62% from 82% due to fast urbanization and land transformation in last two decades. Barren and fallow land also reduces about 27% in last two decades and built-up area also shown increasing trend . The spatial changes in biophysical parameter of the city clearly indicated that NDVI, NDBI and Land use/land cover charges are the main driving forces for development of urban heat island in the city and many health issues related to heat waves are already reported in the city along with many other negative impacts on natural landscape and resources. The observations from present work will be very useful scientific information to understand the causes of elevated land surface temperature and mitigation measures. Results could be used by policy makers to develop the suitable model for long term sustainability of the cities.

TI  - Mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of fallow land in mountainous regions of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of the global population has resulted in a continuous increase in cropland intensity and a shortening of the fallow period as part of the cropland rotation cycle. Yet, there is a lack of systematic knowledge on the extent of fallow lands, particularly in complex landscapes, such as the mountainous regions of China. To fill this knowledge gap, taking Yuanyang County (YYC), Yunnan Province, China, as a case study, we tested a method to identify the spatial-temporal distribution of fallow land by mapping cropland with Landsat data. The overall accuracy of land cover classification, including cropland, ranged between 90.1% and 95.8% from 1998 to 2019. The average accuracy of fallow plots was 75.7% from 2001 to 2019. The annual fallow rate varied between 8.3% and 54.3%, with an average of 20.7%. Kernel density estimated with the probability density function showed that fallow varied between 5 and 13 blocks per km(2), gradually decreasing from the central area to the periphery. Increasing elevation, the low value of regional domestic products, and the increased distance to rural settlements were closely related to the higher proportions of fallow land. The approach presented here can be applied to map fallow land in other regions.

TI  - Iterative spatial leave-one-out cross-validation and gap-filling based data augmentation for supervised learning applications in marine remote sensing
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In marine remote sensing, supervised learning can link variables measured in-situ near the ocean surface to variables that can be measured from space. However, the in-situ data used for training and validating such empirical satellite algorithms are often spatially auto-correlated and clustered, giving rise to various statistical challenges such as overfitting to spatial structures. Furthermore, co-located in-situ and satellite measurements are rare in the oceans because of the cost of data collection from research vessels and frequent cloud cover. We propose two methods to mitigate these challenges. The first method builds on spatial leave-one-out cross-validation (SLOOCV), an approach designed to provide sound error estimates when data are spatially auto-correlated by enforcing a minimum separation distance between training and test observations. However, estimating this distance may be impossible with sparse and spatially clustered data. We hence propose to iterate and integrate error estimates over a range of separation distances (iSLOOCV). To address the often-small size of labeled data sets based on marine in-situ data, we tested if increasing the number of observations for algorithm training by means of cloud-filling algorithms for marine satellite data improved predictions. The potential of these two methods is demonstrated by developing empirical algorithms for mapping the proportions of seven diagnostic pigments (DPs) that serve as proxies for phytoplankton community composition in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We estimated the prediction accuracy of 13 algorithms with iSLOOCV, using various sets of satellite data products as input, and found adequate algorithms for 4 of the 7 DPs. Random forests combining ocean color and environmental variables as input had the lowest prediction errors overall. Correlations between predictions and observations estimated by iSLOOCV ranged from 0.69 to 0.85 and mean absolute errors from 0.02 to 0.13. Daily maps and longer-term composites of these DPs were broadly consistent with previously published results. Overall, errors increased when extrapolating over larger distances, highlighting how iSLOOCV can illuminate changes in algorithm performance based on sub-regional data coverage. Generating larger training sets by prior gap-filling substantially improved all error measures for 3 of the 7 DPs, with mixed results for the others. Therefore, data augmentation by gap-filling of satellite data should not be used as a default approach but can be a useful tool when supervised learning applications are suspected to be limited by the size of the training set.

TI  - Mapping mountain glaciers using an improved U-Net model with cSE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is melting glaciers. Changes in mountain glaciers have a tremendous impact on human life. Regular identification and extraction of glaciers from satellite images are necessary. However, when studying glaciers, materials surrounding the glacier have high spectral similarity to glaciers and are easily misclassified in the identification process. Therefore, in this study of glacier extraction, we used an improved U-Net model (a channel-attention U-Net) to map glaciers. The model was trained on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), and was tested on glaciers in the Pamir Plateau. The results show that the channel-attention U-Net identifies glaciers with relatively high accuracy compared to U-Net and GlacierNet. The obtained results were fine-tuned by the conditional random field model, effectively reducing background misidentification.

TI  - Monitoring of hourly carbon dioxide concentration under different land use types in arid ecosystem
T2  - OPEN LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a major factor affecting human life and living quality in arid and semiarid regions. This study was conducted in the Al-Ahsa district in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration over different land-use types. Initially, the study's land use/land cover (LULC) was classified using the spectral characteristics of Landsat-8 data. Then, sensors were placed in five sites of different LULC types to detect CO2, air temperature, and relative humidity. The Friedman test was used to compare CO2 concentration among the five sites. Five LULC types were identified over the study area: date palm, cropland, bare land, urban land, and water. The results indicated that CO2 concentration showed a maximum mean value of 577 ppm recorded from a site dominated by urban lands. During the peak time of human transportation, a maximum value of 659 ppm was detected. The CO2 concentration mean values detected for the other LULC types showed 535, 515, and 484 ppm for the bare land, cropland, and date palm, respectively. This study's sensors and procedures helped provide information over relatively small areas. However, modelling CO2 fluctuations with time for LULC changes might improve management and sustainability.

TI  - FWENet: a deep convolutional neural network for flood water body extraction based on SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most severe natural disasters in the world, floods caused substantial economic losses and casualties every year. Timely and accurate acquisition of flood inundation extent could provide technical support for relevant departments in the field of flood emergency response and disaster relief. Given the accuracy of existing research works extracting flood inundation extent based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and deep learning methods is relatively low, this study utilized Sentinel-1 SAR images as the data source and proposed a novel model named flood water body extraction convolutional neural network (FWENet) for flood information extraction. Then three classical semantic segmentation models (UNet, Deeplab v3 and UNet++) and two traditional water body extraction methods (Otsu global thresholding method and Object-Oriented method) were compared with the FWENet model. Furthermore, this paper analyzed the water body area change situations of Poyang Lake. The main results of this paper were as follows: Compared with other five water body extraction methods, the FWENet model achieved the highest water body extraction accuracy, its F1 score and mean intersection over union (mIoU) were 0.9871 and 0.9808, respectively. This study could guarantee the subsequent research on flood extraction based on SAR images.

TI  - Decomposing and mapping different scales of land subsidence over Shanghai with X- and C-Band SAR data stacks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence can be observed with time-series of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. However, existing approaches only reveal subsidence signals that are multi-scale mixed, which is not conducive to the systematic analysis of subsidence of different mechanisms. A deformation signal decomposition (DSD) method based on spectral analysis is used to decompose the deformation extracted by time-series InSAR into three classes of deformation signals. They refer to large-scale deformation related to geological settings, medium-scale deformation caused more by group excavation, and small-scale deformation along linear infrastructures. TerraSAR-X datasets for Shanghai spanning April 2013 to September 2020, and Sentinel-1A datasets spanning January 2016 to September 2020 are used in this study. The results were cross-verified between the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A datasets, and validated against levelling measurements. Subsidence signals caused by different mechanisms were automatically decomposed, which facilitates a systematic analysis for targeted diagnosis of land subsidence signals. A detailed analysis was conducted jointly at three scales of surface displacement, geological conditions, major construction activities, and subsidence mechanisms. It indicated that construction activities were the leading cause of land subsidence, and suggests that local authorities that wish to mitigate surface subsidence may benefit from primarily considering this process.

TI  - Surface deformation extraction from small baseline subset synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) using coherence-optimized baseline combinations
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformation data can be used to provide early warnings of geohazards and are useful in a variety of research fields. The Small BAseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) boosts the data sampling rate and improves the accuracy of deformation extraction by restricting the temporal and spatial baselines. However, various factors, such as the types of ground objects and seasons, affect the coherence between SAR images. Traditional SBAS-InSAR employs a fixed temporal baseline, which does not guarantee good coherence and might lead to decorrelation. In this paper, we propose that instead of using a fixed temporal baseline, we directly use the average coherence between SAR images as the baseline constraint index to perform an optimized selection of SBAS-InSAR interferometric pairs, ensuring good coherence of the interferometric pairs and improving the quality of the interferometric fringes. The proposed approach was used to extract surface deformation in two test experiment areas: Houston and Sydney. Compared with the conventional SBAS-InSAR and GPS data, the standard deviation of error of Houston and Sydney dropped from 0.813 to 0.589 and 0.291 to 0.246, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 1.082 to 1.041 and 0.485 to 0.334, respectively, indicating that the proposed method has better surface deformation extraction accuracy. After demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method, it was applied to Pingxiang area, a mining city in China, to effectively extract and analyze the surface deformation induced by mining activities, which proves the universality of this method in different scenarios.

TI  - Developing remote sensing methods for monitoring water quality of alpine rivers on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality in alpine rivers on the Tibetan Plateau is a key indicator for eco-environment security in China, which, however, is difficult to be monitored over the plateau. In this study, several regression methods and physicals models based on hyperspectral satellite data and field observations are proposed to monitor critical water quality parameters, including water turbidity (WT), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) in alpine rivers. Three remote sensing and field joint observation experiments were firstly carried out in these rivers in different seasons. Then, novel statistical and semi-analytical models were built to calculate the water quality parameters in these alpine rivers using hyperspectral remote sensing data. An integrated air-ground database containing long-term water quality parameters of alpine rivers was further generated to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the water environment of these rivers by using the novel models. The results indicate that WT, TP, TN, and TOC concentrations showed clear interannual cyclical variations and seasonal variations, which reflect that the water environment has a strong seasonality and are mainly controlled by climate change in the alpine plateau.

TI  - Chidamide stacked in magnetic polypyrrole nano-composites counter thermotolerance and metastasis for visualized cancer photothermal therapy
T2  - DRUG DELIVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photothermal therapy (PTT) has become one of the most promising therapies in cancer treatment as its noninvasiveness, high selectivity, and favorable compliance in clinic. However, tumor thermotolerance and distal metastasis reduce its efficacy, becoming the bottleneck of applying PTT in clinic. In this study, a chidamide-loaded magnetic polypyrrole nanocomposite (CMPP) has been fabricated as a visualized cancer photothermal agent (PTA) to counter tumor thermotolerance and metastasis. The efficacy of CMPP was characterized by in vitro and in vivo assays. As a result, this kind of magnetic polypyrrole nanocomposites were black spherical nanoparticles, possessing a favorable photothermal effect and the suitable particle size of 176.97 +/- 1.45 nm with a chidamide loading rate of 12.92 +/- 0.45%. Besides, comparing with PTT, CMPP exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity and cellular apoptosis rate in two tumor cell lines (B16-F10 and HepG2). In vivo study, the mice showed obvious near-infrared (NIR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual-modal imaging at tumor sites and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs); on the other hand, magnetic targeting guided CMPP achieved a cure level on melanoma-bearing mice through preventing metastasis and thermotolerance. Overall, with high loading efficiency of chidamide and strong magnetic targeting to tumor sites and SLNs, CMPP could significantly raise efficiency of PTT by targeting tumor thermotolerance and metastasis, and this strategy may be exploited therapeutically to upgrade PTT with MPP as one of appropriate carriers for histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis).

TI  - A novel hybrid sand and dust storm detection method using MODIS data on GEE platform
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate sand and dust storm (SDS) detection is important for assessing SDS disaster risk. Machine learning (ML) based SDS detection approaches have been widely used in recent years due to their higher accuracy and better detection results. However, this approach usually requires manual annotation of numerous training samples that are, in practice, laborious and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid SDS detection method that combines the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform with a spectral index to aid the automatic labelling of training samples. Based on 8 SDS events captured by MODIS over Arid Central Asia (ACA), the effectiveness and accuracy of this method were assessed and compared to traditional approaches. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can distinguish between mixed pixels (thin cloud and land surface) and SDS pixels and that it minimizes misdetection more effectively. This method achieved more than 98% training accuracy and validation accuracy in SDS detection.

TI  - Estimation of 30 m land surface temperatures over the entire Tibetan Plateau based on Landsat-7 ETM+ data and machine learning methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in land surface processes. Improving the accuracy of LST retrieval over the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) using satellite images with high spatial resolution is an important and essential issue for studies of climate change on the TP. In this study, a random forest regression (RFR) model based on different land cover types and an improved generalized single-channel (SC) algorithm based on linear regression (LR) were proposed. Plateau-scale LST products with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2006 to 2017 were derived by 109,978 Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images and the application of the Google Earth Engine. Validation between LST results obtained from different algorithms and in situ measurements from Tibetan observation and research platform showed that the root mean square errors of the LST results retrieved by the RFR and LR models were 1.890 and 2.767 K, respectively, which were smaller than that of the MODIS product (3.625 K) and the original SC method (5.836 K).

TI  - A framework for fine classification of urban wetlands based on random forest and knowledge rules: taking the wetland cities of Haikou and Yinchuan as examples
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetlands play an important role in sustainable urban development. A wetland city recognized by the Ramsar Convention is a city with a remarkable ecological performance of urban wetlands and can provide an example for urban wetland protection. Therefore identifying the detailed characteristics of wetlands is of great value to the conservation of urban wetlands. However, there is no detailed wetland type extraction for wetland cities using multisource remote sensing data. This paper proposes a framework for fine- urban wetland extraction with multisource and multiperiod remote sensing data, which mainly includes Sentinel 1/2 and Landsat 8 data, and obtains the detailed wetland type data containing 14 wetland categories at a 10-m resolution. The classification methods of random forests were used to extract land cover types, and knowledge rules were used to classify detailed wetland types. The wetland cities, Yinchuan, and Haikou, located in southern and northern China, respectively, were chosen as case studies. The results indicate that the overall accuracy and wetland accuracy of the two cities in 2015 and 2020 were greater than 88% and 87%, respectively. The detailed wetland mapping results were more accurate and had a high resolution, and wetland categories were more diverse compared with other wetland-related products. According to the classification results, the wetland area in Haikou was 326.86 km(2) (13.43%) in 2015 and 308.58 km(2) (12.66%) in 2020. The wetland area in Yinchuan was 80.39 km(2) (4.46%) in 2015 and 74.15 km(2) (4.12%) in 2020. The fine urban wetland classification framework we propose and the detailed wetland results could serve for the creation of wetland cities and support the protection and rational use of urban wetlands.

TI  - <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> triggers pneumonia epidemic in autumn and winter in Beijing: a multicentre, population-based epidemiological study between 2015 and 2020
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) epidemics in Beijing, China. Patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) were enrolled from 35 sentinel hospitals in Beijing, 2015-2020. Their medical records were reviewed and respiratory specimens were collected for assay for nucleic acids of 24 respiratory pathogens, including MP. The genotypes of MP were analysed using a real-time PCR method. The domain V of 23s rRNA gene was sequenced to identify macrolide-resistant mutations. A total of 41,677 specimens of ARTI patients were included, with an MP positive rate of 6.16%. MP prevalence mainly occurred between August and January, and peaked in October. The increase in the MP detection rate was coincident with the elevation of the reported number of patients with pneumonia in the 35 sentinel hospitals. One or more respiratory pathogens were co-detected in 27.1% of the MP-positive patients. Type 1 MP remained predominant, and the macrolide-resistant rate of MP had exceeded over 90%. A2063G mutation accounted for 99.0% of macrolide-resistant MP infections. MP epidemic in Beijing mainly occurred between August and January with a remarkable high macrolide-resistant rate. MP is one of the important contributors to the pneumonia epidemic in autumn and winter in Beijing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of urban thermal environment and its relationship with urban expansion types from 2000 to 2020: a case of Huai'an central urban area, Huai'an, China
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critically important to understand the variation of urban thermal environment since urban heat island (UHI) effect is one of the most worrisome urban environment and impedes urban sustainable development. Taking Huai'an central urban area in China as a case, Landsat images from 2000 to 2020 were used, we first estimated land surface temperature (LST) and land covers based on google earth engineer (GEE) platform. Then explored annual variation of SUHI and urban expansion types using statistics method and urban landscape Analysis tools. Finally, discussed the heat effect of urban expansion types and directions. The results showed that (1) SUHI patches gradually concentrated in Phase I, while in Phase II, concentrated SUHIs spread continuously from urban centre to rural area, changing from two centres to a polycentric pattern. (2) Urban expansion was characterized as a diffusion and coalescence process, extension type is the most dominant urban growth mode, second is leapfrog type, and the smallest is infilling type. (3) Annual trend of NLST shows an increasing trend for all three urban expansion types during the last two decades, which of extension mode was biggest, while, that of infilling growth was smallest. This research can attribute a better understanding for the impact of urban expansion on surface heat island effects.

TI  - Exploring the potential of multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation in crop mapping using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural applications. Although studies have combined deep learning methods and time-series satellite images to crop classification with satisfactory results, most of them focused on supervised methods, which are usually applicable to a specific domain and lose their validity in new domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) was proposed to solve this limitation by transferring knowledge from source domains with labeled samples to target domains with unlabeled samples. Particularly, multi-source UDA (MUDA) is a powerful extension that leverages knowledge from multiple source domains and can achieve better results in the target domain than single-source UDA (SUDA). However, few studies have explored the potential of MUDA for crop mapping. This study proposed a MUDA crop classification model (MUCCM) for unsupervised crop mapping. Specifically, 11 states in the U.S. were selected as the multi-source domains, and three provinces in Northeast China were selected as individual target domains. Ten spectral bands and five vegetation indexes were collected at a 10-day interval from time-series Sentinel-2 images to build the MUCCM. Subsequently, a SUDA model Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and two direct transfer methods, namely, the deep neural network and random forest, were constructed and compared with the MUCCM. The results indicated that the UDA models outperformed the direct transfer models significantly, and the MUCCM was superior to the DANN, achieving the highest classification accuracy (OA>85%) in each target domain. In addition, the MUCCM also performed best in in-season forecasting and crop mapping. This study is the first to apply a MUDA to crop classification and demonstrate a novel, effective solution for high-performance crop mapping in regions without labeled samples.

TI  - Object-based change detection for vegetation disturbance and recovery using Landsat time series
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of historical trends in vegetation change at the landscape scale is necessary for resource management and ecological assessment. Vegetation disturbance and recovery are coherent spatial and temporal processes. Pixel-based change detection methods often struggle to provide reliable estimates of change events because they neglect spatial contextual information and are affected by salt-and-pepper noise. To address such problems, we propose a new approach, "object-based change detection of trends in disturbance and recovery" (Object-LT), which introduces object-based image analysis (OBIA) into the current framework of LandTrendr algorithm. We then applied this approach to detect vegetation changes during 2000-2020 in the ecologically fragile region of Guyuan, Ning Xia, China. Accuracy assessment indicated that Object-LT could accurately identify disturbance and recovery trends in vegetation with overall accuracies of 90.05% and 87.50%, respectively. Compare with pixel-based LandTrendr algorithm, Object-LT significantly improved user's accuracy and removed salt-and-pepper noise. Spatial-temporal maps of vegetation change showed that the recovery area was 571.27 km(2) while the disturbed area was 297.65 km(2), accounting for 5.44% and 2.83% of the study area, respectively. This indicates a general vegetation recovery trend in the study area. Object-LT allowed for an accurate and comprehensive characterization of vegetation change over large areas, which contributes to a better understanding of change processes of vegetation landscape over time.

TI  - Integration of ground-based and space-borne radar observations for three-dimensional deformations reconstruction: application to Luanchuan mining area, China
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Luanchuan mining area, which is located in Henan Province, China and characterized by undulating topography and large precipitation, is vulnerable to the landslide disasters. The observations from the space-borne radar (ascending and descending TerraSAR-X) images and the ground-based radar (GPRI-II) images are integrated to monitor the surface deformations in Luanchuan mining area. Before the integration of the observations from multi-source SAR images, the coordinate systems of multi-source images are required to be unified by geographical projection. However, the accuracy of the commonly used geographical coding will be degraded by external DEM errors and inaccurate satellite orbit, which makes it difficult to achieve the high-precision registration of space-borne and ground-based radar scenes. Therefore, in this paper the iterative closest point (ICP) method is introduced to register the space-borne and ground-based images, yielding sub-pixel registration accuracy. Reasonable weights are then assigned to multi-source observations through Strain Model and Variance Component Estimation (SM-VCE) method, from which the high-precision three-dimensional deformations can be reconstructed. The results show that the maximum deformation rates in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions of Luanchuan mining area from July 20, 2019, to August 1, 2019, are about 0.2, 0.4 and 0.7 mm/day, respectively. The deformations are mainly on the loose slags in the Luanchuan pit rather than the bedrock, as a result of the accumulation of waste slags. Some suggestions on the installation location of ground-based radar are also provided to better combine the space-borne and ground-based observations.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations of NDVI and its response to climate in China from 2001 to 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in global or regional environmental change. In this study, the spatial-temporal variations of NDVI and its response to climate in China and its seven sub-regions were investigated based on MODIS NDVI data, ERAS-land precipitation (PRE) and temperature (TEM) data from 2001 to 2020. The inter-annual growth rate of NDVI in China was 0.0021/yr in the past 20 years. The inter-annual growth rates of NDVI in seven sub-regions had significant differences at regional or seasonal scales. The ratio of improved vegetation area to the total studied area reached about 70%. In summer, vegetation degradation was concentrated in East China and Southwest China. The vegetation in Central China and South China improved more obviously in autumn than in the other seasons. The vegetation of Northeast China had a remarkable degradation in autumn and winter, especially in winter. The influence degree of PRE (q = 0.54, P < 0.01) was greater than that of TEM (q = 0.27, P < 0.01) in the control of the spatial distribution of NDVI. The interaction influence degree q of PRE boolean AND TEM was about 0.71 in the last 20 years. However, the PRE and TEM played different roles in vegetation growth in seven sub-regions.

TI  - Stress-associated metabolites vary with both season and habitat across populations of a climate sentinel species
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Relating physiological stress to habitat quality could refine conservation efforts. Habitat quality, which is often inferred from patch occupancy or demographic rates, might be measured in a more timely and nuanced way using metrics of physiological stress. To understand whether stress-associated hormones vary with metrics of habitat quality, we measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels in the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a small mammal with well-defined habitat (talus), which can vary in quality depending on the presence of subsurface ice features. In spring and fall 2018, we collected feces noninvasively from pika territories in taluses "with" or "without" subsurface ice to capture seasonal variation in FGM between habitat types. We used linear mixed effects models to explore the interactions among season, habitat metrics (including subsurface ice status), and subsurface temperature as predictors of FGM. We found support for interacting effects on FGM levels, which covaried with season, elevation, putative ice presence, graminoid to forb ratio, graminoid cover, and measures of acute subsurface heat exposure. However, only one subsurface temperature metric differed according to putative presence of subsurface ice. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that FGMs might be developed as a tool to assess habitat quality.

TI  - Historical trends of degradation, loss, and recovery in the tropical forest reserves of Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Guinean Forest region of West Africa, a globally significant biodiversity hotspot, is among the driest and most human-impacted tropical ecosystems. We used Landsat to study forest degradation, loss, and recovery in the forest reserves of Ghana from 2003 to 2019. Annual canopy cover maps were generated using random forests and results were temporally segmented using the LandTrendr algorithm. Canopy cover was predicted with a predicted-observed r(2) of 0.76, mean absolute error of 12.8%, and mean error of 1.3%. Forest degradation, loss, and recovery were identified as transitions between closed (>60% cover), open (15-60% cover) and low tree cover (< 15% cover) classes. Change was relatively slow from 2003 to 2015, but there was more disturbance than recovery resulting in a gradual decline in closed canopy forests. In 2016, widespread fires associated with El Nino drought caused forest loss and degradation across more than 12% of the moist semi-deciduous and upland evergreen forest types. The workflow was implemented in Google Earth Engine, allowing stakeholders to visualize the results and download summaries. Information about historical disturbances will help to prioritize locations for future studies and target forest protection and restoration activities aimed at increasing resilience.

T2  - ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction models for crude protein concentration (CP) in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based on multispectral reflectance data from field trials in 2019 and 2020 in southern Sweden were developed and evaluated for independent trial sites. Reflectance data were collected using an unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne camera with nine spectral bands having similar specification to nine bands of Sentinel-2 satellite data. Models were tested for application on near-real time Sentinel-2 imagery, on the prospect that CP prediction models can be made available in satellite-based decision support systems (DSS) for precision agriculture. Two different prediction methods were tested: linear regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Linear regression based on the best-performing vegetation index (the chlorophyll index) was found to be approximately as accurate as the best performing MARS model with multiple predictor variables in leave-one-trial-out cross-validation (R-2 = 0.71, R-2 = 0.70 and mean absolute error 0.64%, 0.60% CP respectively). Models applied on satellite data explained to a small degree between-field variations in CP (R-2 = 0.36), however did not reproduce within-field variation accurately. The results of the different methods presented here show the differences between methods used and their potential for application in a DSS.

TI  - Routeview: an intelligent route planning system for ships sailing through Arctic ice zones based on big Earth data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of Arctic routes (ARs) has attracted global attention, and exploiting the Arctic has become an important strategy for many countries. However, there are still some challenges for ships sailing in Arctic ice zones, including harsh marine environments and the insufficient service capacity of sea ice information service systems. To better understand the route changes in the Arctic and extract real-time ship navigation routes, we developed an online interactive route planning system (RouteView) for ships sailing in the Arctic based on big Earth data. RouteView includes two main features: (1) an online calculation interface is provided for optimal routes along the Arctic Northeast Passage (NEP) 60 days into the future by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) based on sea ice and meteorological data, and (2) an online ice-water classification is established based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and deep learning to help users extract the sea ice distribution in real time. This work can potentially enhance the safety of shipping navigation along the NEP and improve information extraction methods for ARs.

TI  - Detecting annual anthropogenic encroachment on intertidal vegetation using full Landsat time-series in Fujian, China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal vegetation plays an essential role in habitat provision for waterbirds but suffers great losses due to human activities. However, it is challenging in tracking the human-driven loss and degradation of intertidal vegetation due to rapid urbanization in a high temporal resolution. In this study, a methodological framework based on full Landsat time-series (FLTS) is proposed to detect the year of change (YOC) of intertidal vegetation converted to impervious surfaces (ISs) and artificial ponds (APs), and the condition of the remaining intertidal vegetation was also assessed by FLTS, in the Fujian province, a subtropical coastal area lying in southeast China. The accuracies of the YOC detection of intertidal vegetation converted to IS and AP were 91.84% and 72.73%, with mean absolute errors of 0.26 and 1.06, respectively. The total areas of intertidal vegetation encroached by IS and AP were 31.68 km(2) and 23.85 km(2), respectively. Most ISs were developed later than 2010, and most APs were developed earlier than 2005, which are highly related to the implementation of local policies for economic development. The remaining intertidal vegetation in growing, stable, and degraded conditions were 43.05%, 56.38%, and 0.57%, respectively. The results indicated that areas of intertidal vegetation were reclaimed for anthropogenic uses at a considerable rate, although the intertidal vegetation still increased owing to natural development after the establishment of natural reserves. The study demonstrates that the FLTS has capacities in monitoring the dynamics in coastal zones solely for its dense earth observations.

TI  - Mapping fallow fields using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives over farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China with Google Earth Engine
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The cropland in the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China is highly unstable owing to environmental restoration projects, poor soil fertility, poverty, and rural labor loss, and it is characterized by a large number of fallow fields. Mapping fallow fields in a farming-pastoral ecotone can help in evaluating the impact of complex cropland landscapes on the environment and food security. To map the fallow fields using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives, a multi-metric dataset of vertical transmit-vertical receive + vertical transmit-horizontal receive polarization was established. Moreover, spectral bands and vegetation index datasets were established using Google Earth Engine to classify cropped and fallow fields using the Random Forest classifier. The overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients of different datasets were assessed to examine the dataset with the highest overall accuracy in the main growing season. A 10 m resolution fallow map for 2020 was then generated based on the combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were 95.82% and 0.92, respectively. In addition, the time-series characteristics of the entropy eigenvalues generated via dual-polarization decomposition were quantitatively evaluated to clarify the contribution of the Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar archive to the fallow field mapping. The eigenvalues were more sensitive to the phenological characteristics of cropped and fallow fields than the original backscatter signal of the Sentinel-1 data. Moreover, the mapping method was tested at different time intervals by gradually aggregating the results across an increasing number of months to optimize the fallow field monitoring using the minimum number of observations possible within a short period. Data aggregated over August achieved the highest one-month accuracy; it was also very close to the observations from the whole growing season. The results further emphasize the influence of Sentinel-1 archives on fallow field mapping. Overall, this study clarifies the potential applicability of Sentinel archives for monitoring and mapping managing patterns of agricultural land in a region.

TI  - Quantifying understory vegetation density using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and GEDI LiDAR data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understory vegetation contributes considerably to biodiversity and total aboveground biomass of forest ecosystems. Whereas field inventories and LiDAR data are generally used to estimate understory vegetation density, methods for large-scale and spatially continuous estimation of understory vegetation density are still lacking. For an evergreen coniferous forest area in southern China, we developed and tested an effective and practical remote sensing-driven approach for mapping understory vegetation, based on phenological differences between over and understory vegetation. Specifically, we used plant area volume density (PAVD) calculations based on GEDI data to train a support vector regression model and subsequently estimated the understory vegetation density from Sentinel-2 derived metrics. We produced maps of PAVD for the growing and non-growing season respectively, both performing well compared against independent GEDI samples (R-2 = 0.89 and 0.93, p < 0.01). Understory vegetation density was derived from the differences in PAVD between the growing and non-growing season. The understory vegetation density map was validated against field samples from 86 plots showing an overall R-2 of 0.52 (p < 0.01), rRMSE = 21%. Our study developed a tangible approach to map spatially continuous understory vegetation density with the combination of GEDI LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery, showing the potential to improve the estimation of terrestrial carbon storage and better understand forest ecosystem processes across larger areas.

TI  - Cloud-based storage and computing for remote sensing big data: a technical review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid growth of remote sensing big data (RSBD) has attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry. Despite the progress of computer technologies, conventional computing implementations have become technically inefficient for processing RSBD. Cloud computing is effective in activating and mining large-scale heterogeneous data and has been widely applied to RSBD over the past years. This study performs a technical review of cloud-based RSBD storage and computing from an interdisciplinary viewpoint of remote sensing and computer science. First, we elaborate on four critical technical challenges resulting from the scale expansion of RSBD applications, i.e. raster storage, metadata management, data homogeneity, and computing paradigms. Second, we introduce state-of-the-art cloud-based data management technologies for RSBD storage. The unit for manipulating remote sensing data has evolved due to the scale expansion and use of novel technologies, which we name the RSBD data model. Four data models are suggested, i.e. scenes, ARD, data cubes, and composite layers. Third, we summarize recent research on the application of various cloud-based parallel computing technologies to RSBD computing implementations. Finally, we categorize the architectures of mainstream RSBD platforms. This research provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental issues of RSBD for computing experts and remote sensing researchers.

TI  - Recent resettlement programs, as drivers for Afromontane forest loss in the Hawa-Galan district of Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia has been experiencing resettlement programs primarily as a response to the tragedy of land degradation. The program, however, resulted in massive deforestation in the resettled sites. This study, therefore, aimed at evaluating the impact of resettlement on the moist evergreen Afromontane forest cover between 2000 and 2018 in the Hawa-Galan district. Landsat TM of 2000, ETM+ of 2010, and OLI of 2018 were used to detect forest cover change. Likewise, an explanatory sequential approach of mixed research design was used. Hence, 118 participants out of the total 2232 indigenous and resettled households were employed to survey the impact of deforestation.The study area lost 55% of its total area over the last two decades, corresponding to average deforestation rates of 2.06, 6.75, and 4.14% for the corresponding periods: 2000-2010, 2010-2018, and 2000-2018, respectively. Our findings also revealed the demographic, socioeconomic, and backgrounds of the resettlers were the prominent triggers. Conversion of forests to other uses will have far-reaching impacts on the residual biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, in the light of resettlement, it is high time for the Ethiopian government to revisit its intervention strategies and resettlement policies in the forest priority areas.

TI  - An improved coverage-oriented retrieval algorithm for large-area remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of satellite technology, the amount of remote sensing data and demand for remote sensing data analysis over large areas are greatly increasing. Hence, it is necessary to quickly filter out an optimal dataset from massive dataset to support various remote sensing applications. However, with the improvements in temporal and spatial resolution, remote sensing data have become fragmented, which brings challenges to data retrieval. At present, most data service platforms rely on the query engines to retrieve data. Retrieval results still have a large amount of data with a high degree of overlap, which must be manually selected for further processing. This process is very labour-intensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes an improved coverage-oriented retrieval algorithm that aims to retrieve an optimal image combination with the minimum number of images closest to the imaging time of interest while maximized covering the target area. The retrieval efficiency of this algorithm was analysed by applying different implementation practices: Arcpy, PyQGIS, and GeoPandas. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm and suggest that the GeoPandas-based approach is most advantageous when processing large-area data.
