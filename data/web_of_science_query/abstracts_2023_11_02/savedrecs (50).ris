TI  - TYPOLOGY OF METAPHOR IN POLITICAL INTERNET-COMMUNICATION
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article represents the modern approach to conceptual metaphor being a typical feature of political internet-communication. The metaphor image reflects the results of the world conceptualization, categorization, and assessment. The article investigates prominent metaphor types in the current socio-political content in Ukrainian and German internet-media and government bodies internet-pages. Metaphor typology is based on belonging of a metaphor source domain unit (subsidiary subject) to a semantic (or thematic) group. The conducted study outlines and analyzes anthropomorphic, naturomorphic, sociomorphic, and artefact metaphor. Every type includes the subtypes that underline the multidimensionality of conceptual metaphor semantics. The article describes the conceptual metaphor development directions. The dynamics of the analyzed metaphors depends on the source domain which functions as a scheme of the object being reproduced. Thus, metaphor forms and preserves the worldview and becomes a means to create new concepts.

TI  - Detecting Ships in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone: Requirements for a Dedicated SmallSat SAR Mission
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance tradeoffs of a smallsat synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system for maritime surveillance in the coastal waters of New Zealand are investigated. The lower costs of smallsat platforms allow for a constellation of SAR satellites that can be launched from New Zealand using an existing local launch service provider. The minimum SAR image quality necessary for a smallsat system to achieve a desired detection performance is determined using existing X-band satellite data. The image quality is specified in terms of noise-equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) and resolution. It was found that for a resolution cell of 4 m(2 )a system NESZ of -1.7 dB is sufficient to detect small fishing vessels with a probability of detection of 0.5, while maintaining the probability of false alarm below 10(10). These requirements are translated into a preliminary SAR system design.

TI  - SATELLITE-BASED INVESTIGATION ON THE SURFACE COOLING EFFECTS OF URBAN PARKS AND THEIR RANGE -A CASE STUDY FOR NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, GERMANY
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) has a cooling effect owing to shading and evapotranspiration and therefore has a climate regulating function within metropolitan areas. Urban parks are a type of GI that act as park cool islands (PCIs) and play a major role in mitigating the surface urban heat island. This study aims to (1) investigate the status quo of the surface cooling effect intensity of selected urban parks in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), including their cooling range, and to (2) propose a methodological approach for investigating the PCI intensity using remote sensing data considering the occurrence of mixed pixels To achieve these tasks, land surface temperature values based on Landsat 8 images from three different days in 2018 and 2019 were observed. In addition, a method for the reduction of mixed pixels was developed. The results confirm a surface cooling effect of 1-5 K and thus the existence of a PCI. The impact of the surface cooling effect was found within a minimum range of 150 m. However, the process of identifying the cooling area was complicated by the high proportion of GI in cities in NRW, compared to other study areas Further research on the influencing parameters of the surface cooling effect is needed.

TI  - Pansharpening PRISMA Data for Marine Plastic Litter Detection Using Plastic Indexes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral PRISMA images are new and have not yet been evaluated for their ability to detect marine plastic litter. The hyperspectral PRISMA images have a fine spectral resolution, however, their spatial resolution is not high enough to enable the discrimination of small plastic objects in the ocean. Pansharpening with the panchromatic data enhances their spatial resolution and makes their detection capabilities a technological challenge. This study exploits, for the first time, the potential of using satellite hyperspectral data in detecting small-sized marine plastic litter. Controlled experiments with plastic targets of various sizes constructed from several materials have been conducted. The required pre-processing steps have been defined and 13 pansharpening methods have been applied and evaluated for their ability to spectrally discriminate plastics from water. Among them, the PCA-based substitution efficiently separates plastic spectra from water without producing duplicate edges, or pixelation. Plastic targets with size equivalent to 8% of the original hyperspectral image pixel coverage are easily detected. The same targets can also be observed in the panchromatic image, however, they cannot be detected solely by the panchromatic information as they are confused with other appearances. Exploiting spectra derived from the pan-sharpened hyperspectral images, an index combining methodology has been developed, which enables the detection of plastic objects. Although spectra of plastic materials present similarities with water spectra, some spectral characteristics can be utilized for producing marine plastic litter indexes. Based on these indexes, the index combining methodology has successfully detected the plastic targets and differentiated them from other materials.

TI  - Metastatic and sentinel lymph node mapping using intravenously delivered Panitumumab-IRDye800CW
T2  - THERANOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a well-established minimally invasive staging procedure that maps the spread of tumour metastases from their primary site to the regional lymphatics. Currently, the procedure requires the local peri-tumoural injection of radiolabelled and/or optical agents, and is therefore operator dependent, disruptive to surgical workflow and restricted largely to a small subset of malignancies that can be readily accessed externally for local tracer injection. The present study set out to determine whether intravenous (IV) infusion of a tumor-targeted tracer could identify sentinel and metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in order to overcome these limitations.Methods: We examined 27 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), 18 of whom were clinically node negative (cNO). Patients were infused intravenously with 50mg of Panitumumab-IRDye800CW prior to surgical resection of their primary tumour with neck dissection and/or SLNB. Lymphadenectomy specimens underwent fluorescence molecular imaging to evaluate tracer distribution to LNs.Results: A total of 960 LNs were analysed, of which 34 (3.5%) contained metastatic disease. Panitumumab-IRDye800CW preferentially localized to metastatic and sentinel LNs as evidenced by a higher fluorescent signal relative to other lymph nodes. The median MFI of metastatic LNs was significantly higher than the median MFI of benign LNs (0.06 versus 0.02, p < 0.05).Furthermore, selecting the highest five fluorescence intensity LNs from individual specimens resulted in 100% sensitivity, 85.8% specificity and 100% negative predictive value (NPV) for the detection of occult metastases and 100% accuracy for clinically staging the neck. In the cN+ cohort, assessment of the highest 5 fluorescence LNs per patient had 87.5% sensitivity, 93.2% specificity and 99.1% NPV for the detection of metastatic nodes.Conclusion: When intravenously infused, a tumour-targeted tracer localized to sentinel and metastatic lymph nodes. Further validation of an IV tumor-targeted tracer delivery approach for SLNB could dramatically change the practice of SLNB, allowing its application to other malignancies where the primary tumour is not accessible for local tracer injection.

TI  - Impact of land use and land cover change on the environmental quality of a region: A case of Ernakulam district in Kerala, India
T2  - REGIONAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing urbanisation trend over the decades has resulted in the rapid transformation of land use and land cover (LULC) patterns worldwide. One of the significant consequences of such an uncontrolled conversion process is on the environmental quality (EQ) of the regions, which needs to be addressed. Hence, the present study attempts to derive the environmental quality index (EQI) to measure the impact of LULC along a rapidly urbanising region. The study was divided into three phases. Firstly, the relevant variables were systematically identified from the literature and screened based on relevance, redundancy, context, and scale of the study. The variables then were finalised based on data availability and expert suggestions. The selected variables were grouped under biophysical, LULC, and socio-economic domains. Secondly, using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, LULC analysis was performed and the bio-physical variables were processed. The LULC maps (with five classes: water body, settlements, hill, forest, and agriculture) were prepared for the study region for 2000, 2009, and 2019 from Landsat images using a supervised classification algorithm. The LULC analysis showed an increase in the settlement over the past two decades. The relationship between the bio-physical indicators, namely, land surface temperature (LST), normalised difference vegetation index, and normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), was also established to examine the general perception that the increase in urbanisation is one of the main causes for the increase in LST of a region. The correlation indicated that the LST increased with a reduction in vegetation area and growth in settlement areas. Finally, the EQI was constructed using the entropy method of weighting. The spatial mapping of the EQ of the region was obtained and planning interventions were discussed. The EQI map demonstrated that the areas with more industrial belts had poorer EQ compared with other areas. The study also revealed that the conversion of the land cover into different land use types has led to the poor EQ of the region. The insights from the study can help the planners, administrators, and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding the EQ of a region and future urban construction activities in an area.

TI  - Grinding Mills in the Life of the Russian Peasantry of the Post-Reform Period
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Grinding mills were a routine attribute of the economic life of the peasantry, being an indispensable stage in the process of making bread. Yet these structures are hardly ever specifically researched by historians and anthropologists. This paper examines the socio-economic role of mills in the life of peasants of the early 20th century in Karelia. The study is based on the analysis of archival statistical data from the agricultural census of 1916 as well as on ethnographical and toponymical materials, which allows for a comprehensive examination of the object. The study has identified the number of mills in Karelia at the beginning of the 20th century. It also analyses the conditions that contributed to the effectiveness of functioning of these peasant farm buildings. It has been found that the mill craft in Karelia was the second (after blacksmithing) small-scale peasant production in terms of its economic benefit. At the same time, this type of economic activity was not the main source of income in those farms where they existed. The miller remained primarily a peasant farmer, but the level of prosperity of his economy was higher than that of other peasants. The sources used for the research have also enabled to trace the negative effects of crises in agriculture in Karelia during World War I on the flour milling business. A special attention in the paper is devoted to the mythological worldview of peasants. The analysis of the corpus of Karelian- and Russian-language toponymic data has confirmed the important role of grinding mills in the setup of the region's peasant economy.

T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the artistic embodiment and evolution of the artistic image of the Russian journalist M.O. Menshikov in A.T. Averchenko's short stories. The authors select and analyze A.T. Averchenko's texts, including the image of his contemporary - the Russian journalist and writer M.O. Menshikov. The authors reveal the attitude of publicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the personality and professional work of Menshikov, as well as dwell on the specific views of Averchenko. They also comprehend a general attitude towards Menshikov and his contribution to the weekly "Satyricon" magazine. In addition, they emphasize specific artistic techniques for creating the image of Menshikov, consider the author's position, and trace its changes. These changes in Averchenko's attitude to Menshikov in the late 1910s are associated with the worldview evolution of the former editor of "Satyricon" due to historical events and revolutionary shifts in society.

TI  - Saint-Simon and Napoleon: the Emperor's Personality and the Philosopher's Worldview
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses Saint-Simon's ideas about the mechanism of transition to social reorganization, which he saw as the main content of his contemporary era. Starting with the Letters of Geneva Resident to Contemporaries in the plans of the philosopher a special, exclusive place was given to Napoleon. Saint-Simon expected to strike, attract with his ideas a new star who rose on a political skyscraper. He judged from a belief in the linear, logical-defined course of history. Napoleon was present in the mind of the philosopher as a hero who overcame the negative consequences of the French Revolution, almost the only one able to comprehend easily innovative ideas concerning the transformation of society. In the initial version of Saint-Simon's philosophy of history, he acts as a necessary element to cement the past with the future. In the time of the First Empire Saint-Simon's admiration of Napoleon increases, along with his genius is glorified his invincibility as the greatest of people and his coming world conquest. Following this event, the theorist of socialism expects a genius to turn to the sciences and issues of reforming society in the way he predicted. He regarded the "Emperor's Tribunal" as the highest, most authoritative instance to appeal to resolve worldview collisions. The Restoration cardinally changes the philosopher's attitude to Napoleon's personality. His role in history for socialist's consciousness is no longer progressive, but rather conservative. But the general principle - the search for support for his projects from the head of state - is not rejected by Saint-Simon. Now he appeals to Louis XVIII and in general to European monarchs. The bet on a peaceful way of moving to a new, fairer structure, dictated a series of attempts by the philosopher to build a dialogue with the representatives of power.

TI  - Carbon stocks and their spatial distribution in drained and rewetted peatland forests in a low mountain range area, Germany
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage and rewetting of peatlands changes their carbon (C) dynamics. We measured C stocks in the soil and biomass of drained and rewetted peatland forests in the region of the National Park Hunsruck-Hochwald, Germany. A detailed soil map was produced, showing the important soil properties for soil C stocks. Based on the horizon-substrate combination as well as LiDAR data, the spatial distribution of soil and forest C stocks was analysed. Our results show that our peatland sites have shallow soils with a heterogeneous spatial distribution. Mean (+/- SE) soil C stocks in the monitoring sites are 121(+/- 8) t ha(-1) whereas the forest stores on average 71(+/- 0.2) t ha(-1) of C in the biomass. Tree removal in the drained peatlands reduced the total C stocks by 4,430 t. The quality and longevity of the wood products that arise from tree removal will determine whether or not the harvested portion of the C captured by the trees is sequestered over long timescales. Additionally, the success of rewetting activities and the potential soil carbon sequestration or (non-) soil carbon loss will determine whether these ecosystems are carbon sinks or sources. An extrapolation of our data resulted in estimated C stocks of 171,530 t and 544,282 t for peatland soils and for the spruce forest, respectively, for the whole area of the National Park (about 10,000 ha).

TI  - CITY PLACE NAMES AND THEIR MODIFICATION IN CHILD SPEECH
T2  - VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The anthropocentric focus of contemporary linguistic research highlights the specificity of individual linguistic worldview which includes a personal sense of toponymy. The studies discussing the ways that toponymic concepts are apprehended, memorized, and retrieved from memory are usually based on experimental data. But looking at irregular changes that toponyms may receive in individual speech is no less informative. Children's speech proves the most valuable source for this, since it is less bound to the language norms of everyday communication, which makes the modifications more distinct. The author uses a collection (more than 170 items) of St.-Petersburg toponym modifications from children of 3-11 years old, drawing some conclusions about the peculiarities of their auditory perception (the role of individual frequency, phonemic and supra-phonemic word features in building semantic awareness, the specificity of phoneme patterns recognition by children and the processes of etymologizing and rethinking the internal form of the word), memorizing and storing information (the study of the child's vocabulary connections and semantization of words including proper and common nouns; making up words and grammatical forms in the course of their multiple reproduction). Analysis of this real-life data brings clarity over some structural and functional aspects of individual linguistic systems and their speech manifestations. The information obtained can be used for creating child's speech, memory, and attention training programs, as well as for studies in local history.

TI  - Winter coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea: Interannual variability and driving factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of winter coccolithophore blooms in the Black Sea is studied using satellite measurements for 2003-2017 and Bio-Argo buoys data. Analysis shows that such blooms can occupy the entire upper 60-m layer with satellite-derived estimates of surface cell concentration reaching in some years 3.0.10(6) cells l(-1). On average, winter coccolithophore blooms start in November-December, peak in the first decade of January, and terminate in February. They are characterized by significant interannual variability. Blooms in different years can be "basin-wide" covering most of the sea (2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2012-2013) and "local" when they are observed only in certain areas of the Black Sea, most often in its southern part. A detailed analysis of the evolution of winter blooms has shown that they are usually triggered by intense storms, which are followed after 1-2 weeks by the initial growth of coccolithophores in the zone of storm-driven upwelling. Cross-shelf nutrients exchange may contribute to the coccolithophore growth over the continental slope. Intense winter coccolithophore blooms are observed in years with low autumn concentrations of chlorophyll-a, i. e., during periods of weakening of the typical diatom blooming autumn-winter. The strongest correlation on annual time scales is found between bloom intensity and decrease of the autumn-winter wind curl. We suggest that low wind curl causes a weakening of the basin-scale cyclonic circulation and intensifies the cross-shelf exchange, impacting the Black Sea trophic structure in the preceding summer period and may promote the winter bloom of coccolithophores in such years.

TI  - The Archaic Beliefs.bout Wind in the Kalmyk Folklore: An Interdisciplinary Approach
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with the archaic beliefs of the Kalmyk people and their ancestors about wind being one of the main fragments of the worldview within the 'weather' frame. The author provides insight into the shaping of meanings and connotations that constitute the very concept of 'wind'. Reconstructing this fragment in an archaic worldview seems to be crucial, since these ideas reflect the ancient beliefs of the Kalmyks and their ancestors. The investigated materials are multi-genre folklore texts, both published and unpublished ones. The study comes to a number of conclusions. So, the inner form of the lexeme 'wind' mirrors the evident semantics of wind. The important characteristics of the word are humidity, temperature, and intensity, indicating that the archaic worldview contained certain scientific elements. Some myths and folktale texts depict this natural phenomenon as a living being characterized by human deeds (but not emotions). Wind acts as both a positive and destructive figure in folklore narratives, quite a share of oral lore texts retaining this ambivalent structure of the concept. According to the spatial universe model, wind comes not from the Middle world but rather from the Lower one. Gradually, wind started being perceived not only as a powerful tool in the service of positive or negative characters but as an independent force capable of bringing in food and, consequently, sustaining life.

TI  - Volumes by tree species can be predicted using photogrammetric UAS data, Sentinel-2 images and prior field measurements
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Photogrammetric point clouds obtained with unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have emerged as an alternative source of remotely sensed data for small area forest management inventories (FMI). Nonetheless, it is often overlooked that small area FMI require considerable field data in addition to UAS data, to support the modelling of forest attributes. In this study, we propose a method whereby tree volumes by species are predicted with photogrammetric UAS data and Sentinel-2 images, using models fitted with airborne laser scanning data. The study area is in a managed boreal forest area in Eastern Finland. First, we predicted total volume with UAS point cloud metrics using a prior regression model fitted in another area with ALS data. Tree species proportions were then predicted by k nearest neighbor (k-NN) imputation based on bi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images without measuring new field plot data. Species-specific volumes were then obtained by multiplying the total volume by species proportions. The relative root mean square error (RMSE) values for total and species-specific volume predictions at the validation plot level (30 m x 30 m) were 9.0%, and 33.4-62.6%, respectively. Our approach appears promising for species-specific small area FMI in Finland and in comparable forest conditions in which suitable field plots are available.

TI  - From Narrative to Analysis: "The Great French Monarchy" by Claude de Seyssel as Reflection of Trends in Development of Historical Worldview between Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Age
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The work of Claude de Seyssel "The Great French Monarchy" is considered in the context of new data on the development or historical writing in the late Middle Ages and early modern times. It is noted that this treatise is not similar to the traditional historical works of the era of humanism, since in it the ancient idealism in the field of assessing social structures was replaced by explicit realism in the understanding that the basis of social relations was the nobility. Attention is paid to the method and approach that distinguishes this treatise, considering the views on the development of science, formulated by M. Foucault. It is indicated that de Seyssel considered the Renaissance an era of imitation and comparison, and only the time of the scientific revolution of the 17th - 18th centuries as a period of interest in the analysis of the structure of society and power. It is shown that, at the same time, in the work of de Seyssel, written around 1519, we see precisely the method of structural analysis, and not a comparative narrative. The authors conclude that, like the Venetian historian Domenico Morosini, who did not idealize the Venetian Republic, de Seissel did not idealize the French monarchy and viewed it as the power of the noble class in all its aspects.

TI  - Smaller and Isolated Grassland Fragments Are Exposed to Stronger Seed and Insect Predation in Habitat Edges
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens terrestrial arthropod biodiversity, and thereby also leads to alterations of ecosystem functioning and stability. Predation on insects and seeds by arthropods are two very important ecological functions because of their community-structuring effects. We addressed the effect of fragment connectivity, fragment size, and edge effect on insect and seed predation of arthropods. We studied 60 natural fragments of two grassland ecosystems in the same region (Hungarian Great Plain), 30 forest-steppes, and 30 burial mounds (kurgans). The size of fragments were in the range of 0.16-6.88 ha for forest-steppe and 0.01-0.44 ha for kurgan. We used 2400 sentinel arthropod preys (dummy caterpillars) and 4800 seeds in trays for the measurements. Attack marks on dummy caterpillars were used for predator identification and calculation of insect predation rates. In the case of seeds, predation rates were calculated as the number of missing or damaged seeds per total number of exposed seeds. Increasing connectivity played a role only in generally small kurgans, with a negative effect on insect and seed predation rates in the edges. In contrast, fragment size moderated edge effects on insect and seed predation rates in generally large forest-steppes. The difference between edges and centres was more pronounced in small than in large fragments. Our study emphasizes the important role of landscape and fragment-scale factors interacting with edge effect in shaping ecosystem functions in natural grassland fragments of modified landscapes. Managing functional landscapes to optimize the assessment of ecosystem functions and services needs a multispatial scale approach.

AB  - On the example of the SABER/TIMED satellite data measured in 2003, we analyze the quality of daytime O and H retrieval at the altitudes of the mesosphere - lower thermosphere with the use of the condition of ozone photochemical equilibrium, which takes into account only the main chemical sink of this component due to photodissociation. It is shown that neglecting the reaction H+O-3 -> O-2+OH in this condition weakly manifests itself in the H distributions, but leads to a significant (up to 50-70%) systematic underestimation of the monthly mean and annually mean O distributions at the altitudes of 75-90 km.

TI  - GIS and remote sensing-based assessment of soil erosion risk using RUSLE model in South-Kivu province, eastern, Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion risk assessment in South-Kivu longs for the colonial epoch, while the province faces the problem of extreme degradation of land in the form of soil erosion. Thus, the study attempts to assess the soil erosion at the province level using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in conjunction with the Geographical Information System (GIS), and remote sensing data. The estimated total soil erosion was 2.084 million tons; with an annual average of 138.2 t ha(-1 )yr(-1). Moreover, the soil loss greater than 100 t ha(-1 )yr(-1) accounts for 45.2% of the total erosive land. The soil erosion worsening nearly the entire territories range between 87 t ha(-1 )yr(-1) in Shabunda to 248 t ha(-1 )yr(-1) in Uvira. Under high aggressiveness of rainfall with mean of 1857.19 mm/y, the highest rate found in Perennial crop, Trees, and Cropland in contrast to Shrub and closed Forest was mainly due to the mean slope of 22% found in the former Land cover categories compared to 17% of Shrubland and closed forest. The adoption of terracing could reduce by 76% the current rate of cropland i.e., from (162.12 t ha(-1 )yr(-1) to 38 t ha(-1 )yr(-1)). Therefore it is strongly recommended.

TI  - HEIDEGGER'S BEING, RAHNER'S GOD: IS THE QUESTION STILL RELEVANT OR ALREADY ANSWERED?
T2  - HORIZON-FENOMENOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The secularized and rational-oriented mindset of the Western civilization does not preclude important elements of a religious worldview. The objective of the present study is to come to understand the role the categories of Being and God play in the present day spiritual situation. Heidegger's and Rahner's views are considered here within the prospective of the paradigmatic process. The latter marks the fading away of the classical understanding of God and search for new and divine meanings. Therefore I suggest considering some of the most significant motifs in the two philosophers' reflection as regards the history of western civilization and our epoch in the context of the categories of God and Being. Among these motifs there are such attitudes as subjectivism, self-suggestion, disposal of beings, planetarism, oblivion of Being, loss of origins, groundlessness, alienation, situation of meaninglessness. It is due to these attitudes, especially owing to meaninglessness, that many people tend to raise again the issue of the concealed, the encompassing, God or Being. Or perhaps speaking about "Being" and "God" can be interpreted as something that leads to the oblivion of Being and to atheism. "Being" in Heidegger and "God" in Rahner single out the existential centre to which forms of life are related. Nowadays it is forgotten or even vanishes. "God" or "Being" hold everything together and confer meaning thereto. Could it be exactly what modern man is in search of? One has to find answers to these questions.

TI  - An Improved Decomposition as a Trade-Off Between Utilizing Unitary Matrix Rotations and New Scattering Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The requirement of an efficient decomposition technique has always been a priority in the field of physical model-based scattering power decomposition. In view of this, the presented work has been carried out in two sections. In the first part, two parallel model-based approaches have critically been analyzed based on their decomposition strategy, result, and limitations. Considering the challenges, the second section emerges out with an improved seven-component (7SR) decomposition technique. The proposed architecture is ideally based on embedding the best attributes of both the parallel approaches under one roof. The productivity of the introduced method has been validated on ALOS PALSAR-2 datasets over the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, USA, and Mumbai, India. Algorithmic simplicity and proper distribution of decomposed scattering powers are maintained as the results have been obtained without considering any power restriction constraints. The work shows an enhancement in the underlined dominant scattering mechanism. Simultaneously, a tremendous suppression in the percentage of negative scattering pixels is also achieved, making the 7SR algorithm special among its class.

TI  - Inundation mapping using SENTINEL-1 data in the aftermath of super cyclone Amphan : A case study
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding the extent and severity of inundation resulting because of the landfall of a Tropical Cyclone is required by disaster risk managers in near time to carry out planning and rescue operations. In this regards the Satellite based remote sensing plays a vital role and provides this information to risk managers in near real time. Traditionally Optical data is being used for flood/inundation mapping but it suffers from two constraints : non-availability due to cloud cover and during night time. Microwave SAR data overcomes both these constraints and can provide ground information even during heavy cloud cover and night-time. In this study, inundation mapping of the affected districts of West Bengal due to landfall of Super Cyclone Amphan is attempted by using SAR data from SENTINEL-1 satellite. NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature data is also used to carry out the analysis of Bay of Bengal during the genesis and rapid intensification of Super Cyclone Amphan. GsMAP rainfall data is used to carry out rainfall assessment during the landfall of Super Cyclone Amphan. The inundation maps generated using SENTINEL-1 SAR data were validated with the optical images from SENTINEL-2 satellite. The use of SAR data is very crucial for disaster managers in order to plan and execute rescue operations in inundated areas.

TI  - Integrated drought monitoring index: A tool to monitor agricultural drought by using time-series datasets of space-based earth observation satellites
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, integrated drought monitoring index (IDMI) was proposed as a tool to assess and monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of agricultural drought during the northeast monsoon season for the period from 2000 to 2016 in Tamil Nadu state, south-eastern part of Indian peninsula. The IDMI is characterized as the principal component of precipitation condition index (PCI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and vegetation condition index (VCI) derived from time-series satellite observations of climate hazards group infra-red precipitation with stations (CHIRPS), European space agency climate change initiative (ESA-CCI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The study shows that in the year 2016, about 44.4 and 17.8% of Tamil Nadu state was under extreme and severe drought conditions, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the study shows that PCI is the most influential parameter to IDMI, followed by VCI and TCI. The validation of IDMI with 3-month standardized precipitation index (SPI) by using Pearson correlation test shows a strong positive correlation between IDMI and 3-month SPI with correlation coefficient (r) value of 0.73 and 0.77 for the wet (2005) and dry year (2016), respectively. The study clearly demonstrates the potential of IDMI derived from time-series datasets of earth observation satellites as a tool in assessment and monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics of agricultural drought. The proposed IDMI could be effectively used as a reliable tool to monitor agricultural drought and develop its mitigation strategies to minimise the adverse effects of drought on agriculture, water resources, and livelihoods of the people.

TI  - Rapid Evaluation and Validation Method of Above Ground Forest Biomass Estimation Using Optical Remote Sensing in Tundi Reserved Forest Area, India
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing data are freely available on a global scale. However, the satellite image processing and analysis for quick, accurate, and precise forest above ground biomass (AGB) evaluation are still challenging and difficult. This paper is aimed to develop a novel method for precise, accurate, and quick evaluation of the forest AGB from optical remote sensing data. Typically, the ground forest AGB was calculated using an empirical model from ground data for biophysical parameters such as tree density, height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) collected from the field at different elevation strata. The ground fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) in each ground sample location was calculated. Then, the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) from optical remote sensing imagery was calculated. In the first stage of method implementation, the relation model between the ground FVC and ground forest AGB was developed. In the second stage, the relational model was established between image FVC and ground FVC. Finally, both models were fused to derive the relational model between image FVC and forest AGB. The validation of the developed method was demonstrated utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery as test data and the Tundi reserved forest area located in the Dhanbad district of Jharkhand state in eastern India was used as the test site. The result from the developed model was ground validated and also compared with the result from a previously developed crown projected area (CPA)-based forest AGB estimation approach. The results from the developed approach demonstrated superior capabilities in precision compared to the CPA-based method. The average forest AGB estimation of the test site obtained by this approach revealed 463 tons per hectare, which matches the previous estimate from this test site.

AB  - The remote sensing (RS) imagery is important to the development of the spectral signature of mango orchards, vegetation, and other land-use features, and to geospatial feature extraction using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The geospatial information is useful for monitoring vegetation growth, urban development, and land-use / land-cover (LU/LC) change detection. The objective of this study to develop a spectral signature and feature extraction of land-use classes using the multi-temporal and multi-spectral (MTMS) Landsat imagery dataset. The imagery dataset has obtained three images from various sensors of the Landsat satellite system from the years 2003 to 2017. The pre-processing of the imagery is crucial for geospatial feature extraction and analysis of land-use features. The vegetation index (VI) is used in this study to monitor the health and growth of orchards, vegetation, and crop. The resulting accuracy of classification using ANNs method for different years (2017, 2010, and 2003) are 90.10%, 75.75%, and 78.37%. The results of the presented study indicated that significant changes have occurred in the study region, which has affected the environment and human activities. The information of LU/LC's situation in the region will help the urban planners and decision-makers to plan for effectively managing future LU/LC change.

AB  - In almost developing countries of theworld, the per capita per person ratio of land resource is going to be decreased because of increasing population and the country like India is losing their agricultural dominant identity due to transformation of rural area into urban centers. This paper focuses the results on urban sprawl, landuse change, land transformation and land consumption of Allahabad cit based on Survey of India topographical maps of 1973, IKONOS satellite data of 2009 and 2014. The results show that in 1973, the urban built-up area of city based on SOI topographical map was 4760.09 ha, based on IKONOS satellite imageries of 2009 and 2014, the urban built-up area of the city is 7803.16 ha and 8138.39 ha, respectively. This has increased as 3043.07 ha at an interval of 36 years from 1973-2009 to 2009-2014, growth in urban area observed as 335.23 ha. Agricultural land, orchard/plantation, open space, water bodies, and nala converted into urban land. The trend change between 2009 and 2014 has been observed as remarkable decreased to 22.63% in agricultural land,-30.55% in open space, waterbodies-3.91%, and nala0.51%, respectively. The Land consumption rate and absorption coefficient between the period from 1973 to 2009 and 2014 is 0.006 ha and 0.007 ha, respectively. During 2009-2014, land consumption rate is observed 0.006 ha, land absorption coefficient is 0.001 ha and land consumption for 2014-2021, estimated as 0.005 ha. The digital database generated for Allahabad city in GIS would be very useful for better landuse planning/sustainable development of cities.

TI  - Easter Motifs in the "Ural Poems" by Boris Pasternak
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of the meaning of Christian holidays in the poetic world of B.L. Pasternak is studied on the example of the cycle "Ural poems". The issue of the special functional symbolic meaning of holidays in Pasternak's work which had previously only indirectly interested researchers is raised. An attempt is made to formulate the main functional characteristics of holidays in Pasternak's poetry, such as the breaking of space-time relations, the semantic connection of any holiday with all other events in the life of Christ, the opening of the borders of the gospel history and the entry of a lyrical hero into it. The purpose of the work is to show how these principles can help in interpreting specific texts of Pasternak and, on the other hand, to expand the understanding of the functional meaning of the festive aspect in the poet's lyrics using the example of the cycle "Ural poems". The article presents the experience of reading the poems of the cycle in the 1929 edition of the book "Over the barriers" and offers an explanation of further changes in the composition of the cycle. The complex of biblical motifs is tried to be identified in the poem, a possible correlation of "Station" with specific texts is suggested, for example, with the "First Catholic Epistle of the Apostle Peter". The study suggests a relationship of Easter motifs with the space of the Urals in Pasternak's worldview. We interpreted the cycle through the prism of Easter stories, such as the descent of Christ into hell. The Easter substratum is fundamentally linked to the poet's ideas about his own lyrics and art in general. The metaphor of involvement "everything into everything": nature, people, the poet and his poetry into the original gospel story makes significant adjustments to our ideas about Pasternak's artistic aesthetics. These observations prove that the idea of the Bible as a "notebook of humanity" (expressed in the "Security certificate") was with the poet long before the "Second birth" of the 1930s. The results of the research show that further study of the festive aspect of Pasternak's poetic world will make it possible to get a more complete picture of the poet's basic ideas about Christianity and art relationships which crystallize in holidays.

TI  - CARNIVALISATION OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE IN THE ERA OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article studies the carnivalisation of the Russian language in the era of the coronavirus pandemic (March-early December 2020) based on extracts from media texts and live colloquial speech. The phenomenon of carnivalisation is analysed with reference to M. M. Bakhtin's concept of carnivalisation and D. S. Likhachev's generalisations about the folk culture of laughter. It is established that the Russian carnival is associated with will. In the situation of a new "coronavirus normality", the language forms a layer of anxiety vocabulary, which stimulates word and meaning coinage. It is proved that mass linguistic creativity is a form of resistance to disturbing reality. The author systematises potential neologisms, nonce words, and non-standard metaphors. Word innovations act as a means of creating a comic effect, characterisation, and axiological assessment of reality, as well as a means of diagnosing the tender points of the coronavirus space and a means of psychotherapy. The author distinguishes a temporal model formed in the linguistic worldview which reflects the imperfection of the world: the extended present of the coronavirus; pre-coronavirus past; post-coronavirus future which is conceived as a desired return to the past (the slogan Bneped & ydyueel). As part of the analysis, the author describes a layer of new compound word-formations with......- as the first component. Also, she pays special attention to the interpretation of words close to the core of anxiety vocabulary (nymuHkybi, no Pi Hnu kappa apaHmuHeu, etc.). A unique object of analysis is a group of colloquial words that replace business standards (partial derivative ucmaHuuoHka, y partial derivative a pi eHk alpha, anpeueHka), as well as neologisms that expand the number of derivatives of the word Macka. The author points out the development of coronavirus literature and characterises new online technologies studied by literature, art, and education specialists. Finally, the article describes the axiological explosion accompanying the carnivalisation of the Russian language.

AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the structure and methods of mathematical modeling of technological systems for the production of agricultural products. The article presents a study of technological subsystems of the use of machinery and equipment in the production and processing of agricultural products. Examples of elements of a technological system in an agro-industrial complex are a tractor, an agricultural machine, a combine harvester, a device or adapter, a working tool and equipment for maintenance. The structure of mathematical modeling of probabilistic processes of ensuring the reliability of technological systems, taking into account the modeling of the patterns of their functioning, has been developed. It is proposed to consider technological systems in the agro-industrial complex at four levels of the hierarchy: technological systems of operations of the crop, livestock and other agricultural and processing agricultural products of industries, technological systems of processes of crop production, animal husbandry, processing of raw materials of plant and animal origin, technological systems of production units and technological systems of production units of enterprises. A block diagram of the algorithm for modeling the implementation of the plan and an assessment of the achieved results of increasing reliability in the crop, livestock, processing industries of the agricultural enterprise is presented.

TI  - The potential of Gokturk 2 satellite images for mapping burnt forest areas
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remotely sensed data to identify burnt forest areas produces fast, economical, and highly accurate results. Accordingly, in this study we investigate the capabilities of Gokturk-2, Turkey's national satellite, for mapping burnt forest areas. We compare our results with those obtained from Landsat-8 and Worldview-2 satellite images, which are frequently used for mapping burnt areas. The capabilities of the satellites are compared, in terms of detecting burnt forest areas, using support vector machine (SVM) and rotation forest (RF) classification, which are advanced methods.-According to the results of the accuracy analysis, SVM classification gives similar kappa statistics and overall accuracy for Gokturk-2 and Landsat-8 images, while the performance of Worldview-2 shows greater general accuracy. Although there is no significant difference between the two classification methods forLandsat-8 images, SVM gives better results than RF for both Gokturk-2 and Worldview-2. The results of our study show that Gokturk-2 images are an effective source for mapping burnt forest areas.

TI  - Linguistic and Cultural Perceptions of Selected Occupations in Eighteenth-Century Proverbs (on the Basis of <i>Nowy dykcjonarz</i> by Michal Abraham Troc)
T2  - STUDIA Z FILOLOGII POLSKIEJ I SLOWIANSKIEJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an attempt to show the possibilities offered by an analysis of a historical dictionary in researching the old ways of perceiving, categorizing and evaluating the world. The observations in question are based on proverbs extracted from Nowy dykcjonarz by Michal Abraham Troc, which is one of the most significant achievements of Polish lexicography of the eighteenth century.Using the methodology of linguistic worldview reconstruction, the authors present the ways of perceiving certain occupations (shoemakers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, cooks, doctors, executioners) by people in the eighteenth century and provide the cultural context of these perceptions. The analysis demonstrates that language is not only a communication tool, but also a carrier of the collective experience and outlook on life.

TI  - Assessment of Image Segmentation and Deep Learning for Mapping Paddy Fields Using Worldview-3 in Magelang, Central Java Provinces, Indonesia
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Paddy fields are complex land-use entities with various surface covers depending on the timing of the planting stages. Therefore, the best practice to map paddy fields using remote sensing has benefited from the availability of multi-temporal data which were used to characterize the phenology related to the paddy fields. However, this practice may require more RS data to be obtained and processed. Other mapping methods by capitalizing the spatial configuration, such as image segmentation in Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and object recognition in Deep Learning using ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) architecture has been used in the mapping application. This study aims to assess the accuracy from using mean-shift image segmentation and Random Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting as the classifiers, with the accuracy from simple CNN architecture, by using Worldview-3 (WV3) full-spectrum image (16 bands). The image segmentation and deep learning analysis were conducted by using 16-bands from the WV3 image and classified by using RF and XGB, and CNN. The results showed that RF was able to identify the paddy fields with an accuracy of 88.09 % (User's accuracy (UA)) and 81.61 % (Producer's accuracy(PA)), while XGB produced an accuracy of 85.71 % (User's accuracy (UA)) and 82.44 % (Producer's accuracy (PA)), respectively. While CNN produced the accuracies of 49.5 % (PA), 96.3 % (UA) and 82.9 % (OA). The lower producer's accuracy indicated the higher omission error where more paddy fields were classified as non-paddy fields. CNN produced promising accuracy results for identifying paddy field tiles with 82.9 % accuracy without using data augmentation, although it will be needed to increase the accuracy and more complex CNN architecture such as U-net is needed to determine the boundary of the mapped objects.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article, in a contrasting way, examines the semantics of the biblical anthroponym Solomon. functioning in phraseological field and being an integral part of the anthroponymiconof both Russian and Spanish. Methodologically, in order to reveal the semantics of the biblical culture of Solomon. this name, which functions in both Spanish and Russian speech as an antonomasia, was investigated on the materials of fiction and press, on explanatory, encyclopedic and phraseological dictionaries of Spanish and Russian languages. Its main semantic characteristics are wisdom, wealth, justice. Due to its aphoristic content, the biblical name Solomon and its derivatives are widely used in the characterizing, identifying and appraisal functions in Spanish and Russian languages, often with a "reverse" sense. The full semantic-connotative and stylistic identity of sayings with the component Solomon in two languages is not observed, although traditionally they are considered equivalents. There are significant differences in the range of meanings of seemingly identical idioms.

TI  - The use of the normalized relative algoindex for the assessment of algae blooms in the reservoirs of the Vyatka-Kama cis-Urals
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of monitoring of two plain reservoirs located in the Vyatka-Kama Pre-Urals, according to remote sensing data and field observations. The reservoirs located in the Kirov region have similar morphological parameters, the same origin, but differ in the level of anthropogenic load. According to the satellite images taken from the Sentinel-2 satellite (A, B) in the period from May to September 2015-2020, the normalized relative algoindex (NDAI) was calculated. This index allows you to detect accumulations of phytoplankton in reservoirs. The NDAI values do not depend on atmospheric interference and the influence of the reflection spectrum of the water itself. The index images are built in the QGIS software product, version 3.20. The results obtained are compared with the data of field observations on reservoirs. The NDAI values in the water area of the Omutninsky reservoir during the observation period varied from 0.36 to 0.80, in the water area of the Chernokholunitsky reservoir from 0.32 to 0.84. Intensive algae bloom in the studied reservoirs was observed in August 2016 and July 2020. In the water areas where intense algae blooming was noted, the following species prevailed in the phytoplankton samples: Anabaena lemmermannii P.G. Richter, A. spiroides Klebahn, A. planctonica Brunnthaler, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault. The optical density of water in this case was 0.150 and higher (the length of the optical path of the cuvette is 10 mm, lambda = 615 nm), and the NDAI values were more than 0.50.

TI  - Contribution of woody elements to tree level reflectance in boreal forests
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral mixture analysis was used to estimate the contribution of woody elements to tree level reflectance from airborne hyperspectral data in boreal forest stands in Finland. Knowledge of the contribution of woody elements to tree or forest reflectance is important in the context of lea area index (LAI) estimation and, e.g., in the estimation of defoliation due to insect outbreaks, from remote sensing data. Field measurements from four Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), five Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and four birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) dominated plots, spectral measurements of needles, leaves, bark, and forest floor, airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne laser scanning data were used together with a physically-based forest reflectance model. We compared the results based on simple linear combinations of measured bark and needle/leaf spectra to those obtained by accounting for multiple scattering of radiation within the canopy using a physically-based forest reflectance model. The contribution of forest floor to reflectance was additionally considered. The resulted mean woody element contribution estimates varied from 0.140 to 0.186 for Scots pine, from 0.116 to 0.196 for birches and from 0.090 to 0.095 for Norway spruce, depending on the model used. The contribution of woody elements to tree reflectance had a weak connection to plot level forest variables.

TI  - Worldviews and National Values in Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish Early Childhood Education and Care Curricula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines how worldviews and national values are displayed in the national (Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) curricula of Sweden, Finland and Norway. The specific interest is to investigate what similarities and differences there are between these three ECEC curricula with regard to the position of religions and other worldviews. ECEC is often the first societal arena for children to enter and to negotiate their personal values, worldviews, and memberships in relation to the values represented in the surrounding social context. Countries employ different policies for dealing with diversity. Home languages for example, are often supported whereas for home cultures and worldviews, the policies and practices are more varied across contexts. By utilising a curriculum analysis informed content analysis, this study examines the curricular ECEC framework in each country context, highlighting the displayed national value preferences connected to worldviews. The study shows that these three Nordic countries have both similarities but also significant differences in the ways in which they approach the inter-relatedness of the aims of national values and worldview.

AB  - The paper points at the possibilities of Norwid's output reading-the output being rooted in Christianty, both in the dimension of poetics, aesthetics, and that of worldview-in a postsecular perspective. This perspective is devised in the spirit of Charles Taylor's thought that adopts the vision of modernity not only as progressing secularisation, but also as coexistence of secular and religious tendencies. Religion, in this view seen as one of worldview possibilities, is squeezed from the public sphere and made to commence a dialogue with modernity. Norwid's stance suits the horizon of such a dialogue: modernity criticism, reinterpretation of developing secularness, modes of its moral working, and simultaneously opening to the challenges of modernity, as well as drive for reintegration of the order of religion and civilisation.

TI  - NATURAL OBJECTS IN THE FUNERAL RITES OF THE RURAL POPULATION OF THE EUROPEAN BOSPORUS: TO INTERPRETATION
T2  - ROSSIISKAYA ARKHEOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with artifacts that traditionally attract the attention of researchers (fragments of ware, terracotta, coins, etc.), materials of natural origin have been recorded in burial complexes including seeds and grains of cultivated plants, shells of sea and river molluscs, pieces of chalk and dyes (ocher), flint, pebbles, and eggshells, which in most cases form a unique combination of items in the burial inventory. While having no independent cult significance, in the sacral space of the necropolis objects of this kind were endowed with new meanings and included in a system with a complex hierarchy of relations, thus playing a symbolic role in the burial custom. The use of natural objects in the funeral rite in general reflects the durability among the rural population of the rudiments of primitive religions and beliefs common to the archaic worldview of both the Greek and non-Greek populations. Natural objects in burials could correlate with the symbolism of the elements (water, fire, earth) involved in the cosmogonic process and embody the idea of a new birth, renewal, and fertility. As mediators between the worlds in an incessant cycle of death and rebirth, they were used in rites of transition, in which the relationship between the levels of the universe was reconstructed in accordance with the archaic worldview.

TI  - THE PROBLEM OF LONELINESS IN THE MODERN SOCIETY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE AUTHOR'S WORLDVIEW
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the problem of loneliness through the lens of the author's consciousness enables us to understand the principles of the relationships between people in the modern world and what should be a priority in it and also allows to determine the ways of promoting moral values through the author's word picture and artistic images. The ambiguity of approaches to the methods of linguistic and speech representation of artistic concepts has determined the purpose of this work as modeling the concept "Loneliness", the features of which in A. Gavalda's novel "Hunting and Gathering" ("Ensemble, c'est tout") reflect the peculiarities of the author's idiostyle and her attitude to the social phenomenon under study. The semantic-cognitive and contextual analysis reveal the main features of the concept that are characteristic of A. Gavalda's cognitive consciousness as a representative of the contemporary French society. The study reveals the specificity of the figurative component of the concept, characterized by a high degree of abstractness, analyzes the peculiarities of the structural space of the investigated conceptual sphere, and provides an evaluative characteristic of loneliness. The authors of this paper note that the studied concept acquires an individual perspective primarily at the level of its contextual representation. An analysis of the artistic images created by the writer makes it possible to determine the original means that she uses to express her position.

AB  - This study examined the patterns of 15 ecological fairytales and ecological consciousness, which were found in 7 kinds of folk tales in Korea, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. When the 15 stories are categorized based on the subject, relationship, and action, the human-nature cooperation type, human-animal confrontation type, and cooperation/confrontation chain type are identified.The human-nature cooperation type expresses a worldview in which humans, animals, and plants cooperate and depend on each other and establish a symbiotic relationship. The human-animal confrontation type expresses the reflection that if humans abuse or annihilate animals, catastrophe will occur to the ecosystem and personal affairs. In the cooperation/confrontation chain type, the ecological consciousness of causal retribution is found that those who value life are blessed and those who are cruel are punished.The spirit of respect for life found in the ecological fairytales of four Asian countries will broaden the perspective on ecological problems and contribute to joint recognition of today's Asian ecological problems and finding solutions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to confirm the change in the artist's theater and worldview through the characteristics of urban space, which is the main background of Lee Kang-baek's play. To this end, spatial elements such as characters and objects are analyzed in detail from a theatrical semiotic point of view. Not long ago, news of Chun Doo-hwan's death was reported. Currently, democracy is becoming a hot topic of the times again due to the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Myanmar incidents. Therefore, I would like to discuss a new world of works by artist Lee Kang-baek, who has reflected the democratic uprising in Korea and the meaning of the times in his work. It was after the mid-80s that Lee Kang-baek, who was selected as a representative writer in the 70s, was fiercely agonizing over the current social problems in the theater structure. With social issues as the theme of the play, Lee Kang-baek continues experiments and challenges that embody the problems of the times in the network of urban and human relations. Urban space embodies a subtle relationship between social power and individuals, and creates an event here now that allows the audience to experience. The artist agonized about the social role and function of the play amid the enthusiasm of the 6.10 Democratic Uprising, in which more than 1 million people participated every day in 33 cities. This is confirmed by the allegorical technique and symbolic structure in the work. Among them, "Falling asleep after eating utopia" (1987) and "Chilsan-ri (1988)" were performed during the period when the democratization movement against the new military regime and dictatorship was the strongest.

In this paper, we improve of Pgmpy library by adding Likelihood Weighting Sampling inference function for Bayesian network composed with probability variables depending on linear Gaussian conditional probability distribution. We verified result of improved library by comparing with result of Bayesian network written with Matlab. We compared hydrological drought index forecasting results obtained with data of MODIS meteorological satellite and MME climate prediction data of APEC Climate Center. Based on the comparison results, we can think that the calculation by Pgmpy library has no difference within allowable error ranges with the result from Matlab. Therefore, we can conclude the improvement proceeded well and expect improved library will be able to perform more various Bayesian network calculation than before.

AB  - It is widely known that water resources are facing several issues, as their limited availability has been affected by climate change, human over-exploitation and environmental pollution. The reduction of the availability of water resources along with the deterioration of water quality could have devastating consequences for human beings and natural environment. Therefore, ensuring the availability, quality and quantity of water resources is a key issue which has attracted the attention of researchers, governments and the public. The construction of dams constitutes a water storage solution in areas suffering from severe water shortage problems. Dams are artificial barriers, constructed across a river in order to hold back the rain water which falls during the wettest months, while a lake or reservoir is being formed behind them. In the current study, we map and monitor the existing water resources within the reservoir of a newly constructed dam during its gradual filling. In that context, we acquired Sentinel-1 radar data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data which are provided free of charge to all users through the Copernicus programme. Our data sets are covering a period of one and a half year, from the completion of the dam construction and the beginning of the reservoir's filling until today, wherein the water level is at the highest point. Sentinel-1 data were processed using random forest classifier and dividing the area into water and land sub-parts, while Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was calculated for Sentinel-2 data. The multi-dated water extents were integrated in an ArcGIS environment in order to evaluate them and investigate if a combined processing of radar and multispectral data of Copernicus programme could be the right choice towards a more accurate and detailed monitoring of water resources in a dam reservoir. Validation of the results has been performed using in situ measurements and observations.

By accepting and changing numerous stories and laws of stories, a worldview of characters, events, and backgrounds is established. Additionally, the MMORPG setting and enjoying the YouTube platform culture are reproduced in a unique way. In this study, this web novel is used to demonstrate a perspective on the customary nature of the web novel genre and reflection on the function and role of stories. This represents the intertextuality of stories and the typical characteristics of digital storytelling. It also indicates that how stories are enjoyed has changed from “reading and viewing” to “playing” as the enjoyment subjects interact based on the digital web. Additionally, the “Omniscient Reader” reproduces the future society in which the distinction between virtual and reality becomes difficult in the popular imagination. This demonstrates the function of a story that simulates a future society where artificial intelligence and VR technology are developed.

AB  - This paper intends to analyze the role expansion of characters, which was an important factor in setting the worldview in storytelling. With the development of media, the way of setting the worldview began to change. At the center of these changes are 'Transmedia' and 'Metaverse', which have recently been receiving attention. With the development of trans media, where the intersection and convergence of media is actively attempted, characters are breaking free from their innate limitations, crossing various media, and performing various activities in new stories. In addition, in the metaverse, an extended concept of the real world, avatars play a role in constructing and expanding the metaverse world as users and creators. By analyzing these changes, we would like to deal with the phenomenon in which character setting, which was used as an element in orthodox world view setting, replaces the world view.

AB  - This paper is a study on the character of Erlik in myths of South Siberia. Erlik is the lord of the dead and the supreme judge in the underground world. He is not only the Creator Ulgen's partner, but also his antagonist. In myths of South Siberia, there is mutualism like the relationship between Ulgen and Erlik. Ulgen and Erlik compete in the Creation and this leads to the evolution of the world. Erlik is a demiurge, the first living being, the primitive spirit. He has a “dark” image in contrast with the "bright" Ulgen. Erlik breathed a soul into people and takes charge of it after the death of a person. Erlik has a very interesting image. He crosses the line between good and evil. On the one hand, he has the status of a god, and on the other, he is an imperfect being. He is closely related to human life. The character of Erlik reflects the worldview of the people of South Siberia. It is presented in different versions from the historical and cultural backgrounds of each nation. It reflects the view of religion influenced of shamanism and buddhism. The character of Erlik includes the inherent mythological property of south Siberia. At the same time, it varies under the influence of new cultures, religions and worldviews.

AB  - This article examines the meaning of Turgenev-style 'romanticism' that blossomed in the era of Russian realism through Turgenev's Asya. Some of his lyrical works were denigrated for being outside the demands of the times and realistic aesthetics, but on the contrary, it can be said that it is these works that show well the meaning and sincerity of Turgenev's themes.Turgenev was a writer, who led to globalization of Russian literature. His view was not confined to the interior of Russia, he also illuminated the lives, specific worldview and consciousness of Russians living abroad. Describing those who stay in foreign land but whose souls still belong to Russia, he put the fateful yoke of the individual on the same line with Russian history. The immaturity, anxiety, mistakes, and regrets of the characters realistically show the reality of Russians who are on the border of two cultures.Along with the embodiment of German romanticism through Asya Turgenev presents in a unique narrative style the theme of those russians who have European vision but at the same time miss their motherland Russia. In this respect, we can confirm that this work is a masterpiece that precisely describe the thoughts and behaviors of contemporary Russians. By drawing various stories about the growth of the characters, Asya embodies ‘Russianness’ in the form of Asya, who is incomprehensible and immature but still is an object of eternal longing.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to seek to explore the semantic system contained in it by exploring the interrelationship between body and environment, by using gestures accompanying rituals Jangjwa-ri Dangjae as a study object. In order to do so, this study defines the concept of ‘Kineto-cartography’(the combined words between Kinetography and Cartography) as the cultural geographic embodied through human bodies. Hereby, It seeks to discover the ecological relationship between the body and its environment and recording methods of such findings.This study was conducted through literature research, field trip, and participatory observation. Through a numbers of field trips, a natural Rapport was formed with the residents of Wando Jangjwa-ri. After obtaining their prior consent, participatory observation was carried out during the preparation period. Processing and evaluation of data collected in the form of field journals, photographs, gesture transcription, transcripts and video recordings were all carried out in two stages.The first step was to analyze the structure of the entire process of the ritual through video protocol analysis, Laban motion recording method, Kinetography Laban, and qualitative data analysis method. In the second stage, the constituent factors of the Jangjwa-ri Dangjae in Wando were explored according to the conceptual ‘kineto-cartography’ formed as a result of the first step of the study.As a result of the first stage of the analysis, the observation of Jangjwa-ri Dangjae areas was categorized into large, medium, and small. The major categories are ground, gesture, body, and group. The ground(Teo) was divided into village, island(Jangdo) and road. The gesture was now classified into percussion music (Punmulchigi), perform ancestral rites, and sharing food (Eumbok). The body(mom) was divided into movement and posture. The last, group activity was divided into grouping in single or in double formation, in circular shape or in freestyle. The sub-elements of middle categories were divided into each sub-class derived from 55 detailed activities that constitute the Jangjwa-ri dangae.Secondly, through Kinetography Laban’s motion analysis, the first symbolic gesture was found to be ‘drumming’(Punmulchigi), which is another form of strong human will of life. The second gesture is to express worship and was found to be in the form of ‘bowing down’, ‘burning prayer papers and blowing them into the air’. The third gesture was ‘squat down and eat’ which means to describe a good rest after a long labor of ritual and the fourth symbolic gesture was ‘moving in group’ which means to describe symbiotic life.Through this multi-layered structural analysis of Jangjwa-ri Dangjae and the interpretation of symbolic gestures, it was able to explore the very components of kineto-cartography. First, in Jangjwa-ri Dangjae, the mutual relationship between the body and the environment was due to natural environmental factors that repeated in cycle. This suggests that the symbiotic worldview of the residents of Jangjwa-ri, who organized the ritual process according to the natural cycle (low tide and high tide), is being expressed through such rituals. Second, the cultural and social factors of the interrelationship between body and environment are related to the experiences of village residents due to the historical background of Dangjae and the transmission process of percussion rhythm traditional (Pungmul gut). It was shown that during Dangjae, the everyday living spaces of the villagers were transformed into cultural spaces where aesthetic experiences were being shared. Third, the relationship between body and environment is due to the physical factors of village residents who were preparing for the ritual. During the period of Dangjae, people kept their minds and bodies clean and physically prepared themselves for the event such as selecting chief priest(Jeju), practicing exorcism (Dang gut), cleaning the sanctuary, preparing sacrifices, and installing gold strings and so forth.Through this study, it comes to realize that the space of everyday life can be transformed into an ecological space where the body and the environment are closely working together. Based on the kineto-cartography via the examples of Jangjwa-ri Dangjae residents, it was possible to examine the cultural value and artistic potential of the ecological performance of the body. It is believed that this study can be used as a methodology for follow-up studies in the fields of dance, cultural anthropology, and behavioral psychology where gestures are objectively observed and analyzed.

AB  - This paper seeks to explore justice and Shalom’s education through research and argumentation concerning the public theology of Nicholas Wolterstorff and Miroslav Volf. Wolterstorff is a prominent scholar regarding the interdisciplinary research and practical study of theology and discipline in the Reformed tradition. He argues that Shalom’s vision is the main core of the kingdom of God and is actualized through justice. Christian discipline cultivates people who practice justice and serve the public good. In addition, Volf states that because God fully embraced humans through the cross, Christians must also fully embrace others, claiming it is the realization of justice in love and the pursuit of truth. The aim of this thesis is to study, analyze, and examine how justice and Shalom's education should be realized within Christian education based on the two scholars' viewpoints and arguments on public theology based on a biblical worldview.

AB  - In the new normal era, the topic of who is human has emerged significantly as an essential discourse. By understanding human beings, forming and shaping Christian disciples became an important topic. James K.A. Smith, the most influential and popular philosopher, education practitioner, and reformed theologian for the past decade, strongly argue humans as homo liturgicus are fundamentally animals shaped by worship practices. He mentions liturgies can be formative because it shapes what we desire and what we love through the concept of Habitus. Habitus is a sort of cognitive framework that our body acquires as it acquires social experiences through the narrative of our lives. In this sense, Christian worship is a kind of habitus that leads to our imaginations and orientations our desires, and love. The body, repeated practices, involves various narrative spaces that shape the imagination, which in turn forms our desire and orientation. Therefore, Christian education should be formative, not just a Christian worldview that focuses on the information. As a result, Smith suggests various liturgical practices as an alternative to the shape of Christian character based on the concept of habitus proposed by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. This paper sought to clarify, analyze, and even criticizes and evaluates Smith’s liturgical human being, as well as how his concept of Habitus can be applied and accepted into Christian education and theology, and in some respects the uniqueness of his philosophical theory and thought.

AB  - This paper analyzes the modernity of Lee Injik’s Kwiui song(1907) from an receptive aesthetic perspective. Compared to the concept modernity, which is composed at the theoretical and historical level, or modernity, which directed to the discourse of “civilization” and “enlightenment” of the time, the “modernity” in this paper focused on the sense of the world acquired by readers of the time. This paper attempted to revise the general conclusion that Kwiui song is non-modern or pre-modern narrative and to expand the interpretation horizon.This paper utilizes the hero-reader identification model established by Jauss to analyze the receptive aesthetics of main character Gilsoon and Jeomsoon. First, cathartic identification is established between the reader and Gilsoon. Readers with knowledge of traditional narratives can easily recognize Gilsoon as a good character from the beginning of the text. Therefore, the reader can expect that Gilsoon’s narrative will unfold along the familiar horizon, that is, various serious hardships, but eventually become happy in the end. However, the narrative, which follows the familiar structure, has an unexpected ending to Gilsoon’s tragic death. By this shocking ending, the reader can move beyond the emotional identification of Gilsoon to the aesthetic reflection stage, which recognizes the situation in which expectations are frustrated as a problem. At this stage, readers can recognize the collapse of the old moral, worldview, and social order that Gilsoon symbolized. Through the reading, the reader gains the experience of being kicked out of the solid world he knew and suddenly being forced to seek a new “middle and end.” This is a direct and personal sensory experience of fluid modernity.Meanwhile, an incomplete ironic identification between the reader and Jeomsoon is established. Jeomsoon is a typical villainous character whom readers with knowledge of traditional narratives can easily predict the development and ending. The intention to harm Gilsoon is expected to be frustrated and punished. However, the reader’s expectations are betrayed again when the narrative progresses as if she will be happy as soon as Gilsoon dies. Readers whose expectations are denied gain perspectives that can question the worldview that supported existing perceptions. Readers can find a modern desire to accumulate economic wealth and climb up a social ladder. By discovering the common desire which the reader and Jeomsoon can share, the reader’s interpretive repertories extends to the society in rapid transition he is in, and is guided to think about what “desirable middle and end” is in this time.Text kills the villain and accordingly protects familiar traditional aesthetics and the moral world behind it. However, during the reading, the reader faces several decisive forms that betray the original expectations related to them. The old world is clearly collapsing, but a new world to replace it is still vague. In this confusion, the reader can not only know that the significant change is going on, but feel that collapse of the old world is inevitable, and that traditional examples have become absolete. So they are driven to seek new forms of life suitable for the world coming on. From a receptive aesthetic point of view, the modernity of Kwiui song can be found in this overall response of the readers.

T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The genetic diversity of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV) circulating in the Campania Region in years 2015-2018 was investigated through the monitoring of sentinel bivalve shellfish and water matrices. Overall, 463 water samples (71 sewage samples, 353 coastal discharge waters, and 39 seawaters samples), and 746 bivalve shellfish samples were analyzed. Positivity for HAV was detected in 20/71 sewage samples, 14/353 coastal discharge waters, 5/39 seawaters, and 102/746 bivalve shellfish. Sixty-one of the positive samples were successfully sequenced and were characterized as genotype IA (n = 50) and IB (n = 11). The prevalent strain circulating in 2015 in both bivalves and waters was the IA strain responsible for the outbreak occurring around the same time in the Naples area. This variant was no longer identified in subsequent years (2017-2018) when, instead, appeared two of the IA variants of the multistate outbreak affecting men who have sex with men (MSM), VRD_521_2016, and RIVM-HAV16-090, with the former prevailing in both shellfish and water environments. HAV IB isolates were detected over the years in shellfish and in water matrices, but not in clinical samples, suggesting that this genotype had been circulating silently. An integrated surveillance system (environment/food/clinical cases) can be a useful tool to monitor changes in viral variants in the population, as well as an early warning system.

TI  - Sparse Pixel Training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Land Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become the core of modern machine learning approaches. In addition to its inspiring interior design idea, the success of CNN depends mainly on two factors, the first is the availability of training data and the second is the computing power of the used devices. In the field of remote sensing, data availability is difficult and expensive. Furthermore, processing large remote sensing data to accommodate different models is a laborious process. At the same time, training data is often collected in the form of points distributed over crop fields rather than regions, which results in the scarcity of training data. To specifically address the scarcity of training points, in this paper we present a sparse pixel-based training of U-Net convolutional neural networks for land cover classification. Training images are reconstructed from the points' collection in a random manner, they are used as an input for the convolution networks. Based on this proposed method, the amount of training data is reproduced from the different spectral signals for each land cover. We conducted extensive experiments on eight classes, using ground truth data collected from several locations in Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. The obtained results showed the superiority of the proposed method over other methods.

AB  - Urban sprawl heavily affects coastal areas worldwide, posing threats to the environment and resulting in unsustainable urban growth patterns. This is particularly true in the Mediterranean Region, where coastal and especially insular territories constitute distinct cases of fragile ecosystems, affected by long-lasting mass tourism development trends. This research proposes a methodology for monitoring urban sprawl in coastal areas. High-resolution data for built-up areas are used in this respect, provided by the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). Spatial data are processed using GIS technology; and FRAGSTATS software is used to calculate spatial metrics that quantify density, clustering, geometrical complexity and dispersion of the built environment. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study in Crete, a remarkable example of Mediterranean island community, heavily affected by mass tourism development. Urban growth trends in the period 1975-2014 are explored in this respect; and urban sprawl patterns are analyzed at a disaggregated level along the northern coastal zone, using recent GHSL data based on Sentinel-2 images (period 2017-2018). Using a combination of principal component analysis and cluster analysis, different typologies are identified and zones mostly affected by urban sprawl are highlighted.

TI  - Methane Emission by Petroleum Industry in Western Siberia according to Satellite Observations
T2  - 27TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS, ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics
CL  - Moscow, RUSSIA
AB  - We present a technology and results of estimation of methane emission by oil industry enterprises in Western Siberia in 2019. The experimental basis of the work is the results of satellite observations. It is established that methane emission from combustion of associated petroleum gas in flare units in Western Siberia is about 0.3 Tg. This result is based on the previously obtained information on the characteristics of flare units according to VIIRS/Suomi-NPP data. This information also allowed us to determine the locations of the petroleum industry sites in Western Siberia. TROPOMI Sentinel-5 Precurcor and NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (R-2) data were used to estimate methane emission by the oil industry enterprises in Western Siberia, which can reach 3.1 Tg.

TI  - Research progress on remote sensing monitoring of phytoplankton in eutrophic water
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid economic development of lake basins, the frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms has become more and more serious, and the eutrophication of water bodies has become a major environmental problem at home and abroad. Phytoplankton is the primary producer of water bodies and is one of the main indicators to measure the degree of eutrophication of water bodies. Remote sensing technology is an important means to detect the temporal and spatial distribution of phytoplankton in water bodies. Based on the collection and sorting of nearly a thousand research papers on phytoplankton remote sensing in water bodies at home and abroad, from the perspectives of satellite data sources, research content and research methods, the historical progress, research focus and development trends of remote sensing technology in the application of phytoplankton monitoring in eutrophic lakes are summarized. Studies have shown that the existing remote sensing research on phytoplankton in eutrophic water bodies takes the problem of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes as the starting point, and the research perspective is shifted from the surface of the water body (algae bloom area and pigment concentration) to three-dimensional underwater (total algae biomass); The method has shifted from qualitative identification to quantitative inversion; the research content has advanced from monitoring cyanobacteria blooms to detecting different types of cyanobacteria, and gradually formed an application-oriented, "MODIS/VIIRS daily monitoring of large and medium lakes-GF/Sentinel2 targeted monitoring of small lakes" -UAV emergency monitoring" phytoplankton remote sensing integrated monitoring system. The above research combed the development trend of the phytoplankton remote sensing monitoring lake water environment subject of eutrophic water bodies and provided important technical support and theoretical references for personnel engaged in the monitoring and early warning of cyanobacteria bloom ecological disasters.

TI  - Ocean dynamics characterization from a multiplatform observing-system approach in the East Central North Atlantic
T2  - OCEANS 2021: SAN DIEGO - PORTO
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In recent years, the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute (IH) has been collaborating with PLOCAN to establish sustained glider observations across the Northeastern Atlantic. Here, we analyze the data collected by an autonomous underwater glider in two deployments (2019 and 2020) of the observation line between Portugal and the Canary Islands. The water column data collected by the glider is combined with data from multiple sources, namely satellite altimetry and Argo floats, to explore the synergistic use of satellite and in-situ data from multiple platforms. This approach intends to produce a comprehensive picture of the marine environment in depth and at different scales.The study domain covers part of the East Central North Atlantic, namely in the region between Continental Portugal, Madeira Island and the Canary Islands. The region is strongly influenced by the presence of the Mediterranean Water (MW), a warm and salty intermediate water mass, and submesoscale subsurface vortices, known as meddies, are usually present. Several studies have reported that meddies are often accompanied by an anticyclonic circulation at the sea surface, which can be detected using satellite data, in particular, with altimetry and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The identification of a meddy in the Tagus Abyssal Plain (TAP) from glider data collected during missions "Lisboa 2019" (L2019) and "Lisboa 2020" (L2020), and the possibility to detect it from satellite data motivated this study, providing favorable conditions to explore the combination of data from multiple sources. This study shows an example of how to exploit the advantages of combining data from different platforms in sustainable observational programs, maximizing the capacities by each individual technology-component to characterize ocean dynamical features at different spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Social Culture of Tuvans and Online Space
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the issue of how modern technologies have become, among other things, a sort of vehicles of archaization for Tuvans, i.e. of the process of returning to archaic social and cultural ties and meanings. The source of the data is the author's survey of Tuvans who use social networks and messaging apps. The survey was conducted in early 2021 by random sampling, covering 205 people who answered the questionnaire published on Google Forms.Today Russian cyberethnography is more focused on studying the presentation of ethnicity on the Internet. The author suggests going further and considering the network as a new space for the functioning of an ethnic group's social culture in the case of Tuvans. The analysis is based on the ideas of the anthropologists Ch. Hine and H. Rheingold. This allows us to talk about a network sociality as a fact of social reality.The development of wireless Internet in Tuva has led to the same results as all over the globe - people have learned to act together in conditions that previously did not permit this. A significant number of Tuvans use chat groups (of relatives, colleagues, friends) in messaging apps, especially on Viber. Communication via them has various social "consequences". Most often, Viber is used to communicate with friends and relatives (90.2%). The groups of relatives number from 13 to 70 people, communication in them is flowing almost constantly, typically in the Tuvan language; participants exchange information, news, and arrange collective actions. The use of web communications as a tool for unity and coordination of actions allows Tuvans to vote in online contests of various kinds as effectively as possible.A historical insight allows us to see that the space of the social culture of Tuvans has undergone changes throughout history, and the social culture has preserved its basic values - the significance of social ties among kin groups.

TI  - OSGeo/grass: GRASS GIS 8.0.0RC1
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Overview of changes After more than 3 year of development the first stable release GRASS GIS 8.0.0 is available. Efforts have concentrated on making the user experience even better, providing many new useful additional functionalities to modules and further improving the graphical user interface. Breaking news: new graphical user interface with entirely rewritten startup sequence! This re-establishes user experience compatibility with QGIS and other connected software packages. The GRASS GIS 8.0.0 release provides more than 1,300 fixes and improvements with respect to the release 7.8.6. With the introduction of the semantic label raster metadata class, the temporal database was modified to version 3. Hence, to be able to read and process GRASS 7.x space-time datasets, users will be prompted to run t.upgrade. If users want to read newly created space-time datasets back in GRASS 7.x, they can run t.downgrade.

TI  - Towards Operational Flood Monitoring in Flanders Using Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As floods pose an increasing threat to our society, insights into their occurrence and dynamics are of major importance for emergency relief, damage assessment, the optimization of predictive models, and spatial planning. Due to their capability of providing synoptic observations independent of cloud cover and daylight, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors are an invaluable tool for flood mapping and monitoring. In this study, the potential of SAR, and more specifically Sentinel-1, for automated flood monitoring in Flanders is assessed. Its capability to detect floods with varying characteristics is investigated, and an approach for automated monitoring is presented. This approach, combining thresholding and region growing, requires a SAR image pair and several ancillary data layers, including elevation, land cover, and flood risk, as input. The resulting map discriminates permanent water, open flooding, long-term flooding, possible flooding, flooded vegetation, and possibly flooded forests from dry land. Invisible forested areas are indicated as well. A quantitative and qualitative accuracy assessment, based on 17 and 138 flood maps, respectively, highlights the approach's robustness and improved accuracy compared to benchmark techniques. Furthermore, main sources of confusion are identified and suggestions for future improvements are listed.

M3  - Article
AB  - The large iron ore reserves of Brazil are already known, but there are still few studies regarding mineral prospection in smaller deposits and/or areas with lower contents. Exploration techniques that cover large areas at low costs, such as remote sensing, are important for setting targets for mineral exploration. This paper proposes to use of Sentinel-2 images and reflectance spectroscopy to evaluate the use of these techniques for iron prospecting, using two deposits in the state of Bahia, Brazil, as case studies. To validate image processing results, samples were collected in these areas for analysis of optical petrography, x-ray fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy. Images were processed at a spatial resolution of 20 and 60 m with Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering and Spectral Angle Mapper. Corresponding spectral types were determined based on the analyses of mineralogy variation and composition of the spectral mixture. It was also possible to establish a correlation of spectral types with iron content. The results achieved showed that Sentinel-2 data can be used for spectral mapping of different lithotypes composed of iron oxides, with Reflectance Spectroscopy as an important tool for mapping, and that the use of images in spatial resolution 20 m are sufficient to discriminate different types of ore. Image processing has shown that Sentinel-2 sensor data can support iron ore mineral research and the discovery of new mineralized areas.

AB  - With the rapid development of economy and society, transportation plays a pivotal role in the operation of cities. This article is mainly based on Ziyuan County as the research object, sorting out the current situation of the region, including the background situation of nature and traffic, and then proposes the two aspects of the freight and urban transportation system. Through the planning of the city's transportation, the surrounding area Cities and urban groups are closely linked together, shortening the space-time distance between each other, and their traffic capacity and service quality, in order to change the current urban structure and land use patterns of the region. Finally, suggestions are made from the aspects of traffic organization and safety, traffic facility management, vehicle management, passenger and cargo operation management, parking fee management, traffic management system and legal system. The results of the study show that it can be carried out rationally from the level of traffic management, operation and system under the guidance of traffic strategy, and the strong support and assistance of intelligent traffic can greatly improve the current situation of regional traffic and improve the level of traffic development.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - One of the challenges when building Machine Learning (ML) models using satellite imagery is building sufficiently labeled data sets for training. In the past, this problem has been addressed by adapting computer vision approaches to GIS data with significant recent contributions to the field. But when trying to adapt these models to Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery these approaches fall short. Previously, researchers used transfer learning methods trained on ImageNet and constrained the 13 channels to 3 RGB ones using existing training sets, but this severely limits the available data that can be used for complex image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks. To address this deficit, we present Distil, and demonstrate a specific method using our system for training models with all available Sentinel-2 channels. There currently is no publicly available rich labeled training data resource such as ImageNet for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery that covers the entire globe. Our approach using the Distil system was: a) pre-training models using unlabeled data sets and b) adapting to specific downstream tasks using a small number of annotations solicited from a user. We discuss the Distil system, an application of the system in the remote sensing domain, and a case study identifying likely locust breeding grounds in Africa from unlabeled 13-channel satellite imagery.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used satellite data (optical and radar) to evaluate mangrove rehabilitation in an area that has been completely destroyed by the use of herbicides and other chemical agents by the U.S military in the Can Gio Biosphere Reserve in Mekong Delta, Southern Vietnam. We used the Landsat satellite imagery series to analyse the land cover change, and the results showed that the coverage of the mangroves in this study area has gradually increased over the years: 9.54% in 1972, 34.46% in 1988, 46.34% in 1995, 51.76% in 2000, 54.27% in 2005, 56.93% in 2010, 59.91% in 2015 and 63.70% in 2020. The overall accuracy is 92.76%, and the average accuracy is 85.47%. We used a combination of images taken from ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Landsat satellites to build models that detect the structural parameters of mangrove forests. These models can explain mangrove structural parameters such as the basal area of 91% (R-2 = 0.91), the height of 60% (R-2 = 0.60), the density of 52% (R-2 = 0.52) and the biomass of 91% (R-2 = 0.91). This study aims to provide results to study area for better management, monitoring, conservation as well as sustainable development of mangrove forests.

TI  - Aggression and Belief in a just World Among Adolescents from Belarus and Ukraine: A Comparative Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In connection with the spread of a culture of violence in modern society the problem of aggressive behavior of adolescents takes on new impetus. For a comprehensive consideration of this problem, one should take into account not only the intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects of the personality relations system, but also its relations with the world, which can be expressed in the two forms of the belief in a just world - general belief in a just world and personal belief in a just world. 70 Belarusian and 109 Ukrainian adolescents completed two questionnaires: the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the Just World Scale by C. Dalbert. It was found that Belarusian adolescents are characterized by lower aggression compared to Ukrainian ones. The relationship between aggression and the two forms of belief in a just world (general and personal belief in a just world) is negative among Belarusians and Ukrainian adolescents. Belarusian and Ukrainian adolescents on average believe that the world is "rather fair". This indicates a similar view of the world among adolescents in both cultures.

T2  - Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Despite the changing paradigms of melanoma treatment in recent years, there remains a relative paucity of data regarding subungual melanoma in the literature. From 2002-2018, 25 patients with subungual melanoma were surgically treated at our facility. A retrospective chart review was conducted to collect relevant demographic, clinical, pathologic, and outcomes data. The median age at diagnosis was 69 years. Most patients (60%) were male, and the melanoma lesion was most often located on the foot (68%). Acral-lentiginous was the most common histologic subtype (59%), and the median Breslow thickness was 3.4 mm. Fifteen patients (63%) underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy as part of their surgical resection, and four of these patients (27%) had metastatic disease in the lymph nodes. In total, 10 patients underwent lymph node dissection of the involved basin. The median follow up was 21 months in this patient population. Age, gender, tumor location, ulceration, and lesion histology were not significantly associated with recurrence free survival (RFS). Increasing Breslow thickness was found to be significantly associated with shorter RFS (HR: 1.07, CI: 1.03-1.55). In total, 13 patients developed a disease recurrence, and RFS rates were 66% at 1 year and 40% at 3 years. Additionally, 91 and 37% of patients were alive at one year and three years, respectively. Subungual melanomas are rare lesions that often have a more advanced stage at diagnosis, which contributes to the poor prognosis of these cutaneous malignancies.

TI  - Monitoring vineyard water status using Sentinel-2 images: qualitative survey on five wine estates in the south of France
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The wine industry must face many challenges because of climate change. One of them is the increase in temperatures and droughts events. These changes sometimes lead to yield losses and can also impact the quality of the wine produced (e.g., increased alcohol content). The management of available water is also a sensitive issue as water requirements for vineyard irrigation are quickly increasing in the south of France. In this context, there is a need for a decision tool that can help evaluate the vine water status through the entire growth season at a large scale. To address this issue, we have previously developed a model (see Laroche-Pinel et al. 2021a) which predicts the vine Stem Water Potential ('Pstem) using Sentinel-2 (S2) images. This model was developed based on a field campaign over three years. The present study now aims to investigate the feedback of winegrowers on the outputs of our model. Therefore, it was applied on the plots of five wine estates that do not belong to the set used in the initial paper. The qualitative results show interesting spatial and temporal consistency in accordance with winegrower knowledge, irrigation data, and weather forecast. The predicted 'Pstem highlights spatial variability in vine fields where a water source emerges and reflects the differences between vine fields with a drip or sparkling irrigation or without an irrigation system. The predicted 'Pstem also clearly reacts to a peak in temperature. According to their feedback, three of the five winegrowers would be glad to use this service in the years to come.

TI  - Is it relevant to account for grapevine phenology in time series of satellite images?
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - In precision agriculture, most spatio-temporal analyses involve the analysis of time series of remotely-sensed images whose dates are expressed according to the Gregorian calendar. However, in the agronomic literature, it is commonly accepted that calendars based on a thermal index allow a better representation of the actual state of development of the plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that potential new information at the block scale can be revealed by adjusting a NDVI time series extracted from Sentinel 2 images using a site-specific thermal index. This is achieved by removing part of the inter-annual differences in the time-series that is due to variations in phenology by using a temperature-based time adjustment. To do so, the paper is based on an operational case study in viticulture exploring whether a link between NDVI profiles and the consistency over years of harvest quality parameters could be hypothesised at the block scale.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose a new way of understanding data contemplation for Indigenous methodologies. There is a need for Indigenous methods that allow us to explore and organize findings that are steeped in the contextualized story and grounded in the research relationship. A study that asked Cree Kehte-ayak (Old Ones) about the relevance in harmonizing Indigenous and Western ways of knowing in healing from addiction shows that Reflexive Reflection (RR) offers a respectful way for discovery. RR offers epistemological underpinnings for data consideration when engaging Indigenous methodologies. Culturally rooted addictions research can contribute to Indigenous wellness and cultural renewal by bringing awareness to the link between colonialism and addiction and by actively re-centring an Indigenous worldview and governance in the research process (Hall et al., 2015). While challenging colonialism is vital, the strength of Indigenous culture must be central to the overall project, with relational accountability that implies all parts of the research process are related, and that the researcher is responsible for nurturing and maintaining this relationship with the research process and with "all relations." Indigenous research inquiry involves moments of contemplation that explore dreams, intuition, teachings, and connection to land. It also involves spending intimate hours listening to stories of the "old ones" that are rooted in a sense of kinship responsibility that relay culture, identity, and a sense of belonging that are essential to the life of the researcher. Reframing the language around aftercare services for Indigenous Peoples can take place through reflexive investigation and knowledge creation.

AB  - The radiometric calibration assessment assessed the spectral response changes over time for the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS)/Proba-1 mission. As Barrax was the test site for the 2003/2004 SPARC campaign and has been acquired since, it was chosen.The results presented have shown a comparison of in-situ spectra measured during the ESA SPARC, SEN2FLEX and SEN3EXP campaigns with CHRIS/Proba-1 imagery acquired between 2003 and 2019 at the Barrax site in Spain. The CHRIS imagery were processed using the CHRIS-Box, and results indicate that the measurements in the first band in Mode 1 are significantly underestimated and in the Near-InfraRed (NIR) are slightly overestimated. The low value at the blue end is expected from the previously calculated CHRIS calibration coefficients, while previous results suggested the near-infrared was also underestimated.Further analysis will focus on using the atmospheric campaign data to see if the potential errors and uncertainties in the CHRIS atmospheric correction can be reduced. Also, the campaign airborne and satellite data can be compared to the CHRIS and in-situ spectra.

TI  - First Nations' hospital readmission ending in death: a potential sentinel indicator of inequity?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we focused on readmissions for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) ending in death, to capture those admissions and readmissions that might have been prevented if responsive primary healthcare was accessible. We propose this as a sentinel indicator of equity. We conducted analyses of Manitoba-based 30-day hospital readmission rates for ACSC which resulted in death, using data from 1986-2016 adjusted for age, sex, and socio-economic status. Our findings show that, across Manitoba, overall rates of readmissions ending in death are slowly increasing, and increasing more dramatically among northern First Nations, larger First Nations not affiliated with Tribal Councils, and in the western region of the province. These regions have continuously been highlighted as disadvantaged in terms of access to care, suggesting that the time for action is overdue. Rising rates of readmissions for ACSC ending in death suggest that greater attention should be placed on access to responsive primary healthcare. These findings have broader implications for territorial healthcare systems which purchase acute care services from provinces south of them. As an indicator of quality, monitoring readmissions ending in death could provide territorial governments insights into the quality of care provided to their constituents by provincial authorities.

AB  - The performance of various standard algorithms for the retrieval of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI satellite data obtained in 2019 and 2021 is discussed. The study was conducted for the estuaries of 2 mountainous rivers originating in the Caucasus Mountains: the Sulak River flowing to the Caspian Sea and the Mzymta River flowing to the Black Sea. The rivers differ in the degree of flow control and the composition of terrigenous suspended matter carried to the sea. The main objective of the study was to compare SPM retrieval results of the C2RCC (Case 2 Regional Coast Color) processor and the ACOLITE (Atmospheric.orrection for OLI 'lite') algorithms Nechad 2009, Nechad 2015 and Dogliotti.The satellite data were verified against in situ measurements of turbidity and SPM performed synchronously with the satellite survey. Field measurements from a small boat were performed in April and May 2019, 2021 in the northeast Black Sea, in the mouth area of the Mzymta, and in May 2021 in the Sulak mouth area. The measuring instruments and methods included a turbidity sensor mounted on a CTD (conductivity / temperature / depth) probe, a portable turbidimeter, and water sampling for further laboratory analysis. It was established that for low SPM, 20-30 g/m(3), performances of C2RCC and Nechad 2015 practically coincided and correlated well with the in situ data. For large SPM, over 300 g/m(3), the best performance was demonstrated by Dogliotti, an algorithm designed especially for extreme SPM values.

TI  - Proximate Aspects of Starvation-Related Morbidity and Mortality Among Young California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus).
T2  - Journal of Veterinary Anatomy
M3  - Article
AB  - Dramatic fluctuations of west coast (USA) California sea lion (CSL) population sizes are well-known historical events. More recently, the episodes have involved extensive losses from pup starvation. However, beyond dams' lactation failure that results from loss of preferred prey, proximate causes of malnutrition-related death among youngest CSL remain somewhat speculative. We hypothesized that age-related differences in presentation status and postmortem pathology would clarify elements of death trajectories. Records of 494 California sea lions included young pups to late adolescents, all present in the same environment and ecology. We identified differential starvation-related impacts among young CSL populations. Rapid and extreme loss of muscle and fat body mass, and resulting emaciation, were the primary overall features of morbidity. More specifically, the death trajectory among young pups was associated more proximately with contributing fluid deficit, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, and loss of respiratory capacity. The death trajectory among non-pups was associated more proximately with negative effects of forced diet change that resulted in severe-to-overwhelming chronic parasitism. The vast majority of death trajectories appeared to be non-reversible, either in short term or over longer term. The sentinel status of marine mammals such as CSL forewarns of potential threats to local or regional ecology. It is especially concerning if recurring similar events appear to differ causally from historical patterns. We suggest that starvation events occurring in seemingly new patterns can signal new influences on a marine ecology.

AB  - We present outcomes from our experimental work towards identification of forest segments in Czech Jeseniky mountains damaged by a hurricane event on March 17, 2018. We have specifically processed Sentinel-1 satellite radar data and identified a functional methodology of extracting extents of the affected segments. The backscatter intensity of the damaged forest segments in Sentinel-1 images does not change significantly, subject to the sensitivity of the instrument. We have identified that a careful preprocessing of the data can lead to a state of possibility to identify edges of the affected areas in one of Principal Components (PC) generated from a set of dual-polarisation images before and after the event. In our case, these features were clearly visible in PC3 that was used in post-processing chain incorporating strong spatial filtering and edge detection routines. The identified damaged forest segments were validated by mapping during visiting one of the areas and by a comparison with multispectral satellite imagery, from data taken following year (as the damaged forest areas were already cleared and not regenerated). The approach can bring advantage in possibility of early preliminary mapping of the forest damages. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coral reefs and seagrass are critical coastal resources due to their role in the ecosystem benefits for the coastal environment in terms of biodiversity, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism. It is therefore important to preserve and protect these species. Coral and seagrass percent cover mapping is a simple approach to assess coral and seagrass condition. The application of remote sensing of coral and seagrass percent cover mapping is very challenging with respect to performance and accuracy. This research aims to utilize remote sensing data for coral and seagrass percent cover mapping. Linear and machine learning regressions (RF and SVM) were used to develop a coral and seagrass percent cover model from a Sentinel-2 MSI images. The Sentinel-2 MSI images were transformed into deglint, water column (DII), principal component, and mean texture analysis as input bands for the model. The results showed that coral percent cover mapping accuracy is relatively low (RMSE = +/- 17%) due to various problems, limitations, and an inaccurate model, whereas the results of the seagrass percent cover map had higher accuracy, with RMSE +/- 11%. The results obtained indicate that the seagrass percent cover map is suitable for use as basic information to support coastal management. However, the coral percent cover map is not an optimal information source due to its low accuracy.

AB  - Currently, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, this proportion is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. In the next 30 years, a large amount of the world's population is predictably concentrated in urban areas in the developing world. Ha Noi is the capital and largest city of Viet Nam which has the average growth rate of approximately 3% per year. Urban development management has become an important issue in Viet Nam since the negative impacts of the urban sprawl on the environmental sustainability, life quality has been increasing as well. Hence, urban planning and management would be pivotal for creating the effective framework conditions for a sustainable development. The objective of our study is to explore the urban growth of Ha Noi using the Landsat images from 1975 to 2020 compared to the city planning. The volatility analysis information from classified urban land maps is considered supportive for urban management and planning oriented work. In addition, the remote sensing data analysis is a useful tool to support planners, managers for urban management and decision. This study results showed the urban land area in study site city has been growing about 3 times and the largest rate (4-6 times) for the Dong Anh, Tu Liem, Gia Lam and smallest rate (10-25%) for Ba Dinh and Hai Ba Trung districts.

AB  - Urban expansion, particularly converting sub-urban areas to residential and commercial land use in metropolitan areas, has been considered as a significant signal of regional economic development. However, this results in urban climate change. One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of UHI (Urban Heat Island). Understanding the effects of urban land cover change on UHI is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. This research reports an application of remote sensing data, GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for assessing effects of urban land cover change on the LST (Land Surface Temperature) and heat budget components in Ho Chi Minh City, where is one of the fastest urbanizing region of Vietnam. The change of urban land cover component and LST in the city was derived by using multi-temporal Landsat data for the period of 1998 - 2020. The analysis showed that, from 1998 to 2020 the city had been drastically urbanized into multiple directions, with the urban areas increasing from approximately 125.281 km2 in 1998 to 162.6 km2 in 2007, and 267.2 km2 in 2020, respectively. The results of retrieved LST revealed the radiant temperature for 1998 ranging from 20.2ºC to 31.2ºC, while that for 2020 remarkably higher ranging from 22.1ºC to 42.3ºC. The results also revealed that given the same percentage of urban land cover components, vegetation area is more effective to reduce the value of LST, meanwhile the impervious surface is the most effective factor to increase the value of the LST.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study contributes to a proof-of-concept comprehensive drought risk assessment for Vietnam by (i) incorporating drought exposure and vulnerability based on specific socio-economic conditions of the regions; and (ii) using satellite data including World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Space-based Weather and Climate Extremes Monitoring (SWCEM) products, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Enhanced U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Global Data for drought hazard assessment. Drought risk assessment which incorporated hazard, exposure and vulnerability components was conducted for 27 provinces from four administrative areas in Vietnam. Drought Hazard Index (DHI) was derived using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), and surface soil moisture (SSM) to take into account the impact of both meteorological and agricultural drought. Drought Exposure Index (DEI) and Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) were calculated using statistical data of land use and socio-economic characteristics obtained from Vietnam's statistical yearbooks. By combining DHI, DEI and DVI, a composite Drought Risk Index (DRI) was derived for drought risk assessment in the selected provinces for 2020. It was shown that the highest at-risk provinces were in the Mekong River Delta, the agricultural production centre of Vietnam. The South East regions were less impacted by drought compared to other regions. The proposed comprehensive approach to drought risk assessment in Vietnam has potential to contribute to improving drought preparedness and resilience of communities at-risk.

AB  - GIS and Remote Sensing technology had been widely applied in Viet Nam. However, research orientation and development of Web GIS and Remote Sensing solutions for regional management approach also indicates many difficulties and challenges. This paper aims to introduce Web GIS and Remote sensing solutions that can be used in monitoring salinity intrusion and land cover mapping to support the implementation of sustainable development strategy of the Mekong Delta region. The experimental results show the online mapping applications based on Landsat images open a new way that can be effectively applied in monitoring salinity intrusion in river network, updating the status of land cover changes and analysing the trend of forest-cover changes in this region. Results of this study also illustrate the suitable technology available to support regional organizations to create thematic maps in monitoring and managing the natural resources and environment of provinces/cities that can achieve high accuracy and save time.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives We explore the importance of SARS-CoV-2 sentinel surveillance testing in primary care during a regional COVID-19 outbreak in Austria. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting A single sentinel practice serving 22 829 people in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein. Participants All 73 patients presenting with mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. Intervention Nasopharyngeal sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Outcome measures We compared RT-qPCR at presentation with confirmed antibody status. We split the outbreak in two parts, by halving the period from the first to the last case, to characterise three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: early acute (RT-qPCR reactive) in the first half; and late acute (reactive) and late convalescent (non-reactive) in the second half. For each cohort, we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-qPCR, the duration and variety of symptoms, and the number of viral clades present. Results Twenty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (eight early acute, seven late acute and seven late convalescent), 44 patients tested SARS-CoV-2 negative and 7 were excluded. The sensitivity of RT-qPCR was 100% among all acute cases, dropping to 68.1% when including convalescent. Test specificity was 100%. Mean duration of symptoms for each group were 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute, 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent. Confirmed infection was associated with loss of taste. Acute infection was associated with loss of taste, nausea/vomiting, breathlessness, sore throat and myalgia; but not anosmia, fever or cough. Transmission clusters of three viral clades (G, GR and L) were identified. Conclusions RT-qPCR testing in primary care can rapidly and accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 among people with flu-like illness in a heterogeneous viral outbreak. Targeted testing in primary care can support national sentinel surveillance of COVID-19.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate experiences of novice teachers in Christian alternative schools who are reconstructing the curriculum in the biblical worldview. For this purpose, an in-depth interview was conducted and multiple sources were collected including various documents. The results of the interview analysis are as follows; novice teachers in Christian alternative schools experience several difficulties and growth on biblical curriculum reconstructions. The difficulties could be classified into 4 categories; the lack of understanding about the national curriculum and of experiencing the curriculum reconstructions before coming to the teaching fields, the confusion about the concept of the biblical curriculum reconstruction, the difficulty on how to integrate the biblical worldview when they setting up learning objectives, selecting curriculum contents and organizing learning activities, and the lack of time and environment for developing the curriculum. The growth they experienced could be classified into 2 parts; the professional growth as a Christian teacher, and the growth of personal faith and attitude toward their own life as a Christian.

AB  - Taking note of images of and methodology concerning “tradition” in Kim Soo-young’s (金洙暎; 1921-68) poetry, this paper seeks to determine their significance in terms of cultural history. In particular, placed in the center of analysis are poems such as “A Day of Pride” (｢矜持의 날｣), “Wine and a Young Cat” (｢술과 어린 고양이｣), and “From a Far-off Place” (｢먼 곳에서부터｣), which either invoke hexagram statements (guaci; 卦辭) or line statements (yaoci; 爻辭) in The  I Ching: Book of Changes(Yijing;   周易  ) or establish as their themes circulation (xunhuan; 循環), complementarity (duidai; 對待), moderation (zhongyong; 中庸), and correspondence (ganying; 感應), which are worldviews and principles of praxis in the Chinese classic. In this process, the paper strives to present anew the indispensability of reviewing in Kim’s poems, even in cases where the reception and influence of Western modernism manifest themselves clearly, the context of reappropriation through the traditional thinking and discourse harboring in the background. Moreover, while an understanding of the discourse and knowledge of Western modernism, which Kim had no choice but to accept and pursue, is, of course, indispensable in order to understand both the figure and his texts faithfully, this paper endeavors to emphasize the direction and prospects of future research that, at the same time, the context in which the discourse and knowledge of modernism were embraced and modified from the perspective of postcolonial reappropriation through the principle of circulation or the worldview of correspondence in East Asian classics including The  I Ching: Book of Changes, which the writer embodied from his childhood,  must be taken into consideration.

AB  - This article is a pastoral theological reflection on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has already begun to transform our lives. As a pastoral theologian, I investigate opportunities and challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the field of pastoral care and counseling. After briefly explaining the main aspects of the Fourth Industrial Revolutionits characteristics, principles, core influences and tasksthis paper provides important theological reflections for contemporary pastoral theologians and practitioners. In a constructive way, the Fourth Industrial Revolution may promote the quality of life, social welfare, and health; serve the common good; and create synergistic effects through cooperation. Pastoral theologically, however, it can also be a great danger for the individual and broader society because of its humanistic worldview and perspective, its risk of providing false pseudo-relationality through hi-tech hyperconnectivity, and the atheistic value system embedded in this radical Revolution. This paper suggests several practical guidelines for pastoral caregivers and counselors in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: the renewed importance of individual caregiving; the development of genuine community; and the significance of spiritual intervention and guidance.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article examines how Yu Deuk-gong reveals the perception regarding the old territory of Goguryeo among 18th century Joseon intellectuals, as well as the broader process of breaking away from a Chinese-centered worldview. Yu Deuk-gong, who spent his twenties absorbed in literature and poetry with his baektap colleagues, turned his attention to history in 1778 with the book 《二十一都懷古詩》, which was sent to Qing dynasty scholars in Beijing. Along with his later works, Balhaego and Sagunji, Yu Deuk-gong made 《二十一都懷古詩》 was written to sympathize with the sorrows of Han Chinese intellectuals under Manchurian rule, rather than embodying national historical consciousness or the will of the northern territories. In the same year, while traveling to Shenyang and writing a poem in Liaodong, Yu Deuk-gong showed no awareness of Goguryeo’s native lands. 《二十一都懷古詩》 was not simply a retrospective poem but also a historical book, which led to criticism for reducing Joseon’s historical areas to the south of the Yalu and Tuman rivers, except for northern historical lands such as Buyeo and Okjeo.To overcome such criticism, Yu Deuk-gong devoted himself to exploring northern territory history and wrote Balhaego, revealing a sense of restoration regarding ancient Goguryeo land. He also expanded his interest to the historical culture of the Northeast Asian Empire peoples, such as Mongolia and Yeojin. In 1790, Yu Deuk-gong, who left for the second time in 12 years to visit Beijing and Yeolha, gave a favorable evaluation of Manchuria’s character and government in his travel journals. He represented both sides in an objective manner by also discussing a Han Chinese intellectual who complained and was arrogant. The culmination of his travel records can be considered <鳳城>, which presents not only the orthodoxy of Goguryeo but also a systematic theory of the Northeast Asian people linking the Goguryeo, Balhae, Yeojin, and Manchu tribes into one genealogy. However, this theory, which can be referred to as the Northeast Asian Political Situation Theory, was deleted from his travel records in the process of re-editing five years later. In contrast to the strength of Goguryeo, Silla was degraded as a barbaric culture stained with Wakoku culture, furthermore, Goguryeo and Balhae were grouped into the genealogy with Manchuria and Yeojin because they were intimately related, which provoked opposition from Joseon’s intellectual class at the time.However, Yu Deuk-gong’s Northeast Asian Political Situation Theory is linked to Kim Chang-up and Lee Ki-ji’s comparative theory of inter-Korean culture, which posits that the collapse of the Ming Dynasty is attributable to both the national strength of the northern peoples and the cultural weakness of the Han Chinese in the south. His theory is also in the same context as Hong Dae-yong’s suspicion of the reverence of Chinese literature, discussed in his work Uisan Question and Answer, which demonstrates a sort of “de-Chineseization” as an escape from Chinese centralism.

T2  - Korean Journal of Agricultural Science
M3  - research-article
AB  - In this study, the future flood inundation changes under a climate change were simulated in the Tonle Sap basin in Cambodia, one of the countries with high vulnerability to climate change. For the flood inundation simulation using the rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model, globally available geological data (digital elevation model [DEM]; hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle elevation derivatives [HydroSHED]; land cover: Global land cover facility-moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer [GLCF-MODIS]), rainfall data (Asian precipitation-highly-resolved observational data integration towards evaluation [APHRODITE]), climate change scenario (HadGEM3-RA), and observational water level (Kratie, Koh Khel, Neak Luong st.) were constructed. The future runoff from the Kratie station, the upper boundary condition of the RRI model, was constructed to be predicted using the long shortterm memory (LSTM) model. Based on the results predicted by the LSTM model, a total of 4 cases were selected (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 4.5: 2035, 2075; RCP 8.5: 2051, 2072) with the largest annual average runoff by period and scenario. The results of the analysis of the future flood inundation in the Tonle Sap basin were compared with the results of previous studies. Unlike in the past, when the change in the depth of inundation changed to a range of about 1 to 10 meters during the 1997 - 2005 period, it occurred in a range of about 5 to 9 meters during the future period. The results show that in the future RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the variability of discharge is reduced compared to the past and that climate change could change the runoff patterns of the Tonle Sap basin.

AB  - The military satellite communications system requires a new operating concept and system design to transmit All-IP based data as a circuit switching system. The core of All-IP data is packetizing in a packet-based efficient data processing method. In addition, The IP data applied to the satellite system requires measures against the efficiency of frequency resources and delay between transmissions. A frequency resource is a key element in a satellite system. In a limited frequency resources, a system design for transmitting IP data through a small frequency resources is required. Since the satellite system transmits data using Geo-Stationary satellites, data transmission delay occurs. A system design technique for transmitting IP data should be applied in consideration of the satellite-specific environment such as transmission delay and bit efficiency. In this paper, we will discuss the design applied to the Flyaway Satellite Terminal for the frequency resource and satellite data delay.

AB  - The National Human Rights Commission of Korea judged that ‘University Chapel’ is ‘sect education for the propagation of religion and violates the freedom of religion of students’. This should be understood as a request of the times that chapels should no longer be sectarian education solely for the propagation of religion, but should be ‘more sophisticated and high-quality’ religious liberal arts education. The university chapel has its own educational goals and objectives. And it is a subject of university education with its own methodology, content, and evaluation system. Now, university chapels need a new framework that properly captures the needs of chapel recipients, social changes, and changes in the educational environment, beyond the provider-centered educational framework. One alternative is the 'global trend and dedication chapel model'. ‘Trend Chapel’ aims to educate students on a Christian worldview by focusing on global trends, interpreting their meaning through the Bible, and expanding the possibility of dialogue with design. ‘Dedicated Chapel’ is an ‘educational program through the participation of trainees’. ‘Global Trend and Devotion Chapel’ is a response strategy suggested in relation to the direction of the university chapel, which is facing a crisis due to the wave of recommendations from the National Human Rights Commission, and is a model of the university chapel, which is a religious liberal arts education.

AB  - Popular discourse concerning new technologies and media, such as artificial intelligence, algorithmic media, and automated media, are focused on technological engineering and policies. Automated media directed by big data and algorithms, however, is likely to maintain or exacerbate  not solve  existing social problems. In particular, in the case of algorithmic media, gender relations are made unequal via systematic efforts to make women and other social minorities invisible. This paper explores the relationship between artificial intelligence discourse and inequality to facilitate a discussion on the social value of automated media. First, I explore the meaning and current state of the so-called “Silicon Valley worldview” and examine how this discourse has penetrated the media and academia. Subsequently, I explore the cultural collective imaginaries of “autonomy” which is the core concept of artificial intelligence discourse. I clarify the ways in which automated media reinforces social problems such as inequality. I also discuss how automated media exacerbates existing gender inequality. The problem of social inequality should be articulated in the context of the relations connecting human being s and social technology, not purely in the in the context of algorithmic media technology.

AB  - As some of the offline activities have moved online due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, events that require a sense of realism such as seminars, medical practice, education, and performances are being held on Metaverse. Recently, discussions on metaverse platform regulations are expected to begin as metaverse innovation is expected thanks to computing technologies such as 5G, AR, XR, VR, and AI. Until now, regulations on virtual space have been widely applied to Internet space. It is the regulation on various Internet-based platforms such as games, commerce, and portals. For example, 「the Telecommunications Business Act」, 「the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection」, 「the Act on Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce」, and 「the Game Industry Promotion Act」 imposes a number of obligations on platform operators. On the one hand, there is a movement by domestic regulators to introduce recently proposed platform regulation laws in the EU and the United States, and regulations on these platforms involve restrictions on participants' fundamental rights. Metaverse is a space where humans can control their avatars to freely engage in residence, assembly, entertainment, and economic activities, and is characterized by development through the participation of many operators. Therefore, before hastily applying the existing Internet regulation system to the metaverse space, it will be said that the priority is to establish a guarantee system based on the protection of general freedom of action and individual fundamental rights on the platform.This article came to the following conclusion as a result of seeking the direction of guaranteeing fundamental rights based on the right to pursue human dignity and right to pursue happiness guaranteed by Article 10 of the Constitution ahead of the full-fledged metaverse era. First, the metaverse platform is a ever-changing space where various daily lives in the real world of humans are embodied, and should be regulated around the protection of the general right to pursue happiness and free personal rights. Second, the metaverse space is a space with various characteristics, and discipline is needed in consideration of the nature of individual platforms, the degree of interaction with the real world, and influence. Third, the metaverse space is a space where general freedom of action is realized, so fundamental rights of freedom need to be specially protected. However, it is necessary to sentence profits according to the type of metaverse platform and the importance of conflicting fundamental rights. Fourth, there is a certain worldview and order in the metaverse. In other words, as it is a virtual space where creativity and freedom should be exercised, self-regulation arising from the agreement of members should be the key, and the role of the state should focus on preparing an environment that guarantees free competition among platform participants.

AB  - This article examines the worldview of the impact of Moon Yoon-sung’s “complete society” that paints the realist international politics of Cold War science in the 20th century, using“war and peace” as the keyword. This work shows the core status of science and technology in the Cold War system, along with the characteristics of the reorganization of the international order in the 20th century in terms of war and peace.In the novel, which presupposes the end-of-life narrative of Earth and mankind, the status of Cold War science is well illustrated in the humanitarian role of the United Nations and the Science Center not only as saviors after the Korean War but also to dispel the fear of war in the 22nd century. This is because war, which is caused by human selfishness, will eventually lead to the destruction of Earth by mutual confirmation.Assuming that Moon Yun-sung’s “Complete Society” is a fictional map of the physical reality of the 20th century Cold War, the author wanted to show the future blueprint of a symbiotic utopia, a post-gender society through the “human revolution,” to realize eternal peace.

AB  - The mission can achieve the purpose of evangelism only by knowing the situation and culture of the mission field and the worldview that leads their lives. In this regard missiology places great importance on the interdisciplinary studies of social sciences with various disciplines that understand regions, cultures and the society in which mankind belongs. However most of the domestic missiology studies are literature studies that rely on primary data rather than field or interdisciplinary studies.Dr. Hoon Tae Chang of Baekseok University was a missionary scholar and he was exceptionally called "exploration expert." Dr. Hun Tae Chang who started exploring Africa in 1999, visited Africa 34 times until 2020 and there are about 100 thesis based on exploration research and literature. He received the title of “third generation African scholar” at the African Society and responded various issues such as Islam, the Middle East, and the African conflict through interviews with numerous media. Since the news source can reveal his beliefs and religion, the active participation of Christian scholars through interviews helps news audiences change their biblical worldview.This thesis presents how Dr. Hun Tae Chang, a missionary and regional researcher who has been working as a professional interviewer for the general media beyond his religious circles, responded to sensitive social issues. At the same time it highlights the research achievements and accomplishments he has made through his exploration research in Africa for about 20 years.Dr. Hoon Tae Chang's exploration research posed a challenge to the field of missiology which is focused on literature research. In addition the numerous primary information and research results he left are evaluated as valuable data not only for missiology but also for African scholars.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop STEAM programs in the early childhood that can contribute to the development of STEAM literacy such as interests in STEAM topics & elements, creativity, communication skills, and problem solving skills through project learning experiences. To this end, we selected the most familiar and interesting topics to students(toys, aliens, superheroes, etc.) and intended to design STEAM programs that take into account the cognitive, affective, and physical developmental stages of elementary school students using storytelling and project-based learning models. The characteristics of the STEAM program developed in this study are as follows. First, the lower grades of elementary school stage is a time when the ‘I’-centered worldview is expanding through social interactions with family members, peers, and teachers. Therefore, topics are selected based on the stories of people around me, stories that I have experienced, and stories that `I' can relate to. Second, it is a stage that cognitively transits from the pre-operational stage to the concrete operational stage. Formal operation (abstract thinking) has not yet been completed, and it is the time to develop thinking through concrete objects. Therefore, rather than abstract problem-solving, subjects and topics that can directly touch, manipulate, and move the body are selected. Third, the composition of each programs is designed to experience three types of storytellings(narrative storytelling  visual storytelling  physical storytelling). Based on these characteristics we developed total of 6 programs for each 1-2 grade. The result of the pilot application of the 6 programs in a total 16 schools, 19 teachers and 399 students is as follows. First, the average satisfaction of elementary teachers was 4.09 and there was significant difference in teacher satisfaction by grade level(p <.01). Second, students' satisfaction(interest, participation, perception of difficulty) in STEAM programs was 3.96 on average, and there was no meaningful difference between programs, grades and gender. Third, changes in STEAM attitude before and after participation in the programs of elementary school students were statistically significantly improved in all sub-areas (interest, communication, self-concept, self-efficacy, career choice in science and engineering) except for consideration for others and STEAM usefulness. Based on these results, a discussion on the STEAM program for the lower grades and a direction for follow-up research were suggested.

AB  - This paper considers Daehaeng’s thought with a focus on the Hanmaum. Daehaeng’s thought posed a worldview of change, ceaselessly transforming, incarnating, and restoring through the principles of PyeongDeunggongbeop, HwalgungGongbeop, SuRegongbeop.Moreover, she displayed the world of incarnation and merit-transference as the Hanmaum from an everlasting manifest perspective. The Hanmaum  is the Musim that is everlasting and transcends time and space, but it is the Ilsim that is consistent across time, and it is the Gongsim that, from a spatial perspective, appears in a diverse manner.On one hand, the Hanmaum is incarnation that ceaselessly changes, transforms, and reveals from the Musim to Ilsim and to the Gongsim, but on the other hand, it is the return to emptiness and merit-transference that the Gongsim returns to Ilsim and to the Musim.Incarnation is creation where the Buddha incarnates into bodhisattva each moment in order to ceaselessly make anew a sentient being as all sorts of life, but from the aspect of merit-transference that returns to the Buddha at the same time as incarnation, it is also evolution that reveals itself freely.As the incarnation of the Hanmaum, the time called the now, and the space called here, I only return by ceaselessly incarnating and changing and these things are not fixed. Accordingly, my life here and now is always free and unrestricted.

AB  - Faced with the unprecedented crisis of COVID-19, most religions showed  weak,  passive  and  negative  aspects,  but  religion  still  plays  an important  role  in  overcoming  the  COVID-19.  It  is  because  we  need religious  healing  such  as  meditation,  prayer  not  only  in  establishing  an eco‐centric  worldview  in  which  humans,  nature,  and  all  things  coexist, but also in treating the mental illness caused by the COVID-19, that is, ‘corona  blue’,  As  for  Kumkangdaedo,  they  were  a  bit  embarrassed  at first  by  the  unprecedented  pandemic  of  COVID-19,  but  they communicate using digital platforms such as YouTube and Webex, while holding small gatherings at the general headquarters and in each branch, above  all  else,  they  are  gathering  wisdom  to  overcome  the  COVID-19 while  focusing  on  disciplining  for  individual  spiritual  recovery.  The remote conference system was introduced as a measure to overcome the COVID-19,  but  in  the  era  of  the  4th  industrial  revolution,  as  there  are essential  aspects  for  future  propaganda  and  edification  for  young  people who are familiar with digital culture, on this opportunity it will have to be  further  developed  in  the  future.  In  particular,  it  has  been  used  for simple meetings and lectures, but going one step further, there are tasks to be developed, such as training and meditation using digital tools.Founded  in  1999,  the  ‘Geumgangdaedo  Jongrihak  Society’  has  been working    on    rationalization    and    generalization    through    academic systematization.  For  Jongrihak,  the  primary  object  of  study  is  the arrangement  of  the  Dosa  (道史)  and  the  translation  work  of  The  Holy Great Sutras(大聖經). Translated publications of speeches and acts such as Seonghuntonggo, ​​nurturing talents such as master’s and Ph.D. courses, and  academic  conferences  in  which  external  scholars  participated  have continued,  and  they  were  published  as  a  collection  of  academic  papers. Including  personal  research  papers  on  Jongrihak  such  as  ‘a  complete collection  of  Geumgang  Samjong  University  Jongrihak’  and  ‘a  collection of  Geumgangdaedo  Jongbeopwon  Order’,  about  10  master’s  theses  and three  doctoral  dissertations  were  published.  Currently,  we  are  continuing projects of translating  The Holy Great Sutras in a total of 11 scriptures and  28  books,  as  well  as  the  three  Masters’  words  and  deeds  and  the history  of  Daedo.  Being  established  to  foster  adherents  within  Daedo,  the Kumkang  Samjong  College  provides  education.  While  conducting  in‐ depth  Jongrihak  education  through  undergraduate  and  graduate  courses,  it operates  a  three‐part  system  of  Education  Center  –  Undergraduate School  Graduate School (Master’s  Program Doctoral Program). If  the  advent  of  digital  civilization  or  phono  sapiens  civilization  is  an unavoidable  future,  although  it  is  a  digital  culture  that  has  been inevitably  experienced  due  to  the  COVID-19,  it  will  be  beneficial  for the  future  development  of  religion  to  further  develop  it  in  the  future, and it could be a positive opportunity to turn the unprecedented crisis of the  COVID-19 into  an  opportunity.

AB  - The influence of Christianity on Western culture is the endless admiration for the world of ideal values, a heaven that distinguishes itself from reality, and the thorough distinction between nature and human beings. This is a different feature from the oriental reason for pursuing the best in reality based on reality. Cicero called natural law the right principle of human nature to join the world order, or Logos. This means that although there may be differences in degree, it has maintained a similar position to the Eastern view of nature until it reaches the Stoic philosophy. In the 4th century, however, Augustine reconstructed it into a dualistic metaphysical system. He divided this world into the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the earth, good and evil, all of which are products of God’s will and given by grace of revelation. Vertical structural systems of upper and lower levels formed by biblical interpretation. is so solid that it shows the mental inerial force that continues through the Renaissance and into the modern humanistic era. Due to the the Reformation, humans who became independent from God took over the position of God with the noble dignity like God. The modern era of the West is an era of structural contradiction and painful history that entrenched a dichotomous thinking structure, that strictly distinguishes subject from object, subjective thinking and objective thinking, whole world and me, mind and body, value and existence. The worldview of this era is a value relativism attitude based on individualistic liberalism. However, Oriental studies have long been a thoroughly empirical understanding, a principle of life established through inductive reasoning, and a universal social norm. Moral values are the laws of change in things that are inherent in things that constantly work and show their consistent order in countless surrounding objects. In Eastern society, "Moral" is a measure of my existence in relationships, a milestone that suggests a way to move forward through relationships with the surrounding world, and is the only way to feel the majesty of the world and the universe. The history of politics in the East, which has pursued politics that loves the people, has maintained the morality of governance throughout. Various systems operated during the Joseon Dynasty were based on the foundation that state power should be moral in nature. If the West saw morality as an ideological value, the East accepted it as a universal principle of existence of real things, and the East viewed it as a human being in a social relationship where the subjective and the objectives correspond to each other. On the other hand, the West had a fundamental difference set as the absolute self at odds with the world. What should we do to become a tsunami in which our learning knocks on the door of the world like the wave of Hallyu spreading around the world?

AB  - East Asian Civilization is often characterized in terms of its “organic” worldview. What is interesting about this characterization is that it i was discovered and defined by Westerners. And these Westerners' understanding of the East Asian, particularly Chinese civilization, has served as a basic compass when the East Asian intellectuals tried to overcome the pre-modernity of East Asian traditions. One of the representative examples can be found in Maruyama Masao's Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan, which approaches the East Asian thought from a macro-civilizational perspective. In this work, Masao begins the discussion with the critical examination of Chinese thought from a Hegelian point of view and concludes that Chinese civilization has never reached maturity. And central features that lie at the heart of this immaturity are said to be the following: firstly, dealing with politics as a moral dimension, and secondly, the worldview that does not make a clear distinction between nature and human invention. Against the background of emphasis on the pre-modern nature of Neo-Confucain worldview, Masao portrays Sorai Ogyu (荻生徂徠, 1666-1728), a Confucian scholar of the Edo period in Japan as a thinker who pioneered the modern horizon of Japanese thought by claiming the independence of politics from morality and the status of a sage as distinct from nature.  This article aims to examine the civilizational and macroscopic perspective - ‘organic worldview,’ or ‘nature vs. invention’ - that, more often than not, pays an insufficient attention to the intrinsic context of individual thinkers: as reflected in Masao's view of Ogyu Sorai’s thought. In particular, I will examine Masao’s understanding of Sorai’s idea of the relationship between nature and invention by contrasting it with Xunzi's idea of '天人之分'.

AB  - This paper examines the translation practice of Yan Fu(1854-1921), a Chinese enlightment thinker and translator in the late Qing Dynasty, predicated upon a theoretical framework of translation in postcolonial context. It mainly discusses Yan Fu’s   TianYanLun(天演論, 1898)  , which translated Thomas Huxley’s      Evolution and Ethics(1894)  .Yan Fu published a Chinese translation entitled   TianYanLun  to transform the Confucious view of the world of the times in order to appeal to China’s intellectuals for China’s national self-strengthening in the late 19th century. Yan Fu mainly introduced Herbert Spencer’s social Darwinism in   TianYanLun  . Spencer’s social Darwinism provides that the struggle for existence, natural selection and survival the fittest are the fundamental principles of human society. Huxley argued that the struggle for existence and self- assertion need to be restrained to ensure continuity of human society in   Evolution and Ethics  . He thought that an excessive struggle for existence can lead to a destructive effect and called for an ethical behavior in human society. However, these aspects were ignored and modified in Yan’s comments in   TianYanLun  . Yan Fu was in favor of Spencer’s optimistic vision of the struggle for existence in   TianYanLun  . Yan Fu was desperate to appeal to China’s intellectuals so that they would have an objective understanding of the situation facing endangered China. He introduced an world of evolution to China by explaining a linear view of history as a counter-discourse. He criticized a circular view of history which claims “period of good order followed by one of confusion(YiZhiYiLuan, 一治一亂)” in the Confucian worldview, while searching for the wealth and power of China to make a modern China.Yan Fu’s autonomous and inventive translation practice corresponds to the role of a postcolonial translator as a social activist. His role as an activist and translator represents that of the postcolonial translator who is publicly engaged in the construction of discourses. Yan Fu’s postcolonial stance is conspicuously reflected on typical translation tactics in postcolonial context, in the double process of deconstruction of dominating discourse and reconstruction of counter-discourse. Yan Fu’s autonomous and inventive translation practice challenges the conventional notion and general perception of translation in translation theory, and raises the need for a deep understanding of translation.

AB  - This study analyzes the characterization method and meaning of creation in Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon(written in Chinese letters). The original copy of Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon was a manuscript by Professor Lee Hyuk of Chonnam National University, which was printed on an oil-printing copy to be used by Professor Kim Ki-dong as a textbook. Currently, the original cannot be confirmed. Only a copy of the handout is available.Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon is a work created based on the existing Tokkijeon, and the narrative structure is not much different from the general Tokkijeon. However, The dragon king is described as having lost his authority as a monarch, and the Byeoljubu, characterized as rabbits, are described as a ruling class who regard manners as important during the Joseon. In other words, Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon shows the worldview of the ruling class that lived in the late Joseon Dynasty.Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon seems to have been created by utilizing Tokkijeon's Seoul block-printed novel version and Tokkijeon's A Novel for Lending version. In the relationship Tokkijeon's versions, the creation period of Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon warfare is estimated to be the 1880s. The writer of this novel described animals as the dominant class of the Joseon Dynasty, especially with the theme of the work that reflects the emotions of the ruling class of the Joseon Dynasty living in the provinces.The author of Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon is presumed to be Lee Hyuk's great-grandfather Lee Choi-sun. This is because Lee Choi-sun was a teacher of Shin Jae-hyo, a master of Pansori, and his family was the dominant group of the Joseon. In addition, he failed the past examination and his reclusive period coincides with the creation time of Lee Hyuk's Tokkijeon.

AB  - In this paper, the performance of cooperative transmission with a Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is investigated in a clustered low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites communication system. We aim to maximize the receive SNR of a terrestrial user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming and (passive) reflect beamforming subject to a transmit power constraint at the source satellite. Furthermore, we demonstrate it through our simulations. Our proposed IRS-assisted LEO satellite communication system can provide high quality communication service even to communicatively isolated areas, so it can he expected to be a main applicable 6G technology which guarantees superconnection.

AB  - Deep learning has been widely used in various areas, such as detecting materials, or estimating natural disasters. Especially, generative adversarial network (GAN), which is one of the deep learning models, is enhanced to CycleGAN for generation and discrimination of images even with unpaired datasets. In this paper, we design a model to generate reallike fake flood models, and we confirm that we distinguish between real and fake images by mixing them with real images. Based on this metric, a deep learning model is designed, and a dataset is generated using CycleGAN. We further perform data augmentation to assist in the dataset generation process. The program used to design the model is Python, which uses data from Sentinel-1. Input data is a collection of data from floods during 2019 in West Africa, Southeast Africa, Middle East Asia, and Australia. To determine the accuracy of the generated data, we compare the image using several indicators. The used indicators judge the accuracy and similarity of images such as SSIM and MSE, and PSNR. SSIM, MSE, and PSNR averaged 0.7192, 2014.0066, and 15.5745, respectively. Comparing images with these indicators, we confirm that the actual flood image and the generated flood image are similar. And using generated images, we use different deep learning model, to confirm how similar the real flood image is to the flood image produced in this paper.

AB  - This paper aims to reflect on contemporary Russian religious literary studies on Dostoevsky’s eschatological worldview, focusing on Russian messianism in his eschatological novel, The Possessed from the author’s evangelical viewpoint, while referring to their debates on N. Berdyaev’s reflections on Dostoevsky. According to Zyryanov, the contemporary Russian religious literary studies are divided into theological-dogmatic circle and philological circle integrated into the ethno-confessional field of historic poetics. The first circle acknowledges Dostoevsky as a Russian Orthodox writer in accordance with Russian Orthodox dogmas, simultaneously criticizing Berdyaev for his acclaim of Dostoevsky as ‘the most Christian writer’ for prophesying the imminent advent of the third eschatological era and for his criticism of Dostoevsky’s negative Russian messianism. The other circle could be divided into two sub-categories: one acknowledging Dostoevsky as a Russian Orthodox writer in accordance with ethnic Russian Orthodox culture, criticizing Berdyaev’s reflections; and the other one highly estimating Berdyaevs’s reflections. From my evangelical viewpoint, contemporary Russian religious studies should inherit creatively the heritage of Berdyaev’s and other religious philosophers’ sanctuary-free studies, reflecting on the Orthodox dogmas and Russian messianism in the theological dimension.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article is an attempt to define what ‘Christian Philosophy’ is. Defining by genus and difference is the most common way to define something intentionally. Its about the same in case of ‘Christian Philosophy’. We usually focus on identifying the specific difference which makes a philosophy ‘Christian’. But this does not seems to be a proper strategy, insofar as the term ‘Christian Philosophy’ could be counted as contradictory. Prior, then, to discussing what Christian Philosophy is, the compatibility between the term ‘Christian’ and ‘philosophy’ must be examined.It seems, however, that this compatibility could not be secured, if we, by adding some differences to the ‘philosophy’ as a genus, try to narrow it down to ‘Christian philosophy’. Rather, ‘Christianity’ should be the point of departure. This is not only a matter of changing the precedure, but also of changing our way of thinking.The importance of having a Christian worldview could not be overemphasized. But the more important than our view of the world is the world itself, that is, the fact that the world itself is actually a world of Christian God, being created and governed by Him. In this context, Christian philosophy could be defined as ‘an act of philosophizing in the world of God the Creator and Governer’. Now, inasmuch as to accept the revealed truth as truth by faith does not means necessarily to understand it as truth, the Christian philosophy could also be taken as ‘our efforts to understand intellectually the truth accepted and owned by faith’.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Red tide causes significant damage to marine resources such as aquaculture and fisheries in coastal regions. Such red tide events occur globally, across latitudes and ocean ecoregions. Satellite observations can be an effective tool for tracking and investigating red tides and have great potential for informing strategies to minimize their impacts on coastal fisheries. However, previous satellite-based red tide detection algorithms have been mostly conducted over short time scales and within relatively small areas, and have shown significant differences from actual field data, highlighting a need for new, more accurate algorithms to be developed. In this study, we present the newly developed normalized red tide index (NRTI). The NRTI uses Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data to detect red tides by observing in situ spectral characteristics of red tides and sea water using spectroradiometer in the coastal region of Korean Peninsula during severe red tide events. The bimodality of peaks in spectral reflectance with respect to wavelengths has become the basis for developing NRTI, by multiplying the heights of both spectral peaks. Based on the high correlation between the NRTI and the red tide density, we propose an estimation formulation to calculate the red tide density using GOCI data. The formulation and methodology of NRTI and density estimation in this study is anticipated to be applicable to other ocean color satellite data and other regions around the world, thereby increasing capacity to quantify and track red tides at large spatial scales and in real time.

TI  - Factors Influencing Nurses' Willingness to Speak Up Regarding Patient Safety in East Asia: A Systematic Review
T2  - RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Speaking up for patient safety among health care professionals is important because it can contribute to the prevention of adverse patient events, such as medication errors, infections, wrong-site surgical procedures, and other sentinel events. This systematic review identified factors that facilitate or inhibit nurses' willingness to speak up regarding patient safety in East Asian hospitals. Following the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, four databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Web of Science, were searched. Nine studies were analyzed in this review, including five qualitative and four quantitative studies published between 2014 and 2019. Quality of included studies were evaluated using the Mixed-Method Appraisal Tool. Data synthesis was based upon qualitative-led synthesis adopting two existing multilevel frameworks on safety voice and employee voice signals. Four studies were conducted in Japan, three in South Korea, one in Hong Kong, and one in Taiwan. We organized factors influencing East Asian nurses' willingness to speak up regarding patient safety according to the following four contexts: individual (motivation toward patient safety, organizational commitment, perceived effectiveness and importance of speaking up, and assertive personality), team (positive relationship and team trust, team culture, and mentoring), organizational (hospital administrative support and organizational culture) and sociocultural (hierarchy and power differential and collectivistic culture). However, due to the limited number of studies conducted in East Asian hospitals, further studies with larger cohort samples of nurses in various East Asian countries should be conducted to deepen our understanding of nurses' willingness to voice their concerns for patient safety.

T2  - ULTRASONOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance of ultrasonography (US)-based radiomics for axillary lymph node metastasis and to compare it with that of a clinicopathologic model.Methods: A total of 496 patients (mean age, 52.5 +/- 10.9 years) who underwent breast cancer surgery between January 2014 and December 2014 were included in this study. Among them, 306 patients who underwent surgery between January 2014 and August 2014 were enrolled as a training cohort, and 190 patients who underwent surgery between September 2014 and December 2014 were enrolled as a validation cohort. To predict axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, we developed a preoperative clinicopathologic model using multivariable logistic regression and constructed a radiomics model using 23 radiomic features selected via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression.Results: In the training cohort, the areas under the curve (AUC) were 0.760, 0.812, and 0.858 for the clinicopathologic, radiomics, and combined models, respectively. In the validation cohort, the AUCs were 0.708, 0.831, and 0.810, respectively. The combined model showed significantly better diagnostic performance than the clinicopathologic model.Conclusion: A radiomics model based on the US features of primary breast cancers showed additional value when combined with a clinicopathologic model to predict axillary lymph node metastasis.

Today, records and digital contents that identi fy for the Joseon  Expo are distributed throughout domestic and international archive, but there are some difficulties in searching for related resource from perspective of users. It is difficult to examine the comprehensive context of the Joseon  Expo, as the resources of the Expo are provided within a larger category such as the ‘Japanese colonial period’ or the ‘Modern  Expo’ rather  than built on  the basis of a single  event called the Expo.This article presents a plan to comprehensively explore the world of related knowledge by constructing the resources of the Joseon Expo as a digital archive. In the Data design and construction step, the process of linking the Joseon Expo knowledge resources of The Joseon Expo in data unit was included. After the database was established, exhibition hall at that time in 1929 and the current Gyeongbokgung Palace area were mapped to visualize the space information of the exhibition, and a screen to examine the relationship between individual exhibition halls and event programs and participants in the exhibition hall was implemented in  the web space.

AB  - Reading Nalo Hopkinson’s seventh speculative fiction, Sister Mine (2013), from a disability studies perspective, this paper examines the ways in which the novel takes issue with the oppressive system of ableism that privileges the able body as the norm by which the disabled body is defined as deviant and lacking ability and provocatively reimagines disability as an alternative way of knowing and living in the world. This paper demonstrates that Sister Mine is a disability narrative that challenges what Lennard J. Davis calls “the hegemony of normalcy” as well as the kill-or-cure plot typical in mainstream popular disability narratives. Representing the conjoined twin sisters (Makeda and Abby) and their human mother and deity father as a family disabled by the ableist norms set by Afro-Caribbean deities, the novel reveals and interrogates the ideology of ability that stigmatizes one’s identity, value, and status. With the main character/narrator Makeda’s struggles with her disabilities resulting from her being both a conjoined twin and a half-god and half-human without mojo, the novel problematizes such normative notions as ability, disability, and dependency. Makeda’s quest for her mojo, which she believes will enable her to become a normal demigod, actually leads her to a new understanding of that power as giving. In so doing, Hopkinson suggests a non-ableist view of disability that acknowledges the inevitable human vulnerability and dependency and thus redefines ability as participation into interdependency and mutual responsibilities.

AB  - In the era of globalization, cultural identity on tradition as well as multinational culture has also become important in a modern society. Culture is formed by interactions with surroundings. From a research perspective, it is highly valuable to examine the essence of culture through comparative analysis against three East Asian countries (Republic of Korea, China and Japan) which are historically and geographically closely related to each other and analyze Korean ethnicity and national identity with traditional wedding dresses which are believed to be the epitome of cultural lifestyles.This      study      attempted      to      comparatively      review       the      traditional      wedding      dresses      of      the      three      countries      which      have resplendent   culture   and   history    and   express   body   art   based   on   their    aesthetic    elements   such   as    traditional   patterns    and   color.According to analysis of their culture, the three countries have shared the foundation of culture such as nature-friendly ideology and harmonized worldview including eumyangohaeng (yin-yang theory and the five elements), natural inaction and Feng Shui theory. Furthermore, such traditional wedding dresses reflecting each country’s ethnic emotions and consciousness hierarchy imply eumyangohaeng–based colors and patterns reflecting shamanistic wishes along with fancy decorations. This study confirmed the extensibility of artistic expressions using tradition by creating body art based on the traditional wedding dresses of the Republic of Korea, China and Japan during the early modern period. It is anticipated that there would be further studies on many works which establish traditional identity.

AB  - This paper is to rethink our legal system in the face of the COVID-19 crisis and to call for the change of legal paradigm. In particular, it focuses on liberalism and the form of modern legal system, both of which are rooted in the modern mechanical world view. My contention is as follows. Post-modern problems, such as the COVID-19 and the climate crisis, are characterized by the rapid spread of problems through high connectivity, and the uncertainty of individual causalities. Those are reasons that the liberal modern legal system fails to properly cope with post-modern problems. It pursues the method by which it reduces the whole problem to each individual’s problem and divides it into the separate elements, as well as it tries to solve it based on the certainty of causality.To cope properly with the new type of problems, it is necessary that the legal system should support the solidarity of society, and new legal thinking based on probability and patterns should take the place of the conventional causality principle. In addition, the fundamental changes such as easing the formal rigidity and dichotomous logic of the modern legal system are required. The change must be accompanied by a new way of preventing arbitrary abuse of power.

TI  - The Limits of Modern Anthropocentrism and the Restoration of the Humanities Spirit as Publicness
TI  - 근대 인간주의의 한계와 공공성의 인문정신 회복
T2  - 한국학논집
M3  - research-article
AB  - The driving forces behind the development of modern civilization are anthropocentrism and legal human rights being guaranteed as the freedom for all to pursue one’s desire. Modern civilization justified it as a rational ideology through the worldview of evolutionary theory. However, it is now in danger of collapse due to the self-destructive contradiction of such forces. The contradiction derived from this has endangered the survival of mankind, by devastating and destroying natural ecosystem, while expanding and deepening social disruptions and confrontations. The destruction of the ecosystem has been expanded globally and exacerbated steeply towards the second half of the 20th century. Now, humanity is faced with the destruction of the ecosystem, which brings up intensified social disruptions, conflicts and global disasters. It has led the humanity to a grim image of future that creates concerns for our own survival as a species.The collapse of the self-destructive modern civilization is inevitable. The first step for mankind to escape from this crisis is to overcome anthropocentrism, which has become the central force of modern civilization. Anthropocentrism seeks to objectify, dominate, and possess the other, whether natural or human, to satiate selfish desires. The selfish anthropocentrism destroys and devastates not only the ecosystem as the base of human life, but also society by making it impossible for survival. Therefore, the self-centered and exclusive anthropocentrism has to be criticized and overcome for us to escape from the contradiction. However, humans cannot accomplish such a task with modern humanities, which, overwhelmed by modern science, has lost the spirit of humanities and retreated into exploring the human consciousness.In overcoming the modern anthropocentrism, the achievements of traditional humanities have become valuable assets. Traditional humanities regarded ‘humanitas’ as the best value of the study, which was to fully embody the social nature of humans as the members of the world. According to this tradition, being human is to reveal the reason of all things in the world and make each existence harmoniously expressed, so that it conforms to the order of heaven and earth, which is its parents. An indispensable social character to wholly bear such a heavenly mandate is ‘publicness’, which considers all things in the world as brothers. “Seonghakshipdo” (“Ten Diagrams of the Sacred Learning” by Toegye Yi Hwang) and “Daeseunggihinronso” (commentary on the Awakening of Faith) are the major academic achievements that established the humanities system while identifying the humanities spirit in the realization of this publicness.In terms of publicness, which is the core value of traditional humanities, anthropocentrism harms and destroys the existence itself and the world, the basis of its life, which ends up burying the intellect of human reason in the understanding of individual existence like cancer cells. Moreover, it leads us into the dark without a hint of a way out of the contradiction by justifying the indiscriminate affirmation of human desire and self-interest detached from publicness. The disorientation of modern reason and the impasse of modern civilization plunging into the self-destructive chaos are rooted in the loss of humanities spirit as publicness.What is urgent for mankind now is post-modern humanities that will save itself from the catastrophe of modern civilization. Post-modern humanities should be the humanities that overcomes the anthropocentrism of modern civilization, restores the humanistic spirit of publicness as the long heritage of mankind, and aims for humans to live in a world where all things coexist together. In that sense, postmodern humanities are humanities that can be labelled ‘Beopgo Changsin (Create the new but do not contradict the spirit of the classics)’; meaning the creation of the new by emulating the spirit of the past.In addition, ‘Beopgo Changsin’ humanities should boldly deviate from the limited scope of modern humanities confined to literature, history and philosophy, which used to be focused on the study of human consciousness. As traditional humanities did, post-modern humanities should actively move forward as a practical academic complex that contributes to solving the problems at hand in major aspects of life, and to this end, they should take the lead in academic convergence based on the spirit of publicness. Historical precedents of the practical complex humanities based on the publicness include the achievements of "Gwanjia", "Sunjia" and "Dasanhak" in the late Joseon Dynasty. It is imperative for the immediate innovation of humanities to examine these achievements closely and develop them in a modern way.

TI  - Country-scale trends in air pollution and fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during 2001-2018: confronting the roles of national policies and economic growth
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fossil fuel (FF) burning, the main energy source of the modern world's economy, remains the major source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and pollutants in the atmosphere. Based on 18 years (2001-2018) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite, FFCO2 emissions from the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide, and gross domestic product (GDP) data from the World Bank, we found that air quality, FF consumption, and economy are strongly bonded at the continental scale but decoupled at the national level under favorable policies. The comparison of AOD vs PM2.5 and NO2 over urbanized areas shows that the pollutants leading to the AOD load can vary significantly by country. A strong connection between GDP and FFCO2 emissions indicates that economic growth deeply replies on FF consumption in most countries. Meanwhile, air pollution is more associated with the growing trend than the level of development of a country. With more mature technologies and renewable energy, economies can keep growing without compromising their environment and population health.

TI  - Signature Pedagogies for Art Therapy Education: A Delphi Study
T2  - ART THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to shifting standards in art therapy education and licensure an examination of how educators are preparing students for professional practice is warranted. This Delphi study used the framework of signature pedagogies to identify discipline-specific methods used by art therapy educators to teach students how to think, practice, and develop the ethics and values of the art therapy profession. A sample of 18 art therapy educators reached consensus on three common teaching methods and pedagogical worldview deemed essential to the education of art therapists: (a) experiential teaching and learning using art materials, (b) practicum/internship placements, and (c) art-based experiential learning. The results substantiate the claim that art therapy is a distinct profession with teaching methods differentiated from related disciplines.

TI  - Ideological Impact on Social-Economic Development of the Region of Tusheti (Georgia) after WWII
T2  - BALKANISTIC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with one of the highland regions of Eastern Georgia Tusheti, which represents a geoeconomic and ethnocultural phenomenon from a scientific and worldview perspectives. The research sheds light on ideological influences on the socio-economic and the cultural situation of Tusheti from the 1930s to the present day, a number of shortcomings and consequences of Soviet economic reforms, and on its backdrop. The Tush people, uncontented with the system joined an anti-Soviet organization linking the idea of Georgia's independence to the European countries. The centuries-old model of life based on communal relations, setting up on the democratic principles (the right to private property, equality, freedom of speech) was destroyed by Soviet ideological pressure. These principles naturally merged with European values.For centuries, Tusheti, placed in the geostrategic area was of great importance not only for the security of the region, but it also was a natural bridge in connecting the Eurasian cultures. Its strategic importance was particularly increased in the post-Soviet period. The contours of the geostrategic location of this region was revealed exactly in this period. The importance of the sustainable development of Tusheti has transcended national and state boundaries and has come under international environmental frameworks, which have laid the foundation for adapting traditional knowledge and experience with modern international standards and irreversible processes of cooperation.Based on the analysis of scientific literature, historical sources, and field materials, I conclude that the elements of the pro-Western orientation that affects Georgia have been felt in Tusheti from social and cultural viewpoints. Integration into European culture is of great importance for the preservation and further development of Tusheti cultural heritage.

TI  - Urban climate maps as a public health tool for urban planning: The case of dengue fever in Rio De Janeiro/Brazil
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban climate can influence the development of several diseases in the urban environment, among them dengue fever. The existing literature shows a strong correlation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito with climate, and especially with air temperature and humidity. The present study reveals a correlation between the surface temperature in the city of Rio de Janeiro and the distribution of Dengue vector larvae to provide suggestions for urban planning and public health/ epidemiology for the control of the disease. In order to demonstrate this spatial correlation, mean annual surface temperature data obtained from the MODIS sensor and the spatial distribution of Aedes aegypti larvae were used to derive an ROC curve. The epidemic year of 2008 was selected to test the spatial correlation and the results were 67%. The influence of temperature on the spatial distribution of vector larvae in the epidemic years in the context of this study endorses the use of the urban climate map as a tool to help develop strategies for planning for and mitigating the problem. The characteristics of the urban site were derived using matrix algebra, in a GIS environment, and allowed us to identify those portions of the municipal territory that are most susceptible to heat storage - crucial to the reproduction and performance of the dengue fever vector in the transmission of the disease. In the city of Rio de Janeiro, high potential for heating was shown in the central and northern zones, as well as in the area of westward expansion of the city, which are also poorer and densely-populated areas.

AB  - Paddy (Oryza Sativa, sp.) is the main food commodity of most Indonesian. Generally, Indonesia has several rice crop varieties, which are selectively planted by farmers to increase rice crop production value. Recorded in 2019, Cidahu has a relatively high value of paddy rice production of 20.721 tons. One effective way of monitoring rice crops is by utilizing remote sensing technology, both radar and optical imagery. Radar and optical datasets are very potential to be applied in tropical and sub-tropical regions, which are prone to cloud-cover. The combination of the two complement each other in increasing the accuracy of classification. This study aims to analyze the spatial phenology of paddy, map the distribution patterns of paddy rice varieties, and analyze rice crop production's spatial patterns using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imageries in Cidahu sub- district, Sukabumi Regency. The combination of polarization from SAR and vegetation index from optical images are used to determine the planting stages of paddy, which then serves as a guide for identifying rice varieties. The paddy stages are categorized into land preparation, vegetative, generative, and maturative. The yield from the 3,443 hectares of harvested area is 20.000-21.000 tons per hectare.

TI  - Focusing plasma jets to achieve high current density: Feasibility and opportunities for applications in debris removal and space exploration
T2  - AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid emergence of satellite-based economy coupled with the current renaissance in space exploration and aspirations for the Moon and Mars colonization drive strong interest in various techniques that may be adapted to space conditions and utilized for space debris disintegration and removal, as well as device maintenance and repair operations in open space. Dense plasma jets are a promising tool for many advanced applications. These can range from material processing to applying powerful effects of plasmas to targets to facilitate e.g. repair of material components in devices under field conditions or in space, as well as to enable destruction of objects for removal of debris from near-Earth space. Although there has been some effort in the use of strongly focused plasma jets in the aerospace technology, to date such a use is not widespread. In this work, we describe the experiments that demonstrate the possibility of focusing plasma jets into very high-current spots, where the current density reaches 5, 000 A x m(-2) in a spot of about 5 mm. Depending on a specific configuration of focusing magnetic coils, the footprint of the focusing spot could be controlled over a wide range, from millimetres to centimetres, and the current density could be varied from hundreds to thousands A x m(-2). We also briefly outline the possible applications of such systems, emphasising the possible use of such focused plasmas in space exploration technology. We expect that the suggested approach would be of considerable interest to many experts working in aerospace technology, and will stimulate new research directions in these fields.

T2  - Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the features of psychopatological structure of endogenous depression in young women and to identify correlations between various clinical types of depression and their nosological affilation.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of clinical/psychopathological examination of 107 female patients, aged 16 to 25 years, with endogenous depression with one of the following ICD-10 diagnosis: (F34.0; F31.3-F31.5; F21.3-F.21.4+F31.3-F31.5; F60.X+F31.3-F31.5) were analyzed.RESULTS: Several types of endogenous depression were identified: 1) hysterical depression with hysterical-conversions, and also the phenomena of delusional fantasies; 2) dysmorphic depression with predominance of over-valued ideas of physical disability, self-inferiority and eating disorder; 3) depersonalization depression with depersonalization-derealization symptoms; 4) psychopath-like depression with exaggerated behavior, opposition and impulsivity; 5) existential depression with a feeling of losing the life meaning and often pessimistic worldview; 6) psychasthenic depression with the low self-esteem and exaggerated introspection combined with obsessive-phobic disorder; 7) anxious-melancholic depression with anxiety, melancholy and ideas of self-accusation and self-inferiority; 8) depression with symptoms of adolescent asthenic insolvency with difficulties of understanding information, increasing intellectual exhaustion. We revealed differences in motives for committing non-suicidal self-harm behavior and suicidal behavior in typological variants of depressions.CONCLUSION: Hysteroform and psychopathic depressions prevail in personality disorders, while psychosthenic-like, anxious-melancholic and existential depressions are more frequent in affective disorders. Depersonalization depressions are more common in schizotypal disorder. When comparing the types of depressions in boys as reported in previous research with those in girls, the prevalence of hysteroform and anxious-melancholic variants in girls is revealed.
AB  - ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Изучить особенности психопатологической структуры эндогенных депрессий у пациенток молодого возраста с выявлением корреляций между различными клиническими типами депрессий и их нозологической принадлежностью.МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Проанализированы данные клинико-психопатологического обследования 107 пациенток в возрасте от 16 до 25 лет, страдавших эндогенными депрессиями (F34.0; F31.3F31.5; F21.3F.21.4+F31.3F31.5; F60.X+F31.3F31.5).РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ И ОБСУЖДЕНИЕ: Выделено несколько клинических типов эндогенных депрессий: 1) истеродепрессии с наличием полиморфной истеро-конверсионной симптоматики, а также проявлениями бредоподобного фантазирования; 2) дисморфофобические депрессии с преобладанием сверхценных идей физического недостатка, собственной неполноценности и расстройствами пищевого поведения; 3) деперсонализационные депрессии с доминированием деперсонализационно-дереализационной симптоматики; 4) гебоидные депрессии с утрированным поведением с оппозиционностью и расстройством влечений; 5) экзистенциальные депрессии с ощущением утраты смысла существования и нередким формированием сверхценного пессимистического мировоззрения; 6) психастенические депрессии с заниженной самооценкой и утрированным самоанализом, сочетавшимися с обсессивно-фобическими расстройствами; 7) тревожно-меланхолические депрессии с преобладанием тревожного и меланхолического аффекта, сопровождаемого идеями самообвинения и собственной малоценности; 8) депрессии с явлениями юношеской астенической несостоятельности с выраженными затруднениями при осмыслении информации и нарастающей интеллектуальной истощаемостью. Были выявлены различия в мотивах совершения несуицидальных самоповреждений и особенностях суицидального поведения при различных типологических вариантах депрессий.ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Отмечено, что у девушек с расстройствами личности преобладают истероформные и гебоидные депрессии, при аффективных заболеваниях  психастеноподобные, тревожно-меланхолические и экзистенциальные депрессии. В рамках шизотипического расстройства чаще встречались деперсонализационные депрессии.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, it has been believed that science deals with "pure" empiricism, which is getting progressively better to cognize, thereby discovering ahistorical truth, the status of which is independent of the cultural and social context. This system of views has been called the positivist paradigm. Its axiomatics extends far beyond the natural science discourse and acts as a general background for an entire era - Modernity. Formed by the scientific mind, ideas about the nature of what exists are reflected in all areas of social life: social goals, value system, social practices, etc. must be scientifically justified. In the second half of the twentieth century, the positivist paradigm was subjected to comprehensive criticism, the result of which was the abandonment of its main imperatives, and the dominant paradigm (today we can say confidently that not only in the field of philosophy of science) has become post-positivist, with its denial of the existence of theoretically non-loaded facts, the cumulative development of scientific knowledge, approximation to the unchanging absolute truth. Due to the fact that science has ceased to be perceived as a universal cognitive methodology, which has allegedly become the result of the natural evolution of mind, the question of the factors that ensured its dominant position in modern society becomes especially acute. The article focuses on the socio-institutional dimension of the assertion of the scientific worldview, in which the organizational forms of science - academies of sciences and universities - that have made scientific ontology a general cultural worldview a priori, are especially prominent. As a result of the analysis, the article summarizes that the victory of modern era science is an ontological revolution that took place on the basis of the consolidation of a new worldview in the minds of Europeans, which was implemented by "sociological" methods (through the formation of social institutions, endowing them with resources and influence, reorientation to their interests of the energy of educational programs and institutions, the formation of the army and the hierarchy of functionaries, etc.). It was this social process, and not practical achievements (which came in the masses a hundred years after the establishment of science as a new cultural dominant), that created a new cultural field, in which science reigned in the place of church, and its verdicts and discoveries were expected as before people expected for mass and miracle.

M3  - Editorial Material
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Climate change presents a challenge at multiple levels: It challenges our cognitive abilities because the effect of the accumulation of emissions is difficult to understand. Climate change also challenges many people's world-view because any climate mitigation regime will have economic and political implications that are incompatible with libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets. These political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful.

AB  - Taking Antu, Dehui and the Tongyu city of Jilin Province as the typical county unit as research objects, using the data of Landsat8 remote sensing image and official survey map in 2018, the research extracted the scope of environmental constrain factors and agricultural land uses, as well as the geographical information of rural residents by human-computer interaction interpretation method. Then the spatial distribution pattern of rural settlement of Jilin province would be analysed respectively from morphological structure, environmental constrain and agricultural production perspectives with the help of GIS spatial analysis method. It is found that: the rural settlement was in radiating spatial distribution pattern along Ha-Chang urbanisation development belt in northeastern China on the whole and its density of Central > East > West of Jilin Province. And its spatial distribution pattern is obviously affected by radiation effect from road system and aggregation effect of orchards land.

TI  - Effects of Forest Canopy Structure on Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing-based forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is important for accurate understanding of carbon accounting and climate change at a large scale. However, over- and underestimation are common in the process, resulting in inaccurate AGB estimations. Here, the AGB was estimated and mapped by combining Landsat 8 images and forest inventory data in western Hunan Province, China. We used forest canopy density (FCD) mapper to quantify the forest canopy structure. The linear model (LR) and piecewise model with FCD gradients (classified by k-means clustering; sparse, medium, and dense) were developed to estimate AGB for each forest type (coniferous, broadleaf, mixed, and total forests). The piecewise model considered the following scenarios: piecewise model using the variables of LR model (PM), and piecewise model using the variables selected for different FCD gradients (PMV). The PM (R-2:0.45-0.56) and PMV (R-2:0.63-0.75) models showed better agreement between observed and predicted AGB than the LR (R-2:0.18-0.27) models, and the PMV model was the most accurate for each forest type. The PM and PMV models performed better than LR models at different FCD gradients. The PM and PMV models can better alleviate the over- and underestimations of the LR models. At different FCD gradients, the PMV models had different variables, indicating that the correlation between the AGB and spectral variables was different. Overall, FCD is an important forest parameter that influences AGB estimation, and the piecewise model has potential to improve remote sensing-based AGB estimation.

TI  - Hierarchical Self-Attention Embedded Neural Network With Dense Connection for Remote-Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote-sensing imagery strives to assign a pixel-wise semantic label. Since encoder-decoder networks have demonstrated tremendous success in natural image semantic segmentation, the adoption and extension of this kind of method are transferring such superior performance for the problems in remote-sensing. Facing the high-altitude angle of imaging and complex and diverse ground objects of remote-sensing data, it is necessary to strengthen the features' distinguishability by enhancing the network's capability. Nevertheless, the existing methods suffer from the structural stereotype, leveraging the short-range and long-range contextual information insufficiently. Attempting to address the problems mentioned above, a hierarchical self-attention embedded neural network with dense connection for remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HSDCN) is proposed. In the encoder stage, multiple self-attention modules (SAM) are embedded to model pixel-wise and channel-wise relationships at various scales hierarchically, making the representations more refined and discriminative. Then the dense connections are used to fuse the heterogeneous features. Thus, the network could produce logical and reasonable clues for labeling pixels. The extensive experiments are conducted on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam benchmarks. And the results reveal significant improvements in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Index-Based Methods for Impervious Surface Mapping Using Multiseasonal Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have shown that Sentinel-2 images have advantages over Landsat images in impervious surface area (ISA) extraction. The performance of index-based methods can be affected by different binary methods and subject to seasonal variation. This study marks the first attempt to assess the performance of different spectral indices for ISA extraction using multiseasonal Sentinel-2 images. Specifically, five indices (i.e., the biophysical composition index calculated using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method, biophysical composition index calculated using a principal component-based Procrustes analysis, Normalized Built-up Area Index (NBAI), combinational build-up index, and perpendicular impervious surface index (PISI)) and three impervious surface binary methods (i.e., Otsu's method, manual method, and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) classification method) were tested on multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images in the main urban area of Wuhan, China. Results showed that PISI combined with the ISODATA classification method achieved the highest accuracy with 92.64% OA, and 0.8410 Kappa coefficient, and NBAI combined with Otsu's method achieved the lowest accuracy with 35.37% OA, and 0.013 Kappa coefficient. Regarding the seasonal sensitivity, PISI is relatively more stable than the other methods. The superior performance of PISI is largely due to its capability in separating ISA from soil and vegetation. In addition, summer is the best season to map ISA from Sentinel-2 images when the impervious surface is generally less confused with bare soil. This study serves as a reference for the selection of spectral indices for ISA extraction from Sentinel-2 images in relation to binary methods and seasonal effects.

T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is a Chinese mega-science project, the first light of which was achieved on September 19th, 2016. The mid-1990s witnessed the birth of the FAST concept, March of 2011 the commencement of construction, 2019 the shared-risk open programs, and 2020 the final project review, first batch of major surveys and the starting of normal operation. Throughout the more than two decades' "long march", there has never been a lack of constant struggle and challenges, brought about by the fast-moving frontiers of radio technology and radio astronomy. This is a brief summary of our innovations in response, including a low-cost ultra-wideband commissioning receiver, a highly configurable digital spectrometer, a container-based data center, a fast radio burst (FRB) backend, etc.During the early science phase, we developed the world's first commensal observing mode in this band, capable of recording pulsar, Galactic HI, extra-galactic HI, and transient data streams, simultaneously. The thus based Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS) was approved as one of the five major surveys by the science committee and has produced the first batch of FAST's science results, including new pulsars, new FRBs, the first paper on systematic timing of FAST new pulsars, etc. Before CRAFTS, there is no major survey that accomplished simultaneously searching for pulsars and imaging HI. CRAFTS helps improve the survey efficiency of FAST by more than three folds. In addition to surveys, FAST has started more than 100 PI-led programs, selected by open competitions through the "shared-risk" and the first open call for proposals. Many proposals focused on new frontiers, such as FRBs and exoplanets. FAST joined the campaign to monitor the only Galactic FRB source J1935+2154 and provided the most stringent constraint on its radio flux, which is crucial to understand the origin of FRBs. This result along with the discovery papers has been cited as one of the major scientific achievements world-wide in 2020.The cost per unit effective collecting area of FAST is only 1/4 that of the Greenbank Telescope (GBT) or the Square Kilometer Array-phase 1 (SKA1). The success of FAST demonstrates that a giant filled-aperture antenna can still be the most cost-effective route toward the best absolute sensitivity. In light of the main stream of radio astronomy development toward powerful arrays, however, FAST will have to continue exploiting its upgradability, which is another major advantage of a giant single dish over interferometers. For an interferometer of n element, any major upgrade will incur cost of similar to n sets of electronics and of similar to n(2) computational costs. For FAST, a cooled PAF is its clear land-mark goal, which will help utilize its relatively flat and spacious focal plane to achieve even better survey efficiency and quality.Human's worldview and cosmos-view have been entirely shaped by what we can observe. The ultimate goal of FAST is to deepen mankind's understanding of nature through worldview-altering discoveries. On December 1st, 2020 local time, the great Arecibo telescope, after occupying the world's apex of radio sensitivity for more than half a century, collapsed. The FAST was inspired by the audacity of Arecibo and encouraged by its achievements. As envisioned by Dr. Nan, Rendong, "FAST represents the collective ambition of Chinese astronomers to leap from chasing to leading." It starts now.

TI  - Combing GOME-2B and OMI Satellite Data to Estimate Near-Surface NO<sub>2</sub> of Mainland China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface NO2 (NS-NO2) is closely related to human health and the atmospheric environment. While top-down approaches have been widely applied to estimate NS-NO2 using satellite-based NO2 column measurements, there still exist significant defects, resulting in a low overall fit and significant amount of bias. This article combines GOME-2B and OMI satellite data to estimate daily NS-NO2 with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees from 2014 to 2018 over Mainland China, using a machine learning method. The estimated result has four important characteristics. First, the sample-based cross validation with surface observations shows a good result with R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 9.0 mu g/m(3). Second, the underestimation in high concentration areas and overestimation in low concentration areas are both reduced, compared with the case of using OMI data alone. Third, the estimated NS-NO2 is consistent with surface observations in spatial distribution, and successfully represent both inter-annual changes and seasonal characteristics. Furthermore, the population-weighted NO2-based estimated dataset shows a significant decline of pollution exposure levels from 2014 to 2018.

TI  - Estimating Artificial Impervious Surface Percentage in Asia by Fusing Multi-Temporal MODIS and VIIRS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces have important effects on the natural environment, including promoting hydrological run-off and impeding evapotranspiration, as well as increasing the urban heat island effect. Obtaining accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution and dynamics of urban surfaces is, thus, of paramount importance for socio-economic analysis, urban planning, and environmental modeling and management. Previous studies have indicated that the fusion of multi-source remotely sensed imagery can increase the accuracy of prediction for impervious surface information across large areas. However, the majority of them are limited to the use of specific data sources to construct a few features with which it can be challenging to characterize adequately the variation in impervious surfaces over large areas. Thus, impervious surface maps are often presented with high uncertainty. In response to this problem, we proposed the use of multi-temporal MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data to construct a more general and robust feature set for large-area artificial impervious surface percentage (AISP) prediction. Three fusion methods were proposed for application to multi-temporal MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09A1) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) data to construct three different types of features: spectral features, index features (band calculations), and fusion features. These features were then used as variables in a random-forest-based AISP prediction model. The model was fitted to China and then applied to predict AISP across Asia. Fifteen typical cities from different regions of Asia were selected to assess the accuracy of the prediction model. The use of multi-temporal MODIS and VIIRS DNB data was found to significantly increase the accuracy of prediction for large-area AISP. The feature set constructed in this research was demonstrated to be suitable for large-area AISP prediction, and the random forest model based on optimization of the selected features achieved the highest accuracy, amongst benchmarks, with testing R-2 of 0.690, and testing RMSE of 0.044 in 2018, respectively. In addition, to further test the performance of the proposed method, three existing impervious products (GAIA, HBASE, and NUACI) were used to compare quantitatively. The results showed that the predicted AISP achieved superior performance in comparison with others in some areas (e.g., arid areas and cloudy areas).

TI  - A Two-Phase Clustering Approach for Urban Hotspot Detection With Spatiotemporal and Network Constraints
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban hotspots are regions with intensive passenger flow, sound infrastructure, and thriving business during a certain period of time, which mirror the travel behavior of residents. Taxi trajectory is one of the important data sources for urban hotspot detection. Unfortunately, it should be pointed out that quite a few of the relevant studies have ignored the temporal dynamics or network-constrained characteristics of urban hotspots, making the detecting results less reasonable and reliable. In this study, a two-phase clustering approach is proposed to detect urban hotspot with taxi trajectory. Concretely, in the first phase, spatiotemporal hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise is utilized to cluster the trajectory points with spatial and temporal attributes, which is essential for understanding the evolution of urban hotspots over time. In the second phase, the idea of region growing is introduced to further filter noise, in which the spatial similarity between data points is measured by the route distance, considering that the trajectory data are constrained by the road network. A case study is carried out by the proposed method. Meanwhile, in combination with the Luojia1-01 night-time light remote sensing data and POI data, the reliability of the clustering results is verified and the semantic meaning of the discovered clusters is enriched. Furthermore, not only the spatiotemporal distribution but also the trip lengths and directions of the detected hotspots are explored. These findings can serve as a scientific basis for policymakers in traffic control, public facilities planning, as well as location-based service.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of the Three-Dimensional Features of Crevasses in the Amery Ice Shelf Based on ICESat-2 ATL06 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crevasse is an important characteristic of ice shelf internal structure, and also an important index to measure the stability of ice shelf. This study aims to detect crevasses from ICESat-2 data and obtain three-dimensional features of the crevasse. First, the change of along-track surface slope and the depth threshold is combined to obtain the crevasse bottom points and the crevasse edge points. Second, the distance between the crevasse bottom points and the fitted ice shelf surface by crevasse edge points is used as the crevasse bottom points depth. Third, the crevasse direction is judged by the strong and weak laser positions and the width is calculated by the crevasse edge points and crevasse direction. The Amery ice shelf (AIS) is chosen as the test area to validate the method by ATL06 data, combined with the Landsat-8 optical image. The depth of the crevasses in the AIS is about ranges from 2.0 to 60.0 m, and the width is mainly 400 to 1600 m, and the width and length of the L3 rift have dramatically changed, which is an indicator that the AIS is in a new calving cycle. The method in this article can accurately obtain three-dimensional information of the crevasses, find crevasses with abnormal changes in depth and width, and provide effective help for predicting the calving of the ice shelf.

TI  - Reconstructing Sound Speed Profile From Remote Sensing Data: Nonlinear Inversion Based on Self-Organizing Map
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - By establishing a linear regression relationship between the projection coefficient of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of the sound speed profile (SSP) and remote sensing parameters of the sea surface, the single empirical orthogonal function regression (sEOF-r) method was used to reconstruct the underwater SSP from satellite remote sensing data. However, because the ocean is a complex dynamical system, the parameters of the surface and the subsurface did not conform to the linear regression model in strict sense. This paper proposes a self-organizing map (SOM)-based nonlinear inversion method that used satellite observations to obtain anomalies in data on the sea surface temperature and height, and combined them with the EOF coefficient from an Argo buoy to train and generate a map. The SSP was then reconstructed by obtaining the best matching neuron. The results of SSP reconstruction in the northern part of the South China Sea showed that the relationship between the parameters of the sea surface and the subsurface could be adequately expressed by the nonlinear neuronal topology. The SOM algorithm generated a smaller inversion error than linear inversion and had better robustness. It improved the average accuracy of reconstruction by 0.88 m/s and reduced the mean-squared reconstruction error to less than 1.19 m/s. It thus offered significant promise for acoustic applications.

AB  - 6s(Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) radiative transfer model is one of the atmospheric correction algorithms based on the atmospheric radiative transmission model. It is widely used because of its high correction accuracy. Meanwhile, it is criticized for the complexity of the parameters and the efficiency of the correction process. 6S model needs to establish a look-up table based on the geometric conditions and aerosol conditions which directly determines the accuracy of the atmospheric correction. This paper analyzes the limitations of traditional look-up table method and uses artificial intelligence algorithms such as the support vector regression(SVR) algorithm and the back propagation (BP) algorithm to instead the traditional look-up table method. The experiments' results show that the output value and predictive value fit well. Both are better than the traditional linear interpolation performance results, and the BP algorithms performs better, which verifies the feasibility of BP neural network algorithms prediction model instead of linear interpolation method for table lookup. Finally, this paper takes Landsat-8 data as an example, uses the method proposed in this article to perform atmospheric correction, and compares the FLAASH model correction results. The visual performance results of the two are roughly the same.

AB  - Hyperspectral imaging technology can provide multiple narrow bands for each pixel by using narrow spectral interval imaging in visible and short wave infrared bands, which makes accurate quantitative analysis and detail extraction of ground objects possible. Compared with other machine learning models, deep learning has strong learning ability in feature selection and feature extraction. Based on the remote sensing data sets of IP and SA, this paper uses the hybridsn model to compare the classification performance of different loss functions. The experimental results show that the cross entropy loss function makes the model show good classification performance.

TI  - Automatic mapping of national surface water with OpenStreetMap and Sentinel-2 MSI data using deep learning [Research Data]
T2  - heiDATA Dataverse Network
M3  - Data study
AB  - Large-scale mapping activities can benefit from the vastly increasing availability of earth observation (EO) data, especially when combined with volunteered geographical information (VGI) using machine learning (ML). High-resolution maps of inland surface water bodies are important for water supply and natural disaster mitigation as well as for monitoring, managing, and preserving landscapes and ecosystems. In this paper, we propose an automatic surface water mapping workflow by training a deep residual neural network (ResNet) based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data, where the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) superpixel algorithm was employed for generating object-based training samples. As a case study, we produced an open surface water layer for Germany using a national ResNet model at a 10m spatial resolution, which was then harmonized with OSM data for final surface water products. Moreover, we evaluated the mapping accuracy of our open water products via conducting expert validation campaigns and comparing to existing water products, namely the WasserBLIcK and Global Surface Water Layer (GSWL). Using 4,600 validation samples in Germany, the proposed model (ResNet+SNIC) achieved an overall accuracy of 86.32% and competitive detection rates over the WasserBLIcK (87.47%) and GSWL (98.61%). This study provides comprehensive insights into how to best explore the synergy of VGI and ML of EO data in a large-scale surface water mapping task.

CL  - Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image registration using the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC) is a challenging task due to HOPC lacks rotation and scale invariance. In this paper, a modified HOPC algorithm is proposed to address the aforementioned problems. Firstly, the brief review on HOPC and its limitations are introduced. Secondly, the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is used to rotate image for handle the rotation invariance. Subsequently, multi-scale phase congruency features are extracted in phase congruency scale space, and original HOPC is used to match features. Finally, we use random sample consensus (RANSAC) to filter all the matches to obtain correct matches. In this paper, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A data are used as experimental data. We utilize different assessment paraments to evaluate the performance of the modified HOPC algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-art algorithms in terms of registration accuracy.

TI  - Identifying Cotton Fields from Remote Sensing Images Using Multiple Deep Learning Networks
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imageries processed through empirical and deterministic approaches help predict multiple agronomic traits throughout the growing season. Accurate identification of cotton crop from remotely sensed imageries is a significant task in precision agriculture. This study aims to utilize a deep learning-based framework for cotton crop field identification with Gaofen-1 (GF-1) high-resolution (16 m) imageries in Wei-Ku region, China. An optimized model for the pixel-wise multidimensional densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) was used. Four widely-used classic convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including ResNet, VGG, SegNet, and DeepLab v3+, were also used for accuracy assessment. The results infer that DenseNet can identify cotton crop features within a relatively shorter time about 5 h for training convergence. The model performance was examined by multiple indicators (P, F1, R, and mIou) produced through the confusion matrix, and the derived cotton fields were then visualized. The DenseNet model has illustrated considerable improvements in comparison with the preceding mainstream models. The results showed that the retrieval precision was 0.948, F1 score was 0.953, and mIou was 0.911. Furthermore, its performance is relatively better in discriminating cotton crop fields' fine structures when clouds, mountain shadows, and urban built up.

AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology and the differences in remote sensing image classification, it is particularly important to be able to accurately use classification methods to classify images and to compare classification algorithms. In this paper, taking Yangshuo County as the research area, five common supervised classifications, namely support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood classification (MLC), neural network (NN), spectral angle mapping (SAM) and spectral information divergence (SID), are used to classify the land cover of remote sensing image data of GF-2. Landsat8 and its fusion in the same area. The classification results are obtained and compared. Moreover, the overall classification accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient are used to evaluate the performance of the image classification algorithm. The results show that both MLC and SVM perform best on these three data sets. For higher spatial resolution GF-2 and fusion data, the OA and Kappa coefficients of both image data classifiers is 10% higher than those of Landsat8 data with higher spectral resolution.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of ecological cumulative effect in mining area using a pixel-based time series model of ecosystem service value
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Study on the ecological cumulative effect (ECE) in mining area is an effective way to understand the impact of long-term coal mining on the ecological environment. However, the existing quantitative models to evaluate the ECE in mining area focus more on region-wide features, static analysis and multi-temporal comparison with numerical results, but less on the spatial heterogeneity, dynamic changes trajectory and visual mapping of ECE. In order to fill this gap, we have proposed a pixel-based time series model of ecosystem service value (ESV) to quantify the ECE in mining area and reveal its spatial distribution, heterogeneity and dynamic process. The model was constructed from three dimensions, namely space, time and element, which were analyzed from pixel scale, the whole research period and the perspective of ESV respectively. Taking Yanzhou coalfield as the study area, from 1987 to 2016 as the time span, the model was used to analyze the ECE. The study results showed that: 1) it could display the detail about each pixel's spatio-temporal change of ESV credibly by dynamic equivalent factor method based on time-series remote sensing (RS), with equivalent factor rectified by remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) pixel by pixel. 2) The pixel-based time series model of ESV showed a good performance in reflecting the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of ECE, revealing the direction and extent of accumulation, and achieving the dynamic evaluation of ECE in the time dimension. 3) The change of ecosystem service value cumulant (COESVC) in Yanzhou coalfield decreased by 644.49 million RMB, showing obviously negative ECE. The areas with negative ECE were mainly distributed outside the area above mining faces, while that with positive ECE mostly appeared in waterlogged areas, especially those within the area above mining faces. The evaluation result of ECE could be used in decision-making for improving ecological quality and developing coal mining strategies. This paper may also offer an idea and method for dynamic and quantitative evaluation of the ECE in mining and similar area by time-series Landsat-based RS.

To some degree, AOD shows areal air pollution level and possesses obvious spatio-temporal characteristics. However, long-time sequences and detailed AOD information can not be provided due to currently limited monitoring technology. In this paper, a daily AOD product, MODIS-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), is deployed to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from 2000 to 2019. In addition, the importance of influencing factors for AOD is calculated through Random Forest (RF) Model and the propagation trajectories of pollutants are simulated through Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model. Spatio distribution of AOD presents a tendency that AOD value in northern Xinjiang is low while the value in southern Xinjiang is high. Regions with high AOD values are mainly concentrated in Tarim Basin. AOD in southern Xinjiang is the highest, followed by that in eastern Xinjiang and AOD value in northern Xinjiang is the lowest. Seasonal variation of AOD is significant: Spring (0.309) > summer (0.200) > autumn (0.161) > winter (0.158). Average AOD value in Xinjiang is 0.196. AOD appears wavy from 2000 to 2014 with its low inflection point (0.157) appearing in 2005, and then increases, reaching its peak in 2014 (0.223). The obvious downward tendency after 2014 shows that the use of coal to natural gas (NG) conversion project improves the conditions of local environment. According to RF Model, NG contributes most to AOD. HYSPLIT Model reveals that aerosol in southern Xinjiang is related to the short-distant carriage of dust aerosol from the Taklimakan Desert. Aerosol there can affect Inner Mongolia through long-distant transport. Blocked by the Tianshan Mountains, fine dust particles can not cross the Tianshan Mountains to become a factor contributing to AOD in northern Xinjiang.

TI  - An Adversarial Generative Network for Crop Classification from Remote Sensing Timeseries Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing demand for the monitoring of crop conditions and food production, it is a challenging and meaningful task to identify crops from remote sensing images. The state-of the-art crop classification models are mostly built on supervised classification models such as support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long- and short-term memory neural networks (LSTM). Meanwhile, as an unsupervised generative model, the adversarial generative network (GAN) is rarely used to complete classification tasks for agricultural applications. In this work, we propose a new method that combines GAN, CNN, and LSTM models to classify crops of corn and soybeans from remote sensing time-series images, in which GAN's discriminator was used as the final classifier. The method is feasible on the condition that the training samples are small, and it fully takes advantage of spectral, spatial, and phenology features of crops from satellite data. The classification experiments were conducted on crops of corn, soybeans, and others. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparisons with models of SVM, SegNet, CNN, LSTM, and different combinations were also conducted. The results show that our method achieved the best classification results, with the Kappa coefficient of 0.7933 and overall accuracy of 0.86. Experiments in other study areas also demonstrate the extensibility of the proposed method.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Thin Cloud Removal Fusing Vegetation Red Edge and Short Wave Infrared Spectral Information for Sentinel-2A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin clouds seriously affect the availability of optical remote sensing images, especially in visible bands. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands are less influenced by thin clouds, but usually have lower spatial resolution than visible (Vis) bands in high spatial resolution remote sensing images (e.g., in Sentinel-2A/B, CBERS04, ZY-1 02D and HJ-1B satellites). Most cloud removal methods do not take advantage of the spectral information available in SWIR bands, which are less affected by clouds, to restore the background information tainted by thin clouds in Vis bands. In this paper, we propose CR-MSS, a novel deep learning-based thin cloud removal method that takes the SWIR and vegetation red edge (VRE) bands as inputs in addition to visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) bands, in order to improve cloud removal in Sentinel-2 visible bands. Contrary to some traditional and deep learning-based cloud removal methods, which use manually designed rescaling algorithm to handle bands at different resolutions, CR-MSS uses convolutional layers to automatically process bands at different resolution. CR-MSS has two input/output branches that are designed to process Vis/NIR and VRE/SWIR, respectively. Firstly, Vis/NIR cloudy bands are down-sampled by a convolutional layer to low spatial resolution features, which are then concatenated with the corresponding features extracted from VRE/SWIR bands. Secondly, the concatenated features are put into a fusion tunnel to down-sample and fuse the spectral information from Vis/NIR and VRE/SWIR bands. Third, a decomposition tunnel is designed to up-sample and decompose the fused features. Finally, a transpose convolutional layer is used to up-sample the feature maps to the resolution of input Vis/NIR bands. CR-MSS was trained on 28 real Sentinel-2A image pairs over the globe, and tested separately on eight real cloud image pairs and eight simulated cloud image pairs. The average SSIM values (Structural Similarity Index Measurement) for CR-MSS results on Vis/NIR bands over all testing images were 0.69, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively, which was on average 1.74% higher than the best baseline method. The visual results on real Sentinel-2 images demonstrate that CR-MSS can produce more realistic cloud and cloud shadow removal results than baseline methods.

TI  - Evaluation of Four New Land Surface Temperature (LST) Products in the US Corn Belt: ECOSTRESS, GOES-R, Landsat, and Sentinel-3
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asa critical indicator of crop water stress, land surface temperature (LST) has been widely used in agricultural applications for monitoring and quantifying crop stress and crop water use. Given the availability of several newly operational satellite LST products in recent years and an increasing demand for reliable LST for agricultural applications, a systematic and thorough study of evaluation of different satellite LST products for croplands is highly needed. This article, thus, evaluated both the new satellite LST products including ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer on the International Space Station (ECOSTRESS), GOES-R, Landsat Provisional and Sentinel-3, and several mainstream LST products including MODIS Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity product (MOD11A1 and MYD11A1), MODIS/Aqua Land Surface Temperature/3-Band Emissivity product (MYD21A1), and VIIRS/NPP Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity LST (VNP21A1), for agricultural landscapes in the U.S. Corn Belt. The evaluation was benchmarked on in situ measurements from 11 SURFRAD or eddy covariance sites in the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. Results showed that the nighttime and daytime biases of all LST products on different sites were generally within +/- 2 degrees C and +/- 3 degrees C, respectively. Regarding the daytime LST, the highest agreement with ground observations was achieved by ECOSTRESS with an overall absolute bias <0.9 degrees C and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) < 2.3 degrees C. MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 products slightly underestimated daytime LST with an overall absolute bias < 0.9 degrees C and RMSE < 2.9 degrees C. MYD21A1, Landsat Provisional LST, GOES-R, VNP21A1 and Sentinel-3 LST achieved an overall absolute bias < 2 degrees C and RMSE < 3.6 degrees C in terms of daytime LST. Regarding nighttime LST, all LST products reached a low overall absolute bias < 0.5 degrees C and RMSE < 1.7 degrees C except ECOSTRESS and MOD11A1 (absolute bias < 1.9 degrees C and RMSE < 3.4 degrees C). We observed that only ECOSTRESS, MOD11A1, and MYD11A1 achieved the daytime absolute bias < 1 degrees C. The significant discrepancies between the accuracies of nighttime and daytime LST products indicate that the algorithms of satellite LST products need further improvement under spatial thermal heterogeneous conditions. We further investigated the temporal resolution of cloud-free LST data for the study region, and we found that the cloud-free LST data availability follows the order GOES-R (9.32/day) > MYD11A1 approximate MOD11A1 (0.37/day) > Sentinel-3 (0.26/day) > Landsat Provisional (0.12/day) > ECOSTRESS (0.07/day). Holistically considering factors of bias, RMSE, spatial resolution and cloud-free data availability of different LST products, MOD11A1, and MYD11A1 are relatively appropriate for agriculture-related applications.

TI  - Attention Mechanism Cloud Detection With Modified FCN for Infrared Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation (SS) has been widely applied for cloud detection (CD) in remote sensing images (RSIs) with high spatial and spectral resolution because of its effective pixel-level feature extraction structure. However, the typical model of lightweight SS, namely the fully convolutional network (FCN) with only seven layers, has difficulty in extracting high-level features, and the heavy pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) with complicated calculations is not practical in real-time CD, let alone on-orbit CD. So, in view of the problems above, we propose a compact attention mechanism cloud detection network (AM-CDN) based on the modified FCN to refine and fuse the multi-scale features for on-orbit CD. Specifically, taking the FCN as the baseline, our model increases the numbers of hidden layers and adds the residual connections between the input and output to eliminate the network degradation and extract the advanced context feature maps effectively. To expand the receptive field without losing the spatial information, the ordinary convolutions in FCN are replaced by the dilated convolution in AM-CDN. And inspired by the selective kernels of human vision, we introduce the convolutional attention mechanism (AM) into the encoder to adaptively adjust the receptive field to highlight the key texture features. According to experimental results using Landsat-8 infrared RSIs, the accuracy of the proposed CD method is 95.31%, which is 10.17% higher than that of FCN. And the calculation complexity of AM-CDN is only 7.63% of that of PSPNet.

TI  - Assessment of the temporal-spatial evolution of subsidence and its driving mechanism in the Beijing Plain (China) by using SAR interferometry and geological data
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the four types of SAR images from Envisat, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X between 2007 and 2019, a linear time-series analysis of Coherence Targets method is employed to acquire the 13-year deformation velocity and cumulative deformation maps of the Beijing Plain. Such measurement firstly provides the annual subsidence rate and spatial evolution characteristics of the subsidence areas and the maximum subsidence rates in Laiguangying-Ciqu, which is the largest subsidence area of the Beijing Plain, were beyond 14 cm/year from 2009 to 2018. We correlate the observed subsidence with land use, Quaternary strata and pre-existing faults to assess the driving mechanisms of land subsidence. We find that large-scale land subsidence or patchy subsidence in the Beijing Plain takes on a similar variation to dry land and rural settlements/manufacturing enterprise land use. We also observe that the subsiding areas are mainly distributed in the edge of Alluvial-Proluval Fan or in the lacustrine or swampy sediments among Alluvial-Proluval Fans with much thicker compressible deposits, and the high subsidence gradients orientate along active faults. Therefore, this research could contribute to propose effective control measures for subsidence and ground fissure and achieve better hazard mitigation programme in Beijing.

AB  - Land cover types provide primary data for various applications and are important input parameters for ecosystem service models; however, achieving accurate acquisition of land cover types is a hot spot and complex area for research at this stage. Although remote sensing technology can make up for the shortcomings of traditional extraction methods of land cover types and is now widely used in land cover type classification studies, there are still significant challenges to inaccurate land cover type acquisition. Therefore, in this study, based on airborne LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 data, by extracting a series of parameters, the random forest algorithm was used to explore the classification results of LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data separately, and the two data were applied synergistically in order to achieve the complementary advantages of multi-source data and thus improve the classification accuracy of land cover types in urban areas. Among the LiDAR single-type parameters, the intensity parameter model has the highest classification accuracy, with an overall classification accuracy of 80.06% and Kappa=0.7370; among the Sentinel-2 single-type parameters, the texture parameter model has the highest classification accuracy, with an overall classification accuracy of 90.34% and Kappa=0.8742; among the dual-type parameter combination models, the intensity and Sentinel-2 models have the highest classification accuracy based on LiDAR The results show that (1) for airborne LiDAR data, the classification result of intensity parameter is better than the classification result of height parameter; (2) for Sentinel-2 data, the classification result of texture information has the best accuracy, followed by the classification result of band information. (2) For Sentinel-2 data, the classification result of texture information has the best accuracy, followed by the classification result of band information, and the classification result of the red-edge vegetation index is better than that of the traditional vegetation index. (3) The synergistic application of LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data can improve the classification accuracy of land cover types, and the synergistic data classification results are better than the classification results of LiDAR and Sentinel-2 single data sources. Therefore, in future research, we should try to apply multiple sources of remote sensing data together in order to achieve data complementarity and thus improve the classification accuracy of land cover types.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method of Water Body Extraction From High Resolution Remote Sensing Images With Multisensors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body extraction from remote sensing images is an important task. Deep learning has become a more popular method for extracting water bodies from remote sensing images. However, these methods are usually aimed at a specific sensor and are not applicable. Thus, we proposed a new network, called the dense-local-feature-compression (DLFC) network aiming at extracting water body from different remote sensing images automatic. In this network, each layer of the network can receive the feature maps of all layers before it by the densely connected module of DenseNet. The concatenate operation on the feature dimension is used when connecting across layers. It can realize the different levels of features reuse. The local-feature-compression module is introduced before concatenate operation. It can obtain the more abstract features further by the convolution operation. Through the DLFC, we can fuse the spatial and spectral information for the remote sensing images that can extract water body from different remote sensing images. Besides, we construct a new water body dataset based on GaoFen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images. The proposed DLFC achieved excellent performance with GF-2, GaoFen-6, Sentinel-2, and ZY-3 remote sensing images. Compared with the traditional water body extraction method and contemporary networks, the DLFC exhibits noticeable improvement. The results indicate that the DLFC can realize water body extraction from multisource remote sensing images automatically and rapidly.

AB  - Soil is an important link in the process of maintaining ecological balance, which is in the central position of connecting the organic and inorganic world in nature. As an important part of soil, mineral composition not only affects its physical and chemical properties, but also plays an important role in the adsorption and migration of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the ecological environment.In this paper, using the ZY-1-02D satellite hyperspectral data, combined with the USGS standard spectral library, analyze the overall spectral shape and local feature positions of soil mineral spectra.The method of combining spectral feature enhancement matching degree and feature parameter information extraction is used to extract typical minerals such as montmorillonite, kaolinite, calcite, dolomite, mica, hematite, and limonite in bare soil and invert its relative content,obtained the spatial distribution status and distribution characteristics of different soil minerals,it can provide theoretical basis for subsequent research on soil classification, soil physical and chemical parameter prediction, and provide technical support for soil fine mapping, utilization and protection of soil and mineral resources.

TI  - Reconstruction and Evaluation of DEMs From Bistatic Tandem-X SAR in Mountainous and Coastal Areas of China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) mission is designed to generate 3-D images of the Earth as the first bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, few quantitative studies of TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) quality validation have been conducted specifically in China. This article presents an iterative method to generate high-resolution TanDEM-X DEMs and assesses the vertical accuracy with high-accuracy GPS observations, 1 arc second global DEMs available [Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3-D-30 m v2.2, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) v3, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) v3.1, NASADEM, and X-band SRTM], and TanDEM-X 90 m DEM. The results demonstrate remarkable elevation quality and consistency in coastal areas with root mean square error of 1.7 m and 90% linear error (LE90) of 0.4 m, whereas 3-4 times weaker accuracies in steep mountainous areas. A positive bias of 1-2 m for an overall LE90 measure exists in the dense vegetation and steep-slope mountainous areas. TanDEM-X DEM-based SAR interferometry deformation uncertainty simulation indicates a low or even negligible topographic error contribution of 2-4 mm in mountainous areas and less than 1 mm in coastal areas. It indicates that the TanDEM-X DEM performs better than other global DEMs overall and shows a better elevation consistence with SRTM C-band DEM in the coastal area. As an excellent source of up-to-date information, the TanDEM-X DEM are expected be an advantage for understanding dynamic land use changes and improving identification and delineation of coastal lands, mountainous landslides, and earthquakes disasters.

TI  - Human impact on suspended particulate matter in the Yellow River Estuary, China: Evidence from remote sensing data fusion using an improved spatiotemporal fusion method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Transport of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in estuarine waters plays an important role in regulating erosion-accretion and biogeochemical processes. In the YellowRiver Estuary (YRE), artificial water and sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) and coastal engineering structures are the 2 typical anthropogenic activities affecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of estuarine SPM. The monitoring of SPM transport affected by such human activities requires SPMmapping at both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. In this study, we presented an improved Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) strategy with consideration of highly dynamic SPM variations in estuarine waters, and generated 30-m hourly SPM concentrations based on Landsat 8 OLI and GOCI datasets. The new strategy produced higher SPMestimation accuracy than the original FSDAF, with the relative percentage difference (RPD) decreasing from29.75% to 5.31% using GOCI-derived hourly SPMas reference. With in situ SPM measurements as reference, the fused SPM concentrations had an RMSE of 12.09 mg/L and an RPD of 27.17%. Investigation of interday SPM variations before, during, and after the WSRS in 2018 revealed that the first WSRS significantly increased the SPM concentration and plume extent; new wetland with an area of 12.56 km(2) was formed due to sediment accretion near the river mouth. The two groins offshore from the coastlines on the north and south sides of YRE exhibited obvious sediment trapping effects in that higher SPMconcentrations on one side of each groinwere found regardless of the turbidity modes and diurnal SPMvariations; the trapping effects were associated with the number of groins and groin length. Intraday variations of SPM were influenced by tidal currents, with plume direction following the ebb and flooding tidal current direction. The inter- and intraday characteristics of the 30-m hourly SPM dynamics facilitate the detailed analysis of the sediment transport associated with human activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Preliminary Research on a Comparison and Evaluation of FY-4A LMI and ADTD Data through a Moving Amplification Matching Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new moving amplification matching algorithm was proposed, and then the temporal and spatial differences and correlation were analysed and evaluated by comparing the FengYun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager (FY-4A LMI) data and the China Meteorological Administration Lightning Detection Network Advanced TOA and Direction (CMA-LDN ADTD) system data of southwest China in July 2018. The results are as follows. Firstly, the new moving amplification matching algorithm could effectively reduce the number of invalid operations and save the operation time in comparison to the conventional ergodic algorithms. Secondly, LMI has less detection efficiency during the daytime, using ADTD as a reference. The lightning number detected by ADTD increased from 5:00 AM UTC (13:00 PM BJT, Beijing Time) and almost lasted for a whole day. Thirdly, the trends of lightning data change of LMI and ADTD were the same as the whole. The average daily lightning matching rate of the LMI in July was 63.23%. The average hourly lightning matching rate of the LMI in July was 75.08%. Lastly, the mean value of the spherical surface distance in the matched array was 35.49 km, and roughly 80% of the matched distance was within 57 km, indicating that the spatial threshold limit was relatively stable. The correlation between LMI lightning radiation intensity and ADTD lighting current intensity was low.

TI  - Optimal Color Composition Method for Generating High-Quality Daily Photographic Time Series From PhenoCam
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology camera (PhenoCam) data and the derived green chromatic coordinate (GCC) time series are commonly used to track seasonal changes in canopy greenness. However, the GCC time series is noisy because color distortion commonly exists in the captured photographs owing to the varying illumination conditions and nonlinear response of the consumer-grade camera to the incoming light. Hence, we proposed an optimal color composition (OCC) method to generate high-quality daily photographic time series by compositing multiple photographs captured in a single day. First, the optimal acquisition time with good illumination conditions and correct exposure settings is determined for each pixel throughout the day based on a comprehensive color index, combining the brightness and saturation. A virtual photograph consisting of the selected digital numbers acquired at the optimal time is then composited for each day. Finally, the daily GCC time series is calculated based on the virtual photographs. By testing the photographs of six forest sites, the proposed method was compared with the commonly used 90th percentile (Per90) filter. The results show that the daily photographs composited using the OCC method were more homogeneous with less shaded areas compared to those selected by the Per90 filter, and the corresponding GCC time series derived from the OCC method is more stable and less influenced by varying atmospheric conditions and solar angles than the Per90 filter. These results indicate that the OCC method can generate high-quality daily photographic time series with the potential to better indicate seasonal color changes in the forest canopy.

TI  - An Adaptive Phase Optimization Algorithm for Distributed Scatterer Phase History Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique based on distributed scatterers (DSs) has been widely applied in high-precision deformation measurements, which compensates for the drawback that the persistent scatterer InSAR technique does not obtain sufficient monitoring points, especially in rural areas. Considering that DS pixels are susceptible to various decorrelation factors, it is necessary to retrieve the optimal phase series by phase optimization algorithms (POAs). However, conventional POAs rely on a sample covariance matrix or complex coherence matrix (CCM) derived by spatially averaging statistically homogeneous pixel neighborhoods, which may blur and destroy phase information, especially in dense fringe areas. To overcome this limitation, an adaptive POA is proposed in this article. The adaptive POA artificially constructs a superior CCM by the filtered interferometric phase, which is derived through spatial adaptive filtering approach fusion of principal phase component estimation and fast nonlocal means filtering, and an accurate coherence matrix determined via coherence estimation bias correction. Moreover, the modified eigen-decomposition-based maximum-likelihood-estimator of the interferometric phase (EMI) with coherence-power-weighting is proposed to further improve the estimation precision and computational efficiency. The estimated CCM is then processed with the modified coherence-power-weighted EMI algorithm, and the optimal phase history is retrieved. The experimental results validated against both simulated and Sentinel-1A data demonstrate the superior optimization performance and robustness of the adaptive POA over traditional POAs.

TI  - Cross-Correlation Stacking for Robust Offset Tracking Using SAR Image Time-Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offset tracking is widely applied for measuring ground surface displacements from remote sensing data. Displacements are determined by the offset where two image templates match best. The match can be evaluated with normalized cross correlation (NCC), in which the height and location of the NCC peak represent the matching quality and the corresponding offset. Attaining robust degrees Met estimations requires an unambiguous tracking of the peak in the NCC noise floor. To improve offset estimations, we propose a cross-correlation stacking method that can significantly suppress the noise floor of NCC. Instead of deriving offsets from each pairwise NCC, we stack a series of consecutive pairwise NCCs and determine the offset after averaging the NCC stack. Thereby, tracking benefits from the redundant information in multiple NCCs and is more robust to noise. We assessed the method by measuring the flow velocity of the Great Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland using image time series collected by the synthetic aperture radar satellites TanDEM-X and Sentinel-1 A. Using relatively small templates of 48 x 48 pixels combined with a stack of seven pairwise NCCs of TanDEM-X images, we obtain velocity fields whose spatial coverage are almost equivalent to the coverage of velocity fields obtained with templates of 96 x 96 pixels applied on a single image pair. Similar improvements in spatial coverage are observed for Sentinel-1 A. The results demonstrate that the stacking method can greatly enhance both the spatial resolution and the coverage of the obtained velocity fields.

TI  - A Multi-Cooperative Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite images with high temporal and high spatial resolution play a critical role in earth science applications. However, it is difficult for a single satellite to obtain such images due to technical and cost constraints. Therefore, spatiotemporal image fusion based on deep learning has received extensive attention in recent years. This article proposes a multicooperative deep convolutional neural network (MCDNet) for spatiotemporal satellite image fusion. This method is a new multinetwork model in which multiple networks work together to reconstruct the predicted image. The multinetwork model consists of a super-resolution network, a difference reconstruction network, and a collaborative training network. First, the super-resolution network uses the combination of a novel multiscale mechanism and dilated convolutions to make full use of the spectral information of the coarse image and upgrade it to a transitional image that matches the fine image. The difference reconstruction network uses structural relevance to complete the reconstruction of the fine difference image. The collaborative training network extracts the hidden information from the fine image and uses the time relevance to restrict the training of the difference reconstruction network. Finally, the fine difference image and the known fine image are combined to complete the image fusion. The new compound loss function can help multinetwork models better complete cooperative training. Through experiments on two datasets and comparison with existing fusion algorithms, the subjective and objective results prove that MCDNet can effectively reconstruct higher-quality prediction images.

TI  - One-Class Remote Sensing Classification From Positive and Unlabeled Background Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One-class classification is a common situation in remote sensing, where researchers aim to extract a single land type from remotely sensed data. Learning a classifier from labeled positive and unlabeled background data, which is the case-control sampling scenario, is efficient for one-class remote sensing classification because labeled negative data are not necessary for model training. In this study, we propose a novel positive and background learning with constraints (PBLC) algorithm to address this one-class classification problem. With user-specified information of maximum probability as the constraint, PBLC infers the posterior probability of positive class directly in one-step model training. We test PBLC on a synthetic dataset and a real aerial photograph to perform different one-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that PBLC can successfully train linear and nonlinear classifiers including generalized linear model, artificial neural network, and convolutional neural network. Probabilistic and binary predictions by PBLC are more similar to the gold-standard positive-negative method, outperforming the two-step positive and background learning algorithm that post-calibrates a naive classifier based on an estimated constant. Hence, the proposed PBLC algorithm has the potential to solve one-class classification problems in the case-control sampling scenario.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of 2-D/3-D Building Morphology on the Land Surface Temperature:A Case Study of Three Megacities in China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect in cities and its driving factors have long been investigated. 3-D buildings are key components of urban structures and have notable effect on the UHI effect. However, due to the incomplete 3-D building information in urban database, only a few studies investigated the impact of 3-D building morphology factors on the land surface temperature (LST). In this study, a total set of 14 2-D and 3-D building morphology factors were selected to investigate the correlation between UHI and building morphology across three megacities in China (Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai) with Landsat-8 LST scenarios in summer and winter of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Both Spearman correlation and partial correlation analysis were applied at block scale after urban functional zone (UFZ) mapping. A number of significant observations were noted based on the multispatial and multitemporal experimental results:1) both 2-D and 3-D building morphology factors influence LST, among them building coverage ratio, building ground area divided by facade area (GA2FA), and sky view factor yield stronger correlations with LST; 2) UFZ mapping scheme and partial correlation method help with controlling the anthropogenic heat release, greenspace, and water bodies coverage variables when targeting at the influence of building morphology factors on LST. This study provides insights for building morphology design in future urban planning and management.

TI  - Remote sensing analysis of tidal flat utilization characteristic of Tianjin Binhai New Area
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the impact of tidal flat utilization on ecological environment and water resources, a remote sensing method is proposed to extract and analyze tidal flat utilization characteristic. The artificial shoreline is firstly identified by manual interpretation and threshold segmentation using Landsat remote sensing images, and then used to locate tidal flat reclamation zone. The area and land use type of this zone are derived too. The temporal and spatial changes of these indexes are used to reveals to the characteristics of tidal flat utilization. Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is selected as an example to demonstrate this method. The results show that the method is not affected by tidal level and can scientifically reflect the characteristic of tidal flat utilization. By 2018, the length of artificial shoreline of TBNA has increased from 146.22 km in 2002 to 315.69 km, with an increase of 115.9%. The accumulative reclamation area has reached 350.76 km(2) and accounting for 15.5% of the TBNA land resources. The newly added construction land area in tidal flat utilization zone is 63.43 km(2), accounting for more than 20% of the new construction land in TBNA. There are 228.05 km(2) unused land in the tidal flat utilization zone, which can provide important land resources for future development whereas in the land area the area is only 3.58 km(2). The utilization started from 2002, and reached its highest speed in the period from 2006 to 2014. The main utilization area is located at Tianjin Port and Nangang Industrial Zone.

AB  - The remote sensing monitoring of ships has important significance in military and civilian fields. The target of remote sensing ship detection is to locate the position of the ship in the remote sensing image and extract its features. For SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data, traditional ship target detection algorithms have been difficult to meet the needs of speed and accuracy. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, target detection technologies represented by deep learning algorithms are great progress has been made in the ship inspection of images, and it is also a research hotspot in this field. The constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm is prone to false alarms for areas such as land, islands, and azimuth blur. The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model has a strong classification ability and can classify targets and non-targets. In this paper, we propose an improved CFAR_CNN model. CFAR is used to detect the candidate ship samples, and the trained CNN model classifies the candidate ship samples, retains the ship targets, and removes the non-vessel targets. The combination of these two algorithms is the CFAR_CNN algorithm proposed in this article. The CFAR-CNN algorithm for SAR remote sensing images is mainly divided into two stages. The CFAR algorithm is responsible for the first stage of ship detection, and the CNN algorithm is used to remove false alarms generated by the CFAR algorithm. Through the training and testing of the Gaofen-3 satellite data, the CFAR_CNN algorithm has obvious potential compared with the CFAR algorithm alone.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF INFLUENCING FACTORS ON WINTER WHEAT YIELD ESTIMATIONS BASED ON A MULTISOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA FUSION
T2  - APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of crop yields is very important for crop management and food security. Although many methods have been developed based on single remote sensing data sources, advances are still needed to exploit multisource remote sensing data with higher spatial and temporal resolution. More suitable time window selection methods and vegetation indexes, both of which are critical for yield estimations, have not been fully considered. In this article, the Chinese GaoFen-1 Wide Field View (GF-1 WFV) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were fused by the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to generate time-series data with a high spatial resolution. Then, two time window selection methods involving distinguishing or not distinguishing the growth stages during the monitoring period, and three vegetation indexes, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), were intercompared. Furthermore, the yield estimations obtained from two different spatial resolutions of fused data and MODIS data were analyzed. The results indicate that taking the growth stage as the time window unit division basis can allow a better estimation of winter wheat yield; and that WDRVI is more suitable for yield estimations than NDVI or EVI2. This study demonstrates that the spatial resolution has a great influence on yield estimations; further, this study identifies a better time window selection method and vegetation index for improving the accuracy of yield estimations based on a multisource remote sensing data fusion.

AB  - To reduce the environment pollution risk from livestock and poultry breeding (LPB), it was necessary to control regional carrying capacity of livestock and poultry (CCLP).Landsat 8 images in March and July, 2016 was used to extract cultivated land area in Minhou County by using remote sensing (RS) technology. On this basis, CCLP of Minhou County in village scale was estimated by livestock and poultry density, livestock manure nitrogen (phosphorus) load of farmland, and the alarm value of pig manure equivalent load. The results showed that the total cultivated land area in Minhou County was 27665.11 ha and had a relative error of 3.08 % comparing to actual cultivated land area in Minhou County of 26838.00 ha. The results also indicated that the CCLP of Minhou County calculated by 4 index was different. Among them, the livestock and poultry density was the most stringent index, followed by the alarm value of pig manure equivalent load, livestock manure nitrogen load of farmland and livestock manure phosphorus load of farmland. Moreover, the result demonstrated that the maximum and minimum CCLP of Minhou County calculated by 4 indexes was all in Xitou village and Houcun village in Baisha Town. The results could provide a scientific basis for spatial layout of livestock and poultry breeding (LPB) and prevention of environmental pollution might be caused by LPB.

AB  - The Danjiangkou Reservoir is the starting point of the Middle Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The stability of the reservoir is critical to the safety of the surrounding residents. According to statistics, in recent years, with the increase of the Danjiangkou Reservoir's water storage capacity, earthquakes' frequency has gradually increased. It is of considerable significance to discuss the geological mechanism behind the phenomenon. In this paper, a case study of the Songwan area, northwest of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, was introduced. We tried to comprehensively analyze the main factors that caused high earthquake occurrences in the area from remote sensing and aeromagnetic survey data. The Landsat8 multispectral images were used to interpret and analyze the regional faults information. The results showed that the seismic concentration area is located at the intersection of a series of northwest-direction linear faults and a north-east linear fault, showing signs of circular structure around. In addition, aeromagnetic survey data reveals that there are large-scale and gentle magnetic anomalies in the seismic concentration area. It is speculated that the anomaly is caused by the underlying intermediate acid intrusion, which is consistent with the result of remote sensing interpretation. Using optical remote sensing and aeromagnetic survey technology, we analyzed the geological conditions and the causes of frequent earthquakes in the Songwan area from the perspective of regional structure and lithology and provide a valuable reference for the study of seismic mechanisms and safety precautions.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of cultivated land fertility at county scale based on SWCI-NDVI feature space
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - It is objective needs during utilization and management of regional cultivated land resource to use remote sensing to accurately and efficiently retrieve the status of cultivated land fertility at county level and realize the gradation of cultivated land rapidly. In this study, with Dongping County as a case, using Landsat TM satellite imagery and cultivated land fertility evaluation data, the moisture vegetation fertility index (MVFI) was constructed based on surface water capacity index (SWCI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and then the optimal inversion model was optimized to obtain the best inversion model, which was further applied and verified at the county scale. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between MVFI and integrated fertility index (IFI) was -0.753, which could comprehensively reflect the growth of winter wheat, soil moisture and land fertility, and had clear biophysical significance. The best inversion model was the quadratic model, with high inversion accuracy. This model was suitable for the inversion of cultivated land fertility in the county. The spatial distribution and uniformity of the inversion results were similar to the results of soil fertility evaluation. The area differences between the high, medium and low grades were all less than 2.9%. This study provided a remote sensing inversion method of cultivated land fertility based on the feature space theory, which could effectively improve the evaluation efficiency and prediction accuracy of cultivated land fertility at the county scale.

TI  - Extraction of plateau lake water bodies based on an improved FCM algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in plateau body lake water are an important indicator of global ecosystem changes, and a timely and accurate grasp of this change information can provide a scientific reference for the formulation of relevant policies. The traditional fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm takes into account the ambiguity of the classification of the ground object pixels but does not consider the rich spectral information of the neighboring pixels and is very sensitive to the background noise" of the remote sensing image, resulting in low water extraction accuracy. Aiming to compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional FCM algorithm, this paper proposes an improved FCM algorithm. This algorithm replaces the Euclidean distance of the traditional FCM algorithm with a combination of the Mahalanobis distance and spectral angle matching (SAM) to fully take into account the spectral information of neighboring pixels and improve the clustering accuracy. The study selected Sentinel-2 images of the Fuxian Lake and Xingyun Lake basins during normal, wet, and dry periods as the data source. Under the same conditions, the clustering accuracy was compared with the traditional FCM algorithm, improved FCM algorithm, K-means clustering method and iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) clustering method. The experimental results show that the improved FCM algorithm has a higher water extraction accuracy than the traditional FCM algorithm, K-means clustering method and ISODATA clustering method. The kappa coefficient and overall accuracy (OA) of the improved FCM algorithm can be increased by 5.56%-9.45% and 2.66%-5.32%, respectively, and the omission error and commission error can be reduced by 1.72%-4.55% and 12.14%-22.10%, respectively. When the improved FCM algorithm is used, the extraction accuracy is higher for plateau deep lakes than for plateau shallow lakes, and the extraction effect for lakes with poor water environments is more significant than that of other methods. The improved FCM algorithm better maintains the integrity of the water boundary and overcomes the influence of a certain number of mountain shadows and urban building pixels on the clustering results.

TI  - Monitoring Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Rubber Plantation Dynamics Using Time-Series Landsat Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber plantation is an important strategic material related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. Up-to-date and accurate rubber plantation maps are critical for monitoring the area and spatial distribution of rubber plantations and assessing their impacts on society, the economy, and the environment. However, existing optical images are greatly limited by frequent cloud cover, which seriously affects the accuracy of rubber plantation area extraction. To overcome this issue, we used dense Landsat time series stacks based on Google Earth Engine, combined phenological features, and applied random forest algorithms to monitor rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna from 1987 to 2020. The results showed that 1) the phenological characteristics of rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna indicated that the leaf-off period lasts from late December to mid-February of the following year, while the leaf-on of rubber plantations occurred in other months; 2) the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values ranged from 0.82 to 0.96 and 0.76 to 0.95, respectively, showing that the extraction accuracy of rubber plantation information can meet the accuracy requirement; 3) the rubber plantation area in Xishuangbanna increased between 1987 and 2020 from 7.05x10(4) to 47.78x10(4) hm(2). The peak rubber plantation area occurred in 2015 (49.60x10(4) hm(2)) followed by a downward trend; 4) spatially, the rubber plantation is mainly distributed in Jinghong City and Mengla County, while less abundant in Menghai County. Overall, this article is expected to contribute to the rapid and accurate mapping of rubber plantations in large-scale applications and analysis.

AB  - Accurate land information using was the foundation of the modern agriculture. The Sential-2 images were used as data sources in this paper. Firstly, spectral curve analysis of the features in the study area was performed and non-vegetated areas were excluded by using decision tree method. Since the same texture feature in each band had a certain autocorrelation, the principal component analysis method was used to reduce the dimension. In the end, 49 features including original band, vegetated band, texture feature could be achieved, then 3 models with different input which were classified by random forest method could be set up. The result showed that the model which used original band, vegetation index and decreased dimension texture feature had the highest accuracy. The total classification accuracy and Kappa index was 91.03% and 0.81771 respectively. Therefore, some conclusions were figured out: (1) the classification method based on multiple features was helpful to improve the accuracy; ( 2) the time series characteristics of vegetation index could help improve the classification accuracy of non-main crops; (3) decreasing the dimension of texture feature could improve the efficiency and cartographic quality of the classification.

TI  - The Impacts of Impervious Surface on Water Quality in the Urban Agglomerations of Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt From Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Agglomerations of Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (UAMLYREB) have experienced rapid and intense urbanization over the past decades with natural ecosystems being converted to impervious surfaces. Thus, impervious surfaces are recognized as critical parameters when considering the effect of urbanization on water quality. While understanding how the threshold of impervious surfaces affects water quality has been a hot topic, there has been little quantitative analysis on how such thresholds change during rapid urbanization periods across large urban areas. To remedy this deficiency, this article made use of remotely-sensed impervious surface area data and in situ water quality monitoring observations for the period 2000 to 2018 to quantitively derive the temporal variation in the thresholds of the percentage of the impervious surface area (PISA) when inferring the relationship between PISA and a set of water quality indicators for a selection of watersheds within the UAMLYREB. We employed segmented regression model to derive the nonlinear relationship between PISA, the water quality indicators, and the PISA-related thresholds. Our results indicate that PISA may be considered a useful water quality indicator over watershed spatial scales. We also found that the threshold effects differed between water quality indicators (DO, CODMn, NH3-N), where, except for NH3-N, the indicators showed a PISA threshold of 30.08 to 42.34%, with slight variations over the study period. These results imply that maintaining PISA to be around 30% in watershed areas may be sufficient to mitigate against water quality degradation during the urbanization process.

TI  - One Step Ahead: A Framework for Detecting Unexpected Incidents and Predicting the Stock Markets
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unexpected incidents can be destructive or even disastrous, affecting the financial markets. Incidents such as the 9/11 attacks (2001), the Fukushima nuclear disaster (2011), and the COVID-19 outbreaks (2019, 2020) severely shocked both local and global markets. For investors, it is crucial to quantify the key facts that affect the incidents' impacts, and to estimate the reactions of the markets accurately and efficiently for global event-driven investment strategies. Though Web data and other alternative data allow such a possibility, it is still very challenging to mine noisy and often biased heterogeneous data sources, and construct a unified framework for modeling global markets across across time and regions. As a first attempt, we build a framework that extracts incident facts globally based on a deep neural network, feeds them into models built on a global event database complemented with novel socioeconomic datasets (e.g. nightlight data from satellites), and predicts stock market directions in a simulated real-world setting with interpretable results that outperform various baselines. Specifically, we study terrorist attacks in three countries for over 20 years on average, as a first effort to systematically quantify the impact on stock markets at a large scale using novel indicators.

TI  - The Guiding Significance of the Number of Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Frozen Section for Intraoperative Axillary Dissection in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The results of large randomised trials have changed the treatment strategy of axillary lymph nodes. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in some patients with one to two sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) metastasis based on final paraffin section (FPS) results which called into question the need for intraoperative frozen section (FS). This study aims to assess the guiding value of the number of positive SLN detected via FS for intraoperative ALND.Patients and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed data from 3303 patients with breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy between 2015 and 2019. Combined with the FPS results, FS sensitivity, specificity, and false negative rate (FNR) were calculated and the difference in the number of positive SLNs between FS and FPS was analyzed.Results: The overall FNR of FS was 23.21%, which was 76.47% in isolated tumor cells, 62.28% in micrometastasis, and 12.09% in macrometastatic disease. The size of SLN metastasis were significantly associated with a higher FNR (p<0.001). The accuracy rate of the number of positive SLNs detected via FS was 92.62%. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (p<0.03) and Ki67 (p<0.02) were significant factors affecting the accuracy rate.Conclusion: FS is a effective method for SLN biopsy, ALND can be avoided in patients with one or two positive SLNs detected via FS.

TI  - Mapping Surface Deformation Over Tatun Volcano Group, Northern Taiwan Using Multitemporal InSAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tatun Volcano Group (TVG) is located at the northern coast of Taiwan Island with only 15 km to the Taipei metropolis. Recent geothermal and geochemical studies suggest that the TVG is dormant-active rather than extinct, implying the eruption potential to devastate the nearby area of 7 million inhabitants. Although some geodetic tools (e.g., global positioning system and precise leveling) have been utilized to analyze the activity associated with volcanism, it is still challenging for conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to obtain clear ground surface movement at the TVG due to decorrelation and complex atmospheric delay. In this study, we present an improved multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to explore the temporal evolution and spatial extent of displacement at the TVG from 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR images acquired between 2007 and 2011. Stratified atmospheric delays and orbit error are corrected with a patch-based joint model as different phase components can be separated according to their distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. The spatial deformation patterns indicate an uplift of 10 mm/year at the SW-NE ridge and subsidence with a rate of 10 mm/year at the E-W ridge. The temporal deformation variations at Mt. Chihshin and Huangzuei have high similarity with correlation coefficients of 0.9 above. This indicates that the subsidence at Mts. Chihshin and Huangzuei might be caused by released hydrothermal fluids related to tectono-magmatic activity within the hydrothermal system beneath the TVG.

TI  - An Auto-Adjusted Kernel Method for Thermal Sharpening With Local and Object-Based Window Strategies
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal sharpening expands the application of land surface temperature due to the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. Fixed kernels (FK) are widely applied in two window strategies: local window strategies (LWS) and object-based window strategies (OWS). However, the fixed regression kernel effect on LWS and OWS has rarely been considered in existing studies. Due to the heterogeneity among different windows, it is important to select suitable kernels for each window either in OWS or LWS. This article presents an auto-adjusted kernel (AAK) method to resolve this issue and examines certain simple kernel selection rules in thermal sharpening aiming to balance accuracy and efficiency. We test the AAK method with Landsat 8 data and compare it to the FK method with both OWS and LWS. The results reveal that the AAK method generally performs better than the FK method. Compared to the FK method, the AAK method improves the OWS accuracy by 0.283 K on average at three downscaling ratios, and the accuracy improvement increases with increasing downscaling ratio (from 3 to 9). Especially when the downscaling ratio reaches to 9, there is an evident improvement with 0.425 K of AAK. Moreover, the AAK method enhances the mean LWS accuracy by 0.179 K overall and decreases the difference between OWS and LWS. Furthermore, the AAK method increases the accuracy in specific areas and reduces extreme-value points. These findings indicate the potential of the AAK method in thermal sharpening with OWS and LWS, which resolves kernel selection problems.

TI  - Applying Deep Learning to Clear-Sky Radiance Simulation for VIIRS with Community Radiative Transfer Model-Part 1: Develop AI-Based Clear-Sky Mask
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fully connected deep neural network (FCDN) clear-sky mask (CSM) algorithm (FCDN_CSM) was developed to assist the FCDN-based Community Radiative Transfer Model (FCDN_CRTM) to reproduce the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) clear-sky radiances in five thermal emission M (TEB/M) bands. The model design was referenced and enhanced from its earlier version (version 1), and was trained and tested in the global ocean clear-sky domain using six dispersion days' data from 2019 to 2020 as inputs and a modified NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor over Ocean (ACSPO) CSM product as reference labels. The improved FCDN_CSM (version 2) was further enhanced by including daytime data, which was not collected in version 1. The trained model was then employed to predict VIIRS CSM over multiple days in 2020 as an accuracy and stability check. The results were validated against the biases between the sensor observations and CRTM calculations (O-M). The objectives were to (1) enhance FCDN_CSM performance to include daytime analysis, and improve model stability, accuracy, and efficiency; and (2) further understand the model performance based on a combination of the statistics and physical interpretation. According to the analyses of the F-score, the prediction result showed similar to 96% and similar to 97% accuracy for day and night, respectively. The type Cloud was the most accurate, followed by Clear-Sky. The O-M mean biases are comparable to the ACSPO CSM for all bands, both day and night. The standard deviations (STD) were slightly degraded in long wave IRs (M14, M15, and M16), mainly due to contamination by a 3% misclassification of the type Cloud, which may require the model to be further fine-tuned to improve prediction accuracy in the future. However, the consistent O-M means and STDs persist throughout the prediction period, suggesting that FCDN_CSM version 2 is robust and does not have significant overfitting. Given its high F-scores, spatial and long-term stability for both day and night, high efficiency, and acceptable O-M means and STDs, FCDN_CSM version 2 is deemed to be ready for use in the FCDN_CRTM.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant interferon-armed RBD dimer vaccine (V-01) for COVID-19 in healthy adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I trial
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Safe and effective vaccines are still urgently needed to cope with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, we developed a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (V-01) containing fusion protein (IFN-PADRE-RBD-Fc dimer) as antigen verified to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in pre-clinical study, which supported progression to Phase I clinical trials in humans. A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I clinical trial was initiated at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Gaozhou, China) in February 2021. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years and over 60 years were sequentially enrolled and randomly allocated into three subgroups (1:1:1) either to receive the vaccine (10, 25, and 50 mu g) or placebo (V-01: Placebo = 4:1) intramuscularly with a 21-day interval by a sentinel and dose escalation design. The data showed a promising safety profile with approximately 25% vaccine-related overall adverse events (AEs) within 30 days and no grade 3 or worse AEs. Besides, V-01 provoked rapid and strong immune responses, elicited substantially high-titre neutralizing antibodies and anti-RBD IgG peaked at day 35 or 49 after first dose, presented with encouraging immunogenicity at low dose (10 mu g) subgroup and elderly participants, which showed great promise to be used as all-aged (18 and above) vaccine against COVID-19. Taken together, our preliminary findings indicate that V-01 is safe and well tolerated, capable of inducing rapid and strong immune responses, and warrants further testing in Phase II/III clinical trials.

AB  - The mafic and ultramafic rocks of Mettupalayam belong to the southern granulite terrain of India, which is concomitant with vital economic resources. The advantage of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) data for mapping the litho units are exploited well here for differentiating the rock units with the aid of band combination (1, 3, 6), principal component analysis (5, 1, 6) and band ratioed band combination (2/3, 3/2, 1/5 and (9-8)/1, (8-6)/2, and (9-6)/3). As part of the field study, the collection of sam-ples and ground control points were carried out and in addition to that, the generation of laboratory reflectance spectra for samples was achieved. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were performed using ASTER data with the aid of spectra obtained from the laboratory conditions to demarcate the abundance of mafic and ultramafic rocks of the area. The XRF method was used to retrieve the major oxides of the field-collected samples and the spectral absorption characters are validated with it. The results show a vibrant interpretation of the litho units.

TI  - Diagnosis and Management of Melanoma of the Scalp: A Review of the Literature
T2  - CLINICAL COSMETIC AND INVESTIGATIONAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is a public health issue and the head and neck region is of particular interest, despite accounting for only 9.0% of the total body surface, it harbours 20% of melanoma cases. Data from the literature show that scalp melanomas (SM) carry high mortality rates, with a 10-year survival rate of 60% which lead them to be named as the "invisible killer". Moreover, SMs are more common in the elderly than in young population, and they occur six times more frequently in men than in women. This is probably related to the higher incidence of androgenetic alopecia and a higher cumulative and intermittent ultraviolet damage on the scalp. Histologically, SM is a heterogenous group, including lentiginous melanoma (LM), desmoplastic melanoma, superficial spreading and nodular melanoma. Thin melanomas tend to display an atypical network or pseudo-network and regression in dermoscopy. Blue-white veil, irregular pigmented blotches and an unspecific pattern are most commonly detected in thick lesions. On reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), the most frequent pattern is irregular meshwork, but also ringed and disarranged pattern have been described. Differential diagnosis includes benign solar lentigo, actinic keratoses, lichen planus like keratosis, melanocytic nevi and blue nevi. All suspicious lesions should be biopsied; therefore, an excisional biopsy with 2 mm margins is usually the best option. The management of SM is the same as for melanoma on other body sites. However, sentinel node biopsy tends to be more challenging, as well as achieving adequate excision margins of the primary tumor. In this review, we summarize clinical, pathologic, dermoscopic and RCM features of SM, and focus on its epidemiology, risk factors and best management options.

AB  - The article discusses a primal relationship with the sea. On the level of the oldest pagan worldview, this relationship is characterized as a closed nature cycle and a perception of personal worth. The relationship with the sea is special and relevant from a scientific, cultural, and educational point of view. Despite the reverent fear of gods, the pagan worldview and attitudes provided an opportunity to go to sea and experience an ambivalent tension full of conflicting feelings, natural fear, traditional mythological images, tribal obedience, and creative determination. Combining maritime activities with sea-gods provided reasons for a personal self-concept, as well as for natural personal and tribal needs and interests.

AB  - This study aimed to discover the romantic worldview and orientation in the novel The Trap of Destiny in light of the fatalism and humanism of Lee Byung-ju.The novel concerns Nam Sang-doo, a victim and problem solver falsely accused based on the grammar of the mystery genre, who is characterized by his complete intuition and reasoning skills in the absence of obstacles or external conflicts. Nam Sang-doo is presented as a model romantic hero who overcomes his tragic fate through will and extraordinariness, while reproducing a romantic narrative structure of separation from and unification with the world. This confirms that the final destination of the novel is not to find the culprit but to regenerate Nam Sang-doo.In addition, the novel presents various factors that determine fate in addition to human will. At every turning point in the narrative or decisive stage of solving the case, Nam Sang-doo"s fortune, helpers, and chance encounters afford him breakthroughs, showing that romantic leaps and ironies can arise from coincidence, which reflects the writer’s fatalist view that fate is the result of coincidence and necessity acting organically through internal unity. Destiny"s Trap presents a romantic vision of the ultimate unity of the world, incorporating the ambivalent values of fatalism and humanism through trust and support for the evolutionary aspirations of humans who, accepting infinite responsibility, leap forward to their fate.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to design and optimize Wireless Remote Sensing Network (WRSN) system for Precision Agriculture (PA). Optimization for PA is necessary to improve production yield. Friss Transmission Equation is modelled and simulated in MATLAB to determine the relationship of Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) with the range of transmission. Number of sensor node to be deployed over a plantation area is determined in MATLAB so that Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can achieve optimum transmission coverage. Computational algorithms such as Conventional Point-to-Point Transmission (CPTPT) protocol, Shortest Distance Cluster Head Selection (SDCHS) protocol and Power Considerations Cluster Head Selection (PCCHS) protocol are also developed in MATLAB. Performance metrics used to evaluate these algorithms include the average transmission range and number of available connectivity paths. Results showed that PCCHS is the best among the three algorithms since it has the shortest average transmission range and least route for connectivity. Three sensor nodes (SNs) and a Data Acquisition Tower (DAT) are designed and fabricated to collect the soil and crops variability data in the farms. Each SN and DAT forms a wireless sensor node which is able to process data, has independent power source and various sensing capability as well as wireless communication system. Concurrently, real time data logging architecture is implemented at each SN. Data transmission protocol is also developed to increase the transmission efficiency, where cluster head is selected based on residual power. Clustering routing protocol constructs the formation of Centralized Clustering Network System (CCNS) which prolongs the Network Lifetime (NL) by approximately 25%.

TI  - A Review on the Acceptance and Criticism of the Poetry of Qing Dynasty by Bak Jega
TI  - 朴齊家의 淸代 詩文學 受容과 批評에 관한 考察

M3  - research-article
AB  - Bak Jega(朴齊家) was sensitive to Vernacular Sintic novels(白話小說) that were popular in Qing Dynasty at the time, as well as “The theory of divinity”(神韻說) of Wang Shizhen(王士禎), “The theory of spirituality”(性靈說) of Yuan Mei(袁枚), and “The theory of texture”(肌理說) of Weng Fanggang(翁方綱) than any other Bukhak school(北學派) members. This paper is a brief review of Park Jega's acceptance and criticism of Qing Dynasty poetry.	In addition to criticism of indiscriminate acceptance of poetry of Qing Dynasty, he was ordered by King Jeongjo, who thought he would look after him at the time, to post a self-written text(自訟文) on his own, and insisted on establishing his worldview, citing everlasting taste as an example. He exchanged with Li Diaoyuan(李調元)Â·Pan Tingyun(潘庭筠)Â·Peng Yuanrui(彭元瑞)Â·Hong Liangji(洪亮吉)Â·Ji Yun(紀昀)Â·Luo Pin(羅聘)Â·Weng Fanggang(翁方綱) of Qing Dynasty, which were talented in poetry, writing and painting, he sticked to the stance to move away from traditional Sinocentrism and accept their advanced civilization even if they were from the barbarians. Thus, he praised three high sides of Ji Yun in the first few words of "Nanyang Soharok"(灤陽消夏錄), which he recited his novel. In "Mukjuk"(墨竹) of Luo Pin he recited in painting poetry that he painted the figure and the inner spirit together while with “The Ghost Amusement Scroll”(鬼趣圖) he praised the godlike style adhere to likeness.	At that time, a variety of poetics were prevalent in the Qing Dynasty period, including theory of texture of Wang Shizhen, theory of spirituality of Yuan Mei and theory of texture of Weng Fanggang. All of these influenced the poetry literature of Joseon a lot. He was deeply sympathized with the "the soliloquial spirit"(獨抒性靈) and "unrestrainedness"(不拘格套) of Gonganpa(公安派) in the Ming Dynasty which claimed  innocence of childhood theory, and "Seomunjangjeon"(徐文長傳) by Yuan Hongdao(袁宏道) greatly influenced the formation of literature of Bak Jega. In his "Yeongyeong Japjeol"(燕京雜絶) there is a saying that praises the customs of Xu Wei(徐渭) and exemplifies him who has excellent poetry, poetry, and painting. Following Wang's "Sixty songs for a man at the end of the year"(歲暮懷人六十首), he created "Six Ships"(戱倣王漁洋歲暮懷人六十首), saying that phrase of Wang reached the profoundness of the world. Bak Jega was very close to the literary view of Yuan Mei, who claimed the theory of the sprituality, especially in insisting on the truthfulness of poetic sentiments. Weng Fanggang, who argued for the theory of the texture, is also an positivistic style writer who proposed to be practical and realistic.	Although criticism of the previous poetry was mainly based on the foreword(序跋文), Bak Jega, who embraced various poems of the Qing Dynasty, expressed his critical consciousness through his independent and self-contained poetry world, in the form of a thesis, and a non-poetry. This paper identifies the case, and this part of the research needs to be continuously discussed in the future.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The founding myth of Japan is vastly expanded in the body of the Kojiki, thus making it difficult to understand the structure of the story at a glance. In addition, the book uses numerous myths and fictional characters, such as Emperor Jinmu and Empress Jingu, to develop the story. The purposes of creating this book as well as the intentions of those who producers it have yet to be clearly revealed. This ancient book presents many stories and depictions of the state and various other worlds such as Takamanohara(高天原), Ashihara no Nakatsukuni(葦原中国) and Yomi no Kuni(黄泉国, otherwise known as the underworld). The Kojiki presents an endlessly expanded worldview through visits and wars of conquest. Moreover, this book describes the appearance of the Sun God, who plays an active role in the story, and states that the descendants of the God continue to rule as the Emperor, who is the supreme ruler of Japan. This study focuses on the concept of territorial expansion(弘國), an expansionist thought found in the preface of the Kojiki. Moreover, this study examines the presentation of expansionist thought in the body of the text by focusing on the structural relationship between the preface and the body.

T2  - GEOGRAFARES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a physiographic survey of the high courses of watersheds and sub-basins inserted in the Meruoca Massif, located in the Northwest region of the State of Ceara. The geoenvironmental system was addressed by digital processing of satellite images landsat 8 and Spot 5, and fieldwork. The geosystemic model was used, from which it was defined the existence of a geosystem and eleven geofacies, each geofacies representing one of the sub-basins studied. The geosystemic research allowed identifying the existence of different environments to leeward and windward of the massif, in term of soils, forms, vegetation cover and fluvial incision, indicating the wetter windward sector as a result, a fact controlled by orographic rainfall, with more developed soil and vegetation cover and more intense river incision. It was also identified that most of the rivers are of the intermittent type, forming rivers of 1st, 2nd and 3rd orders. The conclusion is that the geosystem is fragile and vulnerable to the uses and occupations that have been suffering, which implies risks of high environmental degradation.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS IN DAM BREAK SIMULATION STUDIES
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams are structures built for controlling the flow of water for many useful purposes such as water supply, power generation, retention of mining and industrial waste, as well as recreation and flood control. However, they bring together some risk of dam body collapse causing damage for the dam downstream areas. Therefore, hypothetical dam break studies which provide mapping of areas potentially attainable in the event of a rupture are especially important for planning actions aiming minimization of associated losses. The aim of this research is to assess the degree of adherence or similarity between flood maps obtained by simulation studies and those effectively obtained from the collapse itself occurred in Dam I owned by Vale SA on January 25, 2019. The study focuses mainly on comparing the effects over the simulated flood maps caused by use of different representation of dam downstream topography relief, namely Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Land Observing Satellite from Alaska Satellite Facility (ALOS_ASF) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) models. The simulations were performed using the HEC-RAS software developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers considering hypothesis of strong influence of relief in flood mapping results. In this way, three simulation tests were carried out for evaluation and discussion. In the first simulation, the digital terrain model derived from ALS was used. The second simulation was carried out associating the digital surface model ALOS_ASF with a spatial resolution of 12.5 m. Finally, the SRTM digital elevation model with 30 m spatial resolution provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was used in third simulation. Results showed better adherence to simulations using data from ALS. This was verified by visual analysis over high resolution orthorectified images and by calculating statistics indicators such as the (F) index. Conclusions pointed out that flood patches resulting from simulation are critical tools for taking actions involving areas and populations to be affected, so the best relief model technologies like ALS data should be used in simulation.

TI  - Identifying Urban Building Function by Integrating Remote Sensing Imagery and POI Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying urban building function plays a critical role in understanding the complexness of urban construction and improving the effectiveness of urban planning. The emergence of user generated contents has brought access to massive semantic information which complements the traditional remote sensing data for identifying urban building functions and exploring the spatial structure in urban environment. This article proposes a stepwise identification framework for urban building functions based on remote sensing imagery and point of interests (POIs) data, which merges the spatial similarity of buildings and kernel density to improve the identification accuracy and completeness. Taking Wuhan as an example, Google earth images and POI data were obtained to identify the seven primary categories for the individual buildings in the core urban area. The results suggest that the proposed stepwise framework is feasible to identify the urban building functions as the identification results exhibit the superiority in terms of accuracy and completeness. Our results suggest that the identification of urban building function is sensitive to the bandwidth of kernel density estimation and 200 meter is the optimal size. The findings also indicate that significant spatial agglomeration exists in residential and commercial buildings at both macro and microlevels.

TI  - Quality of Regional Nodal Irradiation Plans in Breast Cancer Patients Across a Large Network-Can We Translate Results From Randomized Trials Into the Clinic?
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Regional nodal irradiation (RNI) improved disease-free survival by 3% to 5% in 2 large randomized trials, but this small absolute advantage relies on accurate contouring and dose delivery. We audited our network to determine compliance on regional nodal coverage, contouring, and dosimetric parameters with respect to accepted guidelines.Methods and Materials: In our network, we have established a clinical pathway for patients with node-positive breast cancer that guides indications for RNI and dosimetric goals. We reviewed records of 183 patients with nodal macrometastases after upfront surgery or involved nodes of any size after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radiation treatment plans were examined to determine lymph node volumes treated, whether nodes were contoured, quality of nodal contours, and whether target coverage and normal organ dosimetric constraints were met when RNI was delivered.Results: Despite the presence of macrometastases on sentinel lymph node biopsy, no lymph nodes were treated in 2.2% (4 of 183). Of 179 patients who received nodal irradiation, 18 received radiation to axillary levels 1 and 2 only, and 161 patients received RNI. Overall, regional nodes were not treated despite strong indications in 7.6% (14 of 183). Treated nodes were not contoured for 2.2% (4 of 179), and lymph node contours were unacceptable in 15.4% (27 of 175). Of patients receiving RNI, 14.9% (24 of 161) did not have adequate nodal target volume coverage, mean heart dose was >4 Gy for 3.1% (5 of 161), and lung V20 Gy was >35% for 8.7% (14 of 161).Conclusions: Adherence to indications for regional nodal treatment was high, but nodes were either not contoured or had unacceptable contour quality in 18% of plans, and coverage was inadequate in 15%. Because the small disease-free survival advantage seen in trials may be decreased with these deviations, routine clinical practice requires detailed peer review to fully translate results of clinical trials.

TI  - The Diminishing Importance of Fate and Divine Femininity During the High and Late Roman Empire
T2  - TEMENOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Weaving and femininity are historically intimately connected with the concept of Fate. In antiquity Fate was portrayed as a powerful female principle controlling the cosmic system humans inhabited. However, as the antique religious world gave way to a new era, the role of Fate subsided under Christian dominance. This article examines how this change played out, and how the worldview that won prominence as Christianity prevailed gradually lost touch with the presence of powerful female cosmic principles. It shows that the disappearance of Fate from the prevailing world was seminal in the birth of a new 'technology of the self'. In conclusion, the article places the disappearance of Fate in the context of a discussion of how the view of the self changed in the aftermath of Christianity, which had become dominant. This discussion is related to the scholarship of Peter Brown, among others, as well as a newly published posthumous work by Michel Foucault (2018).

T2  - TOPOI-REVISTA DE HISTORIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to show the historical materiality experienced by the Apurina people based on their cosmology. It asks, does the cosmology present in the group's mythical narratives register aspects of the Apurina historicity? The article's hypothesis is that the Apurina worldview, which places Apurina as a "middle people," has its origin in historical immanence, and, as such, has experienced changes over time. Transforming into theological transcendence, this worldview has preserved traces of historicity that may help us to interpret the history of both the Apurina people and the region they live in. The article is based on a specific bibliographic discussion and also uses primary sources and field observations.

T2  - GEORESURSY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that one of the main nowadays problems of subsoil use is the depletion of reserves. Every year many researchers pay attention on mining waste as a source of replenishment of the resource base. Disputes on the prospects of processing technogenic raw materials are relevant. The object of research is the technogenic neoplasms. which were the result of dredging and hydraulic processing of placer gold. The paper presents the results of assessing the prospects and places of application of information technologies. in particular, the analysis of Earth remote sensing data in the design and organization of work to involve technogenic placers in operation. It is shown that these technologies are able to increase the efficiency of work and reduce labor costs at the stage of preliminary study of potential development targets.Possibilities of detailing the infrastructure facilities of the mining and processing complex are considered. It is proposed to use the vegetation index at a non-traditional time for vegetation research in order to isolate coniferous trees on the formed secondary phytocenoses. An area assessment of the technogenic raw materials of the Keiba gold-placer cluster has been carried out. The analysis of the methodological approach based on remote sensing data is carried out. Aspects of natural vegetation restoration in the post-exploitation period are covered. Optimal combinations of raster data channel combinations for the study of the territory within the boundaries of the object under study are proposed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibrosis is the final pathological outcome of chronic intestinal inflammation without specific therapeutic drugs, which leads to ileus and surgical intervention. Intestinal fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The role of mast cells (MCs), which are members of the sentinel immune cell population, is unknown in intestinal fibrosis.METHODS: In this study, we analyzed changes in MCs, tryptase proteins, and ECM components in human fibrotic and control patient intestines. We constructed dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal fibrosis models using wild-type mice, MC-reconstituted mice, and MC-deficient mice to explore the role of MCs and tryptase in intestinal fibrosis. The roles and mechanisms of MCs and tryptase on fibroblasts were evaluated using human MCs (HMC-1 and LAD-2), commercial tryptase proteins, human colon fibroblasts (CCD-18Co fibroblasts), the tryptase inhibitor APC366, and the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) antagonist ENMD-1068.RESULTS: Regardless of whether the colon was a human colon or a mouse colon, the fibrotic intestinal tissue had increased MC infiltration and a higher expression of ECM proteins or genes than that of the control group. The dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal fibrosis in MC-deficient mice was alleviated compared with that in wild-type mice. After MC reconstruction in MC-deficient mice, the alleviating effect disappeared. Tryptase, as a content stored in MC granules, was released into fibrotic intestinal tissues in the form of degranulation, resulting in an increased expression of tryptase. Compared with the control group, the tryptase inhibition group (the APC366 group) had reduced intestinal fibrosis. The CCD-18Co fibroblasts, when cocultured with MCs or treated with tryptase proteins, were activated to differentiate into myofibroblasts and secrete more ECM proteins (such as collagen and fibronectin). The underlying mechanism of fibroblast activation by tryptase was the activation of the PAR-2/Akt/mTOR pathway.CONCLUSIONS: We found that MC tryptase promotes inflammatory bowel disease-induced intestinal fibrosis. The underlying mechanism is that tryptase promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into fibrotic-phenotype myofibroblasts by activating the PAR-2/Akt/ mTOR pathway of fibroblasts.

TI  - Biogeographical trends in phytoplankton community size structure using adaptive sentinel 3-OLCI chlorophyll a and spectral empirical orthogonal functions in the estuarine-shelf waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The active hydrodynamics and complex circulation patterns in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) provide a dynamic scenario to investigate mesoscale responses of the size structure of phytoplankton communities to environmental variability. In this study, a large in-situ dataset acquired in inland, estuarine and coastal waters of the nGoM and U.S. East Coast were utilized to achieve a regional parameterization of the red-NIR ratio-based chlorophyll a (Chl a) algorithm for the high-spatial and spectral resolution Sentinel 3-OLCI ocean color sensor. Using an adaptive scheme, the algorithm was used in combination with other standard Chl a algorithms such as the Neural Network (C2RCC) and OC4ME to optimally extract Chl a in water types ranging from turbid estuarine to clear oceanic waters in the nGoM. This adaptive methodology (Chl a_AD) showed better performance in estimating OLCI-Chl a (R-2=0.84, N = 178) compared to any single algorithm in the estuarine-coastal-ocean waters of the nGoM. Next, OLCI-derived phytoplankton spectral absorption coefficients (OLCI-a(phy)) were obtained for comparison, using a regionally-tuned 3rd order function of OLCI-Chl a based on Multi-regression (MR), and an estuarine-to-ocean adaptive Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA-AD). Finally, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) algorithm was applied to OLCI-aphy to retrieve phytoplankton size fractions (PSFs) for the river dominated nGoM region. Results indicate relatively better performance of MR-EOF in estimating f(micro) (R-2=0.87), f(nano)(R-2=0.76) and f(pico)(R-2=0.64) compared to QAA-AD-EOF. Chl a time-series (Oct 2016 - Jan 2020) obtained in the estuaries and shelf waters of the nGoM revealed seasonality (peak/lows in spring/fall) linked to river discharge, where hydrodynamics and wind driven variability due to storms further influenced the phytoplankton biomass spatiotemporal distribution. Microphytoplankton dominated in estuaries and the nGOM inner shelf waters, including the midshelf region during the spring peak river discharge period. PSF dynamics in the outer shelf is strongly influenced by Loop Current eddies where warm offshore waters contribute to the dominance of the picophytoplankton fraction. Floodwater discharge and strong winds due to Hurricane Barry (2019) transported estuarine microphytoplankton into the outer shelf and also increased nanophytoplankton fraction. Such fluctuations in phytoplankton size structure after hurricanes or storms can modify the pelagic food web dynamics in coastal systems.

TI  - Joint Classification of Hyperspectral and Multispectral Images for Mapping Coastal Wetlands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is significant for restoration and protection of natural resources and ecological services in coastal wetlands to map different land cover types with satellite remote sensing data. Considering difficulties of wetland species classification, hyperspectral images (HSIs) with high spectral resolution and multispectral images (MSI) with high spatial resolution are considered to achieve complementary advantages of multisource data. An effective approach, named as multistream convolutional neural network, is proposed to achieve fine classification of coastal wetlands. First, regression processing is adopted to make chaotically scattered coastal wetland data more compact and different. Second, through appropriate feature extraction and feature fusion strategies, high-level information of multisource data in regression domain is fused to distinguish different land cover. Experiments on GF-5 HSIs and Sentinel-2 MSIs are carried out in order to validate the classification performance of the proposed approach in two coastal wetlands of research value in China, i.e., Yellow River Estuary and Yancheng coastal wetland. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the field, especially when the number of sample size is extremely small.

AB  - The way to classify high-performance deep neural network depends on large-scale and high-quality labeled samples. However, it is difficult to obtain a large number of high-quality data sets in the field of remote sensing images. The most common solution is to use fine-tuned pre-trained neural network to study, which brings data deviation instead. At the same time, the remote sensing images which are in different time phases will be changed. It leads to violate the assumption between the training and test data. In this paper, we apply four deep adaptive networks to remote sensing image migration and classification experiments, and carried out an experimental evaluation of deep domain adaption for remote sensing image classification. Firstly, we selected two sets of public remote sensing optical scene classification data, two groups of data are compared in the above four networks, and the transfer accuracy under different network structures is obtained, and then we compared and analyzed the accuracy of different categories of data transfer classification. The experimental results show that the transfer accuracy of the four network structures using the transfer algorithm is much higher than the accuracy of the network with only transfer pre-trained model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of those four adaptive networks is higher, but the accuracy of different categories of data transfer classification is different, which can prove that the deep domain adaptive algorithm is also applicable to the remote sensing image transfer and can also confirm that the feasibility of mutual transfer between optical remote sensing data.

AB  - In this paper, we proposed an oil platform detection method in polarimetric SAR images based on level set segmentation and convolutional neural network (CNN). An improved level set segmentation method is used for the extraction of regions of interest (ROIs) at first. The classic CNN model is then used for the identification of oil platforms from the extracted ROIs. In the method, the offshore strong scattering targets are coarsely detected by a thresholding segmentation of the polarimetric entropy and alpha angle parameters. Then, a circle covering the initially detected targets is obtained using a proposed circle covering algorithm. The ROIs are extracted by using level set segmentation in the initialization of the circle. Oil platforms are finally detected by using the improved LeNet-5 model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using multiple sets of polarimetric SAR data from different sea regions acquired by RADARSAT-2.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), with all-day and all-weather observation capabilities, can capture the phenology of crops with short growth cycles to improve land cover classification results. The present study carried out a land cover classification using multitemporal RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images that are 24 days apart. The objectives of this study were 1) examining the land cover classification capacity of multitemporal fully PolSAR data processed with multiple polarimetric decomposition methods, 2) investigating the contribution of multi-type polarimetric decomposition methods to multitemporal PolSAR image classification, 3) and determining optimal image acquisition dates and polarimetric parameters for land cover classification. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient attained using the multitemporal PolSAR data were 96.55% and 0.96, respectively, which were improved by as much as 16.77% and 0.20, respectively, compared with those obtained with a single scene. Compared with the multitemporal PolSAR image classification using coherency matrices alone, the use of polarimetric decomposition methods improved overall accuracy and kappa value by 2.22% and 0.03, respectively. Using decision tree algorithms for feature selection, we found that April 14, May 8, June 1, and June 25 and Pauli, Cloude, Neumann3, An&Yang4, Freeman3, Barnes2, and MCSM5 decomposition methods were optimal for the land cover classification.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Algorithm Based on Recurrent Neural Network for MODIS 250 m Reflectance Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is a critical land surface parameter, and several large-scale FVC products have been generated based on remote sensing data. Among these existing products, the global land surface satellite (GLASS) FVC product, derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m reflectance data (MOD09A1), has achieved complete spatial-temporal continuity and satisfying accuracy. To further improve the spatial resolution of GLASS FVC product, this study developed a novel FVC estimation algorithm for MODIS 250 m reflectance data based on a recurrent neural network with the long short-term memory unit (RNN-LSTM). The RNN-LSTM was established using sequence training samples derived from the MODIS 250 m reflectance and GLASS FVC products, which were conducted over three vegetation types in mid-West China. Additionally, two machine learning methods, including the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used to compare with the proposed method. The evaluation results showed that RNN-LSTM derived FVC had reliable spatial-temporal continuity and good consistency with the GLASS FVC product. Furthermore, the smooth temporal profiles of the RNN-LSTM FVC estimation indicated that the proposed method was capable of capturing the temporal characteristics of vegetation growth and reducing the uncertainties from the atmosphere and radiation. Finally, an independent validation case in the Heihe area indicated that the RNN-LSTM algorithm achieved the best accuracy (R-2 = 0.8081, rmse = 0.0951) compared with the BPNN (R-2 = 0.7320, rmse = 0.1127) and MARS (R-2 = 0.7361, rmse = 0.1117). This study provides a new approach by showing the potential of the RNN-LSTM method for land surface parameter estimation and related research.

AB  - The vegetation cover of Qingdao city has changed significantly under the dual influence of climate change and the implementation of blue ocean strategy. The spatial-temporal dynamic change characteristics of vegetation coverage in Qingdao were quantitatively studied on the county-level scale and the man-made and natural driving factors were analysed spatial-statistically by using the dichotomy pixel model Based on Landsat remote sensing data of Qingdao in 2000, 2008 and 2016. The results suggest that: (1) the overall evolution of vegetation coverage declines from 65% to 63% from 2000 to 2016. (2) Significant spatial difference of vegetation coverage is found at the county scale. The vegetation coverage of Jiao Nan increased, while that of Jimo decreased from 2000 to 2008. Jiao Nan had the highest vegetation coverage between 2008 and 2016, while Jiao Nan, western Jimo and Pignut all increased significantly. The vegetation coverage of eastern coastal urban area dropped dramatically to reach the lowest record in each phase of the three-year data. (3) The influence of climate factors on vegetation coverage is not significant, while the human activity is the leading factor causing the evolution of vegetation coverage in Qingdao where urbanization is negatively correlated with the change in vegetation coverage. Furthermore, population migration also has an impact on the vegetation coverage.

TI  - A Semiphysical Approach of Haze Removal for Landsat Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of haze could seriously contaminate the observations of optical satellite imagery. Haze not only significantly affects the visual interpretation but also reduces the accuracy of map products. In this article, a semiphysical approach is proposed to reduce the haze effects for Landsat image. The proposed approach is based on the physical model of radiative transfer theory and the presence of dark objects. As the depth map of satellite remotely sensed image is almost a constant value, the coarse transmission map of atmosphere is estimated by the haze thickness, other than the scene depth map. The derived coarse transmission is utilized to correct the color shift induced by airlight. For haze veiled textural information, the guided-filter based approach is adopted to refine the coarse transmission map to restore the textural information. Experiments are conducted upon the images acquired by Landsat at different dates and spatial locations. The visual interpretation upon the dehazed results suggests that the proposed approach could generate visually promising results and preserve spectral properties of land surfaces. Moreover, it also performs favorably against several state-of-the-art deep learning based methods and a classic algorithm. The results of quantitative assessments demonstrate that the developed approach could enhance the information of Landsat scene with minimum spectrum changes. With the visual and quantitative assessments, we can conclude that the proposed approach is a promising solution for Landsat image dehazing. It is expected to improve the data quality of hazy scene and expand the usability of Landsat data.

TI  - Credibility and statistical characteristics of CAMSRA and MERRA-2 AOD reanalysis products over the Sichuan Basin during 2003-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to its large population, unique topography, and rapid industrialization and urbanization, the Sichuan Basin (SCB) is one of the most polluted regions in China, as reflected by the large aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this study, the credibility of two long-term atmospheric composition reanalysis datasets-the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA)-are evaluated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products over the SCB during 2003-2018. The time series of the three datasets at seasonal, monthly and annual scales exhibit some interesting similarities and differences, but with all of them demon-strating a prominent slowing down of the severe air pollution status over the SCB since 2012 (-0.25/7yrs for MODIS and CAMSRA and-0.12/7yrs for MERRA-2). CAMSRA shows good consistency with MODIS at all time scales (correlation coefficients varying from 0.89 to 0.97 at four seasons) despite its systematic overestimation (similar to 0.2) throughout the 16-year study period. MERRA-2 has a negative deviation during 2003-2006 and then maintains an increasing positive deviation in the following years (0.05-0.2). This positive bias increases as MODIS AOD declines prominently from 2014. The good temporal consistency of CAMSRA is partly attributable to the bias correction of the assimilated remotely sensed AOD from MODIS and AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer). The differences between the reanalysis and MODIS are obvious during October-December, which may be related to the cloud contamination effects as well as the uncertainties of emissions in each model system. The uniform decreasing trend of the three datasets since 2012 supports the effects of the tough emissions reduction policy, which is also evident in AOD changes of anthropogenic species. It is concluded that atmospheric composition reanalysis data with good spatial and temporal coverage can be considered in future air quality analyses over the SCB. However, the bias and regional dependence should be handled carefully.

AB  - The texture feature of images plays an important role in tree species classification. The selection of important texture features in tree species identification can be supported via performance testing by considering the same texture features produced by different bands and different texture features produced by the same band in tree species classification. In this study, we used the 8-band WorldView-2 image as the data source and extracted three types of texture features, i.e., data range, mean, and variance, by applying occurrence measures to the obtained data, then used the maximum likelihood classifier for image classification. The results show that the classification accuracies of the texture features extracted from the red edge. near-infrared 1, near-infrared 2 bands (55.0768%. 53.7395%, and 51.1020%, respectively) were higher than those of other bands (ranging from 39.5740% to 43.9079%); the texture feature classification accuracy of the mean (77.9470%) was higher than those of the data range (45.3938%) and variance (45.3938%); when the eight bands combined with all mean and all data range, the classification accuracy of tree species reached 89.7845%. The results demonstrate that the effective combination of spectral bands and important texture features can improve the tree species classification results.

TI  - Spatial Shift Phenomenon Compensation for TomoSAR Imaging Using High-Resolution TerraSAR-X Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are available nowadays, effecting rapid development in the urban remote sensing technology. In this study, we use a set of 27 scenes from TerraSAR-X to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) point clouds of a skyscraper-North Star Times Tower in Beijing, China. We study in detail the derivation process of a 3D model of tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) from the two-dimensional (2D) imaging mathematical model of SAR. We observe the presence of a spatial shift in the elevation direction of TomoSAR, which yields poor and even incorrect results when greedy algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) or regularized orthogonal matching pursuit (ROMP) algorithms are applied. Then, we propose a phase compensation method to eliminate the spatial shift. Both OMP and ROMP algorithms are used for TomoSAR imaging on high-resolution TerraSAR-X data. The experimental results with North Star Times Tower demonstrate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the algorithms. Finally, we compare the ROMP and OMP algorithms and conclude that both algorithms can yield similar reconstruction results in TomoSAR imaging. The ROMP algorithm does not depend on sparsity and can suppress noise through regularization selection at the cost of time. The OMP algorithm introduces noise when the sparsity is inaccurate.

TI  - A Two-Scale Method of Sea Ice Classification Using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR Data During Early Freeze-Up
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice classification using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in the wide-swath mode is one method for ice type retrieval. The conventional method of sea ice classification involves single-scale classification, wherein the backscatter and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features in a specific resolution are used as classification bases. The classification is implemented only once. In this way, however, the scalloping and interscan banding (ISB) artifacts in some TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data affect the classification result. In this article, a two-scale method of sea ice classification is proposed. The two-scale process includes both the coarse- and fine-resolution classifications. First, the coarse-resolution classification utilizes downscale images to generate the ice zone. Subsequently, the fine-scale classification utilizes the full-resolution SAR image and the ice zone to generate the final classification result. The support vector machine is used as the classifier. This two-scale method provides a better classification result compared to the single-scale method in two aspects. First, it effectively avoids the appearance of scalloping and ISB artifacts in the results. Second, it is less time-consuming and provides satisfactory results for discriminating multiyear ice, first-year ice, and water. The validation is accomplished using independent images, with an overall average accuracy of 86.38%. This article shows that this method may provide an alternative for sea ice classification using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data.

TI  - Diverse Roles of Previous Years' Water Conditions in Gross Primary Productivity in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity is one of the most important indicators of ecosystem function, which is related to water conditions and shown high interannual variation. Due to the time-lag effect, not only the current water condition but also the previous water conditions (e.g., one year before) impact the gross primary productivity (GPP). Revealing the impacts of current and previous years' water status is currently a hot topic. In this study, we designed a series of water deficit scenarios based on the meteorological dataset of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and then analysed the responses of the remote sensing-based moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity (GPP) in China, from which the role of water deficit in time periods was evaluated. The results indicate that the impact of climate factors (i.e., water, temperature and radiation) on GPP has a high spatial heterogeneity and that water-limited regions that are primarily distributed in North and Northwestern China show a stronger water-GPP relationship than water-unlimited regions. The water deficit that occurred in different periods had a variable impact on GPP. Specifically, GPP was primarily controlled by the current year's water conditions in the water-limited regions, with the importance value of 52.8% (the percentage of Increased Mean Square Error, %IncMSE) and 3.8 (the mean decrease in node impurity, IncNodePurity), but at the same time, it was conditionally affected by the water status in the previous year, with the importance value of 20.4% (%IncMSE) and 0.6 (IncNodePurity). The role of water in previous years is multifarious, which depends on the water conditions of the current year. The results revealed by the scenarios indicate that the influence of water conditions in the previous year was not statistically significant when the water conditions of the current year were in a drought. In contrast, when the current year's water conditions were normal or wetter, the water conditions in the previous year (i.e., one-year time lag) were also important and the increase of GPP significantly depended on the water condition (p < 0.05). The diverse roles of water conditions in previous years on GPP and its non-ignorable time-lag effect revealed in this study imply that not only the current year's water condition but also its dynamic changes in previous years should be considered when predicting changes in GPP caused by climate change.

TI  - Global Land Surface Temperature Change (2003-2017) and Its Relationship with Climate Drivers: AIRS, MODIS, and ERA5-Land Based Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in the water cycle and energy balance at global and regional scales. Large-scale LST estimates can be obtained from satellite observations and reanalysis data. In this study, we first investigate the long-term changes of LST during 2003-2017 on a per-pixel basis using three different datasets derived from (i) the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard Aqua satellite, (ii) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) also aboard Aqua, and (iii) the recently released ERA5-Land reanalysis data. It was found that the spatio-temporal patterns of these data agree very well. All three products globally showed an uptrend in the annual average LST during 2003-2017 but with considerable spatial variations. The strongest increase was found over the region north of 45 degrees N, particularly over Asian Russia, whereas a slight decrease was observed over Australia. The regression analysis indicated that precipitation (P), incoming surface solar radiation (SW down arrow), and incoming surface longwave radiation (LW down arrow) can together explain the inter-annual LST variations over most regions, except over tropical forests, where the inter-annual LST variation is low. Spatially, the LST changes during 2003-2017 over the region north of 45 degrees N were mainly influenced by LW down arrow, while P and SW down arrow played a more important role over other regions. A detailed look at Asian Russia and the Amazon rainforest at a monthly time scale showed that warming in Asian Russia is dominated by LST increases in February-April, which are closely related with the simultaneously increasing LW down arrow and clouds. Over the southern Amazon, the most apparent LST increase is found in the dry season (August-September), primarily affected by decreasing P. In addition, increasing SW down arrow associated with decreasing atmospheric aerosols was another factor found to cause LST increases. This study shows a high level of consistency among LST trends derived from satellite and reanalysis products, thus providing more robust characteristics of the spatio-temporal LST changes during 2003-2017. Furthermore, the major climatic drivers of LST changes during 2003-2017 were identified over different regions, which might help us predict the LST in response to changing climate in the future.

TI  - Pansharpening Via Neighbor Embedding of Spatial Details
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial details injection model has been considered as a general framework in the literature of pansharpening, and recently there have been significant advances in this framework based on sparse representation (SR) of spatial details. However, the SR-based methods have greater computational burden in estimating the sparse vectors and limited ability in detail edge preservation. In this article, we introduce the neighbor embedding (NE) instead of SR-based model and the edge-preserving filter into the spatial detail injection framework to address the aforementioned two drawbacks. By utilizing the best quality of NE, we propose the detail injection via NE (DINE) algorithm for pansharpening, and DINE+, an improved variant of DINE by using the edge-preserving filter to enhance the spatial details. Experiments carried on three datasets captured by different satellite sensors and compared with current state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one important way to obtain the information of ocean surface velocity. The Doppler Centroid Anomaly (DCA) estimation, which obtain the radical velocity based on the difference between the measured Doppler centroid and the predicted Doppler centroid, have be used to most onboard spaceborne SAR. GaoFen-3 (GF-3), the first full-polarimetric SAR satellite of China. This paper shows the experiments of direct ocean surface velocity measurement for GF-3 SAR Satellite. Comparing the results to the actual ocean current, the proposed method of ocean surface velocity measurement for GF-3 SAR is validated. Thus, GF-3 has the similar ability to retrieve the radical ocean surface velocity as Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2.

TI  - Monitoring of Leaf Nitrogen Content in A Citrus Orchard by Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Conference on Signal Processing Systems
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for citrus growth. Thus, the chemical analysis of leaf tissues is needed to determine nitrogen in the traditional agronomic method, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and costly. Satellite remote sensing (RS) can quickly acquire multispectral images of large-scale orchards and thus can support low-cost and periodic monitoring of nitrogen content in orchards. RS data have been widely used for the monitoring of nitrogen content in various crops and performed quite well in related researches. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the leaf nitrogen content (LNC) of citrus on the basis of the data acquired by satellite RS. In this study, Landsat 8 RS image data are used to estimate the distribution of LNC in an orchard, and the effectiveness of different estimation methods for monitoring LNC value is studied. Linear regression, partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RF), and deep neural network (DNN) models are constructed and compared. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using satellite RS data in determining LNC in sugar citrus. In terms of evaluating LNC, the PLSR algorithm outperforms other algorithms in testing data, reaching a determination coefficient of 0.864, a root mean squared error of 1.217, and a mean relation error of 3.5%. An accurate spatial distribution of nitrogen content in an orchard can be obtained by our model, which can be used to provide powerful support for the practical management and operation of the orchard.

TI  - Water surface monitoring and water quality parameters inversion of Lijiang River based on multi-temporal active and passive remote sensing, 2016-2020
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lijiang River Basin is used as the research area, and Landsat 8 OLI, GF-1, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-1A monthly images of 2016-2020 are used as data sources. The normalized water index (NDWI), modified normalized water index (MNDWI), enhanced water index (EWI), normalized difference pond index (NDPI), backscatter coefficient (S) and weighted index of active and passive remote sensing (JQ) are used to extract the water information of the Lijiang River. The case 2 regional coast color (C2RCC), maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), two band ratio method (Double R) and chlorophyll reflection peak intensity (pchi) are used to retrieve the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) and total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations in Lijiang River. The Lijiang River is divided into 278 basic evaluation units, and the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of hydrological and water quality information in the upper, middle, and lower reaches in dry and flood seasons of Lijiang River are quantitatively analyzed by difference value of water surface variation (WDr), shoreline development index (SDI) and dynamic degree of water information change (K). The following conclusions are drawn: (1) Compared with NDWI, MNDWI, EWI, and backscatter coefficient, the extraction effect of JQ and NDPI are better. Compared with JQ, NDPI has higher precision and credibility. ( 2) RMSE of Chl. a based on the inversion of C2RCC algorithm is 0.18-7.88 mg/m(3), RMSE of TSM is 0.17-12.55 g/m3, and it can better reflect the changing trend of Chl.a. ( 3) The division of the basic evaluation unit can clearly analyze the continuous changes of the width, area, Chl.a and TSM of the upstream, middle and downstream areas. The measured data rely on the monitoring of the stations, and the results are scattered and can't be used for continuity analysis. (4) The Lijiang River has more precipitation and strong water mobility from May to October. The average water surface width of most areas is within 100-250 m. However, the water nutrient is low and the water quality is good. The water quality is the worst in February. The areas with high eutrophication are mainly concentrated in Xing'an County, Lingchuan County and other urban residential areas in the upper and middle reaches, and Xingping town with more tourism development zones downstream.

TI  - Ambiguities Suppression for Azimuth Multichannel SAR Based on <i>L</i><sub>2,q</sub> Regularization With Application to Gaofen-3 Ultra-Fine Stripmap Mode
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology is capable of overcoming the minimum antenna area constraint and achieving high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) imaging. Generally speaking, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the spaceborne multichannel SAR systems should satisfy the azimuthal uniform sampling condition, but it is sometimes impossible due to the limitation of radar system timing conditions, which is often referred as "coverage diagram." For the Gaofen-3 system, the PRF of each channel at some beam positions is slightly less than that of uniform sampling in the dual-channel mode, leading to the nonuniform undersampling, hence, resulting the azimuth ambiguities in the recovered images. Although the ambiguous energy in Gaofen-3 images is not high in general, it is still noticeable amid surrounding weak clutters of strong targets. In this article, a novel multichannel SAR imaging method for nonuniform undersampling based on L-2,L-q regularization $(0 is proposed. By analyzing the reasons of azimuth ambiguities in the multichannel SAR system, the imaging model is established with emphasizing the difference from conventional single-channel SAR. Then, we combine the multichannel SAR data processing operators with the group sparsity property to construct the novel imaging method. The group sparsity property is modeled by the regularization problem can be solved via sparse group thresholding function. It is shown that the proposed method can efficiently suppress the azimuth ambiguities caused by nonuniform undersampling. Simulations and Gaofen-3 real data experiments are exploited to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Assessing Disaggregated SMAP Soil Moisture Products in the United States
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A soil moisture (SM) disaggregation algorithm based on thermal inertia (TI) theory was implemented to downscale the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) enhanced product (SPL2SMP_E) from 9 to 1 km over the continental United States. The algorithm applies land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index frommoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) at higher spatial resolution to estimate relative soil wetness within a coarse SMAP grid-this MODISderived relative wetness is then used to produce the downscaled SMAP SM. Results from the algorithm were evaluated in terms of their spatio-temporal coverage and accuracy using in situ measurements fromSMAPcore validation sites (CVS), theU.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Reference Network (CRN). Results were also compared with the baseline SPL2SMP_E and the SMAP/Sentinel-1 (SPL2SMAP_S) 1 km product. Overall, the unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of the disaggregated SM at the CVS using the TI approach is approximately 0.04 m(3)/m(3), which is the SMAP mission requirement for the baseline products. The TI approach outperforms the SMAP/Sentinel SL2SMAP_S 1 km product by approximately 0.02 m(3)/m(3). Over the agriculture/crop areas from SCAN and CRN sparse network stations, the TI approach exhibits better ubRMSE compared to SPL2SMP_E and SPL2SMAP_S by about 0.01 and 0.02 m(3)/m(3), indicating its advantage in these areas. However, a drawback of this approach is that there are data gaps due to cloud cover as optical sensors cannot have a clear view of the land surface.

TI  - HLSTM: Heterogeneous Long Short-Term Memory Network for Large-Scale InSAR Ground Subsidence Prediction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of ground subsidence is of great significance for the prevention and mitigation of this type of geological disaster. It is still a challenge when wide area is concerned. In this article, a heterogeneous long short-term memory (HLSTM) network is proposed for large-scale ground subsidence prediction based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. First, the study area is divided into homogeneous subregions through spatial clustering of InSAR-derived subsidence velocity. Second, a specific LSTM model is constructed to capture complex nonlinear temporal correlations embedded in InSAR-derived subsidence time series for each subregion. Essentially both spatial heterogeneity and temporal correlation are incorporated into the HLSTM prediction. In the experiment part, the HLSTM predictor is validated using a subsidence monitoring result from 80 Sentinel-1 images acquired over Cangzhou, China, from 2017 to 2019. The HLSTM result shows the highest prediction accuracy through comparisons with the results from other seven methods.

TI  - Estimates of Daily Evapotranspiration in the Source Region of the Yellow River Combining Visible/Near-Infrared and Microwave Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variation of surface net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux at different times of the day over the northern Tibetan Plateau were estimated using the Surface Energy Balance System algorithm, data from the FY-2G geostationary meteorological satellite, and microwave data from the FY-3C polar-orbiting meteorological satellite. In addition, the evaporative fraction was analyzed, and the total evapotranspiration (ET) was obtained by the effective evaporative fraction to avoid the error from accumulation. The hourly change of latent heat flux presented a sound unimodal diurnal variation. The results showed the regional ET ranged between 2.0 and 4.0 mm over the Source Region of the Yellow River. The conditional expectations of surface energy components during the experimental period of the study area were statistically analyzed, and the correspondence between different surface temperatures and the effective energy distribution was examined. The effective energy distribution of the surface changed significantly with the increase in temperature; in particular, when the surface temperature exceeded 290 K, the effective energy was mainly used for surface ET. The aim of this study was to avoid the use of surface meteorological observations that are not readily available over large areas, and the findings lay a foundation for the commercialization of land surface evapotranspiration.

TI  - Impact of Monsoon-Transported Anthropogenic Aerosols and Sun-Glint on the Satellite-Derived Spectral Remote Sensing Reflectance in the Indian Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda), sr(-1)) is one of the most important products of ocean color satellite missions, where accuracy is essential for retrieval of in-water, bio-optical, and biogeochemical properties. For the Indian Ocean (IO), where R-rs(lambda) accuracy has not been well documented, the quality of R-rs(lambda) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard both Terra (MODIS-Terra) and Aqua (MODIS-Aqua), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership spacecraft (VIIRS-NPP), is evaluated and inter-compared based on a quality assurance (QA) system, which can objectively grade each individual R-rs(lambda) spectrum, with 1 for a perfect spectrum and 0 for an unusable spectrum. Taking the whole year of 2016 as an example, spatiotemporal pattern of R-rs(lambda) quality in the Indian Ocean is characterized for the first time, and the underlying factors are elucidated. Specifically, QA analysis of the monthly R-rs(lambda) over the IO indicates good quality with the average scores of 0.93 +/- 0.02, 0.92 +/- 0.02 and 0.92 +/- 0.02 for VIIRS-NPP, MODIS-Aqua, and MODIS-Terra, respectively. Low-quality (similar to 0.7) data are mainly found in the Bengal Bay (BB) from January to March, which can be attributed to the imperfect atmospheric correction due to anthropogenic absorptive aerosols transported by the northeasterly winter monsoon. Moreover, low-quality (similar to 0.74) data are also found in the clear oligotrophic gyre zone (OZ) of the south IO in the second half of the year, possibly due to residual sun-glint contributions. These findings highlight the effects of monsoon-transported anthropogenic aerosols, and imperfect sun-glint removal on the R-rs(lambda) quality. Further studies are advocated to improve the sun-glint correction in the oligotrophic gyre zone and aerosol correction in the complex ocean-atmosphere environment.

TI  - Detection of Geothermal Anomaly Areas With Spatio-Temporal Analysis Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technology for detecting geothermal anomalies. However, detection results have been found to have a certain dependency on the distribution of ground objects and imaging conditions at different times, and pseudo-anomalous areas are easily extracted. To solve this problem, a new geothermal anomaly detection method is proposed in this article and implemented in the Jiaonan uplift in the Yishu fault zone. A temperature inversion experiment is carried out on TIR remote sensing images based on the radiation transfer equation. Then, a gradient operator is used to extract high-temperature regions in various periods, and geothermal anomaly areas are selected through the spatio-temporal analysis method proposed in this article after excluding the influence of impervious surfaces, water bodies, and vegetation. The temperature anomaly points, which are all high-temperature points in each inversion result and geothermal anomaly areas extracted by the proposed method, are compared with the five geothermal anomaly points, which are determined based on 150 geothermal wells and the geological structure in the study area. The spatial locations of the temperature anomaly points and geothermal anomaly areas are close to those of the geothermal anomaly points. Compared with the mean grad method, the proposed method is found to effectively delete some pseudo-anomaly areas under the premise of ensuring the extraction accuracy of geothermal anomaly areas.

TI  - Crop Mapping Using Sentinel Full-Year Dual-Polarized SAR Data and a CPU-Optimized Convolutional Neural Network With Two Sampling Strategies
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although optical remote sensing can capture the Earth's environment with visible and infrared sensors, it is limited by weather conditions. Often, only a few sets of cloud-free optical imagery are available in cloudy regions, where many agricultural towns are located. On the other hand, radar remote sensing can capture imagery under cloudy conditions. In this study, we examined the capability of Sentinel-1 multitemporal dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in a whole year from Google Earth Engine in crop mapping in two study sites in Chongqing, China, and Landivisiau, France. Results show that it is possible to produce better crop classification maps using multitemporal SAR imagery, but the performance is limited by local terrain. Flat agricultural regions, such as Western Europe, are expected to benefit from the multitemporal SAR information. Mountain agricultural regions, such as Southwestern China, will encounter difficulties due to the undulate terrain. We also tested two sampling strategies, i.e., random sampling and regional sampling, and observed high variation in overall accuracy: the former led to a higher accuracy. The gap is caused by the diversity of training sets examined using tSNE visualization. The importance of SAR channels in each month are correlated with their entropy. Data from the growing season are important in distinguishing crop types. The 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved similar results under a huge computation cost compared with 2-D CNNs. Based on the experiments, we recommend to use a lightweight 2-D CNN that can run on the CPU for real-world crop mapping with SAR data.

TI  - A Comparative Study of DEM Reconstruction Using the Single-Baseline and Multibaseline InSAR Techniques
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric SAR (InSAR) is a practical technique to derive 3-D structure of the earth's surface. This article conducts a comparative study of digital elevation model (DEM) reconstruction using the single-baseline and multibaseline InSAR techniques. To improve the accuracy of the DEM generated from the single-baseline InSAR, we improve the weight definition approach according to the coherence magnitudes for the fusion of single-baseline InSAR DEMs. For multibaseline InSAR, we adopt a method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm, which uses external DEM as a constraint. A TerraSAR-X dataset comprising four SAR images acquired over Barcelona is used for experimental investigation. The accuracies of four types of DEM are comparatively studied, including DEM by single-baseline InSAR, DEM by the fusion of single-baseline InSAR DEMs, DEM by unconstrained multibaseline InSAR, and DEM by constrained multibaseline InSAR. The results show that the proposed weighted fusion of single-baseline InSAR performed slightly better than the constrained multibaseline InSAR method, and both of them performed better than the single-baseline results, demonstrating that multiple observations can effectively improve the accuracy of the reconstructed DEM.

TI  - Detection of delay in post-monsoon agricultural burning across Punjab, India: potential drivers and consequences for air quality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s, a widespread transition to a rice-wheat rotation in the Indian state of Punjab has led to steady increases in crop yield and production. After harvest of the summer monsoon rice crop, the burning of excess crop residue in Punjab from October to November allows for rapid preparation of fields for sowing of the winter wheat crop. Here we use daily satellite remote sensing data to show that the timing of peak post-monsoon fire activity in Punjab and regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) has shifted later by approximately two weeks in Punjab from 2003 to 2016. This shift is consistent with delays of 11-15 d in the timing of maximum greenness of the monsoon crop and smaller delays of 4-6 d in the timing of minimum greenness during the monsoon-to-winter crop transition period. The resulting compression of the harvest-to-sowing period coincides with a 42% increase in total burning and 55% increase in regional AOD. Potential drivers of these trends include agricultural intensification and a recent groundwater policy that delays sowing of the monsoon crop. The delay and amplification of burning into the late post-monsoon season suggest greater air quality degradation and public health consequences across the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain.

TI  - Landslide Detection Mapping Employing CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide detection mapping (LDM) is the basis of the field of landslide disaster prevention; however, it has faced certain difficulties. The Three Gorges Reservoir area of the Yangtze River has been one of the most intensively evaluated areas for landslide prevention in the world, due to the high frequency of landslide disasters here. In this article, we constructed an accurate LDM model based on convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and dense convolutional neural networks (DenseNets) that considers "ZY-3" high spatial resolution (HSR) data and conditioning factors (CFs). In this article, 19 factors based on remote sensing (RS) images, topographical and geological data associated with historical landslide locations were randomly divided into training (70% of total) and testing (30%) datasets. The experimental results show that the accuracy (ACC) of these three LDM models is above 0.95, indicating that the deep neural networks aimed at landslide detection performed well. Furthermore, DenseNet with RS images and CFs can accurately detect landslides. Specifically, DenseNet with RS images and CFs outperforms the other five models by considering the evaluation metrics, which exhibited Kappa coefficient improvements of 0.01-0.04 and ACC improvements of 0.02-0.3%. Among all the factors, elevation factor has a high importance of 0.727, which is the most important factors found in this landslide model construction experiment.

TI  - LaeNet: A Novel Lightweight Multitask CNN for Automatically Extracting Lake Area and Shoreline from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations of lake area and shoreline can indicate hydrological and climatic changes effectively. Accordingly, how to automatically and simultaneously extract lake area and shoreline from remote sensing images attracts our attention. In this paper, we formulate lake area and shoreline extraction as a multitask learning problem. Different from existing models that take the deep and complex network architecture as the backbone to extract feature maps, we present LaeNet-a novel end-to-end lightweight multitask fully CNN with no-downsampling to automatically extract lake area and shoreline from remote sensing images. Landsat-8 images over Selenco and the vicinity in the Tibetan Plateau are utilized to train and evaluate our model. Experimental results over the testing image patches achieve an Accuracy of 0.9962, Precision of 0.9912, Recall of 0.9982, F1-score of 0.9941, and mIoU of 0.9879, which align with the mainstream semantic segmentation models (UNet, DeepLabV3+, etc.) or even better. Especially, the running time of each epoch and the size of our model are only 6 s and 0.047 megabytes, which achieve a significant reduction compared to the other models. Finally, we conducted fieldwork to collect the in-situ shoreline position for one typical part of lake Selenco, in order to further evaluate the performance of our model. The validation indicates high accuracy in our results (DRMSE: 30.84 m, DMAE: 22.49 m, DSTD: 21.11 m), only about one pixel deviation for Landsat-8 images. LaeNet can be expanded potentially to the tasks of area segmentation and edge extraction in other application fields.

TI  - Ground Camera Image and Large-Scale 3-D Image-Based Point Cloud Registration Based on Learning Domain Invariant Feature Descriptors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource data are captured from different sensors or generated with different generation mechanisms. Ground camera images (images taken from ground-based camera) and rendered images (synthesized by the position information from 3-D image-based point cloud) are different-source geospatial data, called cross-domain images. Particularly, in outdoor environments, the registration relationship between the above cross-domain images is available to establish the spatial relationship between 2-D and 3-D space, which is an indirect solution for virtual-real registration of augmented reality (AR). However, the traditional handcrafted feature descriptors cannot match the above cross-domain images because of the low quality of rendered images and the domain gap between cross-domain images. In this article, inspired by the success achieved by deep learning in computer vision, we first propose an end-to-end network, DIFD-Net, to learn domain invariant feature descriptors (DIFDs) for cross-domain image patches. The DIFDs are used for cross-domain image patch retrieval to the registration of ground camera and rendered images. Second, we construct a domain-kept consistent loss function, which balances the feature descriptors for narrowing the gap in different domains, to optimize DIFD-Net. Specially, the negative samples are generated from positive during training, and the introduced constraint of intermediate feature maps increases extra supervision information to learn feature descriptors. Finally, experiments show the superiority of DIFDs for the retrieval of cross-domain image patches, which achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Additionally, we use DIFDs to match ground camera images and rendered images, and verify the feasibility of the derived AR virtual-real registration in open outdoor environments

TI  - Long-term Land Cover Change Detection Using Multisensor and Multiresolution Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study of Chang'an University, China
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is one of the most important aspects of remote sensing applications. However, owing to the limited conditions of image acquisition, images obtained from the same type of remote sensors are usually used to monitor long-term land use and land cover (LULC) changes. Owing to developments in aerospace technology and new optical remote sensors, LULC change detection can be performed well with multisensor and multiresolution images. The main contribution of this article is to verify that it is feasible and practicable to perform long-term LULC change detection by applying different change detection methods to multisensor and multiresolution remote sensing images. In this study, different change detection methods were used on Landsat, QuickBird, WorldView-4, and GF-2 images to detect LULC changes on Weishui Campus of Chang'an University, China, from 1998 to 2018. Results showed that the direct spectral comparison method using Landsat-5 images could more efficiently detect LULC changes between 1998 and 2008 than the post-classification change detection method using Landsat-7 images. However, for 2008-2018, the object-based change detection method was more applicable than the post-classification method for monitoring LULC changes on campus by using time-series high-resolution images. This study can be used as a reference for the utilization of multisensor and multiresolution remote sensing images and the combination of different change detection methods in the LULC change detection field.

TI  - An Improved Multi-Platform Stacked D-InSAR Method for Monitoring the Three-Dimensional Deformation of the Mining Area
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of information on fine surface three-dimensional deformation in a goaf is of great significance for the in-depth understanding of the law of mining subsidence and guiding the safe production and ecological restoration of the mining area. In this paper, three platform SAR satellite images are used for stacked D-InSAR processing to obtain the information on surface deformation in three line-of-sight directions. An improved three-dimensional decomposition model is proposed based on the difference between the COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X satellite heading angles, which are very small. The proposed method is verified by evaluating the three-dimensional deformation of the ground surface during the mining process at the 132610 working face in Fengfeng Mining District, Handan City, Hebei Province. The accuracy of the three-dimensionally decomposed vertical settlement results is verified with the leveling data of the same period. The accuracy of 0.82 cm is achieved, and the maximum subsidence is approximately 16 cm. Combining the high-precision terrain information obtained from the unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry data and the deformation law of inclined coal seam mining, the horizontal movement of the 132610 working face is analyzed to prove the feasibility of the proposed method.

TI  - Super-Resolution of VIIRS-Measured Ocean Color Products Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch in October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite has provided high quality global ocean color products, which include normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) of six moderate (M) bands (M1-M6) at the wavelengths of 410, 443, 486, 551, 671, and 745 nm with a spatial resolution of 750-m, and one imagery (I) band at a wavelength of 638 nm with a spatial resolution of 375-m. Because the high-resolution I-band measurements are highly correlated spectrally to those of M-band data, it can be used as a guidance to super-resolve the M-band nL(w)(lambda) imagery from 750- to 375-m spatial resolution. Super-resolving images from coarse spatial resolution to finer ones have been a field of very active research in recent years. However, no previous studies have been applied to satellite ocean color remote sensing, in particular, for VIIRS ocean color applications. In this study, we employ the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) technique to glean the high-frequency content from the VIIRS I1 band and transfer to super-resolved M-band ocean color images. The network is trained to super-resolve each of the VIIRS six M-bands nL(w)(lambda) separately. In our results, the super-resolved (375-m) nL(w)(lambda) images are much sharper and show finer spatial structures than the original images. Quantitative evaluations show that biases between the super-resolved and original nL(w)(lambda) images are small for all bands. However, errors in the super-resolved nL(w)(lambda) images are wavelength-dependent. The smallest error is found in the super-resolved nL(w)(551) and nL(w)(671) images, and error increases as the wavelength decreases from 486 to 410 nm. The results show that the networks have the capability to capture the correlations of the M-band and the I1 band images to super-resolved M-band images.

TI  - Adaptive Attention-based High-level Semantic Introduction for Image Caption
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been several attempts to integrate a spatial visual attention mechanism into an image caption model and introduce semantic concepts as the guidance of image caption generation. High-level semantic information consists of the abstractedness and generality indication of an image, which is beneficial to improve the model performance. However, the high-level information is always static representation without considering the salient elements. Therefore, a semantic attention mechanism is used for the high-level information instead of conventional of static representation in this article. The salient high-level semantic information can be considered as redundant semantic information for image caption generation. Additionally, the generation of visual words and non-visual words can be separated, and an adaptive attention mechanism is employed to realic the guidance information of image caption generation switching between new fusion information (fusion of image feature and high-level semantics) and a language model. Therefore, visual words can be generated according to the image features and high-level semantic information, and non-visual words can be predicted by the language model. The semantics attention, adaptive attention, and previous generated words are fused to construct a special attention module for the input and output of long short-term memory. An image caption can be generated as a concise sentence on the basis of accurately grasping the rich content of the image. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model is promising for the evaluation metrics, and the captions can achieve logical and rich descriptions.

M3  - Review
AB  - With the initial establishment of global earth observation system in various countries, more and more high-resolution remote sensing data of multisource, multitemporal, multiscale, and different types of satellites are obtained. It is urgent to explore the advanced basic theory of remote sensing information science, design high-performance generic key technologies of remote sensing information system and global positioning system, and study complex engineering system of remote sensing applications and geographic information system. In this article, the basic theory exploration, inversion technology research, and engineering application design and development of generic optical remote sensing product (ORSP) are systematically reviewed. We classify the ORSP scientifically, review the main algorithms and application scope of 16 kinds of generic ORSP, and expound the validation and quality evaluation methods of ORSP in engineering application. Furthermore, we analyze the current core problems and solutions, and prospects for the state-of-the-art research and the future development trend of generic ORSP. This will provide valuable reference for scientific research and construction of high-resolution earth observation system.

TI  - Combined Sentinel-1A With Sentinel-2A to Estimate Soil Moisture in Farmland
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, seven filter algorithms were compared. The Lee sigma method was more suitable for estimating soil moisture (SM) than the other filtering methods under different land cover types. First, we used a combination of roughness and the dual-polarized Sentinel-1A backscattering coefficients (VV and VH) to estimate SM in bare soil areas. Second, we employed water cloud model (WCM) to remove the influence of vegetation signals on the land surface backscattering and estimate SMin vegetation-covered areas. SM was also retrieved by modified soil moisture monitoring index (MSMMI) and modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) of Sentinel-2A images. The results show that MSMMI can more accurately monitor SM in bare soil areas, which was slightly better than synthetic aperture radar (SAR) results. The SAR backscattering coefficients after the removal of vegetation influence by WCM can more precisely estimate SM in vegetation-covered areas, which is significantly better than MSMMI and MPDI, especially in high vegetation-covered areas. Optics and SAR differ in their abilities to estimate SM under different land cover, but the powerful fitting ability of machine learning can make full use of their advantages. We employed the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms to estimate SM combining Sentinel-1A with Sentinel-2A images. The estimation accuracies of SM by regression algorithms were higher than those by the semiempirical SAR and optical models. The accuracy of estimated SM by DNN was higher than that of GRNN and RFR, which were better than SVR.

TI  - Comprehensive Evaluation of Sentinel-2 Red Edge and Shortwave-Infrared Bands to Estimate Soil Moisture
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to explore the applicability of SMMI (soil moisture monitoring index), MSMMI (modified soil moisture monitoring index), PDI (perpendicular drought index), and MPDI (modified perpendicular drought index) in estimating soil moisture (SM) in farmland. The random forest classifier was used to obtain two-stage land cover types maps. The sensitivity of Sentinel-2 spectral bands to the measured SM at a depth of 0-5 cm was optimized by random forest regression. According to the sensitive bands, SMMI and PDI from different feature spaces were constructed to explore their feasibility for monitoring SM under different land cover types. Second, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in the study area was estimated by nine kinds of FVC estimation models and compared with the measured FVC. The effects of different FVC methods on estimating SM by MSMMI and MPDI were evaluated. The results show that red edge and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of Sentinel-2 had irreplaceable effects on the land cover classification. In terms of monitoring SM in bare soil areas, the SM indices with SWIR bands had high correlations with measured SM. For vegetation-covered areas, MSMMI from the FVCgr model (dimidiate pixel model with red edge bands) and the Short wave infrared1-Short wave infrared2 feature space had the highest correlation with the measured 0-5 cm depth SM. Whether vegetation-covered areas or bare soil areas, the combination of red edge and SWIR bands can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of SM. MSMMI can be used as the best SMMI in the study area. Sentinel-2 images, with great potential, can effectively estimate SM at a depth of 0-5 cm in farmland with complex environments.

TI  - Urban and Rural Income Gap: Does Urban Spatial Form Matter in China?
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - This research uses satellite remote sensing data to measure the urban spatial form and analyzes the impact of changes to urban spatial structure on the income gap between urban and rural residents. The results indicate that the compactness of the urban spatial form is positively correlated with the income gap between urban and rural residents. However, there is no statistically significant relationship between the urban spatial extension rate and the urban-rural income gap. A subsequent analysis of the control variables shows that fiscal policy is positively correlated while urbanization is negatively correlated with the income gap between urban and rural residents. These conclusions provide the basis for formulating policies to narrow the urban-rural income gap. Appropriately reducing the spatial compactness of cities can narrow the income gap. In addition, changing excessive preferences for urban fiscal policy and increasing the level of urbanization can also promote a reduction in the income gap between urban and rural residents.

TI  - An Adaptive Blended Algorithm Approach for Deriving Bathymetry from Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The log-ratio method (LRM) proposed by Stumpf et al. has been widely used to map bathymetry from multispectral imagery for oligotrophic waters, while the selection criteria of bands for the LRM have been subject to tradeoffs between maximum detectable depth and sensitivity. In this article, we first applied a method for global sensitivity analysis to a semianalytical forward model of optically shallow waters with the WorldView-2 band-set. The results show that the sensitive wavelength band in water-leaving reflectance for water depth varies from the longer wavelength band to the shorter wavelength band with increasing water depth. Then, we developed an adaptive blended algorithm approach (ABAA) to seamlessly map bathymetry from the shallower region to the deeper region. The LRM with different band combinations was selected for the sub-algorithms of the ABAA. The subalgorithms and depth range used for each subalgorithm of the ABAA were automatically determined by the proposed applicable depth range analysis that considers logarithmic regression for the LRM. The ABAA was applied to WorldView-2 and Landsat-8 imagery of the Xisha Qundao. When the in situ bathymetry data are available, compared with the LRM with the blue and green bands, the ABAA significantly improves the accuracy of the estimated depth, especially for waters shallower than 6 m (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.31 to 0.94 m for WorldView-2 data, RMSE=0.25 to 1.42 m for Landsat-8 data). When the in situ bathymetry data are absent, the ABAA performs better than the LRM with a single band ratio and an optimization-based method overall.

TI  - Sami traditional medicine: practices, usage, benefit, accessibility and relation to conventional medicine, a scoping review study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The Sami Indigenous populations, who live in the arctic Sapmi area across four countries - Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula of Russia - have practiced traditional medicine (TM) for millennia. However, today Sami TM is unknown within the Swedish health care services (HCS). The aim of this study is to describe the nature and scope of research conducted on Sami TM among the four Sapmi countries. This study covers peer-reviewed research published in the English language up to 8 April 2020. From 15 databases, 240 abstracts were identified, and 19 publications met the inclusion criteria for full review. Seventeen studies were conducted in Norway, one in Finland and one in Sweden, none in Russia. In northern Norway, Sami TM is actively used by the local communities, and is claimed to be effective, but is not accessible within HCS. Holistic worldviews, including spirituality, prevail in Sami TM from practitioners' selection criteria to health care practices to illness responsibilities. An integration of Sami TM into HCS is clearly the desire of local communities. Comparisons were made between Sami TM and conventional medicine on worldviews, on perspectives towards each other, and on integration. More studies are needed in Sweden, Finland and Russia.

TI  - Functions of Collective Narratives in a Territorial Conflict. The Israeli-Palestinian Case
T2  - DADOS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIAIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The various narratives of a conflict play a central role in its development. Not only are they a reflection of the collective memory of the various parties in conflict, but also a functional element in its dynamics. In the case of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, data show that each side's main narratives are fairly stable over time, and they possess significant magnitudes - over two thirds of their publics, in both cases. This article analyses the use of narratives in the dynamics of the conflict, which affects both the cognitive and emotional dimensions of the public's world-view on both sides. We draw ten main functions of collective narratives in the conflict. We discuss that, although a transformation of narratives in the conflict is required for its resolution, both groups will face resistance associated with the functionality of the narratives during this process.

TI  - The Proper Ki-67 Cut-Off in Hormone Responsive Breast Cancer: A Monoinstitutional Analysis with Long-Term Follow-Up
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Our study focuses on a monoinstitutional series of patients affected by Hormone Responsive carcinomas (luminal A and luminal B) and aims to define an optimal Ki-67 cut-off, to correctly stratify these patients into risk classes, using the ImmunoHistoChemical (IHC) surrogates of the Molecular Subtypes, according to the St. Gallen guidelines.Methods: We analyzed 1685 patients. These patients underwent both radical and conservative surgeries with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy eventually followed by Axillary Dissection (AD). Furthermore, all the patients underwent adjuvant therapies according to the guidelines. A retrospective univariate analysis was performed and survival curves (Disease-Related Survival, DRS, and Disease-Free Survival, DFS) were carried out according to the following ki-67 risk classes: Low Risk (Ki-67 <= 14%); Intermediate Risk (Ki-67 15% divided by 20%); High Risk (Ki-67 > 20%).Results: 14 yy DRS was 98% in LA and 85% in LB with a ki-67 cut-off of 14% (1)=0.037) vs 95% (LA) and 83% (LB) with a ki-67 cut-off of 20% (1)=0.003). 14yy DFS was 85% in LA and 72% in LB with a ki-67 cut-off of 14% (p=0.017) vs 83% (LA) and 66% (LB) with a ki-67 cut-off of 20% (p<0.000).Discussion: Our results confirmed that the 20% Ki-67 cut-off is more reliable in differentiating patients at low or high risk of recurrence and death, and stratifying patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, despite its poor reproducibility, the identification of the most accurate ki-67 index assumes a pivotal relevance in guiding a tailored strategy among patients with this specific profile of breast cancer, as well as the molecular surrogates, in order to avoid harmful overtreatments.

T2  - NOVA PRISUTNOST
M3  - Review
AB  - The paper investigates the attitude of Bonifacije Perovic towards liberalism, communism and the scientific and technological revolution. Belonging to the personalist circle of Croatian Catholic intellectuals, Perovic wrote several treatises and studies in political and social philosophy before and after the Second World War, in which he criticized the basic ideological setting and goals of both communism and liberalism and capitalism, respectively. concluding that, although seemingly different, both political-social ideologies converge on both materialism and resistance to the Christian worldview, which, as a final consequence, degrades man. He joined this critique after the Second World War with the critique of the scientific and technological revolution, which became an ideology per se, and with the first two ideologies formed a kind of a materialist triangle.

TI  - A Novel Azimuth Ambiguity Suppression Method for Spaceborne Dual-Channel SAR-GMTI
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth ambiguity degrades the quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and leads to the increase of false alarm rate in ground moving target indication (GMTI). Due to the existing azimuth ambiguity, suppression methods do not remove the first-order ambiguity completely and ignore the ambiguity above first order as well, moving target detection is affected by residual ambiguity. Hence, a novel method to suppress first-order and higher order azimuth ambiguities for the dual-channel SAR/GMTI is proposed in this letter. First, the displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) technique is applied to suppress clutter. Then, estimate the local azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (LAASR) to find out the area affected by ambiguity. Finally, an inpainting algorithm is improved to patch the ambiguity area. The proposed method can remove the ambiguity almost completely. Moreover, the method is verified using the GaoFen-3 SAR dual-channel complex image data, and the result shows that the false alarm of moving target detection is degraded without reducing the detection rate.

TI  - Modelling chlorophyll-a concentrations in a continental aquatic ecosystem of the Brazilian semi-arid region based on remote sensing
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data are essentialto evaluate dynamic processes suchas eutrophication and increases in the concentration of suspended sediments in continental aquatic systems. The aim of this study, therefore, was to develop models to estimate chlorophylla concentrations from remote-sensing data in continental waters of the Brazilian semi-arid region. The study area corresponds to the Oros reservoir, located in the state of Ceara. The models were developed based on measurements taken at 20 sampling points. Water samples were collected from the reservoir to i) analyse the chlorophyll-a, electrical conductivity, pH and turbidity; ii) take optical measurements in situ of water transparency and spectral radiance. Radiance measurements were carried out using an ASD FieldSpec (R) 3 Hi-Res spectroradiometer. The spectral data were later transformed into reflectance values and used to test the performance of several models found in the literature for estimating chlorophyll-a. The results showed that for the three-band model, the maximum value for the coefficient of determination (R-2), of 0.88, was obtained using the lambda(1) = 660 nm, lambda(2) = 690 nm and lambda(3) = 717 nm spectral bands. The model employing two spectral bands presented the best performance (R-2 = 0.87) in the lambda(1) = 660 nm and lambda(2) = 690 nm bands. An absolute mean error of 5.35 and 5.00 mu g L-1 was found for the three- and two-band models respectively. The developed models are reliable, showing that chlorophyll-a concentrations can be quantified from remote-sensing field data with a high degree of accuracy.

For tanks with a floating roof, the amount of oil stored will also be estimated. If a SAR time series is available all the images can be processed jointly, exploiting the available temporal information to provide more accurate and robust estimates than those obtained from each individual image. The dimensions of each storage tank are derived from its semicircular double reflections, which are detected using the coherent scatterers in the SAR image. The classification between tanks with fixed and floating roofs is performed with a simple machine learning classifier using just three features related to the detected semicircular double reflections. The performance of the proposed method using a single image and a time series is evaluated with three TerraSAR-X images of the port of Rotterdam, containing 167 oil storage tanks of different sizes, and with both fixed and floating roofs.

TI  - Potential of temporal series of Sentinel-2 images to define zones of vine water restriction
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images and derived normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) to characterise vine water status. It assumes that in non-irrigated conditions, growth is the main factor affected by water restriction. Therefore, NDVI time series may be relevant to identify sites presenting differences in vine water restriction. The study was carried out in 7 plots and 2 reference plots across the Mediterranean basin. It shows that raw NDVI temporal series present some limitations. It then proposes an original methodology based on empirical cumulative distribution function of NDVI values observed over the whole season to account for the whole temporal dynamics of NDVI. Results showed that an approach based on cumulative distribution of NDVI values is relevant to classify plots in relation to their water restriction.

TI  - OPTIMIZING PROTOCOLS FOR HIGH-QUALITY RNA EXTRACTION FROM BLOOD AND LIVER TISSUES OF THE BROAD-SNOUTED CAIMAN
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcriptomic information provides fundamental insights into biological processes and can be used to determine gene expression in cell, tissue, or organism under specific physiological conditions, or in response to any environmental perturbation. Extraction of high quality RNA is a challenging step mainly in non-traditional organisms, and protocols for preservation and isolation need to be adjusted in many cases. In the present work, we aimed to develop a protocol for preservation and isolation of high-quality and quantity of RNA from blood and liver tissues of Caiman latirostris. Three preservation methods were tested: 1) flash freezing (LN2) and storage at -80 degrees C; 2) RNAlater (R) conservation with progressive cooling up to -80 degrees C); 3) preservation in TRIzol (R) reagent, flash freezing in LN2 and storage at -80 degrees C. Methods 1 and 2 were tested for liver, while 2 and 3 for blood. Our results showed that both preservation methods resulted in excellent outcomes for liver samples. For blood samples however, TRIzol (R) preservation was an efficient procedure for adequate RNA quality, quantity, and integrity, while conservation in RNAlater (R) solution was inadequate in both quality and quantity for an optimal RNA extraction. Appropriate protocols were established for each tissue and are being used now for transcriptomic studies in this sentinel organism.

TI  - Multi-Label Data Fusion to Support Agricultural Vulnerability Assessments
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying crop species and varieties adaptable to climate change impacts is one of the main aspects of climate vulnerability assessments. This estimation involves processing, integrating, and analyzing many information sources to provide accurate and timely responses. However, designing this evaluation, examine the information gathered, and reaching agreements among all stakeholders and experts, often requires considerable effort in time, money, and people. In this study, we propose a data fusion strategy to support climate vulnerability assessments by identifying the adaptability of crops in a territory in the short term. This strategy follows the Joint Directors of Laboratories' data fusion model guidelines. It was evaluated and validated through a case study in Colombia's upper Cauca river basin. For this purpose, we identified Climate, Soil, Water Quality, Productive Alliances, and Production as the most relevant data sources to be integrated, and using metrics such as Mean IR, SCUMBLE, TCS, among others, we evaluated the combined datasets according to their theoretical complexity. The adaptability of crops in a territory was addressed as a multi-label learning problem, assessing the performance of different multi-label classification and multi-view multi-label classification models with both test and actual data. Comparing the predicted crops with the actual ones, we obtained a 98% similarity without considering crop ranking using the Binary Relevance approach and the Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms. Using a more exhaustive test involving order, we obtained a maximum similarity of 67% applying Binary Relevance and Random Forest.

TI  - PROTEAN POWER CONCEPT IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: ORIGINS AND PROSPECTS
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to the representatives of other directions in International Relations Science, constructivists have long distanced themselves from the notion of power, but in the 2000s and 2010s, due to the increasing interest in conceptualizing this phenomenon, the first attempts of the constructivist interpretation of the concept of power started to emerge. Such interpretations received their fullest expression in the concept of Protean power, developed by a group of researchers under the informal leadership of Peter Katzenstein.The article analyzes the main features of the Protean power, as well as the emerging practices. The author shows that this type of power is less associated with specific actors and their intentions than other types of power, since it is aimed at overcoming uncertainty under the conditions when it is impossible to calculate risks. This formulation of the question allows one to reconsider the role of the creativity principle in international interactions and provide it with a higher ontological status.According to the author's conclusion, the concept of Protean power continues the line of revising the ontological foundations of the studies of world politics, which has emerged within constructivism in the last decade. Similarly to some other constructivist concepts, this concept implies a holistic interpretation of the phenomenon of power in international relations and reflects the desire to move away from the classical (Newtonian) worldview. Although today it provides many reasons for criticism and, perhaps, needs further elaboration and reinterpretation, its contribution to the scientific discussion of the ontology of power in international interactions is beyond doubt. Protean power is paving the way that allows bypassing the neo-positivist consensus that has so far set the tone in the International Relations Science.

TI  - An Effective Method for Canopy Chlorophyll Content Estimation of Marsh Vegetation Based on Multiscale Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) inversion for marsh vegetation is of great significance for marsh protection and restoration. However, it is difficult to collect the CCC measured data for marsh vegetation that matches the pixel scale of remote sensing image. This article proposes a new method based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images to obtain multiscale marsh vegetation CCC sample data. A random forest (RF) regression algorithm was used to evaluate the application performance of GF-1 wide field view (WFV), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) satellite remote sensing data in marsh vegetation CCC inversion. In addition, parameter optimization of the RF regression model was used to construct an optimization algorithm suitable for marsh vegetation, and the importance of input variables was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that the UAV multispectral images assisted in the acquisition of marsh vegetation CCC sample data, as the method expanded the number of CCC samples while quantifying the CCC sample data collection accuracy [R-2 >= 0.86, root mean square error (RMSE) <= 6.98 SPAD], which improved the CCC inversion accuracy compared with traditional sampling methods. Extracting pure vegetation pixels through binary classification reduces the uncertainty of the UAV-scale CCC inversion results. Parameter optimization of the RF regression model further improves the CCC inversion accuracy at GF-1 WFV, Landsat-8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 MSI scales. Among the three satellite remote sensing data, Sentinel-2 MSI achieved the highest CCC inversion accuracy for marsh vegetation (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 10.96 SPAD) due to the inclusion of red-edge bands that are more sensitive to vegetation properties. Red-edge Chlorophyll Index (Clred-edge) and Green Chlorophyll Index (Cl-green) have the highest influence on the CCC inversion accuracy among input variables.

TI  - Effect of reproduction cycle stage on energy metabolism responses in a sentinel species (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) exposed to cadmium: What consequences for biomonitoring?
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal trace elements such as cadmium (Cd) are commonly present in ecosystems and could lead to impairment of mitochondrial functions and energy imbalance in aquatic organisms including molluscs. Combined exposure to increasing temperatures and Cd could enhance such an impact on animals. Seasonal fluctuations, such as temperature, and the corresponding reproduction cycle can affect biomarker responses. However, the reproduction cycle stage is rarely taken into account in ecotoxicological studies. Thus, this work aimed at understanding energy metabolism responses in a sentinel species, Dreissena polymorpha. Mussels were collected during the rest and the reproduction periods and were exposed to 10 mu g.L-1 of cadmium (Cd) at two temperatures (in situ temperature and in situ temperature + 5 degrees C) during 7 days. Energy metabolism was monitored by measuring reserves and energy nucleotides charge and by assessing aerobic and anaerobic metabolism markers, and upstream regulation pathways. Markers related to OXPHOS activity revealed seasonal variations under laboratory conditions. Conversely, adenylate nucleotides, glycogen, lipid and transcript levels of AMP-activated protein kinase, citrate synthase, ATP synthase and cytochrome b encoding genes remained steady after the acclimation period. No evident effect of Cd on energy metabolism markers was noticed for both exposures although the transcript level of succinate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase encoding genes decreased with Cd during the rest period. Cellular stress, revealed by lipid peroxidation and catalase mRNA levels, only occurred in Cd and warming co-exposed mussels during the reproduction period. These results suggest that contaminant impact might differ according to the reproduction cycle stage. The effect of confounding factors on biomarker variations should be further investigated to have a deeper knowledge of metabolism responses under laboratory conditions.

TI  - Avulsions drive ecosystem services and economic changes in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal wetland is a mosaic of landscapes that brings together rich biodiversity with the valuable activities of fishing, tourism and ranching. Human occupation and land use in the headwaters have intensified the rate of channel avulsions in the lower reaches of the largest megafan on the Taquari River. This study evaluates the longterm changes of landscapes in the active depositional lobe of the Taquari megafan from the perspective of local communities of pantaneiros. Maps derived from multiple decades of multispectral Landsat data have proven useful for studying land cover changes through the relationship between dry (terrestrial vegetation and soil/dry pastures) and humid landscapes (open waters, aquatic macrophytes and wet soils), as well as through Sankey diagrams and spatiotemporal mapping with Boolean operations according to the rate of dryland recovery. We found that dryland recovery associated with an older and smaller avulsion (known as Ze ' da Costa) is analogous to that of a most recent and much larger avulsion (known as Caronal), which is still ongoing and has greater importance due to the scale of the impacts. Land value and fish capture depreciate as the partial Caronal avulsion still evolves, increasing the likelihood of environmental conflicts. While pantaneiros no longer profit from ecosystem services of provision (e.g., livestock or fishing), dryland recovery may deliver quantifiable ecosystem services of regulation. The strengthening of partnerships among stakeholders and the implementation of environmental compensation mechanisms are central for the best management of the Pantanal's megafans that ensure quality of life for all pantaneiros.

TI  - Climatology of the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) Version 2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Combined ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) Version 2 (V002) has been available since March 2019 from the NASA LP DAAC (Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center) and provides global, monthly infrared land surface emissivity and uncertainty at 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) resolution. A climatology of the CAMEL V002 product is now available at the same spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, covering the CAMEL record from 2000 to 2016. Characterization of the climatology over case sites and IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) land cover categories shows the climatology is a stable representation of the monthly CAMEL emissivity. Time series of the monthly CAMEL V002 product show realistic seasonal changes but also reveal subtle artifacts known to be from calibration and processing errors in the MODIS MxD11 emissivity. The use of the CAMEL V002 climatology mitigates many of these time dependent errors by providing an emissivity estimate which represents the complete 16-year record. The CAMEL V002 climatology's integration into RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) v12 is demonstrated through the simulation of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) radiances. Improved stability in CAMEL Version 3 is expected in the future with the incorporation of the new MxD21 and VIIRS VNP21 emissivity products in MODIS Collection 6.1.

TI  - Crop identification by massive processing of multiannual satellite imagery for EU common agriculture policy subsidy control
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The early and automatic identification of crops declared by farmers is essential for streamlining European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payment processes. Currently, field inspections are partial, expensive and entail a considerable delay in the process. Chronological satellite images of cultivated plots can be used so that neural networks can form the model of the declared crop. Once the patterns of a crop are obtained, the correspondence of the declaration with the model of the neural network can be systematically predicted, and can be used for monitoring the CAP. In this article, we propose a learning model with neural networks, using as examples of training the pixels of the cultivated plots from the satellite images over a period of time. We also propose using several years in the training model to generalise the patterns without linking them to the climatic characteristics of a specific year. The article also describes the use of the model in learning the multi-year pattern of tobacco cultivation with very good results.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing vegetation normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes, climate change characteristics, and their response relationship have a great significance to the ecosystem's regulation and improvement the human settlements. Based on GIMMS AVHRR NDVI and MODIS NDVI datasets as well as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration data, this study used unitary linear trend analysis, correlation analysis, RS, and GIS data to analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of vegetation NDVI in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River between 1989 and 2018. It also analyzed the spatiotemporal response between vegetation NDVI and climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration). The results showed that the vegetation NDVI in the study area had an increasing trend over the past 30 years, growing by 31.28%, and the NDVI change in 81.83% of the pixels was positive, the highest being 0.025. The temperature in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River showed an obvious upward trend, showing an overall distribution pattern of low temperature in the southwest and high temperature in the southeast. The precipitation showed a gentle upward trend and a spatial distribution pattern of a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest. The sunshine duration showed an obvious decreasing trend and a spatial distribution pattern of gradually increasing from southeast to northwest. In the past 30 years, the annual mean NDVI in the study area had a positive correlation with temperature and precipitation and a negative correlation with sunshine duration.

AB  - Accurate satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) with high-quality and fine spatio-temporal resolutions play crucial roles in the meteorological analysis and the research of the global water cycle. The FY-4A is the first satellite of China's FengYun4 satellite series (FY4 series), the most recent and advanced generation of meteorological satellite operated by China. In this study, China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA, 0.1 degrees/hourly) dataset, generated by combining data of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) with the Climate precipitation center Morphing (CMORPH), was adopted to calibrating and evaluating the FY-4A QPE (0.04/degrees/half-hourly) by Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation Calibration Algorithm (STDCA), over Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau (YKP). Additionally, we generate new precipitation data called CFY QPE by combining FY4A QPE with CMPA based on STDCA, which has the finer spatiotemporal resolution and higher-quality data. The results indicate that CMPA is suitable in anchoring FY4A QPE, and the systematic biases and random errors of CFY QPE are significantly reduced, especially with a better correlation against gauge in terms of CC (similar to 0.78) and mKGE (similar to 0.7). Besides, the capabilities of capturing precipitation events on CFY QPE significantly improved with POD (similar to 0.82) and FAR (similar to 0.25). Collectively, the significant advantages of STDCA are shown in improving the quality of FY4A QPE.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of Spatial-temporal Changes in Eco-environment Quality in Beijing Based on Remote Sensing Ecological Index with Google Earth Engine
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective and quantitative monitoring of spatial-temporal changes in eco-environment quality is critical for urban sustainable development and policymaking. In this study, four ecological factors (greenness, wetness, heat, and dryness) of Beijing were obtained by integrating MODIS imagery in each year from 2001 to 2020. Then, a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI), which is employed to assess the eco-environment quality, based on the four factors was constructed by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Finally, the spatial-temporal changes in RSEI over the 20 years were analyzed. The results show that the eco-environment quality of Beijing improved from 2001 to 2020, with the average RSEI increasing from 0.586 in 2001 to 0.64 in 2020. The eco-environment quality in the mountainous areas of Beijing is higher than that in the urban areas. The area exhibiting deterioration decreased from 23.46% between 2001 and 2005 to 8.66% between 2015 and 2020, while the area with improved eco-environment quality increased from 13.04% between 2001 and 2005 to 21.64% between 2015 and 2020. We have thus assessed the spatial-temporal changes in eco-environment quality based on RSEI and GEE, which is critical to the investigation of the interactions between human activities and ecosystem services in Beijing.

TI  - Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network-Based Hyperspectral Image Resolution Enhancement via an Auxiliary Panchromatic Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the limits of incident energy and hardware system, hyperspectral (HS) images always suffer from low spatial resolution, compared with multispectral (MS) or panchromatic (PAN) images. Therefore, image fusion has emerged as a useful technology that is able to combine the characteristics of high spectral and spatial resolutions of HS and PAN/MS images. In this paper, a novel HS and PAN image fusion method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. The proposed method incorporates the ideas of both hyper-sharpening and MS pan-sharpening techniques, thereby employing a two-stage cascaded CNN to reconstruct the anticipated high-resolution HS image. Technically, the proposed CNN architecture consists of two sub-networks, the detail injection sub-network and unmixing sub-network. The former aims at producing a latent high-resolution MS image, whereas the latter estimates the desired high-resolution abundance maps by exploring the spatial and spectral information of both HS and MS images. Moreover, two model-training fashions are presented in this paper for the sake of effectively training our network. Experiments on simulated and real remote sensing data demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the spatial resolution and spectral fidelity of HS image, and achieve better performance than some state-of-the-art HS pan-sharpening algorithms.

TI  - Detection of Fire Smoke Plumes Based on Aerosol Scattering Using VIIRS Data over Global Fire-Prone Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke from fires significantly influences climate, weather, and human health. Fire smoke is traditionally detected using an aerosol index calculated from spectral contrast changes. However, such methods usually miss thin smoke plumes. It also remains challenging to accurately separate smoke plumes from dust, clouds, and bright surfaces. To improve smoke plume detections, this paper presents a new scattering-based smoke detection algorithm (SSDA) depending mainly on visible and infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) blue and green bands. The SSDA is established based on the theory of Mie scattering that occurs when the diameter of an atmospheric particulate is similar to the wavelength of the scattered light. Thus, smoke commonly causes Mie scattering in VIIRS blue and green bands because of the close correspondence between smoke particulate diameters and the blue/green band wavelengths. For developing the SSDA, training samples were selected from global fire-prone regions in North America, South America, Africa, Indonesia, Siberia, and Australia. The SSDA performance was evaluated against the VIIRS aerosol detection product and smoke detections from the ultraviolet aerosol index using manually labeled fire smoke plumes as a benchmark. Results show that the SSDA smoke detections are superior to existing products due chiefly to the improved ability of the algorithm to detect thin smoke and separate fire smoke from other surface types. Moreover, the SSDA smoke distribution pattern exhibits a high spatial correlation with the global fire density map, suggesting that SSDA is capable of detecting smoke plumes of fires in near real-time across the globe.

TI  - Investigation the Robustness of Standard Classification Methods for Defining Urban Heat Islands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of studying the spatiotemporal cause mechanism of urban heat island (UHI) effects, the classification method used will directly affect the robustness of urban surface heat classification. Applying five commonly used standard classification methods, we divided Beijing's urban surface temperatures in the summer of 2020 into five levels. We then compared the reliability of the five classification methods in resolving 12-period data and the seasonal average temperature in UHI patches, based on two indicators: UHI area and UHI intensity. The actual land-use composition of the UHI patches obtained with traditional methods was applied to confirm our results. The mean-standard deviation method and natural breaks (Jenks) method were more robust with regard to UHI classification and 12-period data reliability. For the UHI area index, the mean-standard deviation method produced the smallest total area of UHI patches for summer days and nights. For the UHI intensity index, the quantile method, mean-standard deviation method, and natural breaks (Jenks) method were associated with smaller errors. Considering the composition of land-use types in UHI patches, the mean-standard deviation method, and natural breaks (Jenks) method were more rigorous. Thus, our research results provide guidance for method selection when classifying UHI.

TI  - CMODH Validation for C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar HH Polarization Wind Retrieval Over the Ocean
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new HH-polarized geophysical model function (GMF), called CMODH, has been proposed recently for C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ocean surface wind speed retrieval. CMODH has the potential to be directly used to retrieve wind speed from HH-polarized SAR images without converting the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) from HH- into VV-polarization using various empirical and theoretical polarization ratio (PR) models. However, the capability of CMODH for wind speed retrieval has not been comprehensively validated. In this letter, as a case study, two C-band HH-polarized SAR images acquired in RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) quad-polarization and Sentinel-1A (S1-1A) dual-polarization modes are first used to examine the CMODH performance. The wind speeds estimated using CMODH are shown to be consistent with buoy winds. A statistical comparison is then carried out to further validate CMODH using collocated 1457 C-band RS-2 and 284 S1-1A/B HH-polarized SAR images and 110 in situ buoys. The results show that the CMODH-retrieved wind speeds are in good agreement with buoy measurements, with a bias of 0.07 and 0.49 m/s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.66 and 2.05 m/s for RS-2 and S1-1A/B, respectively. Compared to hybrid models, such as CMOD5.N and various PR models, CMODH achieves the smallest RMSE for wind speed retrieval. Moreover, for the first time, it is shown that the wind speed retrieval capability of CMODH is better than that of CMOD5.N for incidence angles between 30 degrees and 49 degrees and wind speeds between 10 and 20 m/s, which provides a new prospective on wind retrieval improvement using a combination of VV- and HH-polarized SAR observations.

TI  - The impacts of the ecological water diversion project on the ecology-hydrology-economy nexus in the lower reaches in an inland river basin
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyse the comprehensive effects of an ecological water diversion project (EWDP) and its driving mechanism since 2000 in Heihe River Basin (HRB) in Northwest China. We compared the hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic changes in the period of 1985-2015, revealed the relationships between them using linear regression method, and discussed their internal mechanisms referring to the long-term monitoring data, statistics data, field surveys and remote sensing data. We found that the hydrological regime in the region downstream of Langxinshan Hydrological Station (LXS region) in the lower HRB has changed, with an increase of annual discharge as well as obvious differences in the infra-annual distribution of monthly runoff. As a result, the groundwater level in most of the LXS region has risen, but the changes of the chemical characteristics of the groundwater were not significant. Meanwhile, the vegetation has been remarkably restored, and the water and wetland continually expanded suggesting that the degraded environment in the LXS region has gradually been rehabilitated. Additionally, the regional economy has developed rapidly, with a rapid increase of value-added tertiary industry due to the explosive growth of the tourist population. Along with the EWDP, other policies and projects have played an important role in restoring the ecology. The hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic systems have formed feedback loops in the LXS region, but there is still need to coordinate the relationships between water resource, ecosystem and socio-economy by considering water carrying capacity and water production efficiency and thinking of them as a nexus.

AB  - Purpose To spare DCIS patients from overtreatment, treatment de-escalated over the years. This study evaluates the influence of these developments on the patterns of care in the treatment of DCIS with particular interest in the use of breast conserving surgery (BCS), radiotherapy following BCS and the use and type of axillary staging. Methods In this large population-based cohort study all women, aged 50-74 years diagnosed with DCIS from January 1989 until January 2019, were analyzed per two-year cohort. Results A total of 30,417 women were diagnosed with DCIS. The proportion of patients undergoing BCS increased from 47.7% in 1995-1996 to 72.7% in 2017-2018 (p < 0.001). Adjuvant radiotherapy following BCS increased from 28.9% (1995-1996) to 89.6% (2011-2012) and subsequently decreased to 74.9% (2017-2018; p < 0.001). Since its introduction, the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) increased to 63.1% in 2013-2014 and subsequently decreased to 52.8% in 2017-2018 (p < 0.001). Axillary surgery is already omitted in 55.8% of the patients undergoing BCS nowadays. The five-year invasive relapse-free survival (iRFS) for BCS with adjuvant radiotherapy in the period 1989-2010, was 98.7% [CI 98.4% - 99.0%], compared to 95.0% [CI 94.1% -95.8%] for BCS only (p < 0.001). In 2011-2018, this was 99.3% [CI 99.1% - 99.5%] and 98.8% [CI 98.2% - 99.4%] respectively (p = 0.01). Conclusions This study shows a shift toward less extensive treatment. DCIS is increasingly treated with BCS and less often followed by additional radiotherapy. The absence of radiotherapy still results in excellent iRFS. Axillary surgery is increasingly omitted in DCIS patients.

TI  - INTERPRETATION OF THE IDEA OF MONOTHEISM IN THE CHAPTER <i>ON THE ONENESS OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD</i> FROM THE POEM BY MAJDUD SANAI <i>THE GARDEN OF THE TRUTH...</i>

AB  - According to the canon of the Persian poetre, every mathnavi-poem begins with a preamble, devoted to the divine oneness and known in the tradition as tawhid. These preambles give rich material for research into the way the author interprets the Islamic key doctrine, i.e. monotheism (tawhid). Historically, these preambles originate from the Islamic tradition to begin each affair with the words that open the Quranic text. The tawhid preambles may be regarded as an extended version of this formula. Majdud Sanai is the founder of the Sufi philosophical and didactic epic. His works were used by the later authors, e.g. Farid al-Din Attar, Jalal al-Din Rumi, and others. Despite the place that Sanai occupies in the development of the Persian Sufi poetry, there are not much data that allow us to reconstruct his biography, though his texts provide an opportunity to learn much about his worldview. The main focus of the article is the key elements of the chapter devoted specifically to the topic of monotheism, On the Oneness of the Almighty God, that opens the poem The Garden of the Truth and the Law of the Path. The article demonstrates the specificity of Sanai's approach to solving the problem of divine oneness. Unlike other authors, e.g. Mahmud Shabistari, Sanai, when discussing the question about God's oneness, emphasises not the unity of God's oneness or essence (tawhid al-dhat), but the unity of God's actions (tawhid al-af`al). To Sanai, monotheism means to regard God as the only true actor, withut whom nothing can go over from movement to rest and from rest to movement. This interpretation of God's unity has had a great effect on the status of the world in Sanai's philosophy. The article also contains the first Russian translation of the tawhid preamble On the Oneness of the Almighty God to the poem The Garden of the Truth and the Law of the Path; the translatio is accompanied with a detailed commentary.

TI  - Infrared satellite-derived sea surface skin temperature sensitivity to aerosol vertical distribution- Field data analysis and model simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature is an Essential Climate Variable. The radiative impact of mineral dust is one of the major contributors to inaccuracies in the satellite-retrieved sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin). Different aerosol dust vertical distributions have varying effects on the satellite-derived SSTskin. To further investigate the physical mechanisms of aerosol effects on Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) derived SSTskin, the aerosol radiative effects were studied with a field-data match-up analysis and radiative transfer simulations. The field data are measurements of the SSTskin derived from highly accurate ship-based infrared spectrometers vertical atmospheric temperature and water vapor radiosonde profiles. The aerosol dust concentrations in three-dimensions from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 have been used as input to radiative transfer simulations. Based on the analysis field data and simulations, we have empirically determined that the sensitivity of the Terra MODIS retrieved SSTskin accuracies is related to 1) dust concentration the atmosphere, 2) the dust layer altitude, and 3) the dust layer temperature. As the aerosol altitude increases, the effect on the SSTskin retrievals becomes more negative in proportion to the temperature contrast with the sea surface. SSTskin differences, satellite-derived surface measurements, for a given aerosol layer optical depth vary between-3 K and 1 K according to our match-up comparisons and radiative transfer simulations.

AB  - Oil spill is considered as one of the main pollutants in the sea. The detection and automatic identification of marine oil film is very important to reduce the loss caused by marine pollution. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the ability to work all day and all-weather, and is not affected by bad weather. It is one of the effective means of oil spill monitoring. Sentinel-1 SAR image dataset is a historical SAR image classified and marked by ships and land in the sea area with suspected oil leakage background .Using the deep learning semantic segmentation method, Deeplabv3+ network with Resnet101 as the backbone is adopted, the atrous rate of atrous convolution is changed, the hop connection layer is added, and the semantic information is added to improve the semantic segmentation effect, and the average IOU reaches 66.5% The results show that the improved neural network based on Deeplabv3+ can effectively segment SAR oil spills and improve the segmentation accuracy of SAR images.

TI  - Iterative-SGLRT for Multiple-Scatterer Detection in SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter introduces a multiple-scatterer detection method in synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR), named iterative sequential generalized likelihood ratio test (iterative-SGLRT). In this technique, the number of scatterers is sequentially decided by the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) pixel by pixel, after iteratively estimating the parameters. It is a good tradeoff of the aforeproposed methods of sup-GLRT and fast-sup-GLRT on accuracy and efficiency. Simulated comparisons showed that iterative-SGLRT outperformed fast-sup-GLRT on the performances of detection probability and accuracy without substantial computation time increase, and compared with sup-GLRT, its performance loss could be negligible with computational burden greatly reduced. In addition, both iterative-SGLRT and sup-GLRT have been applied to the TerraSAR-X data set over Shenzhen city. The 3-D reconstruction of the test site and the separation of the overlaid scatterers have been achieved. In addition, verification using light detection and radar (LiDAR) indicated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1 rho(s) for both methods of the height estimated. Accordingly, iterative-SGLRT is very suitable for large urban area processing for its super-resolution, high efficiency, and robustness.

TI  - Monitoring Recent Lake Variations Under Climate Change Around the Altai Mountains Using Multimission Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating lake dynamics is vital for the accurate evaluation of climate change and water resources monitoring. However, it remains a challenge to estimate the lake mass budget due to extremely scarce in situ data, especially for alpine regions. In this article, multimission remote sensing observations were blended to examine recent lake variations and their responses to climate change around the Altai Mountains during 2001-2009 and 2010-1018. First, the multitemporal Landsat images were used to enable the detailed monitoring of the surface extent of 43 lakes (>= 5 km(2)) around the Altai Mountains from 2001 to 2018. The results presented that the total lake surface extent shrunk from 9835 km(2) in 2001 to a minimum of 9652 km(2) in 2009, while subsequently rose to 9714 km(2) in 2018. By combining the lake area with the water level derived from the ICESat and CryoSat-2 altimetry data, the water storage of seven lakes covering similar to 84% of the overall lake area in the region was obtained. The total water storage was detected with a decrease of 4.86 +/- 1.17 km(3) from 2003 to 2009 and a decrease of 3.65 +/- 1.16 km(3) from 2010 to 2018, respectively. Although most of the glaciers in this region had a significant mass loss in the past decades, the factor analysis indicated that most of the lakes had maintained a steady or slightly changing tendency because the glacial melting water was counteracted by the negative impact of high evapotranspiration amount. For the lakes with a few glacier melting supplies, e.g., the Uvs lake and Hyargas lake, the significant water budget loss was caused by the increasing evapotranspiration, decreased precipitation, and developed animal husbandry, which mainly dominated the overall decreasing trend of lake water storage in the Altai Mountains.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of MODIS Land Surface Temperature Based on a Geographically and Temporally Weighted Autoregressive Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter in numerous environmental studies. However, currently, there is no satellite sensor that can completely provide LST data with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions simultaneously. LST downscaling is regarded as an effective remedy for improving the temporal and spatial resolutions of LST data. In this article, a geographically and temporally weighted autoregressive (GTWAR) model of LST downscaling is that comprehensively considers the spatial heterogeneity, spatial autoregression, and temporality of LST is newly proposed. The normalized difference water index, the normalized difference built-up index, and the normalized difference vegetation index were selected as explanatory variables to downscale the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST from 1000 to 100 m, while the Landsat 8 LST was selected as the reference data. Compared with the thermal data sharpening (TsHARP), the geographically weighted regression (GWR), the geographically weighted autoregressive (GWAR) and the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) downscaling methods, the proposed method was superior based on quantitative indices, with the lowest root mean square error (Zhangye: 1.57 degrees C, Beijing: 1.22 degrees C) and mean absolute error (Zhangye: 1.06 degrees C, Beijing: 0.85 degrees C). The downscaling model of GTWAR will facilitate improvements in the accuracy of downscaling for temporal series of LST data.

TI  - Research on Change Detection Method of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Subpixel Convolution
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image change detection method plays a great role in land cover research, disaster assessment, medical diagnosis, video surveillance, and other fields, so it has attracted wide attention. Based on a small sample dataset from SZTAKI Air-Change Benchmark Set, in order to solve the problem that the deep learning network needs a large number of samples, this work first uses nongenerative sample augmentation method and generative sample augmentation method based on deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, and then, constructs a remote sensing image change detection model based on an improved DeepLabv3+ network. This model can realize end-to-end training and prediction of remote sensing image change detection with subpixel convolution. Finally, Landsat 8, Google Earth, and Onera satellite change detection datasets are used to verify the generalization performance of this network. The experimental results show that the improved network accuracy is 95.1% and the generalization performance is acceptable.

T2  - ENCOUNTERS IN THEORY AND HISTORY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Political education is always actual because it maintains an intimate union with democracy that, in turn, experiences internal developments in the function of political life. Because of this, pedagogy has a vigilant role to discern the paths and challenges that democracies pose to political education, and that's where this article comes from: the identification and analysis of new scenarios that affect both democracies and political education: patriotism, radicalization, sustainable development, and sexual identity. Each scenario yields a different result that can be synthesized around three basic ideas: that political education today is to combine unity with diversity, dialogue, and practical life.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of remote sensing images and poor quality limit the performance improvement of follow-up research such as remote sensing interpretation. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed for data augmentation of remote sensing images abstracted from Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces in China, i.e., deeply supervised GAN (D-sGAN). D-sGAN can generate high-quality images that are rich in changes, greatly shorten the generation time, and provide data support for applications such as semantic interpretation of remote sensing images. First, to modulate the layer activations, a downsampling scheme is designed based on the segmentation map. Then, the architecture of the generator is Unet++ with the proposed downsampling module. Next, the generator of this net is deeply supervised by the discriminator using deep convolutional neural network. This article further proved that the proposed downsampling module and the dense connection characteristics of UNet++ are significantly beneficial to the retention of semantic information of remote sensing images. Numerical results demonstrated that the images generated by D-sGAN could be used to improve accuracy of the segmentation network, with the faster generation speed compared to the CoGAN, SimGAN, and CycleGAN models. Furthermore, the remote sensing data generated by the model helped the interpretation network to increase the accuracy by 9%, meeting actual generation requirements.

TI  - Diagnostic Analysis on Change Vector Analysis Methods for LCCD Using Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change vector analysis (CVA) is a simple yet attractive method to detect changes with remote sensing images. Since its first introduction in 1980, CVA has received increased attention from the remote sensing community, leading to the definition of several new methodologies based on the CVAs concept while extending its applicability. In this article, we provide an extensive review of CVA-based approaches in the context of land-cover change detection (LCCD). We first reviewed the development of the CVA-based LCCD method with remote sensing images, and some classical-related methods were discussed. Then, we analyze and compare the performance of five selected methods. The analysis was carried out on seven real datasets acquired by different sensors and platforms (e.g., Landsat, Quick Bird, and airborne) and spatial resolutions (from 0.5 to 30 m/pixel), with scenes from both urban and natural landscapes. The analysis shows several Moreover, comparing the detection accuracies of different methods implies that the content of an image scene still plays an important role when disregarding the unique preferences of different methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf)
CL  - IEEE Atlanta Sect, ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Radio frequency interference (RFI) usually mixed into the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system as a direct wave, which can significantly degrade the SAR image quality, including amplitude, phase and geometry, etc. In this paper, a new form of RFI, namely the mutual RFI (MRFI), which is a kind of scatter-wave RFI originating from the nearby ground area simultaneously illuminated by different SAR satellites, was investigated. In order to solve the issue of MRFI, a novel RFI detector based on spectrum energy cancellation (SEC) and a RFI mitigation technology based on improved eigen-subspace projection (ESP) method are proposed. In this work, a systematic analysis of MRFI is performed, and the proposed mitigation process is introduced. Finally, experiments accomplished over GaoFen-3 single look complex (SLC) data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

TI  - THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION LEGISLATION FORMATION IN THE FIELD OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE CONSTRUCTION
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to substantiating the philosophical and legal approach to the law within the framework of the formation of a legal framework in the field of creating a qualitatively new system of local self-government. The article examines the problems of jurisprudence from the standpoint of the philosophy of law within the framework of local government. In the article, the author also examines the historical and methodological aspects of the development of the philosophical foundations of the formation of the system of local self-government as the most important moment in the formation of European liberalism due to its genesis. The purpose of the article is to describe the direct influence of the philosophy of law on the formation and development of the legal worldview of building a system of local self-government. Throughout its history, the European Union has developed a set of standards on which local selfgovernment systems of EU member states and applicants for this status are built. The complexity and simultaneous importance of legislative regulation of the functioning of this system are evidenced by the fact that the legislation and principles of international law used by the EU in the field of local self-government are among the "youngest" ones.

CP  - 15th European Conference on Game Based Learning (ECGBL)

AB  - This article explores didactic planning in relation to 360-degree virtual reality through the application PartyLab (ed. In Danish FestLab). PartyLab is a Danish educational 360-degree application for alcohol prevention for young adults (ages 15 to 17). The application is used in a virtual reality headset, which results in an immersive experience with an intense feeling of presence. The application consists of 125 different 360-degree movie sequences, which students steer through, through choice making. Hereby students get the opportunity to experiment with alcohol in a safe environment and test different approaches towards consuming alcohol. This results in each user having a unique experience. It is examined how didactic material can be designed to support the experiential learning that takes place in the application. The material is designed through an iterative process with evaluation by schoolteachers, SSPs (a unit of collaboration between schools, social services, and police) and later in a real-life setting in schools. This paper describes the first two iterations, which contain the development of the first edition of the teaching material, evaluation by schoolteachers and adaption of the material followed by evaluation of SSPs. The current material consists of a learning guidance that will enable the general schoolteacher to facilitate the learning course (including the use of VR headsets) and students' assignments to support the learning in the application. It was found that a very thorough guide for the teachers running the course is necessary, due to little or no experience with virtual reality and limited time for preparation. Moreover, using the application several times, with room for reflection on class and assignments on blood alcohol concentration could enhance students learning. Moreover, it was found, that assignments on alcohol consumption should be carefully introduced and not deal with high intake of alcohol, as it could create an incorrect worldview and thus promote alcohol consumption instead of preventing it.

TI  - Sociological Narrative of Suicidal Behavior Among Older People
T2  - CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Globally, suicide is regarded as an immoral behavior and can be considered a criminal act in some societies. Sociological narrative views suicide not only as a result of mental illness suffered by the individuals but may also be caused by the social environment and other risk factors.Purpose: The objective of this study is to examine the social risk factors that drive older people to have suicidal feelings or tendencies and the extent to which these factors arise from the changes that occur in their social environment as a result of the process of modernization and industrialization.Methods: This study employed the phenomenological approach through qualitative data collection technique. A total of 20 informants comprising 10 males and 10 females of Malay, Chinese and Indian ethnicity were selected for the study using purposive sampling technique. In-depth interviews were conducted with the informants. Data were transcribed and subsequently analyzed thematically using the NVivo 11 software.Results: The findings revealed five conditions that led older people toward suicidal intentions. These include social and cultural changes, lack of social support, conflict in religious belief, influence of economic uncertainty and socio-economic status, and depression as a result of the changes in their social environment.Conclusion: The implication of this research is that these factors affect older people directly as they struggle to adapt and respond to the major changes that occur in the social structure of the society they live in, stemming from the process of modernization and industrialization. Efforts to enact better policies and services for older people need to be addressed especially in developing countries based on assessment of their needs, weaknesses, strengths, and capabilities by incorporating elements of the worldview of the older people based on their experiences of daily lives.

In this paper, the RCM data are used for the first time to detect sea ice in the Eastern Arctic area with a pixel-based classifier. HH, HV, cross polarization ratio, and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features are extracted from the dual-polarized RCM data with a medium resolution (50m) for a random forest classification model. The overall detection accuracy (over 90%) confirms the superior capacity of RCM data for sea ice monitoring.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Nitrous Oxide Concentration in China
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieves nitrous oxide profiles from the thermal infrared satellite data, the results will be affected by the impact of atmospheric parameters such as atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, as well as surface parameters such as surface temperature and surface emissivity and the like. N2O own changes to a lesser extent, so when using the optimal estimation inversion, to get a priori profile and to select the inversion channel are the keys. Therefore, the inversion of nitrous oxide is rarely seen in China. Study and analyze the absorption characteristics of nitrous oxide and other interfering gases in the thermal infrared region for channel selection, based on this, to retrieve and analyze the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of nitrous oxide concentrationis of great practical significance for the study of global climate change in China. In this paper, under the inversion framework of the optimal estimation method, an optimal sensitive profile channel selection method is used to retrieve the nitrous oxide concentration using the AIRS data. Compared with the Canadian station in the TCCON observation network, the results show that the retrieval results are in good agreement with the ground observations, and the correlation coefficient r is 0. 73. This algorithm can be extended to the thermal infrared hyperspectral data such as IASI and CrIS, and increase the observation data of nitrous oxide to more than 20 years. This long-time series product is an effective supplement to the current ground observation. The annual and monthly mean changes of nitrous oxide and its spatial distribution characteristics in China are analyzed for the first time. The results show that the change of thenitrous oxide concentration is obvious with time and latitude, among which the annual change of the nitrous oxide concentration is small, and the monthly and seasonal meanvalue changes greatly. From January of each year, the concentration of nitrous oxide increased month by month, reached the maximum in July and August, and then began to decline month by month. The seasonal variation was the highest in summer (June-gust), spring and autumn are the second, while winter is the lowest. According to the annual average, the concentration of nitrous oxide in China changes obviously with latitude, and the higher the latitude is, the lower the concentration is. High-value regions are mainly concentrated in South China, especially in summer. The low-value regions are north China and southwest China. In the west of China, the concentration of nitrous oxide is higher in summer. In addition to local emissions, this seasonal or monthly mean change is also affected by air convection and transport.

However, a unified signal system cannot currently realize high precision positioning and high speed data transmission simultaneously in satellite navigation and communications integration. Therefore, a new integrated signal model for navigation and communication was proposed in this paper. This signal uses traditional navigation signal as pilot signals to realize synchronization, and Cyclic Code Shift Keying(CCSK) signals as communication signals to transfer data. Theoretical analysis and simulation show this signal improves the transmission rate of satellite data and has strong compatibility with Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS). And the feasibility of the signal was verified through the hardware platform.

TI  - Light-YOLOv4: An Edge-Device Oriented Target Detection Method for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most deep-learning-based target detection methods have high computational complexity and memory consumption, and they are difficult to deploy on edge devices with limited computing resources and memory. To tackle this problem, this article proposes to learn a lightweight detector named Light-YOLOv4, and it is obtained from YOLOv4 through model compression. To this end, first, we perform sparsity training by applying L1 regularization to the channel scaling factors, so the less important channels and layers can be found. Second, channel pruning and layer pruning are enforced on the network to prune the less important parts, which could significantly reduce network's width and depth. Third, the pruned model is retrained with a knowledge distillation method to improve the detection accuracy. Fourth, the model is quantized from FP32 to FP16, and it could further accelerate the model with almost no loss of detection accuracy. Finally, to evaluate Light-YOLOv4's performance on edge devices, Light-YOLOv4 is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experiments on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) demonstrate that the model size, parameter size, and FLOPs of Light-YOLOv4 have been reduced by 98.63%, 98.66%, and 91.30% compared with YOLOv4, and the detection speed has been increased to 4.2x. While the detection accuracy of Light-YOLOv4 is only slightly reduced, for example, the mAP has only reduced by 0.013. Besides, experiments on the Gaofen Airplane dataset also prove the feasibility of Light-YOLOv4. Moreover, compared with other state-of-the-art methods, such as SSD and FPN, Light-YOLOv4 is more suitable for edge devices.

TI  - Monitoring Hybrid Rice Phenology at Initial Heading Stage Based on Low-Altitude Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of hybrid rice phenology (RP) is crucial for breeding rice cultivars and controlling fertilizing amount. The aim of this study is to monitor the exact date of hybrid rice initial heading stage (IHSDAS) based on low-altitude remote sensing data and analyze the influence factors of RP. In this study, six field experiments were conducted in Ezhou city and Lingshui city from 2016 to 2019, which involved different rice cultivars and nitrogen rates. Three low-altitude remote sensing platforms were used to collect rice canopy reflectance. Firstly, we compared the performance of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge) for monitoring RP. Secondly, double logistic function (DLF), asymmetric gauss function (AGF), and symmetric gauss function (SGF) were used to fit time-series CIred edge for acquiring phenological curves (PC), the feature: maximum curvature (MC) of PC was extracted to monitor IHSDAS. Finally, we analyzed the influence of rice cultivars, N rates, and air temperature on RP. The results indicated that CIred edge was more appropriate than NDVI for monitoring RP without saturation problem. Compared with DLF and AGF, SGF could fit CIred edge without over fitting problem. MC of SGF_CIred edge from all three platforms showed good performance in monitoring IHSDAS with good robustness, R-2 varied between 0.82 and 0.95, RMSE ranged from 2.31 to 3.81. In addition, the results demonstrated that high air temperature might cause a decrease of IHSDAS, and the growth process of rice was delayed when more nitrogen fertilizer was applied before IHSDAS. This study illustrated that low-altitude remote sensing technology could be used for monitoring field-scale hybrid rice IHSDAS accurately.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Ecosystem Structure in the Water-Land Interaction Area of Nansi Lake Based on Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ecological environment with remote sensing technology is an effective means of environmental management and sustainable development. Based on Landsat image data and field survey data, this paper used the unweighted voting multi-classifier ensemble method to extract the ecosystem cover data of the water-land interaction area of Nansi Lake from 1987 to 2017, and analyzed the evolution characteristics of the ecosystem structure with the help of the transfer matrix and landscape pattern index. The results showed: (1) The accuracy of multi-classifier ensemble was higher than that of single classifier, with a maximum improvement of 4.17%. (2) In 2006, the change inflection point of ecosystem structure appeared in the study area, which showed that the trend of increase and decrease of ecosystem area changed, and the degree of landscape fragmentation was the lowest. The structure and type transfer of the ecosystem in the study area showed the characteristics of "ring" distribution, and the distribution and transfer of ecosystem at the junction of land and water and land were more complex. (3) Human activities under the intervention of China's policies, climate change and ecosystem self-regulation were the main driving factors for the change of ecosystem structure in the study area. This study provided technical methods for the further exploration of the ecosystem, and provided constructive guidance for the protection and sustainable development of ecological environment.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Turbidity for Lakes in Northeast China Using Sentinel-2 Images With Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality of inland lakes and reservoirs is a great concern for the public and government in China. Water turbidity is a reliable and direct indicator that can reflect the water quality. Remote sensing has become an efficient technology for monitoring large-scale water turbidity. This study aims to search an optimal regression model to accurately predict water turbidity using remote sensing data. To achieve this goal, 187 water samples were collected from field campaigns across Northeast China, in 2018, of which the samples were gathered within +/- 6 days of Sentinel-2 overpasses. The spectral reflectance data was used as independent variables for modeling. The simple regression, partial least squares regression, support vector regression, extreme learning machine, back-propagation neural network, classification and regression tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor were used to compare. From model validation, we identified GBDT as the best regression model (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 9.90 NTU, MAE = 6.71 NTU). We applied GBDT to retrieve the water turbidity and obtained a satisfactory result. Feature selection technique from tree-based ensemble method was also tested. We selected B2, B3, B4, and B5 as the important variables because of their high ability to explain the variation of turbidity. These results demonstrated the significance of using a promising method to retrieve water turbidity using Sentinel-2 imagery at the regional scale. It is beneficial to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of water turbidity; support water quality management and inland water environment protection.

TI  - The oasis regional small and medium lake water transparency monitoring research and impact factor analysis based on field data combined with high resolution GF-1 satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency is an important parameter to characterize water quality of rivers, lakes and wetlands. We measured the water quality data such as water transparency and the water spectral data of Shahu Lake. GF-1 image data were preprocessed to assure that the measured data were consistent with the reflectance curve of the remote sensing image data, and then selected an empirical method and semi-empirical/semi-analysis method of water transparency for remote sensing estimation of water transparency and constructed a remote sensing estimation model suitable for studying the water transparency of Shahu Lake. The new model was combined with GF-1 image data to analyze the total temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the water. The results showed that the empirical model based on the measured band 1/B4 of the spectral data was the best model for water transparency remote sensing estimation of Shahu Lake. The model was expression: SD = 0.3336 x (1/B1) + 27.94. The coefficient of determination of the verification model was 0.7454. The estimation of the water transparency model showed that the water in Shahu Lake has the transparency of the central lake and intake was higher and the transparency of the Third Drainage, Bird Island and Old Wharf were lower compared to each region. These findings were consistent with the measured numerical characteristics. The transparency of Shahu Lake is mainly affected by the water quality index, tourism activities, ecological hydration and distribution of reeds.

TI  - Characterization and Evaluation of MODIS-Derived Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for Monitoring Drought from 2001 to 2017 over Inner Mongolia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner Mongolia is one of the main green production bases of agricultural and animal husbandry products. Due to factors such as natural geographical location, drought occurs frequently in Inner Mongolia. Based on the MOD16 product and the method of crop water stress index (CWSI) combined with multi-year precipitation and temperature data, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and major influencing factors of drought in Inner Mongolia from 2001 to 2017 were analyzed. In order to provide effective scientific basis for drought control and drought resistance in Inner Mongolia for decision. The results showed that: (1) during 2001-2017, the average annual CWSI in Inner Mongolia had a strong spatial heterogeneity, which showed a trend of gradual increase from northeast to southwest. The annual average CWSI was 0.7787 and showed a fluctuating downward trend for Inner Mongolia. (2) The CWSI of every 8d during one year in Inner Mongolia showed the double-peak trend, reaching its maximum of 0.9043 in the 121st day. In addition, the average CWSI of every 8d was 0.6749. (3) In Inner Mongolia, the average CWSI of different land-use types showed little difference and ranged from small to large: woodland (0.5954) < cropland (0.7733) < built-up land (0.8126) < grassland (0.8147) < unused land (0.8392). (4) The average correlation coefficients between CWSI and precipitation, temperature respectively were -0.53 and 0.18, which indicated that CWSI was highly correlated with precipitation in Inner Mongolia.

TI  - AiRound and CV-BrCT: Novel Multiview Datasets for Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is undeniable that aerial/satellite images can provide useful information for a large variety of tasks. But, since these images are always taken from above, some applications can benefit from complementary information provided by other perspective views of the scene, such as ground-level images. Despite a large number of public repositories for both georeferenced photographs and aerial images, there is a lack of benchmark datasets that allow the development of approaches that exploit the benefits and complementarity of aerial/ground imagery. In this article, we present two new publicly available datasets named AiRound and CV-BrCT. The first one contains triplets of images from the same geographic coordinate with different perspectives of view extracted from various places around the world. Each triplet is composed of an aerial RGB image, a ground-level perspective image, and a Sentinel-2 sample. The second dataset contains pairs of aerial and street-level images extracted from southeast Brazil. We design an extensive set of experiments concerning multiview scene classification, using early and late fusion. Such experiments were conducted to show that image classification can be enhanced using multiview data.

T2  - Ciencia e Natura
M3  - Article
AB  - Tainhas State Park embraces locations of occurrence of freshwater sponge Oncosclera jewelli. Our objective is to indicate the areas of potential occurrence of the species from factors related to the geomorphometric signature of the occurance points along the Tainhas River in the Park and its buffer zone. Connections and data analysis were performed from the construction and manipulation of a geographic database, in SIGs SPRING-5.4.3 and QGIS-2.18, containing: a) MDEs from Topodata, Embrapa and Alos bases, obtained by remote orbitals sensors for the entire study area, and MDE obtained by drone-generated aerial images of the geomorphometric variables: slope, aspect and topographic position index; b) geological map of Rio Grande do Sul; c) land use and coverage map, based on images from the GeoEye satellite. The results demonstrated that the species occurs exclusively on the lithological unit of Serra Geral Formation. The plain is marked by terrain of low slope and south and east orientation and flattened plains. The Potential Occurrence Map of the species was generated, demonstrating that approximately 4.5% of the total length of watercourse stretches in the study area meet the analyzed geomorphometric conditions.

TI  - MIIDAPS-AI: An Explainable Machine-Learning Algorithm for Infrared and Microwave Remote Sensing and Data Assimilation Preprocessing-Application to LEO and GEO Sensors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we leverage and apply state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to satellite remote sensing of temperature, moisture, surface, and cloud parameters in all-weather, all-surface conditions, from both microwave and infrared sensors. The multi-instrument inversion and data assimilation preprocessing system, artificial intelligence version, or MIIDAPS-AI for short, is valid for both polar and geostationary microwave and infrared sounders and imagers as well as for pairs of combined infrared and microwave sounders. The algorithm produces vertical profiles of temperature and moisture as well as surface temperature, surface emissivity, and cloud parameters. Additional products from hyperspectral infrared sensors include selected trace gases. From microwave sensors, additional products such as rainfall rate, first year/multiyear sea ice concentration, and soil moisture can be derived from primary products. The MIIDAPS-AI algorithm is highly efficient with no noticeable decrease in accuracy compared to traditional operational sounding algorithms. The automatically generated Jacobians from this deep-learning algorithm could provide an explainability mechanism to build trustworthiness in the algorithm, and to quantify uncertainties of the algorithm's outputs. The computation gain is estimated to be two orders of magnitude, which opens the door to either 1) process massively larger amounts of satellite data, or to 2) offer improvements in timeliness and significant saving in computing power (and therefore cost) if the same amount of data is processed. Here, we present an overview of the MIIDAPS-AI implementation, discuss its applicability to various sensors and provide an initial performance assessment for a select number of sensors and geophysical parameters.

TI  - Deep convolutional neural networks for surface coal mines determination from sentinel-2 images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is a principal source of energy and the combustion of coal supplies around one-third of the global electricity generation. Coal mines are also an important source of CH4 emissions, the second most important greenhouse gas. Monitoring CH4 emissions caused by coal mining using earth observation will require the exact location of coal mines. This paper aims to determine surface coal mines from satellite images through deep learning techniques by treating them as a land use/land cover classification task. This is achieved using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that has proven to be capable of complex land use/land cover classification tasks. With a list of known coal mine locations from various countries, a training dataset of "Coal Mine" and "No Coal Mine" image patches is prepared using Sentinel-2 satellite images with 13 spectral bands. Various pre-trained CNN network architectures (VGG, ResNet, DenseNet) are trained and validated with our prepared coal mine dataset of 3500 "Coal Mine" and 3000 "No Coal Mine" image patches. After several experiments with the VGG network combined with transfer learning is found to be an optimal model for this task. Classification accuracy of 98% has been achieved for the validation dataset of the pre-trained VGG architecture. The model produces more than 95% overall accuracy when tested on unseen satellite images from different countries outside the training dataset and evaluated against visual classification.

TI  - The Healing of Simon's Mother-in-Law in Mark 1:29-31: An Ideological-Critical Reading in the Light of the Role of the Understanding of Sickness in Its Cure
T2  - NEOTESTAMENTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The healing of Simon's mother-in-law in Mark's Gospel, while presenting us with the shortest of the miracle stories in the Gospels, contains all the necessary elements of its Gattung. For the critical 21st-century reader, given today's medical understanding of the nature of the "sickness" in question-fever-as well as the issues of the healing process, the text may leave much to be desired. Through the prism of ideological criticism the text is re-read, and by means of a literature review a close look at Mark's theology and its inherent Christology is undertaken. From the backdrop of the understanding of sickness in the first-century Greco-Roman world and the understanding of the Jesus event, the article argues that the age-old maxim lex credendi, lex vivendi is at work. The understanding held about a particular medical situation affects the way it is attended to. Arguing that such a thought pattern evidenced in African-Nigerian settings presents difficulties both to mature faith and the treatment of sicknesses, this article criticises the insistent holding onto this ancient worldview. It urges the taking of the steps to accessing the possibilities of medicine today.

AB  - A study was performed on onion and carrot fields to develop yield prediction models and to assess the crop water use (CWU) with the use of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data. The experimental fields, which belong to the Tawdeehiya Farms located in the central region of Saudi Arabia, were used to predict yield, evapotranspiration (ET) and estimate CWU. Yield samples were collected randomly with the assistance of a handheld global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and subsequently analyzed for commercial harvest (CH) yield and above-ground biomass (AGB). The CWU was estimated as ETa using the simplified surface energy balance (SSEB) with an accuracy of 89.2%, and the differences between amounts of the actual irrigation water and the ETa were ranged between 10.6% (onion) and -12.6% (carrot) across the growth period. The outputs of this study can be used to improve irrigation management in the study area and related areas.

TI  - The tenet of <i>ubuntu</i> in South (African) ethics: Inclusive hospitality and Christian ethical disposition of effective pastoral care in Africa
T2  - STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The notion of ubuntu as a moral theory in the South African and African contexts presents attractive norms of an African worldview that can be articulated and applied to contemporary Christian ethics. The proponents of ubuntu perceive it as an African philosophy based on the maxim, "a person is a person through other persons", whereby the community prevails over individual considerations. It is not merely an empirical claim that our survival or well-being is causally dependent on others but is in essence capturing a normative account of what we ought to be as human beings. However, ubuntu has shortcomings that make it an impractical notion. Despite its shortcomings, ubuntu has natural ethic potential that enforces and engenders hospitality, neighbourliness, and care for all humanity. This article contributes to further conceptualisation and understanding of the notion of ubuntu and its relationship with hospitality in order to retrieve some principles that can be applied to effective and meaningful pastoral care. The principles drawn from ubuntu are juxtaposed with Christian principles and pastoral care to encourage embodiment of God by pastoral caregivers.

TI  - Performance of CCCma and GFDL climate models using remote sensing and surface data for the state of Rio de Janeiro-Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of the CCCma (Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis) and GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamic Laboratory) models in the baseline period (1961-2000) and for the future IPCC scenario Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 6.0 (2046-2065) were evaluated through the descriptive statistics using spatial interpolation methods (Kriging and Ordinary Co-Kriging) using the exponential, gaussian and spherical spatial models. The daily temperature and rain data from the CCCma and GFDL models were used for the current baseline climate (1961-2000) and the future scenario (2046-2065), data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were used for comparisons with the two models and the product MCD12Q1 derived from Moderate resolution spectroradiometer sensor was used to check which areas had higher and lower values of temperature and rain in the State of Rio de Janeiro. For validation, data were compared and geostatistical analysis was performed using Kriging techniques. The averages of air temperature and precipitation showed similar patterns in both models. The CCCma model presented the data closest to the NOAA reanalysis data, with the GFDL model underestimating most precipitation and air temperature data. Through the product MCD12Q1 of the MODIS sensor, it is possible to register marked differences in relation to rain and temperature and their respective land use for the State. For the geostatistics data, it was possible to verify that, for the past and future scenarios, the exponential transitive model presented in the majority of the cases the least degree of spatial dependence (GDE), being therefore considered the best. When comparing the GDE of the two climatic models, it is verified that the CCCma presented the best geostatistical performance and can be used in works to simulate scenarios of future climate changes.

TI  - Satellite Based Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation Is Congruent with Plant Diversity in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A dynamic habitat index (DHI) based on satellite derived biophysical proxy (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, FAPAR) was used to evaluate the vegetation greenness pattern across deserts to alpine ecosystems in India that account to different biodiversity. The cumulative (DHI-cum), minimum (DHI-min), and seasonal (DHI-sea) DHI were generated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based FAPAR. The higher DHI-cum and DHI-min represented the biodiversity hotspots of India, whereas the DHI-sea was higher in the semi-arid, the Gangetic plain, and the Deccan peninsula. The arid and the trans-Himalaya are dominated with grassland or barren land exhibit very high DHI-sea. The inter-year correlation demonstrated an increase in vegetation greenness in the semi-arid region, and continuous reduction in greenness in the Northeastern region. The DHI components validated using field-measured plant richness data from four biogeographic regions (semi-arid, eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats, and Northeast) demonstrated good congruence. DHI-cum that represents the annual greenness strongly correlated with the plant richness (R-2 = 0.90, p-value < 0.001), thereby emerging as a suitable indicator for assessing plant richness in large-scale biogeographic studies. Overall, the FAPAR-based DHI components across Indian biogeographic regions provided understanding of natural variability of the greenness pattern and its congruence with plant diversity.

TI  - A Probability-Based Daytime Algorithm for Sea Fog Detection Using GOES-16 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog is a hazardous weather event that can endanger navigation, aviation, and transportation. While human has several limitations in detecting and forecasting offshore fog, satellite remote sensing offers cost-effective images. In this study, a probability-based daytime sea fog detection algorithm, applied to geostationary operational environmental satellite (GOES) 16 satellite data over the Grand Banks offshore Eastern Canada, is presented and compared with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Low Instrument Flight Rules (LIFR) probability map. Initially, clear-sky and ice cloud classes were delineated in the GOES-16 image and then the remaining pixels were assigned a fog probability by conducting small droplet proxy, spatial homogeneity, and temperature difference tests. Moreover, a green band was linearly interpolated using the first three bands of GOES-16 images to generate pseudotrue color composites. The resulting maps were evaluated both during an extended sea fog event and using several statistical measures. The average detection probability for the observed advection fog events was 66% for the proposed method, while that for NOAA's LIFR map was 38%. Furthermore, by thresholding the generated maps at the probability of 60%, the false alarm rate, probability of detection, hit rate, and Hanssen-Kuiper skill score were 0.09, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.68, respectively. The proposed method is operationally being used in this region to detect and monitor sea fog, facilitating safe navigation and aviation. This is the first study that uses GOES-16 for daytime fog detection and discusses a satellite-based solution for fog modeling in Grand Banks, NL.

TI  - The Third Generation of Pan-Canadian Wetland Map at 10 m Resolution Using Multisource Earth Observation Data on Cloud Computing Platform
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of the Canadian Wetland Inventory Map (CWIM) has thus far proceeded over two generations, reporting the extent and location of bog, fen, swamp, marsh, and water wetlands across the country with increasing accuracy. Each generation of this training inventory has improved the previous results by including additional reference wetland data and focusing on processing at the scale of ecozone, which represent ecologically distinct regions of Canada. The first and second generations attained relatively highly accurate results with an average approaching 86% though some overestimated wetland extents, particularly of the swamp class. The current research represents a third refinement of the inventory map. It was designed to improve the overall accuracy (OA) and reduce wetlands overestimation by modifying test and train data and integrating additional environmental and remote sensing datasets, including countrywide coverage of L-band ALOS PALSAR-2, SRTM, and Arctic digital elevation model, nighttime light, temperature, and precipitation data. Using a random forest classification within Google Earth Engine, the average OA obtained for the CWIM3 is 90.53%, an improvement of 4.77% over previous results. All ecozones experienced an OA increase of 2% or greater and individual ecozone OA results range between 94% at the highest to 84% at the lowest. Visual inspection of the classification products demonstrates a reduction of wetland area overestimation compared to previous inventory generations. In this study, several classification scenarios were defined to assess the effect of preprocessing and the benefits of incorporating multisource data for large-scale wetland mapping. In addition, the development of a confidence map helps visualize where current results are most and least reliable given the amount of wetland test and train data and the extent of recent landscape disturbance (e.g., fire). The resulting OAs and wetland areal extent reveal the importance of multisource data and adequate test and train data for wetland classification at a countrywide scale.

TI  - Impact of Topography and Rainfall Intensity on the Accuracy of IMERG Precipitation Estimates in an Arid Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of topographical characteristics and rainfall intensity on the accuracy of satellite precipitation estimates is of importance to the adoption of satellite data for hydrological applications. This study evaluates the three GPM IMERG V05B products over the arid country of Saudi Arabia. Statistical indices quantifying the performance of IMERG products were calculated under three evaluation techniques: seasonal-based, topographical, and rainfall intensity-based. Results indicated that IMERG products have the capability to detect seasons with the highest precipitation values (spring) and seasons with the lowest precipitation (summer). Moreover, results showed that IMERG products performed well under various rainfall intensities, particularly under light rain, which is the most common rainfall in arid regions. Furthermore, IMERG products exhibited high detection accuracy over moderate elevations, whereas it had poor performance over coastal and mountainous regions. Overall, the results confirmed that the performance of the final-run product surpassed the near-real-time products in terms of consistency and errors. IMERG products can improve temporal resolution and play a significant role in filling data gaps in poorly gauged regions. However, due to the errors in IMERG products, it is recommended to use sub-daily rain gauge data in satellite calibration for better rainfall estimation over arid and semiarid regions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have a significant role in absorbing carbon emissions in the atmosphere used as photosynthetic materials. Absorbed carbon emission is stored in the form of biomass in vegetation, of which 47% of the biomass is aboveground carbon stock (AGC). Monitoring the AGC needs to be carried out efficiently, consistently, and sustainably to increase efforts to prevent global warming, and remote sensing imagery has the potentials to address this issue. This study aims to (1) explore the relationship between the selected vegetation indices derived from the WorldView-2 image and the corresponding AGC measurement in the field and (2) estimate and map the spatial distribution of AGC of mangroves. This research was conducted in a mangrove forest in Clungup Mangrove Conservation area, East Java Province, Indonesia. We applied allometric equations to determine the value of vegetation biomass in the study area based on the tree diameter at breast height (DBH), which will then be converted into carbon stock value. For AGC estimation and mapping purposes, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Rededge Simple Ratio (SRre), and Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI). We used correlation and regression analysis to evaluate the statistical relationship between these vegetation indices and field AGC data. Our findings suggested that the SR has the highest accuracy in modeling AGC with an R-2 value of 0.124. Thus, it results in a range of AGC from 0.127 tons/pixel to 0.414 tons/pixel in the study site.

TI  - Perspectives of the development of complex interdisciplinary hydrological geocryological research in the North-East of Russia
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming and anthropogenic impact causes transformation of geocryological conditions in the river basins of the North-East of Russia. Changes in the thickness of the active layer, configuration of taliks, types of landscapes and other factors lead to transformation of water exchange processes between surface and groundwater runoff. This is manifested in the seasonal redistribution of the components of the water balance, accelerated melting of aufeis, change in the ratio of waters of different genesis in the structure of river runoff. As a result, natural and anthropogenic risks that affect the safe and efficient development of infrastructure and socio-economic processes are increasing. At the same time the system of observations developed in the Soviet period has been practically destroyed in the region. This paper offers a vision of organizing complex multidisciplinary research to assess and project the changes in the conditions of underground and surface water interaction in natural and disturbed river basins of the cryolithozone of the North-East of Russia, including for solving applied problems, based on permafrost, hydrology. hydrogeology, landscape science and geophysics with applications of remote sensing and field research integrated through mathematical modeling methods. To achieve the goal, the identification of natural and disturbed landscapes using remote sensing data. and key areas for detailed research will be selected. Geophysical and drilling works will be carried out within the sites to establish permafrost-hydrogeological conditions, monitoring stations will be equipped to determine hydrogeological, hydrometeorological and geocryological characteristics, including sampling for isotopic and hydrogeochemical studies. As the main key sites, it is proposed to use the area of the Kolyma water-balance station and the site on Anmangynda aufeis, for which there are long-term observation series in the 20th century. Field data will become the basis for improving the mathematical model of runoff formation, considering the relationship between groundwater and river runoff in the conditions of permafrost. Mathematical modeling will make it possible to quantitatively analyze the water balance of rivers considering various factors and project water availability both for specific industrial facilities and for the region as a whole.

TI  - AUTOMATIZED RECOGNITION OF URBAN VEGETATION AND WATER BODIES BYJILIN-1A SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of testing the developed techniques for automatized recognition of vegetation and water bodies on the urban territory by multispectral images from the Jilin-1A satellite are given.The research included automatized recognition of vegetation and water bodies on the selected observation territory based on images with super high spatial resolution in the visual and infrared range and consequent comparison of the obtained results with the results of visual decoding.The obtained results of processing the images from the Jilin-1A satellite in accordance with the proposed techniques confirmed the sufficiently high accuracy of automatized edge enhancement of recognized objects as compared to the results of interactive visual recognition of these images. Different test areas provided a good separation of vegetation and water types with the same thresholding customization.The accuracy of automatized classification of vegetation and water bodies (without considering the standard errors) for different test areas was within 81...92 %, and values of kappa-coefficient were within 0.68 to 0.85.Comparison of normalized index images received from Jilin-1A and Sentinel-2A satellites showed slight discordance in NDVI values and significant discordances for NDWI and MNDWI that are caused by the usage of different spectral channels (SWIR and NIR). These discordances can be sufficiently reduced when using correction coefficients.Analysis of the influence of output image resolution reduction (from 10 to 8 bit) and subsequent informational compressing (JPEG lossy and JPEG2000 lossless) on results of automatized recognition of vegetation and water bodies confirmed the validity and efficiency of these techniques. The volume of saved and transmitted files significantly decreased (in 80 ...100 times) with a slight reduction of classification accuracy (by 1 ...2 %).The proposed techniques make it possible to increase significantly the efficiency and probability of renewing maps of big cities and to reduce financial expenditures as compared to the traditional ground GPS-surveying and aerosurveying.The high-level automatization of image processing and minimization of necessary calculations (as compared to techniques that use complex classifiers and neural networks) allow to implement the developed technique as a geographic information web service that satisfies the needs of a wide circle of government services and commercial structures and can be useful for megalopolis population and tourists.

TI  - MYTHOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AS A FORM OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of the article is to explain the actual role of mythological consciousness in the modern spiritual life of society, thereby overcoming the generally sceptical, if not negative, attitude towards mythologisation in modern social science.The subject of the article is nature and forms of mythological consciousness. The authors' premise is that rather than being a collection of myths, mythological consciousness is an independent way of spiritual penetration into the world, the transformation of the sensually perceivable and the sign-symbolical reality into an inseparable whole. Mythological consciousness is interpreted as an immanent component of social consciousness. A special role is assigned to the centres of mythological consciousness, in which its nature is encoded. Mythologemes, archetypes and mentality are kinds of a link between social consciousness and social unconsciousness.By revealing the mythological nature of ideas, values, images, symbols, and signs as unavoidable forms through which worldview mindsets and conceptual pillars of modern science are formed, we find ways to unleash their true intellectual and spiritual potential.The final result of the article is the validity of the statement that the ideological structure of modern social thought is its mythological component.

TI  - A Continental-Scale Assessment of Density, Size, Distribution and Historical Trends of Farm Dams Using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Farm dams are a ubiquitous limnological feature of agricultural landscapes worldwide. While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address this critical global information gap. Specifically, we trained a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the first continental-scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km(2)) and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales recorded the highest number of farm dams (654,983; 37% of the total) and Victoria the highest overall density (1.73 dams km(-2)). We also estimated that 202,119 farm dams (11.5%) remain omitted from any maps, especially in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Three decades of historical records revealed an ongoing decrease in the construction rate of farm dams, from >3% per annum before 2000, to similar to 1% after 2000, to <0.05% after 2010-except in the Australian Capital Territory where rates have remained relatively high. We also found systematic trends in construction design: farm dams built in 2015 are on average 50% larger in surface area and contain 66% more water than those built in 1989. To facilitate sharing information on sustainable farm dam management with authorities, scientists, managers and local communities, we developed AusDams.org-a free interactive portal to visualise and generate statistics on the physical, environmental and ecological impacts of farm dams.

AB  - Wildfires are the most deadly and dangerous accidents across the United States, especially in California. Many lives are lost, and billions of dollars' worth of property damages occur in wildfire every year. Wildfires are fueled and accelerated by several different factors, such as weather, climate, vegetation types, land cover, and human activities. This research aims to develop a machine learning and big data-based fire risk prediction model considering the different geographical factors outlined above. We propose a systematic way to make fire risk prediction and detection models that analyzes satellite data, weather data, and historical fire data to predict fire. We got an accuracy of 100% using ensemble model and 93% using Faster R-CNN for wildfire risk prediction and fire detection, respectively, using machine learning models.

TI  - Evaluation of Seasonal Characteristics of Land Surface Temperature with NDVI and Population Density
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover and population density and its variability characteristics in National Capital Region, NCR, India have major effects on thermal environments, mainly on land surface temperature (LST). There are very few meteorological stations to record the surface temperature in earlier periods, and they may not be the true representation for NCR region. In such cases, LST derived from thermal satellite data is useful to study the LST variability across the NCR region, an important parameter for urban micro-climate. Satellite images from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) used to obtain Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST map to determine the impact of those parameters on LST variability. Higher NDVI reveals the lower LST and vice versa. The high LST-NDVI negative correlation was observed during monsoon season. Statistical analysis of nighttime LST with population density shows that population growth tends to lead to urban LST rise or Urban Heat Island (UHI) strength, as well as effects NCR micro-climate. The high population density is one of the key contributing factors for NCR's high surface temperature, UHI intensity and also micro-climate. The study shows that the seasonal distribution of LST needs to be overcome with the high vegetation cover and some other appropriate mitigation measures. One way of mitigating such seasonal peripheral thermal effects could be to adopt better cropping practices in order to minimize the agricultural fallow period and promoting green roofing concepts in urban areas and using porous concrete for construction which might help to mitigate impacts of high LST in urban areas of NCR. The results of these studies may be useful in assessing and resolving the microclimate problem and in reducing the impact of UHI and also provide supporting data for NCR's urban planning and environmental research.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to improve the efficiency of the operation of operational duty shifts by system analysis and synthesis of the system of organized management of operational duty shifts of control centers in crisis situations. One of the most important tasks is the task of choosing a rational model of knowledge representation. In the article, the subsystem of choosing a rational model of knowledge representation is implemented in the form of a mathematical (combined) model of the process of choosing a rational model of knowledge representation. In the course of the work, a list of classification features and the corresponding values of the features were identified, which make it possible to determine whether the solution of the problem of an official of the Center of management in crisis situations of the Ministry of EMERCOM of Russia belongs to the knowledge representation model. For the convenience of working with the received data, the method of convolution of criteria was successfully implemented. Integral indicators were obtained for each model: production, frame, logical, and semantic network models. The results obtained with an emphasis on the specifics of modern information and analytical systems based on artificial intelligence and knowledge bases contribute to improving the efficiency of the management bodies of the EMERCOM of Russia in monitoring and forecasting emergencies.

TI  - Impacts of Land-Use Change on Ecosystem Service Value of Mountain-Oasis-Desert Ecosystem: A Case Study of Kaidu-Kongque River Basin, Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used long time series Landsat data and ecosystem services coefficients for global and Chinese ecosystems during 1978-2018 to estimate the influences of land-use change on ecosystem services (ES) in Kaidu-Kongque River Basin (KKRB), where both socioeconomic progress and the arid, fragile natural environment have considerable affected land-use change. The results showed that (1) the total value of ES in the KKRB was about USD 8111.5, 7995.31, 8275.74, 8131.91, and 8016.38 million in 1978, 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018, respectively. The net ecosystem service value (ESV) loss was about USD 116.19 million for 1978-1988, the net ESV profit was about USD 280.43 million for 1988-1998, and the net ESV loss was about USD 259.36 million for 1998-2018. (2) Water supply and waste treatment function were the top two ecological functions with high service value; their combined contribution rate was 59.3%, indicating that the regulating service function in this study area is higher than the provision services function. (3) The high to low ranking for each ecosystem function based on their contribution rate to overall ES value was water supply > waste treatment > climate regulation > biodiversity protection > recreation and culture > soil formation > gas regulation > food production > raw material. These results are significant for the continuation of the integrity and sustainability of the mountain-oasis-desert region ecosystem, where socioeconomic progress and the fragile characteristics of the natural ecosystem complement each other. The results of this study provide scientific evidence for governmental decision makers and local residents and offer a reference for environmental researchers in northwest China.

AB  - Ascending aortic pseudoaneurysms are associated with prior cardiac surgery and have a high chance of rupture. Open surgery is challenging given its likely reoperative nature. Various endovascular therapies have been described but are sometimes complicated by stroke. We present a patient with a prior coronary artery bypass grafting who was referred for an incidental 3-cm saccular ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm who was successfully treated with frame coiling under total cerebral embolic protection using the SENTINEL device. We propose that endovascular obliteration of ascending aortic pseudoaneurysms is a viable option in patients unfit for open repair and advocate for total cerebral embolic protection as an important adjunct.

AB  - Satellite data may support management of wetland areas for monitoring of the inundation seasonality. Previously successful in Donana and Camargue Biosphere Reserves, this study examines the transferability of unsupervised inundation mapping through automatic local thresholding in discriminating inundated areas from non-inundated ones in Kerkini Lake. Nine different alternatives of this approach are employed on Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-2A images (2016-2019). The best fit alternative was derived by the validation against local and on-site registered attributes. To overcome unfavourable atmospheric conditions, Sentinel-1 (S1) images were examined in tandem with derived S2 inundation maps (S2m), using the best fit alternative. Two S2m, one preceding and one following a target S1 image, were used to train random forest models (per pixel) to be applied to the target S1 image and derive the respective inundation map (S1m). S1m was validated against a S2m for the same date; not previously used in the training process. Classification performance reached k [0.77-0.94] and overall accuracy [88.05-97.16%] for the S2m. The evaluation of S1m showed k of 0.99 and overall accuracy between 99.71-99.88%. Automation of the process and minimum human interference supports its usage by non-specialists, e.g. for Protected Areas management.

AB  - Remote sensing and automatic earth monitoring are key to solve global-scale challenges such as disaster prevention, land use monitoring, or tackling climate change. Although there exist vast amounts of remote sensing data, most of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts. First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks. The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer learning and enable rapid progress in remote sensing applications.(1)

AB  - Increasing urbanization causes a variety of environmental changes, not only in regional but in the global scale, especially in developing countries. The developing countries like Lao PDR have very few data on environment and urban management and face many difficulties due to poor data management. Nowadays, using the integration of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing provides us with an effective result in determining the land use and land cover changes as well as providing valuable information needed for planning and researching. A new approach has been introduced for detecting and monitoring urban expansion by using the Big Data platform via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing. Also, the machine learning algorithms have been recommended in this research, such as Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Minimum Distance (MD). In this paper, we conduct GEE combining with multiple sources of satellite optical images time-series from three main satellites, Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. For our dataset collection, we manually classify our dataset based on the pixel-based approach and object-based approach which were divided into training sample (70%) and testing sample (30%). Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from a confusion/error matrix of the classifier. From the results, RF and CARF outperformed other classifiers and exhibited overall accuracy both training data and testing sample whereas SVM performed mediocrely and Minimum distance displayed least performance.

TI  - Multi-task Convolution Neural Network for Season-Insensitive Chlorophyll-A Estimation in Inland Water
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, a crucial indicator of phytoplankton biomass, is sensitive to seasonality. The variations in trophic states regarding seasonality and the changes of spectral properties of water bodies pose uncertainties to the accuracy of remote sensing semiempirical models. In particular, lakes in subtropical regions generally experience different trophic states in dry and wet seasons. In this study, a season-insensitive Chl-a retrieval model using multitask convolution neural network with multiple output layers (MCNN) is proposed. A layer-sharing network combined with data augmentation is adopted to alleviate the issue of insufficient quantity of in situ samples. In addition, a hyperparameter optimization is performed to automatically refine the MCNN architecture. To evaluate the accuracy of proposed method, Laguna Lake, one of the largest lakes in Southeast Asia, is selected as the validation target. The lake is characterized by oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in wet season, whereas the states change to mesotrophic and low-level eutrophic states in dry season. A collection of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument Level-2 images and 409 in situ samples with the Chl-a concentration range 1.24-22.30 mg center dot m(-3) were used for model calibration and evaluation. Experimental results showed that MCNN with the performance of average R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 2.06 mg center dot m(-3), Pearson's r = 0.86 outperforms related semiempirical models, including normalized difference chlorophyll index, two-band and three-band models, and WaterNet. The Chl-a prediction accuracy was improved by 7.19-14.6%, in terms of RMSE, compared with WaterNet.

AB  - This study emphasizes the use of remote sensing parameters NDVI and LST to identify decadal change of three different years 1999, 2009, and 2019 in green cover in Dehradun city. Data analysis was done by using satellite imagery Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM. The relationship between NDVI and LST are inversely proportional. The result shows the continuous decrease in green cover with an increase in temperature over the time of Dehradun city. From this study, we came to know that the area under NDVI (Very High) value is decreasing from 10% in the year 1999 to 3.7% in the year 2009 and further 0.6% in the year 2019 and in contrast, the area under LST range(>35 degrees C) is increasing from 1.68% in the year 1999 to 16.55% in the year 2009 and finally reaches to 39.75% in the year 2019. This results in environmental damage of Dehradun city over the time period. This study helps the decision makers of different organizations who want to do urban planning, climate change analysis, and forest fire risk management study in reducing sustainable damage.

TI  - Implementation of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) sedation training course in a regular endoscopy unit
T2  - ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Several scientific societies have endorsed non-anesthesiologist sedation (NAS) during gastrointestinal endoscopy, considering it a safe procedure when administered by adequately trained personnel. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of adverse events after implementation of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) sedation training program.Methods From January 2017 to August 2018, data from all consecutive endoscopic procedures in adults (>= 18 years) performed at our endoscopy unit were collected using an electronic reporting system.Results All staff (physicians and nurses) completed the ESGE-ESGENA sedation course. In total, 12 132 patients underwent endoscopic procedures, 10755 (88.6%) of which were performed in a non-anesthesiological setting. Of these, about 20% used moderate sedation with midazolam + fentanyl and 80% used deep sedation with additional propofol. No sentinel, 5 (0.05%) moderate risk, and 18 (0.17%) minor risk adverse events occurred, all during moderate or deep sedation, and all managed by endoscopy staff without the need for anesthesiologist assistance.Conclusions After completing the ESGE-ESGENA sedation training program, the rate of adverse events was very low in our institution. The findings support implementation of the program in all digestive endoscopy units and inclusion in the curriculum for physicians and nurses to ensure safe endoscopic procedures.

TI  - PORFIRY PETROVICH AND RASKOLNIKOV: HERMENEUTICS OF DOUBLES
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the character and the plot function of Porfiry Petrovich, one of the basic characters in F. Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. The study aims to prove that he can be seen as the protagonist Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov's double in worldview only in the context of the Napoleonic idea. A detailed hermeneutic analysis of the three encounters between the two characters reveals that under the guise of the Law Porfiry Petrovich has adopted and employed this idea in its ontological purity as the will to exercise power over the rest. His speech and everyday behavior demonstrate how the idea works. The latter serves to bring to light the connection between "professional" and "moral" standards, by proving that the institutionalized cynicism with which Porfiry Petrovich puts the Law "into practice" corresponds precisely to the theoretical principles designed by Raskolnikov to classify people into extraordinary and insignificant beings. The outlined proximity supports the hypothesis that Porfiry Petrovich has a biography, symbolically speaking. It enters discourse imperceptibly as shared by Raskolnokov in terms of the biography of the idea, its birth, and how it is experienced by both men. The awareness of that undivided authority predetermines the overall attitude of Porfiry Petrovich to the student. On the other hand, it also makes Raskolnikov deny verbally his guilt towards Porfiry while seeking a possibility to sever the connections with their "past", binding them symbolically.

TI  - Fire, flood and monodominance of <i>Tabebuia aurea</i> in Pantanal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental filters affect species diversity. Understanding their influence on plant communities is one of the main challenges of ecology in the search for solutions to the management and conservation of floodable savannas. To shed more light on this challenge, the present work asked if the interactions between flood and fire influence the richness of community and favor the abundance and basal area of the monodominant Pantanal species Tabebuia aurea. We also asked what role earth-mounds play in this process. To address these questions, we used Landsat-5 and -8 and Resourcesat-1 satellite data; to access the fire history in monodominant stands of T. aurea in the Pantanal from 2003 to 2017. We chose 37 areas with 2 to 9 annual fire episodes. A total of 125 25 x 25 m plots were established in the different areas, to sample arboreal strata. We sampled all individuals 3.18 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh). In each plot, we measured height by the watermark from the last flooding on each individual as a proxy of inundation level. We applied generalized linear model (GLM) analyses to compare effects of flood and fire on abundance, richness and basal area, on and off earth-mounds using negative binomial, Poisson and Gaussian distribution, respectively. We sampled 2411 individuals distributed among 19 families, 31 genera and 36 species. Under higher fire frequency, abundance, richness and basal area of all species decreased with increase of water level. However, the abundance and basal area of Tabebuia aurea remained higher than those of other species. Under lower fire frequency, the abundance and richness of all species in the community increased with water level. Basal area, however, decreased with increasing water level, such that individuals with larger basal area were found under lower fire frequency. Under high fire frequency earth-mounds protected T. aurea individuals from fire and flood. Earth-mounds influenced species richness and basal area only under medium-low fire frequency. Results show that monodominance of T. aurea benefits from the interaction between fire and flood, with some help from earth-mounds. Individuals of other tree species, show tolerance to high flood levels or high fire frequencies, but not the interaction between fire and flood. This dynamic strengthens the monodominance of T. aurea, as the number of individuals also increases. Our results show that flood and fire are important to the conservation of this monodominant community.

TI  - The discovery of structural elements and zones of hydrothermal alterations by using ASTER satellite data in the margins of Gadabay and Murovdag ore districts (Lesser Caucasus, Azerbaijan)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the discovery of structural elements, zones of hydrothermal alterations and mineralization in the margins of Gadabay and Murovdag regions and the study of prospective areas for mineralization characterized by them by using ASTER satellite data. The main purpose of the research is the definition of the lithological composition of rocks, ring and linear structures and zones of hydrothermal alterations with the help of remote-sensing methods and by better technological development of special radiometric data. In order to detect the lithological composition of associated rocks of alteration zone of endogenous ores, 14 channel data of ASTER has been used. By using stereoscopic images obtained from ASTER data, it was determined that hydrothermal alterations are mainly represented by alunitization, kaolinization, sericitization, silication, pyropilitization and silification in the studied ore regions. These changes were shown to be characteristic for copper-porphyry, gold-copper pyrite, copper-polymetal and gold-copper-porphyry deposits. Strip ratios, principal component analysis (PCA), minimum of noise fraction (MNF) and selection method for least squares (LS) have been used to map hydrothermal alteration zones. The ring structures detected in the area, different fault fractures and lineaments are assessed as favourable geological structural factors for alteration and mineralization. The results obtained by ASTER image analysis confirm the presence of derivative minerals which are considered to be the product of hydrothermal alterations which are densely concentrated (kalium spathization, kaolinization, serictization, pyrophyllitization, alunitization) has been confirmed. The points each with private coordinates have been determined (defined) within separate areas with the help of remote data and relevant anomalous maps prepared. These points are considered favourable geological condition in terms of the type and intensity of hydrothermal alterations in the area. Such areas are considered a sign of indirect search significant for the detection of copper-polymetallic, copper-porphyry, copper-pyrite and gold-pyrite type of mineralization with epithermal origin in the region.

TI  - Quantification of capillary water input to the root zone from shallow water table and determination of the associated 'Bartlett' pear water status
T2  - XIII INTERNATIONAL PEAR SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Pear Symposium
CL  - Montevideo, URUGUAY
AB  - The Alto Valle of Rio Negro and Neuquen is an intensive irrigated fruit producing area. The existence of a shallow water table modifies the water content in the soil profile. It is important to distinguish the effect and estimate the amount of water capillary rise in order to enhance the irrigation management and allow the crop to achieve its maximum yield and development in non-stress conditions. The aim of this trial was to quantify and associate water content of soil profile with water status of pear trees, using different methods. In a surfaced irrigated 'Bartlett' pear orchard planted on 2003, the following variables were measured during the 2017-2018 growing season: soil water content at three depths (0.20, 0.40, 0.60 m) and water table level (WTL). Additionally, soil profile and texture class were described. Evapotranspiration (ETm) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were calculated with data of the automatic weather station. Stomatal conductance (Gs) was measured with a leaf porometer in three different moments of the growing season. Moisture stress index (MSI) was calculated from all Sentinel 2A images available for the season. The capillary water input into the root zone from a shallow water table is evident in the continuous records of sensors. This phenomenon keeps soil water content within the readily available water range. The Gs measures showed that the crop water status was appropriate and that values were high compared to those referred to deciduous trees. The MSI values obtained were between the limits of a well-irrigated crop. These results agree with the non-restrictive condition observed in the soil water balance.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover and canopy nitrogen estimation in corn through remote sensing
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen use efficiency of nitrogen use in agriculture is very low, causing environmental problems and low crop productivity, therefore, knowing the spatial and temporal distribution of biophysical variables such as the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and the canopy nitrogen content (CNC) of the crops will provide valuable information to improve this condition. The use of freely accessible satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2 (S-2) images, can facilitate this task. Due to the above, a study was carried out in six corn plots grown by producers in Texcoco de Mora, Estado de Mexico. The first objective was to investigate the relationship between spectral indices, estimated from the reflectance measured with a multispectral radiometer at surface level and S-2 images, with FVC, estimated by digital photographs through the Canopeo mobile application. The second objective was to obtain a linear model that estimated the CNC from the analysis of different spectral indices. Two models were generated to estimate FVC, from the radiometric information at surface level, their validation yielded a high value of R-2 = 0.92 and a RMSE = 7.3% between measured and estimated FVC data; however, in the case of the data estimated with S-2 images, lower values of R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 17.6% were obtained, which was attributed to a possible effect of the atmosphere, since the study period coincided with the rainy season. Finally, to estimate the CNC, the best results were obtained with the model generated from Cl-Green, in which an R-2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 0.63 g m(-2) were obtained, when comparing the CNC measured in relation to the estimate.

AB  - Urban green areas (UGA) provide relevant ecosystem services to cities, unfortunately, they are vulnerable to urbanization processes. The objective of this study was to analyze under a spatio-temporal approach the UGA of the Metropolitan Zone of Monterrey (MZM). Landsat and Global Forest Change satellite images were used to estimate the UGA and environmental quality of the MZM for the period 2000-2019. A trend (p < 0.01) of UGA reduction was found from 2001 to 2019. The estimated environmental quality decreased from 13.21 (2000) to 7.75 m(2) (2019). The UGA area was lost at a rate of 0.29 m(2) per inhabitant per year. The municipalities of Juarez, Monterrey, Apodaca and Guadalupe were the ones that lost UGA. The conservation and protection of UGA should be priority activities for the civil authorities of the municipalities of the MZM, specifically, in the municipality of Juarez.

TI  - An InSAR Ionospheric Correction Method Based on Variance Component Estimation With Integration of MAI and RSS Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionospheric phase delay can seriously affect the low-frequency spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. Ionospheric correction is, therefore, vital to improving the measurement accuracy of Interferometric SAR (InSAR). InSAR ionospheric correction relies mainly on two kinds of approaches, i.e., one uses SAR azimuth offsets measures, and the other achieves through a range split-spectrum (RSS) technique. However, the two approaches have different spatial sensitivities to the ionosphere, but they can complement each other. In this study, we present an integration InSAR ionospheric correction method. This method uses the Helmert variance component estimation to reasonably allocate the weights for the ionospheric measurements obtained from the azimuth offset-based and RSS techniques to improve the ionospheric correction performance. The azimuth offset can be derived from a pixel offset-tracking procedure or multiple-aperture InSAR. We demonstrated the proposed method on 28-MHz FBS mode ALOS-1 PALSAR images acquired before and after the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, 2008. This study also applied the proposed method to 14-MHz FBD mode ALOS-1 PALSAR images with no significant surface deformation and high coherence in Chile. After the ionospheric correction with the proposed method, we found that the ionospheric errors in the Wenchuan and Chile cases have varied from -31.0 to 21.1 cm and -4.7 to 93.9 cm, respectively. The results show that the proposed method can effectively remove the long-wavelength ionospheric delay. Our study reveals that this method can also alleviate the influence of local ionospheric disturbance simultaneously.

TI  - Advanced Processing of Multiplatform Remote Sensing Imagery for the Monitoring of Coastal and Mountain Ecosystems
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal areas are key to sustaining biodiversity, but their complexity and variability makes their analysis challenging. On the other hand, mountain ecosystems include a large percentage of the global biodiversity and their monitoring is essential, as they are especially vulnerable to climate change. In this context, remote sensing offers a cost-effective technology for the conservation of both kinds of natural areas. In this work, multispectral and hyperspectral data recorded by sensors, onboard satellites, aircrafts and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), have been used for the sustainable management of natural resources. Specifically, a multiplatform methodology has been developed to process multisensor high spatial resolution imagery and the main benefits and drawbacks of each technology have been identified. Advanced processing techniques in each stage of the methodology have been selected to provide accurate and validated benthic and vegetation maps. Two challenging ecosystems, located in Cabrera and Teide National Parks, have been selected for this study. They correspond with a coastal and a mountain island ecosystem, respectively. To address the associated challenges, the use of imagery with the maximum spatial and spectral resolution, provided by Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, CASI and Pika-L, has been considered. Results have been validated with in-situ data and by the National Parks' managers and they have shown the ability of remote sensing to accurately map both Parks when the appropriate imagery and techniques are selected. The best performance was achieved with the Support Vector Machine classifier and, in general, WorldView can be considered the most appropriate platform when factoring in cost, coverage and accuracy.

AB  - In the coastal tropics and subtropical regions, fragile ecosystems such as deltas, mangrove forests, and swamps are common, whose ecological stability strictly depends on the quality management of hydrological resources at the basin level. The National Hydrographic Basin Council in Cuba, protect the hydrographic basins, considered as the reference unit for the integrated management of water resources. Moreover, the council aims at preventing negative impacts on of these vital ecosystems for their key services to the overall social and economic wellbeing. As an example, the Zaza River basin in the of Province of Sancti Spiritus, the mangrove forest is suffering from significant decay, in particular on the southern coasts. A significant improvement of the water resources sustainable management in Cuba, is a more reliable and timely monitoring. Considering the extreme conditions and the limited accessibility of mangroves, remote sensing and others earth observations techniques represents a suitable tool for monitoring the mangrove forest in coastal areas. In our study, we used a set of 10 multispectral Landsat - 8 OLI images from November 2014 to December 2015.By collecting campaigns on mangroves' phenology, we have: 1) studied the relationships between phenology and spectral behavior of species; and, 2) set up a classification framework to assess the forests composition remotely, with special attention to mangroves. The methodology here implemented could be effectively applied in all coastal natural ecosystems of this island to improve the knowledge about the critical issues of these very fragile ecosystems.

TI  - Remote sensing mapping of vegetation land cover change with regard to rainfall variability in the Sahel: a multiscale approach
T2  - PHYSIO-GEO
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sahel is a fragile region, characterized in recent decades by profound changes in land use, which are the result of complex interactions between societies and their environment. These phenomena, which modulate and transform the landscape, take place on several spatial and temporal scales. However, few studies have highlighted this multidimensional reality, most generally focusing only on the local or regional level, and on a single site. In this study, we mobilized two scales (local and regional) on three different sites. On the one hand, we performed a diachronic mapping of land cover by the analysis of multispectral Landsat images and, on the other hand, we studied its articulation with NDVI and rainfall time series.The results bring out an original synthesis of the land cover trends observed in the Sahelian agropastoral zone. They help understanding the complexity of the multi-scale phenomena that characterize the evolution of Sahelian areas. If the analysis of the time series confirms, as has been observed by several authors, an overall regreening trend on a regional basis as a result of the improvement in rainfall conditions from the 1990s, the diachronic analyzes proposed in this study found significant contrasts at finer scales. Considering the total area mapped (Landsat images covering each region), the areas of vegetation cover progression between 1999 and 2010 represent 18 % of the Gourma area and 27 % for Fakara. In terms of net change between 1999 and 2010, in Fakara which has the highest rate of progression (+13 %), the Dantiandou municipality shows, in contrast, a negative rate (-35 %) which is not the case in the two other studied municipalities: +7 % for Tessekre (in Ferlo) and +12 % for Hombori (in Gourma).

T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the history of Hellenistic studies in Britain. Brought up in the spirit of purist classical historiography and philology, British historians found it difficult to accept the idea of a polysyllabic, syncretic civilization, combining elements traditionally perceived as purely Western or purely Eastern, even in ancient times and far to the East. The beginning of the collapse of the colonial system after the WWI and the shaky position of the occidentocentric worldview paradigm in the West and in the East, gave impetus to the development of Hellenistic studies in Britain and the United States. Having passed several levels of development, the historiography of Hellenism has now reached a new stage.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This study is the first work in implementing four-dimensional (4-D) hologram interferometry to simulate COVID-19 rate variations in slums using microwave remote sensing technology. The study also proposed a new mathematical formula to simulate the rate of COVID-19 from 4-D hologram interferometry; termed as Marghany's 4-D hologram SAR interferometry. The most critical challenge of the world is pandemic COVID-19; which is spreading widely across slums. Slums are considered the main source of criminals and diseases owing to lack of perfect housing, unsanitary conditions, poor infrastructures and occupancy security. The meagre in the impenetrable urban slums are the furthermost susceptible to impurity because of (i) scarce and delimited admission to wellbeing drinking water and satisfactory extents of water for individual sanitation; (ii) the absence of elimination and handling of an excretory product; and (iii) the lack of removal of solid waste. In this view, urban slum requires the standard and accurate method to be identified automatically from remote sensing data. In this context, a remote sensing technique plays a tremendous role in monitoring land use spatial variations. The data are used that involved historical three Sentinel-1A data. The consequences present that the hologram Interferometric technique is being an admirable device for a disordered urban slum in place of it can differentiate between them from its adjacent setting. Reconstruction of a 4-D urban slum is delivered by hologram Interferometric phase unwrapping based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), besides historical time variations of COVID-19 are allied with slum. Hologram interferometric reveals a countless imbrication of COVID percentage rate of 1.2% between high-class zone with the urban slum. The consequences disclose that urban slums, road networks, and infrastructures are effortlessly categorized. In conclusion, the hologram Interferometric based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an appropriate algorithm for chaotic 4-D urban slum automatic detection in Sentinel-1A.

TI  - Medieval Kazakh History in Arab and Persian Sources
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of this topic lies in the analysis of the study of medieval Kazakh history. After gaining independence, the processes of the revival of national identity, reinstatement of primitive spiritual and moral values and human mentality, which were sharply suppressed during the period of the Soviet totalitarian system, became widespread. Therewith, the widely discussed national-historical structure of the population, the knowledge of ethnic roots, the restoration of traditions and customs, which served as a connecting link, as well as the specificity and originality of the approach are of particular importance. Currently, the problem of objective reading, coverage, and popularisation of the ancient and medieval Kazakh history and culture is acute. By rejecting one-sided interpretations of historical events, established cliches require impartial, academic analysis based on evidence drawn from a wide range of sources. The purpose of this study is to identify the problems of the history of Kazakhstan in the 13th-14th centuries, the general laws of world historical development and the features of the historical process, folk traditions by using a scientific and systematic approach. Based on the systematisation and classification of data from the geographical and Arab historical records of the 13th-14th centuries, the analysis of written monuments is performed, their interdependence is established, and the degree of completeness and reliability of the data in the works of the narrative is determined in an integral system. Due to the scientific expeditions and research trips to Mongolia, China, and Germany, Kazakh orientalists analysed and performed the first systematic processing of archival materials and historical evidence of the early history of resettlement based on the ancient Turkic manuscript, ancient Indian, and Chinese sources that formed a picture of the proto and ancient history. For example, the features of stone figures give an idea of the military hierarchy, military operations, the settlement of ethnic groups (ethnogeography), the worldview of the Turks, etc.

T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - The present work tries to bridge a gap about the estimation of geometric and structural orchard parameters (LiDAR-derived) from vegetation indices from satellites. The maximum height and width, the cross-sectional area and the porosity were measured along the rows in a super-intensive almond (Prunus dulcis) orchard every 0.5 m by means of a Velodyne VLP16 LiDAR sensor. These parameters were interpolated to the pixel centroids of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 and correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from both platforms. The highest correlations were obtained between the NDVI of PlanetScope images and the cross-sectional area of the almond trees (R=0.72) and with the maximum width of the cross-sections (R=0.71). The results can be useful to estimate important canopy geometric parameters for site-specific management of orchards.

AB  - This contribution presents the design and simulations of a 1.8-m parabolic reflectarray to generate a multi-spot coverage from a geostationary satellite. The antenna has been designed to generate two spaced beams per feed in orthogonal circular polarizations (CP) simultaneously at transmission and reception frequencies in Ka-band. The parabolic reflectarray operates by the variable rotation technique independently applied at 19.7 GHz and 29.5 GHz to split the orthogonal CP beams focused by the parabolic surface. The proposed design technique and the simulated results have been experimentally validated by the manufacturing and testing of a 0.9-m parabolic reflectarray with the same operating principle. The proposed antenna technology can be used to provide multispot coverages in Ka-band from geostationary satellites, with the advantage of reducing to one-half the number of antennas and feed-chains commonly required using conventional reflectors.

C8  - 1
AB  - Innumeracy, that is, the inability to deal with numbers and provide correct estimates about political issues, is reported to be widespread among the public. Yet, despite the recognition that a conspiracy mindset is an increasingly common phenomenon in Western democracies, this has not been considered as a potential correlate of innumeracy. Using data from an online sample of respondents across ten European countries, we show that those with a higher propensity to hold a conspiracy worldview tend to overestimate the actual share of the immigrant population living in their own country. This association holds true when accounting for country heterogeneity and other cognitive, affective and socio-demographic factors. Employing a comparative design and refined measurements, the article contributes to our understanding of how a conspiracy mentality may influence perceptions of relevant political facts, questioning basic processes of democratic accountability.

AB  - The right to religious freedom has been approached with different intensity by the European Court of Human Rights and by the protective institutions of the Inter-American System, the Commission and the Court. However, the differences between the two protective spheres of human rights are not only quantitative, because they respond to different historical, political and social realities. Even so, there are also meeting points in the titular and obligated subjects, in the outline of their content and in their limits. The most striking aspect of the European Court is the constant recourse to the margin of national appreciation in the face of the diversity of positions of the member states of the Council of Europe; and, in the Inter-American System, the linking of the right to protection of the most vulnerable, either through the worldview of indigenous peoples, or because of its relationship with the work of many civil society activists with the poorest.

T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar altimeters are instruments carried on space missions and allow for determination of heights, particularly in oceans and ice sheets. The use of altimetry data on continental waters involves several challenges, such as the revisit frequency (typically 27 to 35 days), an accuracy of decimeters, data handling and processing, particularly for narrow rivers such as the Sao Francisco River (width<1km). Radar satellite altimetry has advantages over the conventional in situ monitoring network, including in terms of spatial coverage and global altimetric reference of data. Thus, altimetry data should be used as a complementary and/or alternative source to in situ data. In this context, this study consolidates and evaluates the altimetric series of five different altimetry missions: Envisat in two orbits, Saral, Sentinel 3-A, and Sentinel 3-B. The altimetry water level time series of 17 Virtual stations were compared with leveled gauging stations series to calculate absolute and relative errors. Ultimately, the errors varied from 0.13 m to 0.36 m in the best cases (41%), in line with recent literature. Sentinel-3 satellites showed the best RMSE absolute/relative results: 0.95/0.49 m (S-3A) and 0.96/0.52 m (S-3B). The second best RMSEs was Envisat-X (1.39/0.50 m), then Envisat (1.87/0.56 m) and Saral (1.74/0.60 m).

TI  - Inland Water Body Mapping Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change studies require increasingly detailed information on land cover and land use, to precisely model and predict climate based on their status and changes. A fundamental land cover type that needs to be constantly monitored by the climate change community is water, but currently there is a lack of high-resolution water body maps at the global scale. In this article, we present a fully automated procedure for the extraction of fine spatial resolution (10 m) inland water land cover maps for any region of the Earth by means of a relatively simple k-means clustering model applied to multitemporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 SAR sequences. Indeed, due to heavy cloud coverage conditions in many locations, multispectral sensors are not suitable for global water body mapping. For this reason, in this work, we deal only with SAR data, and specifically with multitemporal Sentinel-1 data sequences. The experimental results, obtained for three geographical areas selected because of their wide diversity in terms of geomorphology and climate, show an almost complete consistency with existing datasets, and improve them thanks to their finer spatial details.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of death in women up to 50 years old. For today the choice of an adequate methods of surgical intervention and the need for an adequate surgical adjuvant therapy, quality of life of patients after surgeryis are important. The aim of our study was to select the volume of surgery for breast cancer using the technique of intraoperative identification of the sentinel lymph node (intraoperative ICG technology) and to evaluate the results of its urgent histological examination. It was shown that the most common method of surgery in patients who underwent intraoperative ICG technology was quadrantectomy, which was performed in 27 cases (54%), rarely subcutaneous mastectomy was performed (30%) and radical mastectomy (by Madden) - 16%. In the control group, priority was given to radical removal of the breast (63.2% of cases); partial resection (by U. Veronesi) was performed in 33.3% of patients, and subcutaneous mastectomy - in 3.5%. Pathomorphological examination of the sentinel lymph node during its intraoperative imaging using ICG-technology established metastatic lesion in 10 of 50 cases (20%) in the main group. The obtained results of the assessment of the regional lymph dissection size in the main group indicate its adequate nature to ensure the radicality of surgical treatment. In our opinion, this is one of the important preliminary conclusions of this study, because to assess the clinical significance of signal lymph node (SLN) analysis as a marker of regional tumor spread, firstly it is necessary to be sured that existing surgical techniques provide radical tumor removal.

TI  - Assessment of air quality with TROPOMI during COVID-19 pandemic: NO<sub>2</sub> over the Po valley
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND THE ATMOSPHERE XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - An analysis of the air quality over the Po valley has been performed by using both satellite and in situ observations of NO2 for the COVID-19 years, 2019-2021. To match satellite observations to those in situ, we have used a geostatistical re-gridding technique. The tools allow us to scale the satellite NO2 retrievals to a finer spatial resolution, which helps us to perform a better spatial colocation with in situ observations. The satellite data consist of Level 2 (L2) NO2 retrievals from TROPOMI (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), whereas in situ observtaions are taken at eleven diverse stations, which are spread over the Po valley. The Po Valley, in the winter 2019/20, has been the first region in Europe to be severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Italian government introduced severe restriction measures from March to May 2020 (lockdown). We compared TROPOMI NO2 concentration during winters 2018-19 (no-COVID-19) and the following 2 winters. The observations of TROPOMI, in agreement with the in-situ measurements, saw a significant decrease in the NO2 concentration in March 2020 after the introduction of the lockdown. But they also found a general decrease in lower tropospheric NO2 in winter 2019/2020, the warmest winter ever observed that has limited the use of power for residential and commercial heating. NO2 concentrations raise almost to the pre-COVID-19 values in the 2020/21 winter.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Phytoplankton in the Coastal Waters of Semarang and Jepara for Monitoring the Eutrophication Process using MODIS-Aqua Imagery and Conventional Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) using the data of field observation and MODIS-Aqua imagery. The field observation data were retrieved by using a conventional method and processed using spectrometric analysis. This study covers the coastal and near land areas which have different levels of anthropogenic activity. The results showed that the coastal waters of Semarang with a high level of anthropogenic activity persistently show a concentration of chlorophyll a (chl-a) twice as large as Jepara coastal waters. This comparison value is obtained based on imagery and field data. Meanwhile, the ratio of chl-a field data in each region shows a value of +/- 5 times greater than the MODIS data. Field observation data shows a higher value than the MODIS-Aqua imagery data. The use of imagery data can be employed as a method of monitoring the eutrophication process on the coast. On the basis of the chlorophyll a classification and field observations, the coastal water of Semarang are classified as eutropic waters and Jepara is categorized as mesotropic category. The classification results will be different if monitoring is carried out using the image data with a location far from the mainland, the Semarang waters are included in the mesotropic category (> 2 mg.m(-3)) and Jepara is included in the oligotropic water category (< 2 mg.m(-3)).

TI  - The effects of land use on spatial pattern of urban green spaces and their cooling ability
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - While both composition and configuration of urban green spaces (UGS) have been shown to affect the cooling effect of UGS, more studies have focused on how land use affects UGS composition and the subsequent impacts on UGS cooling ability. We used Singapore to fill this gap by comparing the interrelationships among land use, spatial pattern and cooling effect of UGS between 2005 and 2015. Landsat imageries and Singapore's Master Plans were used to produce UGS, land surface temperature (LST) and land use maps. Our findings demonstrate that almost all land uses increased in size and lost vegetation over time and showed increased LST as a consequence. Our results support the limited evidence that land use not only affects the UGS composition, but influences their configuration and their cooling effect. In both years, land uses with more, simpler shape, less fragmented, and more connected UGS patches had lower LST and higher cooling effect. How UGS pattern affects cooling effect in each land use was shown to be dependent on the existing UGS pattern in that land use, with four major patterns identified. Our results may help urban planners evaluate the thermal consequences of their land use proposals.

TI  - Decision support systems for the prediction of lymph node involvement in early breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of lymph node involvement represents an im-portant task which could reduce unnecessary surgery and improve the definition of oncological therapies. An artificial intelligence model able to predict it in pre-operative phase requires the interface among multiple data structures. The trade-off among time consuming, expensive and invasive methodologies is emerging in experimental setups exploited for the analysis of sentinel lymph nodes, where machine learning algorithms represent a key ingredient in recorded data elaboration. The accuracy required for clinical applications is obtainable matching different kind of data. Sta- tistical associations of prognostic factors with symptoms and predictive models implemented also through on-line softwares represent useful diagnostic support tools which translate into patients quality of life improvement and costs reduction.

TI  - Cross-Sensor Adversarial Domain Adaptation of Landsat-8 and Proba-V Images for Cloud Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of Earth observation satellites carrying optical sensors with similar characteristics is constantly growing. Despite their similarities and the potential synergies among them, derived satellite products are often developed for each sensor independently. Differences in retrieved radiances lead to significant drops in accuracy, which hampers knowledge and information sharing across sensors. This is particularly harmful for machine learning algorithms, since gathering new ground-truth data to train models for each sensor is costly and requires experienced manpower. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation transformation to reduce the statistical differences between images of two satellite sensors in order to boost the performance of transfer learning models. The proposed methodology is based on the cycle consistent generative adversarial domain adaptation framework that trains the transformation model in an unpaired manner. In particular, Landsat-8 and Proba-V satellites, which present different but compatible spatio-spectral characteristics, are used to illustrate the method. The obtained transformation significantly reduces differences between the image datasets while preserving the spatial and spectral information of adapted images, which is, hence, useful for any general purpose cross-sensor application. In addition, the training of the proposed adversarial domain adaptation model can be modified to improve the performance in a specific remote sensing application, such as cloud detection, by including a dedicated term in the cost function. Results show that, when the proposed transformation is applied, cloud detection models trained in Landsat-8 data increase cloud detection accuracy in Proba-V.

TI  - RECENT CHANGES IN INDIGENOUS FEMINIST AGENDA IN LATIN AMERICA
T2  - PRODUCING INCLUSIVE FEMINIST KNOWLEDGE: Positionalities and Discourses in the Global South
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter critically examines dialogues between indigenous feminists and academic feminists about the role and significance of indigenous epistemologies in constructing social scientific knowledge, particularly feminist epistemologies. We argue that the term indigenous feminisms must be understood as broadly linking gender equality, decolonization, and sovereignty for indigenous peoples. In Latin America, this term typifies an activist and practical movement with cultural, economic, and politically specific dimensions. We posit that analytical and theoretical frameworks developed from indigenous women's ways of knowledge production should be recognized and legitimated in feminist discourse because much is learned from their worldview about women's emancipation, the importance of intersectionality in terms of race, ethnicity, and gender in indigenous contexts, in addition to political and cultural critiques. We show that indigenous feminist theoretical formulations are not homogenous but overlap in some areas of theoretical and practical formulations that involve new conceptualizations of the body, space, time, action/movement, and memory.

TI  - Genomic selection of forage agronomic traits in winter wheat
T2  - CROP SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Genomic selection (GS) can improve genetic gain of complex traits in plant breeding. Phenotyping agronomic traits of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for dual-purpose use is expensive and time-consuming. In this study, we compared the prediction accuracies of four GS models (RR-BLUP, GBLUP, GAUSS, and BL) for forage yield (FY), plant height (PH) and heading date (HD) of the hard winter wheat diversity panel (n = 298) using random and stratified sampling methods. In addition, we determined the appropriate training population (TP) size and marker density for GS of the traits. Moderate to high prediction accuracies ranging from 0.66 to 0.69 for FY, 0.46 to 0.49 for PH, and 0.71 to 0.74 for HD were observed for the GS models. However, the sampling method had little or no impact on prediction accuracy. The RR-BLUP, GBLUP, and GAUSS models produced slightly greater prediction accuracies than BL for all traits studied. Prediction accuracies increased with increasing TP size and marker density in all the GS models tested. However, increase of prediction accuracy started to plateau at n(TP) = 180 lines and 1,000; 1,500; or 3,000 SNPs suggesting that the minimum TP size and marker density were about 180 lines and 1,000 or more SNPs, depending on the model and trait. The impact of TP size on prediction accuracy was greater for RR-BLUP, GAUSS, and GBLUP than for BL model. This study suggests that RR-BLUP, GBLUP, and GAUSS are viable models for selecting the forage agronomic traits during dual-purpose wheat breeding.

TI  - Assessing the Natural Recovery of Mangroves after Human Disturbance Using Neural Network Classification and Sentinel-2 Imagery in Wunbaik Mangrove Forest, Myanmar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the natural recovery of mangroves in abandoned shrimp ponds located in the Wunbaik Mangrove Forest (WMF) in Myanmar using artificial neural network (ANN) classification and a change detection approach with Sentinel-2 satellite images. In 2020, we conducted various experiments related to mangrove classification by tuning input features and hyper-parameters. The selected ANN model was used with a transfer learning approach to predict the mangrove distribution in 2015. Changes were detected using classification results from 2015 and 2020. Naturally recovering mangroves were identified by extracting the change detection results of three abandoned shrimp ponds selected during field investigation. The proposed method yielded an overall accuracy of 95.98%, a kappa coefficient of 0.92, mangrove and non-mangrove precisions of 0.95 and 0.98, respectively, recalls of 0.96, and F1 scores of 0.96 for the 2020 classification. For the 2015 prediction, transfer learning improved model performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 97.20%, a kappa coefficient of 0.94, mangrove and non-mangrove precisions of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, recalls of 0.98 and 0.97, and F1 scores of 0.96. The change detection results showed that mangrove forests in the WMF slightly decreased between 2015 and 2020. Naturally recovering mangroves were detected at approximately 50% of each abandoned site within a short abandonment period. This study demonstrates that the ANN method using Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic and canopy height data can produce reliable results for mangrove classification. The natural recovery of mangroves presents a valuable opportunity for mangrove rehabilitation at human-disturbed sites in the WMF.

TI  - Conceptualization of the Axiological Opposition good - evil ( xubi -badi) in the Consciousness of Persian Native Speakers
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the article is to determine the conceptual content of the axiological opposition << good-evil >> in the Persian language consciousness based on the cognitive interpretation of the results of psycholinguistic experiment held among the Persian native speakers.Methods of the research. Two methods of psycholinguistic analysis of word's semantics have been used, viz.: free associative experiment and the method of direct interpretation of a word meaning. In total 102 persons of different age and social status took part in the experiment. Associative fields of the explored concepts were established based on the results of processing data collected during the 1st stage of the experiment; and their semantic fields were determined after analysis of unabridged predications in the course of semantization of proposed words. Result data were processed using special method of grouping language material based on contentanalysis: the benchmark words repeated in the answers of different participants were taken as units of the analysis and regarded as key concept features. At the final stage of the analysis there was performed cognitive interpretation of the data after the principle of << construing >> the meaning of linguistic expressions stipulated by Ronald Langacker.Results. The results of the experiment revealed that the axiological opposition << good-evil >> conceptualized in the Persian language consciousness has both universal and ethno-specific features. Moreover, prevailing of the former demonstrates that in the mentality of the Persian native speakers the idea of good and evil totally corresponds to the universal human worldview, where these moral and ethic categories serve as a basis for the system of the personal values.Conclusions. It was concluded that using the methods of cognitive- and psycholinguistics - the two up-to-date linguistic streams - for examining particularities of conceptualization of different fragments of internal and external human's world by representatives of variuos ethno-cultural societies, is the best way to determine a set of universal and ethno-specific features inherent in both processes of associating of respondents and the content structure of the examined concepts.

TI  - Good Heart: Telling Stories of Cardiovascular Protective and Risk Factors for Aboriginal Women
T2  - HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives of health and cultural wellbeing encapsulate the spiritual, social and environmental health of individuals, their communities and country. Strategies designed to reduce the cardiovascular burden of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people often fail to consider their unique knowledge and worldview.Methods This adapted, grounded theory study sought to explore Aboriginal women's views of cardiovascular protective and risk factors.Results Twenty-eight (28) women from five women's groups across Central and South Australia participated. Women distinguished the heart as core to their spiritual and physical wellbeing. Women identified six attributes that keep a woman's heart strong, four that can make the heart sick, and eight socio-ecological factors which affect a woman's capacity to care for their heart. Women described having a healthy heart when able to identify as Aboriginal women, being connected to family and community, having a healthy life and body, and being engaged in their health and health care.Conclusions There are gaps in the provision of cardiovascular risk assessment and management, gaps in the cultural safety of primary health care services, and gaps in the communication of the sex-specific warning signs of a heart attack, all of which must be addressed.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Wetland ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions are under increasing stress due to demands for water resources, encroachment of urban and agricultural land use, and changes in climate and hydrologic regimes. An integrated geospatial and remote sensing approach is required to understand the current state and expected range of variability in these systems. Here we describe a research tool called the Wetland Analysis Toolbar (WetBar) and its application in a multi-agency restoration effort for the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout in the Great Basin region of the United States. A significant amount of research for restoring this species has been performed at the field scale, but remote sensing and GIS methods are required to scale these efforts to the species' historic range. This will include methods for riparian mapping, determining an appropriate spatial scale for schemes for disaggregating the historic range, and developing metrics for choosing which regions should be targeted for habitat protection or restoration activities. The WetBar software integrates Google Earth Engine cloud computing directly into the ESRI ArcMap environment, enabling decades-long time series of multispectral satellite and climate data to be used within a querying environment. WetBar disaggregates the network of wetland environments to appropriate spatial units based on elevation and geometric operators and automatically tags these subunits with land use attributes, environmental data, and statistics that capture multi-decadal trends observed by satellite remote sensing. This information will then be used in weighted functions to allocate the limited resources for restoration in a coordinated and effective manner.

TI  - Inconsistencies in sulfur dioxide emissions from the Canadian oil sands and potential implications
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived and reported sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the Canadian oil sands are shown to have been consistent up to 2013. Post-2013, these sources of emissions data diverged, with reported emissions dropping by a factor of two, while satellite-derived emissions for the region remained relatively constant, with the discrepancy (satellite-derived emissions minus reported emissions) peaking at 50 kt(SO2) yr(-1) around 2016. The 2013-2014 period corresponds to when new flue-gas desulfurization units came on-line. Previous work has established a high level of consistency between at-stack SO2 emissions observations and satellite estimates, and surface monitoring network SO2 concentrations over the same multi-year period show similar trends as the satellite data, with a slight increase in concentrations post-2013. No clear explanation for this discrepancy currently exists. The implications of the discrepancy towards estimated total sulfur deposition to downwind ecosystems were estimated relative to 2013 emissions levels, with the satellite-derived values leaving the area of regional critical load exceedances of aquatic ecosystems largely unchanged from 2013 values, 335 000 km(2), and reported values potentially decreasing this area to 185 000 km(2).

TI  - Tracing plant-environment interactions from organismal to planetary scales using stable isotopes: a mini review
T2  - EMERGING TOPICS IN LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural isotope variation forms a mosaic of isotopically distinct pools across the biosphere and flows between pools integrate plant ecology with global biogeochemical cycling. Carbon, nitrogen, and water isotopic ratios (among others) can be measured in plant tissues, at root and foliar interfaces, and in adjacent atmospheric, water, and soil environments. Natural abundance isotopes provide ecological insight to complement and enhance biogeochemical research, such as understanding the physiological conditions during photosynthetic assimilation (e.g. water stress) or the contribution of unusual plant water or nutrient sources (e.g. fog, foliar deposition). While foundational concepts and methods have endured through four decades of research, technological improvements that enable measurement at fine spatiotemporal scales, of multiple isotopes, and of isoto-pomers, are advancing the field of stable isotope ecology. For example, isotope studies now benefit from the maturation of field-portable infrared spectroscopy, which allows the exploration of plant-environment sensitivity at physiological timescales. Isotope ecology is also benefiting from, and contributing to, new understanding of the plant-soil-atmosphere system, such as improving the representation of soil carbon pools and turnover in land surface models. At larger Earth-system scales, a maturing global coverage of isotope data and new data from site networks offer exciting synthesis opportunities to merge the insights of single-or multi-isotope analysis with ecosystem and remote sensing data in a data-driven modeling framework, to create geospatial isotope products essential for studies of global environmental change.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The identification of hydrothermal minerals through the use of multispectral satellite images provides essential information in the first phases of mining prospection. The main goal of this research is to recognize by means analyses of satellite images of the studied zone that could be suitable for the mining activity. Lansat-8 and ASTER multispectral imagines were carried out by different spectral mapping techniques to extract the data. The RGB technique was used to mapping the altered minerals analysing band ratios and spectral indices to highlight areas of abundance of iron oxides, clay minerals and carbonates. The principal component analysis helped in the discrimination of mineral alterations as advanced argillic, intermediate argillic and propylitic alteration. On the other side, the spectral analysis method (SAM) and the lineal spectral unit (LSU) classification method helps defining mineralogical associations and new exploration targets. This methodology allows to recognize an advanced argillic alteration, intermediate argillic alteration, and oxides as hematite and jarosite zones. Carbonates are present in variable concentrations all over the studied area. The results were integrated with the cartographic and metallogenetic information and it was verified by mean the application of reflectance spectrometry. There is an agreement in the results of the application of the multispectral techniques PCA, SAM, LSU in the data set of the Lansat-8 and ASTER sensors for the mapping of alteration minerals. In conclusion this study permitted to optimize the first prospective phases to localize potential target for future mining activity.

TI  - Spatiotemporal persistence of bat roadkill hotspots in response to dynamics of habitat suitability and activity patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife roadkill hotspots are frequently used to identify priority locations for implementing mitigation measures. However, understanding the landscape-context and the spatial and temporal dynamics of these hotspots is challenging. Here, we investigate the factors that drive the spatiotemporal variation of bat mortality hotspots on roads along three years. We hypothesize that hotspot locations occur where bat activity is higher and that this activity is related to vegetation density and productivity, probably because this is associated with food availability. Statistically significant clusters of bat-vehicle collisions for each year were identified using the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approach. Additionally, we used a spatiotemporal analysis and generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the effect of local spatiotemporal variation of environmental indices and bat activity to predict the variation on roadkill hotspot locations and to asses hotspot strength over time. Between 2009 and 2011 we conducted daily surveys of bat casualties along a 51-km-long transect that incorporates different types of roads in southern Portugal. We found 509 casualties and we identified 86 statistically significant roadkill hotspots, which comprised 12% of the road network length and contained 61% of the casualties. Hotspots tended to be located in areas with higher accumulation of vegetation productivity along the three-year period, high bat activity and low temperature. Furthermore, we found that only 17% of the road network length was consistently classified as hotspots across all years; while 43% of hotspots vanished in consecutive years and 40% of new road segments were classified as hotspots. Thus, non-persistent hotspots were the most frequent category. Spatiotemporal changes in hotspot location are associated with decreasing vegetation production and increasing water stress on road surroundings. This supports our hypothesis that a decline on overall vegetation productivity and increase of roadside water deficit, and the presumed lower abundance of prey, have a significant effect on the decrease of bat roadkills. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that freely available remote sensing data can be a powerful tool to quantify bat roadkill risk and assess its spatiotemporal dynamics.

T2  - ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the final results of excavations at one of the largest Neolithic sites in northeastern Asiaa settlement on Suchu Island on the Amur. Most of the rich collection (3967 spec.), owned by IAET SB RAS (stone tools, ceramics, ornaments, and artistic and ritual artifacts), has not been described before. This publication focuses on the analysis of artifacts from dwelling 2 (excavation III, 1977). We describe the construction of this semi-underground dwelling, circular in plan view. The typological analysis of the lithics indicates a complex economy. Many of them (arrowheads, projectile points, inserts, knives, plummets) relate to hunting and fishing, and to processing carcasses (end-scrapers, scrapers, burins, combination tools), others are chopping tools. The distinctive feature of the lithics is that some are bifacial. The analysis of the ceramics suggests that they belong to the Late Neolithic Voznesenovskoye culture. The use of binocular microscopy allowed us to assess the technological and constructive properties of the ceramics, as well as their morphological, decorative, and functional features. Non-utilitarian artifacts shed light on the worldview of the Suchu people. The collection dates to the mid-second millennium BC.

TI  - Spaceborne observations of aerosol vertical distribution over Indian mainland (2009-2018)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the past two decades, high aerosol loading is being observed over the Indian mainland. It becomes necessary to continuously monitor and understand the distribution of aerosol loading over the Indian landmass, as it might have serious health and climatic implications. Whereas there have been extensive studies reporting seasonal distribution and trends of columnar aerosol amounts over the Indian region using data from ground based as well as space borne measurements, in-depth studies on the aerosol vertical profile distribution and in particular, seasonal trends are still lacking. This paper demonstrates the seasonal variability of aerosol vertical structure over the Indian mainland using decadal daily datasets (2009-2018) from CALIOP Lidar (onboard NASA-CNES's CALIPSO satellite) augmented by the variability in columnar AOD from MODIS (onboard NASA's AQUA and TERRA platforms). The changing aerosol amounts in both vertical and total column levels have also been presented. Over Indian landmass, we could find statistically significant increasing trends in aerosol extinction within lower altitude levels during all the seasons. The trends in the vertical distribution of aerosols are also compared with respect to trends in AOD derived from MODIS (Aqua/Terra). Additionally, we have also examined the seasonal variability and trends of aerosol extinction over five selected cities (based on pollution and population levels) of the country.

TI  - Flood control management recommendation of Citarum Hilir Sub-watersheds using remote sensing and geographic information system approach
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Floods that occurred in the Citarum watershed are caused by land degradation and environmental damage following the population and economic pressure on its surrounding. To overcome this problem, proper planning and uninterrupted observation on the physical characteristics of the watershed are needed. This study aims to: 1) identify the physical characteristics of the Citarum Hilir Sub-Watershed that affect the flow coefficient; 2) calculate the flow coefficient by considering the physical characteristics of the sub-watershed; 3) provide management recommendations of the Citarum Hilir Sub-Watershed for flood control. The method to identify the flood characteristics is by calculating the coefficient of river flow using Cook method which incorporates parameters of slope, soil infiltration, land use, and drainage density, deducted from DEM SRTM and Landsat-8. Using Multiparametric GIS Analysis, the result shows that the physical characteristic of land use contributed the most, which is 34.55% to the flow coefficient assessment. The slope parameter has an influence of 25.44%, soil infiltration is 11.42%, and drainage density is 28.60%. The total flow coefficient value is 52.32%, so it is classified as high criteria. Therefore, this area has high flood potential that are prioritized for handling flood control. This area covers a land unit with high to extreme flow coefficient values, which is 73.96% of the total area. Several efforts can be made to follow up the flood control on these priority areas, such as land use management, forest and land rehabilitation, soil and water conservation, and integrated watershed management. Land use planning must refer to this analysis to determine the suitability of land use for water and forest conservation to remediate those high to extreme flow coefficient values. The evaluation on Regional Planning Map of West Java Province in 2009-2029, is needed as a recommendation to control the flood and enhance the Citarum Hilir management.

AB  - he dataset was created by UNIFI-ICARDA aiming to list all the soil and water conservation and restoration interventions in the Badia region, in Jordan. All the interventions were georeferenced by using public domain remote sensing data: Google Earth, was the principal source of information, although the image coverage of GE for Badia is heterogeneous and some Badia areas are covered only by old images. In these areas, a cross evaluation was done using Bing Satellite Imagery, where it offered more recent images. The identified interventions are divided by categories: 58 dams, 203 tanks, 841 check dams, 51 contour structure interventions, 27 reforestation sites, 30 desert restorations, 115 spontaneous intervention. A dam is an artificial structure typically made of concrete or earth and built to inbound water, creating a permanent or semi-permanent basin along a main waterway to support agriculture in the surrounding area. A tank is an artificial water pond built by private or governmental initiative in order to collect and stock seasonal water flows for agricultural/animal husbandry purposes. Check dams are linear structures made of earth (sometimes rock, or concrete), built transversal to the stream flow in the ephemeral river bed, in order to to slow down the flow of water, to increase ground water recharge as well as for agricultural and anti-erosion purposes. Contour structures consist of linear micro-catchment interventions characterized by ridges and furrows traced along the contour lines, where drought tolerant shrubs species are planted in ridges to provide a source of fodder for livestock. They are divided in continuous and discontinuous type. Reforestation interventions consist of vast land works following the contour lines along the slopes, where vegetation was established. Desert restoration interventions includes three different type of interventions: proper desert restoration like dune fixation structures, afforestation interventions, and aquifer recharge structures. Spontaneous hydraulic interventions seem to be similar in purpose to check dams, although showing a more irregular structure and distribution pattern. These structures are often closely connected with other agricultural structures and probably linked to private initiative. The mapped dams and tanks were compared with two other datasets generated by the Jordan institutions: CAP database (list of Badia Restoration Program interventions) and the WAJ database (list of Jordan Valley Authority interventions), resulting in some correspondences, although the comparison was only partially possible because the available satellite images were in several cases too old, particularly in eastern Badia. In other cases, even in presence of recent images, the structures were not found (neither on GE nor on Bing), revealing possible errors of the coordinates indicated by the two datasets.

TI  - The Worldview of the 18th-19th Centuries. Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss (Based on D. Kehlmann's Nove<i>l Measuring the World</i>)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the worldview of the 18th-19th centuries developed by three contemporaries. The philosophy of Immanuel Kant is placed at the center of the worldview, in relation to which the views of Alexander von Humboldt represent a return to Cartesianism, and the views of Carl Friedrich Gauss an appeal to the future, to the theory of relativity of space and time. I. Kant taught that Euclidean space is, as the critique of pure reason asserts, the form of our contemplation, prescribed to every possible experience. For Humboldt, the world is fully measurable within three-dimensional Euclidean space. Gauss, on the other hand, thinks of Kant further, theoretically admitting and mathematically calculating the various possibilities of conceivability of space, thus the world for him is more relative, fiction, or a beautiful dream. Space is folded, curved and very strange. Cartesianism and the relativism of both scientists also extend to their ethical concepts: for Humboldt, man is a machine of "highest skill" designed to serve humanistic goals; for Gauss, human behavior admits of accidents and exceptions, although it did not reach the proper rationality and does not deserve attention, but yet, genius is possible. The personal characteristics of both scientists, as well as the connection with their epoch are revealed. Humboldt appears as a humanist, and Gauss as a misanthrope. It is concluded that the worldview is not one-dimensional, but includes the past, present, future of science, and also allows for mystery, chance, mystical elements present in culture.

TI  - Delimitation of low topsoil moisture content areas in a vineyard using remote sensing imagery (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) in a Mediterranean-climate region
T2  - SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation can be responsible for salt accumulation in the root zone of grapevines when late autumn and winter precipitation is not enough to leach salts from the soil upper horizons, turning the soil unsuitable for grape production. The aim of this work is to present a novel methodology to outline areas, within a drip-irrigated vineyard, with a low soil moisture content (SMC) during, and after, an 11-month agricultural drought. Soil moisture (SM) field measurements were performed in two plots at the vineyard, followed by a geostatistical method (indicator kriging) to estimate the SM class probabilities according to a threshold value, enlarging the training set for the classification algorithms. The logistic regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) methods used the features of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and terrain parameters to classify the SMC probabilities at the vineyard. Both methods classified the highest SMC probabilities above 14% that is located close to the stream at the lower altitudes. The RF method performed very well in classifying the topsoil zones with a lower SMC during the autumn-winter period. This delineation allows the prevention of the occurrence of areas affected by salinisation, indicating which areas will need irrigation management strategies to control the salinity, especially under climate change, and the expected increase in droughts.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture with SAR Data in Large Area Based on Support Vector Regression
T2  - THIRTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING (ICDIP 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Conference on Digital Image Processing (ICDIP)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter in the surface process, and it is indispensable in the field of crop growth and drought monitoring. SAR can penetrate clouds and fog to achieve high-resolution observations, so it has great advantages in remote sensing estimation of soil moisture. In this paper, Sentinel-1A radar data and MODIS were used to explore the applicability of soil moisture retrieval in a large area based on the support vector regression (SVR) method. By analyzing the characteristics closely related to soil moisture, the input of the algorithm was determined including VV, VH polarization backscattering coefficient, radar local incident angle (LIA), digital elevation model (DEM), slope (SLP), and normalized vegetation index (NDVI). Then the accuracy of the SVR model constructed with different feature combinations was discussed, and the best performing model was selected to estimate soil moisture in northern and central Anhui province. The results showed that the model with the combination of VV, LIA, NDVI, DEM, and SLP input had the highest accuracy with R-2 of 0.9413 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0085 cm(3).cm(-3), in which terrain factor had a greater impact. Finally, the best model was used to achieve a wide range of soil moisture retrieval, and test samples were used to verify the estimation accuracy with R-2 of 0.6444 and RMSE of 0.036 cm(3).cm(-3). Moreover, the temporal and spatial distribution of the retrieval result is reasonable, which can characterize the distribution difference of a large study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes the project work on asteroseismology at the ERASMUS+ GATE 2020 Summer school(1) on space satellite data. The aim was to do a global asteroseismic analysis of KIC 5006817, and quantify its stellar properties using the high-quality, state of the art space missions data. We employed the aperture photometry to analyze the data from the Kepler space telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Using the lightkurve Python package, we have derived the asteroseismic parameters and calculated the stellar parameters using the scaling relations. Our analysis of KIC 5006817 confirmed its classification as a heartbeat binary. The rich oscillation spectrum facilitate estimating power excess (nu(max)) at 145.50 +/- 0.50 mu Hz and large frequency separation (Delta nu) to be 11.63 +/- 0.10 mu Hz. Our results showed that the primary component is a low-luminosity, red-giant branch star with a mass, radius, surface gravity and luminosity of 1.53 +/- 0.07 M-circle dot, 5.91 +/- 0.12 R-circle dot, 3.08 +/- 0.01 dex, and 19.66 +/- 0.73 L-circle dot, respectively. The orbital period of the system is 94.83 +/- 0.05 d.

TI  - THE DISCOURSE OF EDUCATION IN THE PUBLICISTIC WORKS BY D. I. FONVIZIN
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the discourse of education in the publicistic works of the outstanding Russian writer and playwright D. I. Fonvizin, whose worldview was formed under the influence of the ideas of the Enlightenment, including the concept of S. Montesquieu about the predisposition of peoples to a particular type of political government. In the dramatic and journalistic work of the Russian satirist, two mutually exclusive educational and social ideals are clearly revealed: authoritarian-traditionalist and democratic. Fonvizin believed that it is the authoritarian model of society that is most suitable for countries such as France and Russia, so he paid great attention to the question of the qualitative difference between the elite and the subordinate segments of the population. The discourse of education and social inequality, which included, among other things, the demonstration and evaluation of various models of social behavior, legitimized the social privileges of the aristocracy, its right to rule and own slaves.

T2  - SPACE, SATELLITES, AND SUSTAINABILITY II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Space, Satellites, and Sustainability II
CL  - Glasgow, SCOTLAND
AB  - Habitat mapping is key to meeting land management and conservation objectives, from supporting estimation of natural capital in a landscape to monitoring habitat change over time. Current land management challenges, including conserving rare species and habitats, illustrate a growing need for spatially extensive and rapidly updatable biodiversity information; a need that can best be met through remotely sensed imagery combined with the remarkable data processing potential of machine learning.We assess the potential for optical satellite data to classify complex upland habitat types in the Scottish Highlands, following two UK national habitat classification frameworks. We explore how the differences in spatial and spectral resolution of satellite sensors affects the accuracy of derived habitat maps. Specifically, we contrast the performance of open-source Sentinel-2 data (20 m spatial resolution) against higher spatial-resolution data from the commercial Worldview-2 satellite (0.5 m resolution). We then compare the results produced with these satellite datasets against equivalent results obtained with high-resolution (25 cm) colour airborne photographs, to better inform users on the utility of available optical data before subsequent analysis, e.g. natural capital assessments, in comparable settings.We demonstrate that high-fidelity habitat maps (93% overall accuracy) can be produced using high resolution optical satellite data (Worldview-2). This level of accuracy exceeded that of maps derived from airborne surveys (similar to 75%) and is deemed sufficient to be useful to ecologists in-situ. In contrast, the capacity of Sentinel-2 data was considerably more limited (similar to 50% overall accuracy). This highlights the importance of spatial resolution for characterising habitat mosaics at scale, especially in settings such as upland Scotland where shifts in habitat and species composition of importance to land managers may occur at relatively fine length scales (<10m). Provided high spatial resolution optical data is available, the framework developed is scalable to a national scale, therefore, facilitating effective land management strategies

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we argue that the relationship between nature conservation and warfare was and continues to be actualized through socio-technical relationships and shared infrastructures. We historicize "green militarization"-defined as the use of military techniques, technologies and partnerships in the pursuit of conservation (Lunstrum 2014)-showing that the partnership between military and nature conservation in Southern Africa has a long and violent history. Our paper accounts for the entanglements of war and nature through a shared technological infrastructure used in north-eastern Namibia during the Namibian War of Liberation (1966-1989). In particular, we focus on the Mirage IIIR2Z, an aerial reconnaissance and ground attack supersonic jet which provided both the South African Defence Force and the civil administration's nature conservationists with aerial photography and remote sensing data. The spatial information produced jointly by the military and the civil nature conservation department was used to produce strategic maps, but also to fight invasive plants and protect wildlife. Our reading of green militarization against this background sheds light on the long-lasting connections between warfare, conservation and ecology along Southern African border regions and contributes to a novel understanding of the contemporary "war on poachers" through a study of the techno-scientific networks that made it possible. Since there is nothing inevitable about the way technologies emerge or change over time (Bijker and Law 1992), this paper develops an empirically grounded and sustained analysis of technological change in the domain of green militarization through three interlinked concepts: "multiple" (Law 2002), "shifting down" (Latour 1994; 1999), and "firming up" (Bijker and Law 1992).

AB  - The article states that the interpretation of law is an intense intellectual activity which is carried out on the basis of (1) empirical experience and (2) of the knowledge of interpreter. The result of interpretation is inevitably an outcome of relation between subjective experience and available knowledge. Personal experience frames the content of subjective morality, whereas the worldview is shaped (interconnections within the global development are observed) based on knowledge. It is emphasized that the personal experience is something that already cannot be changed, that the empirical experience and knowledge are interrelated in the context of development of personal worldview. The article concludes that the philosophical cognition of the law implies not only familiarity with the content of legal norms, but also perception of its ontological problems. Therefore "solving" a problem of understanding a constitutional or other legal norm "only within the legal framework" means either (1) not understanding the ontological basis of the problem or (2) not solving the problem after having perceived its ontological basis.

AB  - This second part of two related articles reports the answers to the research question: What precise supports must be in place for Grades 5 to 12 teachers to enhance their mathematics classes in a sustainable way with Indigenous mathematizing and Indigenous worldview perspectives? In addition to various logistical supports, two other types of supports were identified: supports for learning and unlearning ways of perceiving the world generally and perceiving Western mathematics specifically. These needed supports came to light when we mentored the teachers. On the one hand, the co-researching teachers learned, or had already learned: (a) the plurality of mathematical systems; (b) the perspective of Western mathematics as a human endeavor along with its values, ideologies, and definitions; (c) the mere inclusion of Indigenous mathematizing in a lesson is not enough; and (d) the goal of two-eyed seeing. On the other hand, the co-researching teachers unlearned, or had already unlearned: (a) pure mathematics' claim to be value-free, (b) all students have a predilection to excel at mathematics, and (c) subtle appropriation committed by many mathematics educators as if it were common sense to do it.

It is called the sea world and tries to classify it into another area of life formed by human society.Seafarers were simultaneously subject to political and social changes in other countries related to policy, international law, and fishing in Korea. The sailors faced changes in the international community at the forefront and established a base by moving around the sea and the world. Fishing bases were built in fishing grounds in the North Pacific, South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Atlantic, and South Ice Oceans, and networks were created based on them. The worldview and perception of the sailors aboard the deep-sea fishing boat were formed at the scene of the sea.

AB  - This dissertation analyzes Tamra’s exchanges with other countries in the 10th and 12th centuries to explore the maritime characteristics and the nature of Tamra’s maritime activities. The study of the relationship between Tamla and Goryeo, which had been held between the 10th and 12th centuries, was mainly focused on the political part.However, people called the Tamra people also went to the sea to make a living and expand their lives. The nameless Tamra people risked trading across the sea to neighboring countries. The pre-modern sea was a place of life and a world of possibility to expand the limited area of Jeju.At that time, Tamra interacted with neighboring countries such as Song, Japan, and Goryeo through its search in East Asia trade system based on the sea, and advanced civilization accepted from them stimulated Tamra’s culture and became the foundation for a new culture.After the foundation of Korea, Goryeo wanted to enhance the international status embodied in the Palgwanhoe’s(八關會) foreign participation event. Merchants who visited Goryeo from Song(송), Kitani(거란), Durchin(여진), Tamra, Japan, and Arabia(大食國) strengthened their tribute Trade and embodied the multi-pronged worldview of Goryeo through a gift-giving event to the king at Palgwanhoe.Tamra took advantage of this and actively participated in relations with Goryeo, earning economic benefits from trade with neighboring countries that visited Goryeo. Although Tamra was ruled by Goryeo, it continued its exchange activities through the sea as it existed as an independent country under the system of appointing tributes and kings. The weather deteriorated and the ship was damaged and drifted to Sung(宋) and Japan, which also gave another opportunity for exchange.Tamra became a province of Goryeo in the mid-12th century, losing its status as an independent country, and the scope and appearance of maritime activities were greatly reduced. The Goryeo government’s heavy tax collection and exploitation caused opposition from Tom Line, which led to a rebellion.

TI  - Eruptive history and volcano-tectonic evolution of Paka volcanic complex in the northern Kenya rift: Insights into the geothermal heat source
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we provide insights into the eruptive history and volcano-tectonic evolution of the Paka volcanic complex in a revised stratigraphic framework. We integrate all available 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dates along with field observations, remote sensing data, and the analysis of surface and cutting samples from a 2552 m deep borehole (PK-01). Chemical analyses distinguish basalt, hawaiite, mugearite, benmorite, and trachyte rock type in Paka. It also indicates that the eruptive products are genetically related by fractional crystallization. Major element mass balance and Rhyolite-MELTS models are consistent with the trachyte being generated by 74-83% fractional crystallization of Paka basalt. Before the growth of the volcano, volcanic activity was characterised by plateau fissure eruptions at 582-405 ka. Eruptions directly related to the Paka edifice are divided into four different volcanic sequences. Sequences 1-4 span the periods 390-278 ka, 247-205 ka, 160-36 ka, and 36-8 ka. The Pre-Paka plateau eruption products outcrop at the base of the volcano flanks and are overlain by edificeforming trachyte. Initial caldera-related subsidence is expressed by arcuate structures to the west and southeast parts of the volcano. These initial collapses are associated with tuff and pyroclastic eruptions estimated to have occurred at similar to 38 ka. Following these explosive eruptions, a similar to 1.5 by similar to 1.6 km main caldera developed. The lithological information from the drilled geothermal exploration borehole PK-01 indicates a minimum thickness of similar to 2200 m for the extrusive lava sequences, with the uppermost 1050 m of the strata being directly related to eruptions from the Paka volcano (Phases 1-4). We estimate a minimum total bulk volume of similar to 50 km(3) for the volcanic material erupted from Paka during the last -390 ka. This translates to an average eruption rate of similar to 1.2 x 10(-4) km(3)/yr. The associated advected magmatic heat supported an 'excess' heat flux ranging between 110 and 138 mW/m(2) or about twice present day average continental flux (57 mW/m(2)) and about 1.3 times the background values in geothermal areas (90 mW/m(2)). The apparent high heat flux implies a magma-driven geothermal system, where convection of the hydrothermal fluid is occurring above the heat source. Structural mapping revealed normal faults, strike-slip faults, lineaments, and an array of eruptive vents and domes as the main volcano-tectonic structures. We infer at least four faulting and fault reactivation events that have occurred during Paka geological history. The structural orientations in the area are dominated by NNE and NW with subordinate N-S and NNW striking structures. Evidence suggests that the intersection of NNE and NW trending structures may have had a major influence on the volcanism in the area.

TI  - Wildflower plantings in commercial agroecosystems promote generalist predators of Colorado potato beetle
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildflower plantings in agroecosystems can support arthropod predators, and may have the potential to increase conservation biological control of pest species in nearby crops. Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is a significant defoliator of potato that is resistant to many forms of management. Promoting natural enemies of CPB by establishing perennial wildflower plantings in field margins may provide a measure of control for this pest. We examined the impacts of floral plantings on the abundance of known CPB predators, predation of CPB egg masses, and CPB populations in a commercial agroecosystem. Floral plantings increased the abundance of CPB predators, but did not significantly increase the rate of predation of sentinel CPB egg masses within field margins. Within nearby potato fields, predator abundance and predation rates on CPB eggs were unaffected by the presence of flowers. Colorado potato beetle abundance in potato fields was also not impacted by floral plantings. However, floral margins may provide improved overwintering opportunities for CPB, and further investigation is needed. Perennial wildflower plantings show potential for attracting predators that prey on CPB, but these benefits do not extend into nearby potato crops.

TI  - Global Earthquake Forecasting System (GEFS): The challenges ahead
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We conclude this special issue on the Global Earthquake Forecasting System (GEFS) by briefly reviewing and analyzing the claims of non-seismic precursors made in the present volume, and by reflecting on the current limitations and future directions to take. We find that most studies presented in this special volume, taken individually, do not provide strong enough evidence of non-seismic precursors to large earthquakes. The majority of the presented results are hampered by the fact that the task at hand is susceptible to potential biases in data selection and possible overfitting. The most encouraging results are obtained for ground-based geoelectric signals, although the probability gain is likely small compared to an earthquake clustering baseline. The only systematic search on satellite data available so far, those of the DEMETER mission, did not find a robust precursory pattern. The conclusion that we can draw is that the overall absence of convincing evidence is likely due to a deficit in systematically applying robust statistical methods and in integrating scientific knowledge of different fields. Most authors are specialists of their field while the study of earthquake precursors requires a system approach combined with the knowledge of many specific characteristics of seismicity. Relating non-seismic precursors to earthquakes remains a challenging multidisciplinary field of investigation. The plausibility of these precursors predicted by models of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling, together with the suggestive evidence collected here, call for further investigations. The primary goal of the GEFS is thus to build a global database of candidate signals, which could potentially improve earthquake predictability (if the weak signals observed are real and false positives sufficiently uncorrelated between different data sources). Such a stacking of disparate and voluminous data will require big data storage and machine learning pipelines, which has become feasible only recently. This special issue compiled an eclectic list of non-seismic precursor candidates, which is in itself a valuable source of information for seismologists, geophysicists and other scientists who may not be familiar with such types of investigations. It also forms the foundation for a coherent, multi-disciplinary collaboration on earthquake prediction.

AB  - This paper takes as reference the sociological ideology that is inferred from the essays of Mario Vargas Llosa. At the same time, that worldview that will be identified by the author will be explained and linked to The Time of the Hero. The objective of this confrontational work is to propose an epistemological organization based on the perception of the Peruvian writer and to appreciate how it is corroborated in one of his novels. For this, I have systematized the themes that the narrator reoccurs in extrapolating in his speech, which are related to the conception of Literature and human nature. These topics will be important for the reader to make a judgment about reality.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This thesis aims to complement the theory of ecological writing by establishing the concept of ecological writing, focusing on the aspects of sanctions and perspectives, and looking at the writing process that fits the term ecological writing. Ecological writing is not limited to using natural objects as subjects, but is a writing that discovers the essence and meaning of life in natural objects by interacting with objects. Ecological writing is an exploration of the writing process from the perspective of content to the topic being put into a work while containing the ecological spirit. Ecological writing considers the author's psychological process as an object of inquiry, from observing objects to expressing the enlightenment gained through writing.Next, we looked at the writing process of ecological writing. Lee Ok's <Part about fleas[蚤賦]> and <Second part of Fleas[後蚤賦]> and Yeonam's <Nungyang Poems[菱洋詩集序]> were presented as examples. In order to effectively convey the subject, Lee took a dramatic method by dividing it into <Part about fleas[蚤賦]> and <Second part of Fleas[後蚤賦]>. In order to effectively convey the subject, Lee Ok took a dramatic method by dividing it into <Part about fleas[蚤賦]> and <Second part of Fleas[後蚤賦]>. Lee Ok's <Part about fleas[蚤賦]> and <Second part of Fleas[後蚤賦]> are works that unfold the worldview of Mul-ah-gyun-si[物我均視] that the existence of humans and insects is equal by using the writing method of self-defeat using a small bug called flea as a subject. In Yeonam's <Nungyang Poems[菱洋詩集序]>, the artist observes objects in detail and juxtaposes the truth obtained with human society. Yeonam connects discoveries from objects with epistemology or aesthetic consciousness and replaces them with criticism of reality. Looking at the psychological process that Yeonam performed ecological writing, it was proceeding with the process of ‘observing ⤑ discovering ⤑ connecting with epistemology ⤑ replacing with reality'. By continuing to explore ecological writing strategies, it will be revealed that ecological writing is not a fixed content and form, but a writing that shows various forms and techniques according to the individual's personality.

T2  - TRANS-FORM-ACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout this text, we will try to comprehend how Social Media can be understood as a set of digital platforms that are able to bias human understanding towards the creation of an "image of existence". An "image" that, more than being subjected to its users will, is capable of creating on them a specific idea of self as well as of their worldview, an idea that is already technologically predetermined. Taking the phenomenological tradition as its fundamental thinking ground, in this article we will think about the hermeneutical dimension that is at stake in the creation of an "image of existence" such as the one that is empowered by Social Media platforms and mobile Apps. We will pay special attention to the phenomenological problems inherent to the impact that Social Media has on human interpretation and understanding of himself as well as of its world, while making them "inauthentic".

TI  - Delimitation and classification of coastal wetlands: Implications for the environmental management of the Colombian Continental Caribbean
T2  - Boletin de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the cartographic layer construction process of Colombian Caribbean coastal wetlands at a scale of 1:100,000 and the results obtained in terms of their quantification and typing. Two cartographic layers were constructed and subsequently joined, one of the permanent water bodies and another of temporary water bodies and associated coverages. The layers were generated by multitemporal analysis of 45 Landsat 8-OLI satellite images, based on the NDVI index, uncertainty models by superposition of cartographic attributes, and a flood frequency consultation model on ALOS PALSAR 1 images. As a result, 576,279 ha of coastal wetlands were delimited (1.9 % of total wetlands in Colombia), of which 20.4 % are within protected areas. The cartographic legend makes it possible to typify wetlands based on the coverage and temporality of water bodies; discriminates permanent wetlands (42.7 %) with five categories and temporary wetlands (57.3 %) with 15 categories, mostly distributed in seven large complexes. This study is the first description of the colombian Caribbean coastal wetlands based on a cartographic construction, is methodologically replicable, and will support decision-making in the planning of colombian Caribbean coastal areas, especially for risk management and ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change.

AB  - In order to contribute to the sea bottoms knowledge of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve (RB Seaflower), a mapping update was made at 1:50,000 scale of the Seascape Ecological Units (SEU) for the Serrana, Roncador and Quitasueno atolls, based on the processing and interpretation of ALOS AVNIR - 2 satellite images acquired in 2012. For the attribute assignation was used as reference cartographic products, fieldwork data, and ecological descriptions of the benthic community. A total of 138,967 ha and 30 SEU, which corresponds to 32,908 ha for Serrana, 4,861 to Roncador and 101,198 to Quitasueno. The products generated represents a good approximation of the location, extension and distribution of the benthic seascape elements, constituting the base line information for the management of these atolls, they are also part of the Continental, Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Map of Colombia at scale 1:100,000 (MEC 100K) and the Colombian Coral Areas Atlas (AACC) updated on a digital platform to 2020. However, more extensive field work is needed for cartographic purposes, which allows for greater spatial and thematic detail, and to evaluate cartographic reliability

AB  - In most urban environments, loss of natural vegetation, the reduction of open spaces, and the rapid invasive transformation of the natural environment into impervious has happened. These changes can lead to a decline in life quality and in an increase of various economic, social, ecological, and infrastructural problems and risks. The complexity of the urban environment at various scales requires the application of high spatial and temporal resolution data in the process of urban planning. In this paper, specific urban planning indicators (UPIs), divided into two groups, have been derived for statistical circles (SC) of Split settlement in Croatia. Vegetation indicators (TCR - tree cover ratio, LCR - lawn cover ratio, GCR - green cover ratio) and indicators of urbanization (SCR - street cover ratio, BCR - building cover ratio, IMR - impervious surface ratio) were derived from the derived land cover model. It was generated from WorldView-3 (WV3) imagery with the GEOBIA method. A supervised machine learning technique support vector machine (SVM) was used. A significant spatial variability between UPIs at SCs was observed. The UPIs values at the studied level are the reflection of the historical spatial-functional development of the Split settlement. These type of UPIs can be used at the neighborhood level of urban planning and analysis of different issues in an urban environment.

AB  - The core motifs of Oh Yoon's art are Skulls, Wongwi, and Dokebi. Oh Yoon used these motifs throughout the 1960s and 70s to criticize the Park Chung-hee administration's tyranny. The skulls are a symbol of anti-life, and the evil of unrelenting power. In the 1980s, Oh Yoon was inspired by the figure of the wongwi, a drowned ghost, and used it to depict the national tragedy caused by the dysfunction of a divisive system. Wongwi represents the Korean people during the period from the Korean War to the May 18th Uprising, a metaphor which intertwines this world and the underworld with state violence. The last motif of Oh Yoon's art is the dokebi, a goblin. He begins to reimagine a way to overcome the dichotomous worldview of good and evil, present and past, this world and the underworld with art by drawing a goblin that nullifies the boundary between reality and non-realism.

AB  - The status of the axillary lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer. For over 100 years, axillary lymph node dissection was the standard approach to obtain and manage axillar lymph node, but now, sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard approach with less morbidity and equal accuracy in clinical node-negative patients. In addition, numerous studies are on the way to omit axillary lymph node dissection in specific patient subgroups. The recent trials like the ACOSOG Z0011 showed the evidence that omitting an ALND in patients with low burden nodal disease is safe in patients receiving whole-breast radiation. To reduce the use of ALND is the goal to consider when selecting an axillary management strategy.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Nowadays humankind is confronted with the enormous challenge of climate change. Since the Industrial Revolution the earth’s climate has being effected negatively. The global temperature has risen by 1℃ due to the heavy increase of green-house gases. Climate scientists warn that human civilization may collapse before 2050 if the increase in green-house gases continues. The IPCC encourages people to act in ways to reduce and maintain the earth’s temperature by 1.5℃. Furthermore, a drastic cut in green-house gases should be accomplished within the next ten years. But the international response is progressing slowly. Although the usage of renewable energy is increasing steadily, it isn't enough. Less energy consumption and a reduction in production that causes pollution are two necessary steps. Buddhism is regarded as a nature-friendly and ecological religion. Dependent origination (緣起) promotes a worldview that highlights mutual dependence as well as the theory of Buddha-nature (佛性), which emphasizes the inherent value of all sentient beings. These teachings are in line with promoting the changes needed to combat the climate crisis. However, mutual dependence also tends to promote acceptance of reality in a passive way rather than establishing a bases for active, ecological practice where individuals and groups can create change. Emphasizing socio-economic and structural aspects, Bhikkhu Bodhi suggests reasons and solutions regarding the climate crisis through the four noble truths (四諦). Furthermore, David R. Loy recognizes that Buddhist solutions to individual suffering may be applied to the ecological crisis as collective suffering. Also, Thich Nhat Hanh mentions that collective awakening may halt the course of destruction. Non-harming or ahimsa (不害) as a precept, the four immeasurable states of mind (四無量心), and the six perfections or ṣaṭ-paramita (六波羅蜜) can all be utilized as ethical, ecological practices. However, to curb the problematic trends causing the climate crisis, concrete practices leading institutional and social changes are needed. Buddhist studies should act as a theoretical starting point and provide values and visions for the solution to this human crisis. This can be done through the modernization and materialization of doctrines which are applicable to the fields in question.

T2  - 탐라문화
M3  - research-article
AB  - In most cultural phenomena, there is a certain philosophical understanding of the world and human being. At this point, Jeju 'Culture of Kumda' is a philosophical theme to be viewed. Also considering that philosophy is a discipline in the right worldview and lifeview, ‘Kumda' would have been developed as a desirable living culture of the local community in view of Jeju. In Jeju's lifestyle called 'Kumda', the social model that Han says and the meaning of human life are hidden in various forms. 'Kumda' shows a real phenomenon according to the reason of 'being one' of Han.This article examines the realistic language usage and understanding of 'Kumda' from the hermeneutic perspective. Next, it is to find the connection between ‘Kumda’ and Han through the world view and life view of Han Philosophy.Basically, Han-ism requires new recognition and practice of the difference. Here is the question of sublimation of grudges and understanding of disgust. It is hard to see hate in the right way of different things, because it is the logic of exclusion. The logic of exclusion seems to be a kind of differentiation strategy that the strong have for the weak. It derives from the sense of discrimination that I am superior to you and says that I do not want to hold you. But the fact that discrimination is not correct is what modern quantum physics reveals. In this respect, mutual understanding of dialectics of negative and dialectics of positive is also needed.The characteristics of Jeju, which is the same as the spiritual sublimation of Han, are hidden in the living language of 'Kumda'. It is a philosophy of enveloping others who are different from me, and the recognition of difference, the value of tolerance. With the way of meeting 'me and you are us', we transcend the dialectics of negativity. The hieroglyphic of 化(becoming) says that a strong and an weak lean on each other and protect them. This is the practice of Han Philosophy, which is 'to be one with us'. If we achieve 'one of us' from this, the order of the community together will find its place.'Kumda' meets with the system of the recognition value of the existence of Korean philosophy, it has formed the culture of Jeju Salim-sali(I live by saving others) with the same way. The culture of Jeju Kumda meets with the harmony of Han-Philosophy and is understood as a response strategy of the community reflecting the characteristics of Jeju. This is like the latent DNA among the collective consciousness of the Korean people. It will function as a new social model in the era of G-local with a deep understanding of human beings.

AB  - Oriental philosophy and modern physics have interrelationship in the world view. In the meantime, quantum physics is newly meeting with the themes of Oriental metaphysics. In this case, the most appropriate concept for contrasting with both is Ki(氣) in the Oriental Cosmic-Dynamics(易學). In both material and metaphysical terms, this is because it has a similar meaning than anything else.Whether it is both quantum or Ki, the substantive truth is still not clear. It is an academic clash between the side of seeing both as microparticles and the group that sees them as strings. The key to understanding of the quantum is that it has a constant physical quantity, such as spin or vector, even if it is unidentifiablely small. Physicists who speak of point particles value demonstrations and experimental possibilities based on standard models, and give clues that science and physics must be realistically verified. Here appears the superstring theory from the concept of string. However, superstring is not an observation or experimentally verified fact, but is only predicted through the reasoning of mathematics and theoretical physics.The heart of the oriental worldview is the movement change of the 陰 (Eum) & 陽(Yang). Like the mutual movement of electromagnetic and photon, they shake and move in search of each other's mates. But quantum or Ki, both are still unclear and still invisible. Modern physics asks philosophy and religion. In this situation, what can philosophical worldview and metaphysics tell? The fact that you can not see does not mean that there is no principle of the world.In this case, finding the principle of world understanding based on the existence of an invisible being may be the same task. In other means, if mathematics is the language of Western physics, letters and languages will become oriental mathematics.

AB  - This paper examines the problems of Christian yoga, focusing on the biblical worldview. This article describes the view of salvation in the thought of yoga. Since the participation of churches and members has increased, yoga which is a practice system for self-salvation has recently been given a new name as Christian yoga. Three themes are compared to see how the view of salvation in the thoughts of Hinduism and Yoga contrasts with the biblical worldview. Furthermore, prior studies have suggested that yoga, which Christians approach simply as an exercise, is a religion with a worldview contrary to the Bible. The church education is urgently needed to educate believers who can discern the worldview located in the deeper part of culture.

TI  - Predictive Factors Among Clinicopathological Characteristics for Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in T1-T2 Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The axillary lymph node status is an important prognostic factor of breast cancer. This study explores the predictive factors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis among the preoperative clinicopathological features, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).Methods: This study comprised patients diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent surgery at Nagasaki Harbor Medical Center between April 2014 and December 2019. The factors assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses were the clinicopathological data of these cancers, including the patient age, gender, menstrual status, breast or ovarian cancer family history, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, clinical tumor size, nipple-tumor distance (NTD), tumor histology, histological grade, node status, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 status, and Ki67 labeling index.Results: In the cohort of 313 cases, the ratio of SLN metastasis was 17.3%. A univariate analysis found that the tumor size, NTD, IGT, and clinical tumor stage were associated with SLN metastasis. In a multivariable analysis, the tumor size, NTD, and IGT were associated with SLN metastasis. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a sensitivity and specificity of 61.1% and 65.6%, respectively, at a cut-off of 1.7 cm for the tumor size (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.664; 95% confidence interval: 0.592-0.736), and a sensitivity and specificity of 60.4% and 62.9%, respectively, at a cut-off of 2.0 cm for NTD (AUC: 0.651; 95% confidence interval: 0.571-0.731) to predict the risk of SLN metastasis.Conclusion: T1 and T2 breast cancer patients with a larger tumor size, tumor located closer to the nipple, and IGT have a higher risk of SLN metastases than others.

T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an analysis of long-term fluctuations in the area of spawning areas of three sections of the Cheboksary reservoir, depending on the water content of the year and water levels in the spring period, and their effect on the number of replenishment of the main commercial fish species. Basing on the interpretation of Landsat satellite images, the boundaries and areas of floodplain and coastal spawning areas at different levels were determined. A formula was obtained for the dependence of the area of spawning areas on water levels; the difference between the minimum and maximum values of spawning areas was 1.65 times. It was shown that a high degree of watering of spawning grounds favorably affects the reproductive success of most commercial fish species - a noticeable positive correlation was established between the number of underyearlings and the area of spawning grounds (Spearman's correlation coefficient is 0.65 at p = 0.01). A formula was obtained for the dependence of the number of underyearlings on the area of spawning grounds, on the basis of which a forecast of recruitment in years with different degrees of water availability was given. According to preliminary calculations, the efficiency of natural reproduction can increase 20.5 times in high-water years compared to low-water years. By geo-referencing the boundaries of spawning grounds in geographic information systems, differences in the interpretation of the descriptions of spawning grounds in the Fishing Rules have also been eliminated.

TI  - Satellite estimates of the long-term trend in phytoplankton size classes in the coastal waters of north-western Bay of Bengal
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents long-term variability in satellite retrieved phytoplankton size classes (PSC) at two coastal sites, off Gopalpur and Visakhapatnam, in the north-western Bay of Bengal. The abundance-based models by Brewin et al. (2010) (B10) and Sahay et al. (2017) (S17), for retrieval of PSC (micro, nano, and picophytoplankton), from satellite data, were validated. Both the models performed well in the retrieval of nano and microphytoplankton. However, B10 performed poorly in retrieving picophytoplankton. The statistical analysis indicated better performance of the S17 model and hence was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard Aqua satellite (MODISA) data to understand the temporal at monthly climatology) and spatial variability (from nearshore to offshore). The spatial distri- bution indicated nearshore dominance of micro and offshore dominance of picophytoplankton. In nearshore waters off Gopalpur, microphytoplankton dominated throughout the year except for months of south-west monsoon (June and July) where the dominance of picophytoplankton was observed. All PSC exhibited similar distribution at an annual scale with a primary peak during pre-monsoon (March and April) and a secondary peak during post-monsoon (September-November). However, microphytoplankton concentration during post-monsoon was higher off Gopalpur in comparison to Visakhapatnam. The higher microphytoplankton concentration during pre-monsoon was attributed to recurrent phytoplankton blooms. Whereas, post-monsoon increment could be attributed to enhanced phytoplankton growth by availing nutrients sourced from monsoonal precipitation induced terrigenous influx. The outcome of the present study recommends the use of the S17 model for satellite retrieval of PSC from the north-western Bay of Bengal.

AB  - Deep Learning, and most notable Deep Neural Networks, have largely driven Artificial Intelligence in the area of remote sensing, mainly image classification tasks. In this paper, we present an approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Earth Observation satellite images as environmental preserved or non-preserved areas. One interesting feature of our approach is the fact that we used sensors with different spatial resolutions to assess the performance of a traditional network. We relied on images from the Tocantins Cerrado obtained by the Wide-Scan Multispectral and Panchromatic Camera of the CBERS-4A satellite, with a spatial resolution of 8m to create the training dataset. For testing, we set up a set of images of the Sentinel satellite, with a spatial resolution of 10m from Goias Cerrado. Results imply that Convolutional Neural Networks are feasible and are a good alternative for classifying remote sensing areas even when dealing with images from various sensors, and also with different spatial resolutions, where the model used in this study obtained an accuracy of 0.87. This study demonstrates the flexibility of Convolutional Neural Networks concerning the ability to generalize knowledge for classifying remote sensing images.

AB  - This study focuses on deformation mapping and monitoring using Sentinel-1 radar data and the DInSAR (Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique. In particular, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry technique was used over 15000 km(2) of the Pyrenees, located in Spain, Andorra and France. The main goal is to monitor deformations over a vegetated and mountainous region by exploiting the wide-area coverage, the high coherence and temporal sampling provided by the Sentinel-1 satellites. All possible interferograms were generated using 150 images covering five years. The velocity map of the entire region is presented considering the characteristics of the study area, including vegetation and severe steep mountains. Two areas of deformation are shown, which are characterized by velocity values ranging between -20 to -40 mm/year. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Learning on Religion in the Modern European Educational Space: the Problem of the Approaches to the Teaching
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes significant changes of the sociocultural and religious landscape in the modern post-secular Europe, which have led to the need of new approaches to religious education. According to the European Educational School's Principles, religious education (confessional and non-confessional models) is an integral part of the curriculum. Religion is an ordinary, but a non-progression subject. In some European countries religious education is under a threat. There is an ambivalent process of the quest for multi-layered religious identities within the public schools of post-secular European countries. The author states that the traditional confessional model as a variant of catechesis is evolving to the system of multi-confessional religious education, Alternatives (Ethics, Ethics and Values, philosophy, citizenship), parallel mandatory courses about religion under Toledo principles (2007). Confessional religious education is teaching the religion in question. The author notes the growing role of the model of interreligious education IRE as a non-confessional academic Study of Religion for all students in the classroom. The most important international projects REDCo (Religion in Education. A Contribution to Dialogue or a Factor of Conflict in Transforming Societies of European Countries) and ENRECA network (The European Network for Religious Education through Contextual Approaches) show clear signs of the characteristics of interreligious education: teaching about is combined with teaching from the insider's perspectives. Especially interesting are different options of the cooperative religious education and the model of intercultural religious education ICRE with a worldview as a key notion. The main goal of the IRE is working towards a public, rational discourse of religion against the privatization of religion, against displacing religion from educational institutions. The conclusion is made that the multi- disciplinary approach, based on Culture and Religious Studies, is capable to increase the quality of learning on religions.

TI  - Volume estimation of glaciers in Upper Alaknanda Basin, Garhwal Himalaya using numerical and scaling methods with limited field based data
T2  - HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice volume is an important parameter for quantifying fresh water stored in the Himalayan cryosphere. It is an important input to model the glacier dynamics and consequently estimate the future glacier melt contributions to the rise in sea level and changes in the river flows. While there are large uncertainties in the estimates of total ice volume, even less is known about its distribution at the basin scale. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the volume of glaciers of Upper Alaknanda Basin (UAB), Garhwal Himalaya, using statistical power scaling and slope dependent numerical methods with input from remote sensing data. We have mapped 166 glaciers (area >0.02 km(2)) in UAB covering total glacierised area of similar to 363 +/- 12 km(2) using remote sensing data and have used the above mentioned methods to estimate the ice volume. We have checked the consistency of these results with the limited data of estimates of the ice volume of individual glaciers using other methods. We present estimates of the ice volume of Satopanth glacier (SPG) based on previous measurements of the ice thickness using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) studies supplemented by more recent observations. The estimated ice volume of SPG is approximately 2.1 km(3). The total glacier volume of UAB is estimated by different methods ranges from 20.5 +/- 1.4 to 35.5 +/- 2.1 km(3) with an average 26.1 +/- 4.5 km(3). We compare this estimate with the estimated ice volume of other Himalayan basins.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn, or "organoid nevus," is a common, benign hamartoma of the skin consisting of epithelial and adnexal components. Its natural history and association with neoplastic growths is well documented. The majority of concomitant neoplasms are benign-trichoblastoma and syringocystadenoma papilliferum are most frequently discovered-but malignant tumors have been described. We present the case of a 58-year-old male with a congenital nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn on his left parietal scalp that had been enlarging, changing color, and bleeding over the prior year. Clinical exam and histology disclosed the presence of a trichoblastoma and porocarcinoma arising within the nevus sebaceus. Porocarcinoma is a rare, intermediately aggressive, malignant eccrine gland tumor that is frequently metastasized at presentation. Otolaryngology performed wide local resection with sentinel lymph node biopsy. This case highlights the diversity of tumors associated with nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn, potential for malignant expansion, and necessity for close monitoring and maintaining a low threshold for biopsy in evolving lesions.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the epidemiology of patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Canadian acute care hospitals is needed to inform infection prevention and control strategies and public health measures. The aim of this surveillance was to describe the epidemiology of patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a network of Canadian acute care hospitals between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020.METHODS: Through prospective surveillance, we identified adult and pediatric patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using a standard definition between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020, through the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP), a network of 78 hospitals. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and data on treatment, interventions and outcomes were reviewed and described.RESULTS: As of Aug. 31, 2020, the CNISP had received data for 1906 patients in hospital with COVID-19 in 49 sentinel hospitals in 9 provinces. The majority of patients in hospital with COVID-19 were older (median age 71 yr) and had underlying medical conditions (85.8%). Few children with COVID-19 were admitted to a participating hospital (n = 37, 1.9%). Acquisition of COVID-19 in hospitals was infrequent (6.4% of all cases). A total of 32.8% of patients were admitted from a long-term care facility or retirement home. Health care workers constituted 10.6% of adult patients aged 18-65 years in hospital with COVID-19. Thirty-day attributable mortality was 16.2%. Hospital admission rates peaked in mid-April and were highest in Ontario and Quebec.INTERPRETATION: Surveillance findings indicate that a high proportion of Canadian patients in hospital with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic were older adults with underlying medical conditions. Active surveillance of patients in hospital with COVID-19 is critical to enhancing our knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and to identifying populations at risk for severe outcomes, which will help guide Canada's response in the coming months.

TI  - Glance: A Generative Approach to Interactive Visualization of Voluminous Satellite Imagery
T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Challenges in interactive visualizations over satellite data collections stem primarily from their inherent data volumes. Enabling interactive visualizations of such data results in both processing and I/O (network and disk) on the server side. These are further exacerbated by multiple, concurrent requests issued by different clients. Hotspots may also arise when multiple users are interested in a particular geographical extent. We propose a novel methodology to support interactive visualizations over voluminous satellite imagery. Our system, codenamed Glance, generates models that once installed on the client side, substantially alleviate resource requirements on the server side. Our system dynamically generates imagery during zoom-in operations. Glance also supports image refinements using partial high-resolution information when available. Glance is based broadly on a deep Generative Adversarial Network, and our model is space-efficient to facilitate memory-residency at the clients. We supplement Glance with a module to estimate rendering errors when using the model to generate imagery as opposed to a resource-intensive query-and-retrieve operation to the server. Benchmarks to profile our methodology show substantive improvements in interactivity with up to 23x reduction in time lags without utilizing GPU and 297x-6627x reduction while harnessing GPU. Further, the perceptual quality of the images from our generative model is robust with PSNR values ranging from 32.2-40.5, depending on the scenario and upscale factor.

AB  - This paper discusses satellite data usage in monitoring the surface oil pollution in the off-shore oil-producing area "Oil Rocks" in the Caspian Sea. For this study, we examined satellite SAR and VIS data taken over the region of interest in 2017-2020. All in all, we analyzed 558 satellite images. First of all, we present some statistics on the detectability of natural oil showings in SAR and VIS data. We show that the frequency of reliable detection of natural oil showings in satellite images varies greatly and depends sufficiently on a sensor type and the season. We state that the seasonal variability in the detection rate of natural oil showings on the sea surface is most pronounced for the VIS data. We show statistics on individual sizes of oil patches and describe their seasonal and inter-annual variability. We also present statistics on the frequency of detecting oil patches in the Oil Rocks oil-producing area in SAR images depending on near-surface winds and ocean-atmosphere boundary layer conditions. We compare our new results with those obtained in our previous long-term satellite survey of the Caspian Sea and discuss the reliability of quantitative estimates of surfaced oil amounts based on the satellite images. Further, we depict a detailed map of the spatial distribution of oil slicks detected in satellite imagery taken over the oil-producing area and outline high-risk areas of the sea surface oil pollution and areas exposed to potential risks.

AB  - This paper interprets the theme of “The dance is beautiful when the heart is beautiful.” emphasized in the Korean traditional dance world based on the mind theory of Wang Yang-Ming and Gilbert Ryle. ⑴ The meaning of the word “good-hearted” was examined, ⑵ the reason why the dance is beautiful was examined, ⑶ how the emotions of dancers and audience were possible.In “The dance is beautiful when the heart is beautiful.” according to Wang Yang-Ming, the heart is a pure, precise, clean, clear and bright, and the condition is “truthfulness[誠]” that is not hidden by individual desires by “heart.” According to Ryle, since the propensity of the actor can be known by looking at the action, the intelligence of the dancer must be exercised so that he can dance according to the dancer’s tendency. And liangzhi 良知’s “awareness,” the viewer can recognize the dancer’s mind. The concept of liangzhi is closely related to Wang’s organic worldview, in which he sees the entire universe as one whole organism.

TI  - Dynamic Mapping of Subarctic Surface Water by Fusion of Microwave and Optical Satellite Data Using Conditional Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water monitoring with fine spatiotemporal resolution in the subarctic is important for understanding the impact of climate change upon hydrological cycles in the region. This study provides dynamic water mapping with daily frequency and a moderate (500 m) resolution over a heterogeneous thermokarst landscape in eastern Siberia. A combination of random forest and conditional generative adversarial networks (pix2pix) machine learning (ML) methods were applied to data fusion between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, with the addition of ancillary hydrometeorological information. The results show that our algorithm successfully filled in observational gaps in the MODIS data caused by cloud interference, thereby improving MODIS data availability from 30.3% to almost 100%. The water fraction estimated by our algorithm was consistent with that derived from the reference MODIS data (relative mean bias: -2.43%; relative root mean squared error: 14.7%), and effectively rendered the seasonality and heterogeneous distribution of the Lena River and the thermokarst lakes. Practical knowledge of the application of ML to surface water monitoring also resulted from the preliminary experiments involving the random forest method, including timing of the water-index thresholding and selection of the input features for ML training.

AB  - The article presents the ideological and worldview tendencies in Armenian reality in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and their influence on the literary criticism of the time. Firstly, the article focuses on the social-political situation that influences the formation of social-political ideologies, then the approaches of representatives of various directions on different spheres of life. The study also discusses the influence of these currents on the formation of the views of the literary critics of the time.As an obvious example of a literary work that was exposed to diverse literary criticism, some pieces of critical reviews on the poem "Loretsi Sako" by H. Toumanyan are presented. These reviews prove that artistic and philosophical approaches of the social-political currents of the time serve as the basis of subjective evaluations carried out by literary critics.

TI  - Cloud and Cloud Shadow Segmentation for Remote Sensing Imagery Via Filtered Jaccard Loss Function and Parametric Augmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation are fundamental processes in optical remote sensing image analysis. Current methods for cloud/shadow identification in geospatial imagery are not as accurate as they should, especially in the presence of snow and haze. This article presents a deep learning-based framework for the detection of cloud/shadow in Landsat 8 images. Our method benefits from a convolutional neural network, Cloud-Net+ (a modification of our previously proposed Cloud-Net [1]) that is trained with a novel loss function [filtered Jaccard loss (FJL)]. The proposed loss function is more sensitive to the absence of foreground objects in an image and penalizes/rewards the predicted mask more accurately than other common loss functions. In addition, a sunlight direction-aware data augmentation technique is developed for the task of cloud shadow detection to extend the generalization ability of the proposed model by expanding existing training sets. The combination of Cloud-Net+, FJL function, and the proposed augmentation algorithm delivers superior results on four public cloud/shadow detection datasets. Our experiments on Pascal VOC dataset exemplifies the applicability and quality of our proposed network and loss function in other computer vision applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - This research proposes to design an approach recognizing land use/cover change for Irbid governorate from 1985 to 2015 in 10 years period bases, with an agriculture suitability map using remote sensing and GIS. In this paper, ENVI6 was used to analyse Landsat images, which helps to understand the land uses' classes. LULC Changes results showed an increase in urban land, from 2% in 1985 reached to 11% in 2015; soil and agricultural classes had declined, in 1985 they were 74% of the total area, and reduced to 67% in 2015. Irbid Governorate's change detection results revealed that the decline of agriculture and rock land areas is due to the accelerated expansion of urbanization, which negatively affects agricultural lands. Modelling the area showed high suitability for agricultural activities, which should be considered for the upcoming plans.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses patio-temporal variability of the greenness index of Indian mangroves of the Sundarban forest with bio-carbon flux during 1990-2020. The analysis of NDVI derived using Landsat data reveals the mangrove stress level was very high during the years 1990, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011, with 2011 km(2) mangroves were severely affected out of a total 2215 km(2). The improved and healthy condition prevailed during 1999, 2000, 2001, 2015, 2016 and 2019 and normal condition during 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2010. The net change in mangrove cover during 1990-2020 shows distinct loss and gain regions across the study region. The shoreline change analysis shows that nearly 90 km(2) of mangroves were lost on the seaward side due to coastal erosion. Whereas, 50 km(2 )of newly developed mangroveswere observed in western parts of Southern Parganas due to accretion and no loss/gain was recorded in the rest of the areas. A significant positive correlation (coefficients 0.76 at p=0.01) was recorded between the increase in the extent of the mangrove region and bio-carbon fluxes for the years of normal and high-stress level condition as the dominant classes. Conversely, correlation is insignificant for the years dominated by healthy conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the western Antarctic Peninsula one of the areas the highest warming in the southern hemisphere has been identified. To characterize this tendency, we selected the Lange Glacier (LG) on King George Island, to evaluate: 1) LG surface temperature and dynamics using stakes with temperature data loggers; 2) LG submerged thickness and sea parameters through bathymetry (BT) and 29 CTD stations in front of LG; 3) glacier front (GF) using BT and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 4) change in GF position using DEM and historical data of GF width; 5) Calving flux (QC). Our findings showed 85 % of temperatures were above the 0 degrees C melting point (mean = 5.0 +/- 5.2 degrees C). The stakes had an average ice loss of 9.3 +/- 1.3 cm. The LG mean dynamics was 8.8 +/- 1.5 m (0.40 +/- 0.70 m/day), corroborated by Sentinel-1 satellite images (Offset Tracking = 0.43 +/- 0.01 m/day). An intrusion of external waters warmer in the LG bay was identified, which destabilizes the water column due to convection processes. Our findings together indicated a continuous glacial melt that increases its dynamics due to the increase in temperature, with a contribution of fresh water to the Admiralty Bay. Based on historical results and this study, the LG retracement was estimated in 2,492 m between 1956 and 2019.

AB  - Combating corruption is an important part of the national policy of states. However, measures taken at the state level are no longer sufficient to fight corruption, which is a new challenge for states and governments. As a result, international anti-corruption cooperation is strengthening, attempts are made to develop a unified strategy to combat corruption at the regional and interstate levels, new methods of combating corruption are formed, and a regulatory framework for combating corruption is created.The research methodology is based on a systematic approach to the phenomenon under study that examines the fight against corruption from the political and legal, socio-economic, and moral perspectives; the institutional method that made it possible to consider the fight against corruption as a special political and legal institution of the modern society; and the concept of a philosophical worldview that allows an in-depth analysis of integration anti-corruption processes.The result of the work is related to determining the need for a clearer legal regulation of the nomenclature in the field of combating corruption at the international level, as well as the need to coordinate anti-corruption strategies and methods to in different countries.

M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimates of the relationship between interannual variations in the extent of Antarctic and Arctic sea ice and changes in the surface air temperature in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are obtained using satellite, ground-based, and reanalysis data for the past four decades (1980-2019). It is shown that the previously noted general increase in the extent of Antarctic sea ice observed until recent years from satellite data (available only since the late 1970s) over the background global warming and a rapid decrease in the extent of Arctic sea ice is associated with a regional decrease in the surface temperature at Antarctic latitudes from the end of the 1970s. This is a result of regional manifestation of natural climate variations with periods of up to several decades against the background of global secular warming with a relatively weak temperature trend over the ocean in the Southern Hemisphere. Since 2016, a sharp decrease in the extent of Antarctic sea ice in the Southern Ocean has been observed. The results of the correlation and cross-wavelet analysis indicate significant coherence and negative correlation with the surface temperature of the extent of sea ice in recent decades, not only in the Arctic, but also in the Antarctic.

TI  - In early-stage breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy can save unnecessary axillary dissection compared with fine-needle aspiration cytology for indeterminate axillary lymph nodes
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe most prevalent female cancer is breast cancer. A significant prognostic factor and determinant of treatment is the state of axillary lymph nodes (LNs). Axillary LNs can be classified into pathological, indeterminate, and benign by ultrasonographic (US) assessment.AimIn early-stage breast cancer, the indeterminate axillary LNs are measured. This offers the full advantage of the available diagnostic instruments, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) technique driven by US, and thus prevents excessive dissection of the axillary lymph node. In a step-wise sequence, suggestions are made for the treatment of indeterminate axillary LNs.Patients and methodsThis is a randomized, controlled sample that is prospective. Between October 2017 and October 2018, 60 female patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer with indeterminate axillary nodes were admitted to the breast cancer unit at Kasr Alainy University Hospital, Cairo University. Sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of preoperative US-guided FNAC versus upfront frozen indeterminate node intraoperative SLNB were contrasted, and both findings were correlated to the final histo-guided FNAC.ResultsSensitivity of SLNB was 83.33%, whereas sensitivity of the FNAC was 75%, with the negative predictive value of 83.33%, specificity of 83.3%, and positive predictive value of 75%.ConclusionFNAC is only moderately sensitive (75%), and inadequate sampling and being an operator dependent are potential limits of it. In addition, positive FNAC may cost the patient unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection.

AB  - The Arabian Gulf is characterized by high water scarcity and quickly growing populations over the years. This led to increase of desalination plants in the coastal areas surrounding it. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the brine discharge from the desalination plant on the water quality of the Gulf over the years. Remote sensing data was collected for Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) for the period from 2002 to 2020, while Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) was tracked from 2010 to 2019, obtained from SMOS. Anomalies' graphs for each parameter were obtained and K-mean clustering was used. Additionally, seasonal Mann Kendall Test and time-series analysis were performed at three desalination plants for SST prediction. SST has generally increased especially on the coast inside and outside the Gulf, As for Chl-a, it had a less uniform change, but it had shown an increase outside the Gulf and a decrease inside it with the exception of some coastal areas. K-means clustering generated a best fit with 7 clusters on the map. The most predominant clusters were 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 representing the east of the gulf and the simulated area outside the gulf, coastal areas inside the gulf, the western side of the gulf, and the neck of the gulf and the coastal areas. It can be concluded that there are changes in SSS, Chl-a and SST over recent years in the Gulf. Moreover, SSS data needs further investigation with higher resolution and model enhancement.

AB  - The sentinel lymph node is a predictor of breast cancer aggressiveness.The hazard ratio reported was 2.14, 95% confidence interval, shows that the patient with micro-metastases (MM) have higher probability of poorer Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) relative to those who are node-negative, therefore early detection of micro-metastasis analysis appears to be the approach most advantageous for patients. This work proposes an automatic detection of micro-metastasis by quantifying local cellular changes. The proposed strategy characterizes nuclei morphometry, color and texture to establish differences between MM and normal tissue. The color model is obtained from the plane [(r - b), g] while texture corresponds to the Haralick's features from five different orders of the co-occurrence matrix . This description is complemented by the cellular area obtained from a conventional watershed segmentation. An AdaBoost model, trained with 300 patches of 350 x 350 pixels (56000 mu m(2)) randomly selected from 18 cases, was tested in a set of five different cases with approximately ten patches containing micro-metastasis. This approach obtained a best classification accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.89, specificity of 0, 83, and F-score of 0.86, while the baseline, a ResNet 50 model, obtained 0.74 of accuracy, 0.86 of sensitivity, 0, 63 of specificity, and En-score of 0.77 for exactly the same task.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Orbital Shift on Diwata-2 Microsatellite Operation through Simulations

AB  - Diwata-2 has been in orbit for three years since its launch on October 29, 2018. Thus, the effects of its orbital configuration are much more noticeable than in its earlier stages. This paper investigates the effects of orbital drift on the current issues that are affecting the operations of the satellite such as satellite communications and image quality. Using five simulations involving the determination of the limits of acceptable passes, culmination events over the Philippines, the shift in time of the passes, and the changes to the satellite's temporal resolution, it was found out that the satellite passes have shifted by over an hour from its design at launch. The rate of its nodal precession has increased, resulting to later passes. The temporal resolution of the satellite also changed from 31 days to 11 at the expense of less area coverage. Using the historical two-line element (TLE) data, future passes were also simulated. It was found out that currently, there is a problem involving blind spot areas at nadir pointing, which covers 58% of the Philippines' entire area. Two predictions were also done to determine when the satellite passes over the 3 PM local time. The first is by using linear regression on the culmination events of the satellite, and the second is by using the satellite's historical TLE. Both predictions were in agreement that the event would happen in August 2023. As such, after this limit, a large portion of the passes would not be ideal for image acquisition.

TI  - Detecting the Feeding Habitat Zone of Albacore Tuna (<i>Thunnus Alalunga</i>) in the Southern Indian Ocean using Multisatellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an effective method for identifying potential feeding habitat zones. Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of albacore (ALB) tuna were studied using Taiwan longline fisheries data from 2009 to 2014. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to compile a fishery database and statistically explore the relationship between distribution and environmental factors. Sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSC), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface height (SSH), mixed layer depth (MLD), and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) were examined. The results indicated SST as the largest contributor on ALB distribution, followed by SSS and SSC. Catches per unit effort (CPUE) values indicated that ALB tuna were primarily distributed at 20 degrees E-110 degrees E and 25 degrees S-40 degrees S. The SST and SSS ranges for higher ALB abundance were 17-19 degrees C and 35.1-35.5 psu, respectively. SSC was positively related to CPUE as a result of ALB tuna habits in the current location during the study period (0.1-0.25 mg m(-3)). The predicted CPUE indicated that the potential feeding habitat zones were 35 degrees S-40 degrees S and 25 degrees S-30 degrees S during March and April-August, respectively. These findings provide preliminary insight into the key environmental features affecting the ALB distribution in the southern Indian Ocean.

TI  - Decadal Urban Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Its Impact on Surface Runoff Potential for the Dhaka City and Surroundings Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban growth processes give rise to impervious surfaces and are regarded as the primary cause of urban flooding or waterlogging in urban areas. The high rate of urbanization has caused waterlogging and urban flooding in many parts of Dhaka city. Therefore, the study is undertaken to quantify the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and urban runoff extent based on the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Curve Number (CN) during 1978-2018. The five-decadal LULC has been analyzed using three-generation Landsat time-series data considering six different classes, namely agriculture, built-up, wetland, open land, green spaces, and water bodies for the years 1978, 1988, 1998, 2007, and 2018. Significant changes in LULC for the study area from 1978-2018 are observed as 13.1%, 4.8%, and 7.8% reduction in agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies, respectively, and a 22.1% increase in the built-up area is estimated. Within Dhaka city, 14.6%, 16.0%, and 12.3% reduction in agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies, respectively, and a radical increase of 41.9% in built-up area are reckoned. The decadal runoff assessment has been carried out using the NRCS-CN method, considering an extreme rainfall event of 341 mm/day (13 September 2004). The catchment area under very high runoff category is observed as 159.5 km(2) (1978) and 318.3 km(2) (2018), whereas, for Dhaka city, the setting is dynamic as the area under the very high runoff category has increased from 74.24 km(2) (24.44%) to 174.23 km(2) (57.36%) in years 1978 and 2018, respectively, and, mostly, the very high runoff potential areas correspond to the dense built-up surfaces.

TI  - KALMYKS' IDEAS ABOUT THE OTHER WORLD
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the ideas about the otherworld in the culture of the Kalmyks from an ethnolinguistic point of view. Such ideas about the otherworld often find parallels and have much in common with other peoples of Central Asia and Siberia. These ideas about the otherworld have a pronounced national and cultural characteristic as they are a reflection of the ethnolinguistic picture of the world. Attention, therefore, is focused on the interaction of language and culture, which makes it possible to reconstruct a linguistic picture of the world. This paper presents the main characteristics of the afterlife as perceived by the Kalmyks, reflecting the most common images represented in the Kalmyk culture. Important symbols of the Kalmyks' worldview are considered, such as a road, a door, a threshold, which are related to the journey to the world of the dead.

TI  - Nurse/Resident Reciprocal Shadowing to Improve Interprofessional Communication.
T2  - Hospital pediatrics
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Poor communication is a major contributor to sentinel events in hospitals. Suboptimal communication between physicians and nurses may be due to poor understanding of team members' roles. We sought to evaluate the impact of a shadowing experience on nurse-resident interprofessional collaboration, bidirectional communication, and role perceptions.METHODS: This mixed-methods study took place at 2 large academic children's hospitals with pediatric residency programs during the 2018-2019 academic year. First-year residents and nurses participated in a reciprocal, structured 4-hour shadowing experience. Participants were surveyed before, immediately after, and 6 months after their shadowing experience by using an anonymous web-based platform containing the 20-item Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey, as well as open-ended qualitative questions. Quantitative data were analyzed via linear mixed models. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed.RESULTS: Participants included 33 nurses and 53 residents from the 2 study sites. The immediate postshadowing survey results revealed statistically significant improvements in 12 Interprofessional Collaborative Competency Attainment Survey question responses for nurses and 19 for residents (P ≤ .01). Subsequently, 6 questions for nurses and 17 for residents revealed sustained improvements 6 months after the intervention. Qualitative analysis identified 5 major themes related to optimal nurse-resident engagement: effective communication, collaboration, role understanding, team process, and patient-centered.CONCLUSIONS: The reciprocal shadowing experience was associated with an increase in participant understanding of contributions from all interprofessional team members. This improved awareness may improve patient care. Future work may be conducted to assess the impact of spread to different clinical areas and elucidate patient outcomes that may be associated with this intervention.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Heat Islands in Brazil based on MODIS remote sensing data
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates indicate that by 2050, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas, expanding the total built-up space and density of those areas. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon causes increased temperatures in urban areas compared to outlying regions. It is considered one of the main anthropogenic climate modifications and is directly linked to land-use patterns. The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of the UHI effect, diurnal and nocturnal, in the dry season in 21 Brazilian metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2016. Surface temperature, mean albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values generated by the MODIS sensor (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used. The results obtained showed substantial differences between diurnal and nocturnal UHI effects. Manaus, Porto Alegre, Belem, and Recife presented the highest values of diurnal UHI, whereas Curitiba, Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro showed higher heat island effects at night. The results are an alert to policymakers of the need to rethink land occupation regulations and also give support to actions to mitigate the phenomenon.

AB  - Strategic decision makers tend to apply a set of beliefs, a worldview, that frame managerial realities. It is often known that the belief and worldview influence the frame significantly. Then, using this frame, they set strategic goals which, in turn, form a set of actions that define the strategic options of the firm. Primarily, this paper suggested 10 schools of strategy as defined by distinctive sets of beliefs in theory and practice (Mintzberg et al., 1998). Then this paper argued the validity and usefulness of the Christian school of strategy that reinterpreted theories of strategy from the Christian perspective based upon a frame of the Biblical worldview. The core value of the Christian school is peace that may have constructs of 3Cs (coordination, consideration, and cooperation). Subsequently, this paper suggested a set of actions to implement selected strategy and ways to resolve problems on the basis of peace. Overall, the Christian school should assist all strategists in achieving their purposes in ways that are life-enhancing for their organizations.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to propose a ventilation corridor management plan to improve the thermal environment for Busan Metropolitan City. To this end, the characteristics of hot and cool spots in Busan were identified by conducting spatial statistical analysis, and thermal image data from Landsat-7 satellites and major ventilation corridors were analyzed through WRF meteorological simulation. The results showed the areas requiring thermal environment improvement among hot spot areas were Busanjin-gu, Dongnae-gu, industrial areas in Yeonje-gu and Sasang-gu, and Busan Port piers in large-scale facilities. The main ventilation corridor was identified as Geumjeongsan Mountain-Baekyangsan Mountain-Gudeoksan Mountain Valley. Based on the results, the ventilation corridor management strategy is suggested as follows. Industrial facilities and the Busan Port area are factors that increase the air temperature and worsen the thermal environment of the surrounding area. Therefore, urban and architectural plans are required to reduce the facility's temperature and consider the ventilation corridor. Areas requiring ventilation corridor management were Mandeok-dong and Sajik-dong, and they should be managed to prevent further damage to the forests. Since large-scale, high-rise apartment complexes in areas adjacent to forests interfere with the flow of cold and fresh air generated by forests, the construction of high-rise apartment complexes near Geumjeongsan Mountain with the new redevelopment of Type 3 general residential area should be avoided. It is expected that the results of this study can be used as basic data for urban planning and environmental planning in response to climate change in Busan Metropolitan City.

AB  - This research investigates the fashion photography for the series of Hajajj and analyzes the stories related to subjects, expression modes. Hence, this research concretely derives the building plans of inclusive world view that can be figured out through the fashion photography in Hajajj. The results of this study are as follows. First, the engagement can express the world view with messages such as the culture, preference, value, social position, class of people in fashion beyond the role of reenactment in fashion photography. Additionally, several expressions with the inclusive world views have been captured. Second, Hajajj’s photography in terms of effective series to express the photographer’s consistent worldview would be distinguished to representative 3 series such as ‘Kesh angels’, ‘my rockstars’ and ‘vogue, the Arab issue’. Third, the expressive characteristics for the inclusive world view in Hajajj’s fashion photography had been derived as the overlay of meanings, destruction of stereotype, the rebirth of the object, etc. Hajjaj’s fashion photography is the inclusive spaces where fashionable characters, objects had been overlapped, crossing boundaries, and mixed in new spaces. In addition, these borderless photos also suggest visual narratives of modern Arab cultures and show destruction of stereotypes for fashion, human beings, spaces.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper is intended to reexamine Augustine's 'Otium Liberale' in terms ofconversion. Along with his party, Augustine retreated into Cassiciacum aroundOctober after being converted in late August of 386. In this paper, I would like toreveal what he did while staying there for about six months.It was during his life in seclusion of Cassiciacum that his overall thought in hislife was turned. In that place, Augustine designed a program to abandon his existingworldview and form a new one with free leisure. His time there was for the purposeof freedom from his illness and public affairs, but it can be regarded as conversionto the time for freedom from his worldview which he maintained until the age of32. And that free leisure time should be understood as a time to form a newphilosophical task of awareness of the soul and God.In this paper, I will consider in terms of conversion the philosophical implicationsof his ‘Otium Liberale’ and the philosophical implications of dialogue written at thattime.

AB  - Healthy soils sustain humans. Yet these essential land resources are often overlooked and threatened by human activities. Such changes lead to an unbalanced state of soil functions. The land degradation neutrality (LDN) concept has been developed to serve the sustainable development goals (SDGs), in particular goal No.15. Our goal was to move an idea from LDN concept to reality. We assessed the LDN status of the agricultural area in Saraburi Province, Thailand by using three indicators: (i) land use/land cover (LULC) change, (ii) land productivity (LP) change, and (iii) soil organic carbon (SOC) change. The indicator datasets recorded in 2017 and 2020 were used to investigate the land resource changes. LULC and NDVI metrics were obtained using Landsat 8 satellite images and areas were classified into agricultural and nonagricultural uses. For the SOC stocks, 78 agricultural soil samples were collected from the top 30cm by the Land Development Regional Office 1 (Pathum Thani) in 2017 and by the research team in 2020. The standard procedure used for the SOC laboratory analysis was the Walkley-Black method. The LDN status was estimated by integration of results of the three indicators based on a "one out, all out" system. Over three years, the study metrics indicated that net loss occurred in LULC covering the area of 46.99 km(2) and SOC stocks declined at an average of 0.02%. However, the NDVI obtained from the estimate did not show a difference in the threeyear period. This research highlighted alarming signs of soil degradation in the agricultural economics zone. Negative changes occurred in two of the three indicators which showed a tendency towards the degradation of soil capital in the long run. Counterbalancing measures to achieve equivalent losses and gains should be implemented as quickly as possible.

TI  - The ratio of hazardous meteoroids to orbital debris in near-Earth space
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Orbital debris is known to pose a substantial threat to Earth-orbiting spacecraft at certain altitudes. For instance, the orbital debris flux near Sun-synchronous altitudes of 600-800 km is particularly high due in part to the 2007 Fengyun-1C anti-satellite test and the 2009 Iridium-Kosmos collision. At other altitudes, however, the orbital debris population is minimal and the primary impactor population is not man-made debris particles but naturally occurring meteoroids. While the spacecraft community has some awareness of the risk posed by debris, there is a common misconception that orbital debris impacts dominate the risk at all locations. In this paper, we present a damage-limited comparison between meteoroids and orbital debris near the Earth for a range of orbital altitude and inclination, using NASA's latest models for each environment. Overall, orbital debris dominates the impact risk between altitudes of 600 and 1300 km, while meteoroids dominate below 270 km and above 4800 km. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The performance of supervised classification depends on the size and quality of the training data. Multiple studies have used reference datasets to extract training data automatically in an efficient way. However, automatic extraction might be inappropriate for some classes. Furthermore, classes can have distinct spectral characteristics across large areas. Thus, dividing the study area into subregions can be beneficial. This study proposes to assess the impact of the introduction of spatial stratification and manually collected training data on classification performance. Two classifications were conducted with the Random Forest classifier and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. The classifications' performance was evaluated by accuracy metrics and visual inspection of the maps. The results indicate that introducing spatial stratification and manual training yielded a higher overall accuracy (66.7%) when compared to the accuracy of a benchmark classification (60.2%) conducted without stratification and with training data collected exclusively by automatic methods. Visual inspection of the maps also revealed some advantages of the novel approach, namely constraining some land cover classes to be present only within specific strata, which avoids commission errors of the class to spread freely across the map. Most of the classification improvements were observed in subregions with specific landscapes and spectral patterns, although these strata represent a small fraction of the study area, which might have contributed to the small increase in accuracy.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - SPIE Future Sensing Technologies Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Crop yield prediction is one of the tasks of Precision Agriculture that can be automated based on multi-source periodic observations of the fields. We tackle the yield prediction problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on data that combines radar satellite imagery and on-ground information. We present a CNN architecture called Hyper3DNetReg that takes in a multi-channel input image and outputs a two-dimensional raster, where each pixel represents the predicted yield value of the corresponding input pixel. We utilize radar data acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellites, while the on-ground data correspond to a set of six raster features: nitrogen rate applied, precipitation, slope, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), and aspect. We use data collected during the early stage of the winter wheat growing season (March) to predict yield values during the harvest season (August). We present experiments over four fields of winter wheat and show that our proposed methodology yields better results than five compared methods, including multiple linear regression, an ensemble of feedforward networks using AdaBoost, a stacked autoencoder, and two other CNN architectures.

TI  - DECONSTRUCTING AND DECOLONIZING PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW
T2  - RATIO JURIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Public International Law is as old as the history of our civilizations. In this regard, there were a series of commercial treaties between the indigenous empires and civilizations, on military control, justice and the economic part. However, the birth of Public International Law has a myth originating in modernity, the Peace of Westphalia, which dates back to 1648, from which the States began to be created in Europe and it is these that begin to cement the legal bases of this right, this construction was exclusive since it only took into account the worldview of the European white man, which ended up being imposed on the rest of the world. This is why we want to raise the need to deconstruct and decolonize Public International Law, first of all exposing how the construction of this type of right has been; secondly, we will describe certain generalities of feminisms and the decolonial perspective, as well as the relationship that can be woven between the two; thirdly, we will present the reasons why the path of deconstruction and decolonization of Public International Law should be undertaken, in order to build a non-exclusive, non-oppressive type of law that does not inhibit other interpretations of the world.

AB  - Wildfires can be monitored and analyzed using thermal hotspots records derived from satellite data. In 2020, the Parana River floodplain (Argentina) suffered from a severe drought, and thousands of hotspots -associated with active fires- were reported by the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS-NASA). FIRMS-NASA products are provided in spatial objects (shapefiles), including recent and archive records from several sensors (VIIRS and MODIS). I aimed to handle these data, analyze the number of hotspots during 2020, and compare the disaster with previous years' situation. Using sf, tidyverse, janitor, stringr, spdplyr, ggplot2 and RMarkDown, I imported and pre-processed the spatial objects, generated plots, and obtained reproducible reports. I used R to handle satellite data, monitor the number of active fires, and detect which wetland areas were being affected: this allowed me to quickly respond to peers and journalists about how the wildfires were evolving. Plots are obtained in English and Spanish versions, showing daily and cumulative hotspots, monthly summaries, and a comparison with hotspots detected in previous years. This workflow can be used to analyze thermal hotspot data in any other interest area. Copyright: Open Access

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the German spaceborne radar program starting with the X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument on board the Shuttle Imaging Radar missions (SIR-C/X-SAR) in 1994, followed by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000. The German national satellite radar program began in 2007 with the launch of the satellite TerraSAR-X which is providing since then high-resolution X-band images for scientific, commercial and governmental applications. TanDEM-X, an almost identical twin of TerraSAR-X, was launched in 2010. Both satellites fly in close formation to form the first bistatic, single-pass interferometric spaceborne SAR system. A global, highresolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth's surface with unprecedented accuracy has been generated and made available for a broad community since 2016. A second edition of global DEM, denoted as Change DEM, will be available in 2022. Both satellites are still fully functional and have enough consumables for several additional years of operation. The paper concludes with an overview of the innovative concepts, technologies, imaging techniques and applications planned for the future national SAR missions Tandem-L and HRWS.

TI  - Assessment of biological corridors in Costa Rica: landscape structure and connectivity-fragmentation processes
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, biological corridors have proliferated worldwide in response to the accelerated process of fragmentation of natural ecosystems. Since the early 1990s, Costa Rica implemented the establishment of biological corridors as a strategy for seeking connectivity among protected areas. During the past years, forty new biological corridors have been established, equivalent to 38% of the total surface area of Costa Rica's mainland territory. Despite their popularity, there is no research evaluating their functionality as connectivity spaces. In view of this shortcoming, the present article analyzes Costa Rica's biological corridors from the perspectives of area, landscape structure, ecological functionality, and levels of connectivity-fragmentation. The database of the Programa Nacional de Corredores (translated as National Program of Corridors) is used and complemented by coverage analysis using Landsat images from 2010 and 2015. It is concluded that biological corridors in Costa Rica are diverse in regards to area coverage, landscape structure, ecological functionality and degree of connectivity-fragmentation. After their establishment, most biological corridors have recovered an important part of their natural coverage, nonetheless, fragmentation has increased. The abundant existence of biological corridors evidences the lack of a prioritization policy essential to advance the consolidation of these connectivity strategies throughout the country.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Vegetation Cover Change in a Large Ephemeral River: Multi-Sensor Fusion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral rivers in arid regions act as linear oases, where corridors of vegetation supported by accessible groundwater and intermittent surface flows provide biological refugia in water-limited landscapes. The ecological and hydrological dynamics of these systems are poorly understood compared to perennial systems and subject to wide variation over space and time. This study used imagery obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance satellite data, which were then used to quantify change in woody vegetation cover along the ephemeral Kuiseb River in the Namib Desert over a 35-year period. Ultra-high resolution UAV imagery collected in 2016 was used to derive a model of fractional vegetation cover from five spectral vegetation indices, calculated from a contemporaneous Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided the linear best-fit relationship for calculating fractional cover; the model derived from the two 2016 datasets was subsequently applied to 24 intercalibrated Landsat images to calculate fractional vegetation cover for the Kuiseb extending back to 1984. Overall vegetation cover increased by 33% between 1984 and 2019, with the most highly vegetated reach of the river exhibiting the greatest positive change. This reach corresponds with the terminal alluvial zone, where most flood deposition occurs. The spatial and temporal trends discovered highlight the need for long-term monitoring of ephemeral ecosystems and demonstrate the efficacy of a multi-sensor approach to time series analysis using a UAV platform.

TI  - Mapping Bioclimatic Indices by Downscaling MODIS Land Surface Temperature: Case Study of the Saint-Emilion Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal conditions, influenced by the local environment, impact the development of the vine and determine the composition of the grapes. Bioclimatic indices, based on cumulative air temperatures, are modelled and mapped using statistical methods integrating local factors. Air temperature data from sensors networks are limited in space and time. We evaluated the potential of land surface temperature (LST) to identify comparable spatial distribution, and not to replace air temperature, by using a support vector machine algorithm to compare bioclimatic indices calculated from air temperature or LST. This study focused on the 2012-2018 period in the Saint-Emilion winegrowing area of France. The use of several digital elevation models with high spatial resolution (i.e., GMTED10 (1000, 500 and 250 m) and SRTM (90 and 30 m)) enabled LST to be downscaled at each resolution. The same topographic variables (elevation, slope, orientation coordinates) were used as predictors, and identical algorithms and cross-validation parameters were implemented in both mapping methods. Bioclimatic indices were calculated from daily air temperature, daily LST or weekly LST. The results of the daily and weekly downscaling of the MODIS time series at several spatial resolutions are encouraging for application to viticulture and have allowed to identify an optimal resolution between 500 m and 250 m limiting bias.

TI  - Implementation of temporary relations in the insular German dialects of the Altai Territory
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is an overview of the results of a comprehensive study of categories of temporality in the island German dialects of the Altai. The project covers all groups of upper-and low-insular Altai German dialects, formed in a foreign language environment in the process of long-term contact with the Russian language. As research materials were used the transcripts of conversations with informants, materials from the Text Corpus of German dialects in Altai, the results of a linguistic questionnaire, and folklore of Russian Germans. The attraction and analysis of linguistic facts of various dialects allows to present the specific features of the German dialect groups of the Altai Territory. Being a language universal and one of the most important elements of the linguistic worldview, time is an ambiguous, multifaceted and diverse category. The object of research - the semantic category of temporality is of a complex nature, since both grammatical and lexical means are used to express it. The article describes the ways of expressing temporary relations in insular German dialects at different language levels. The category of temporality is mostly expressed through the temporal forms of the verb, which reveals a vivid picture of dialectal morphological variation in structure and meanings. The semantics and peculiarities of the use of temporal forms of the present, future and past tense in the dialects of Russian Germans, as well as changes in the morphological category of time, lead to a redistribution of functions in the system of temporal markers, in particular, in the system of means of expressing relative temporal values. The special role play the lexical temporal markers, concretizing and clarifying the temporal meanings expressed by grammatical means. The analysis and description of the different-level means of expressing temporal relations allows to consider the dynamics of the processes and changes taking place in the island German dialects in comparison with the literary German language, with dialects in Germany, as well as with other groups of insular German dialects.

AB  - Worldview beliefs related to freedom vs. determinacy in the surrounding and inner world are the focus of active discussion and research in psychological science. The paper presents the results of approbation and construct validation of the Russian-language version of the freedom/determinism beliefs inventory FAD-Plus by D. Paulhus and J. Carey. The results of the research on the sample of first-year psychology students from Moscow universities (N = 372) confirmed the original four-factor structure of the questionnaire, which embraces four scales: Fatalistic Determinism (Cronbach's alpha = .793), Freedom (Cronbach's alpha = .777), Unpredictability (Cronbach's alpha = .689), Scientific Determinism (Cronbach's alpha = .675). For the construct validation of the questionnaire, correlations of the inventory scales with a number of variables referring to well-being, motivation and self-regulation were considered, including dispositional and attributional optimism, subjective well-being and emotional state, meaningfulness of life and attitudes to one's life, psychological needs satisfaction, personal responsibility. The results suggest that the Russian-language version of the freedom/determinism beliefs inventory has good psychometric properties and can be used as a helpful research instrument. Correlation analysis revealed positive relations between the belief in freedom and multiple characteristics of well-being: satisfaction with life, positive emotions, optimism, meaningfulness of life, attitudes to one's life, satisfaction of basic psychological needs, personal responsibility and sensitivity to feedback. Other types of beliefs showed weaker correlations with psychological characteristics. The belief in unpredictability was negatively associated with positive emotions, attributive optimism, meaningfulness of life, awareness of life, responsibility and sensitivity to feedback. The belief in scientific determinism had negative correlations with attributional optimism in a situation of success, activity regarding one's life, sensitivity to feedback and satisfaction of the need for competence. Belief in fatalistic determinism is in many ways similar to scientific determinism in terms of correlations, but unlike the latter, it also positively correlated with satisfaction with life and a sense of harmony with one's life.

TI  - The impact of COVID 19 on air pollution levels and other environmental indicators - A case study of Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only affected health and economics, but also its effect extended to include other aspects, such as the environment. Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015-2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt.

AB  - Analyzing natural and anthropogenic activities using remote sensing data has become a problem of increasing interest. However, this generally involves tediously labeling extensive imagery, perhaps on a global scale. The lack of a streamlined method to collect and label imagery over time makes it challenging to tackle these problems using popular, supervised deep learning approaches. We address this need by presenting a framework to semi-automatically collect and label dynamic regions in satellite imagery using crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data and available satellite imagery resources. The generated labels can be quickly verified to ease the burden of full manual labeling. We leverage this framework for the ability to gather image sequences of areas that have label reclassification over time. One possible application of our framework is demonstrated to collect and classify construction vs. non-construction sites. Overall, the proposed framework can be adapted for similar change detection or classification tasks in various remote sensing applications.

AB  - ALOS-2 and ALOS-4 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/4) are Japanese earth observation satellites with L-band SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensors. ALOS-2 has been operating since 2014, and its observations have been utilized for disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring such as forest and sea/land ice, land monitoring such as agriculture and natural resources, and technology development. ALOS-4 is now being developed for launch in JFY2022. The ALOS-4 aims to expand swath width and increasing observation frequency while keeping the high spatial resolution of ALOS-2 for improving the response of disaster monitoring, early detection of anomalies on the earth's surface, and enabling time-series analysis. In this paper, the ALOS-2/4 mission summary and SAR system design are introduced.

TI  - Assessing the spatio-temporal variability of NDVI and VCI as indices of crops productivity in Ethiopia: a remote sensing approach
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at characterizing agricultural drought in Ethiopia and understanding the effects of drought on crop yield. Monthly, seasonal and annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) values were calculated using MODIS (MOD13Q1) from the year 2003 to 2017. The relationships between NDVI, VCI, and crop yield were examined to predict the possibility of drought impacts on crop productivity. We found that VCI and NDVI data provides consistent and spatially explicit information for operational drought monitoring in Ethiopia. Results also indicated that the most extreme agricultural drought in recent years occurred in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2015. These findings also show that mild to severe droughts have a great chance of occurrence in Ethiopia. However, only severe drought has significant impacts on crops. The food crops yield data used in this study include cereals, legumes, and tubers. It was observed that cereals such as (Zea mays), teff (Eragrostis tef), haricot beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are more sensitive to agricultural drought when compared to the tubers such as sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and taro (Colocasia esculenta). Thus, drought preparedness programs need to pay more attention to the cultivation of these crops under severe drought conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of two well-known algorithms (Ocean Colour 4 for MERIS [OC4Me] and neural net [NN]) used in the calculation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) compared to in situ measurements covering the Mediterranean Sea. In situ data set, obtained from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and more specifically from the data set with the title INSITU_MED_ NRT_OBSERVATIONS_013_035, and Chl-a values at different depths were extracted. The concentration of Chl-a at a penetration depth was calculated. Then, water was classified into two categories, Case-1 and Case-2. For Case-2 waters, the OC4Me presents a moderate correlation with the in situ data for a time window of 0-2 h. In contrast with the NN algorithm, where very weak correlations were calculated, lower values of the statistical index of Bias for Case-1 waters were calculated for the OC4Me algorithm. Higher values of Pearson correlation were calculated (r > 0.5) for OC4Me algorithm than NN. OC4Me performed better than NN.

T2  - The Pan African medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: recipients of monovalent rotavirus vaccine have a low risk of developing intussusception (IS) in high- to medium-high-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, Zambia included, this risk of IS has not been assessed. Two-dose monovalent rotavirus vaccine, introduced in Zambia in 2012 in the capital of Lusaka, and rolled out countrywide in 2013, is administered at 6 and 10 weeks of age with no catch-up dose. Active IS surveillance monitoring in children < 2 years has been ongoing in Zambia since July 2009 and additional retrospective review was conducted from 2007- June 2009.METHODS: retrospective review (January 2007-June 2009) and prospective (July 2009-December 2018) IS surveillance was conducted at nine hospitals and four large paediatric hospital departments in Zambia, respectively. Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical folder abstraction and supplemented by parental interview during prospective surveillance.RESULTS: a total of 248 children < 2 years with IS were identified; 57.3% were male. Most cases with IS were infants (85.5%). IS admissions remained stable during the surveillance period with no seasonality pattern although an increase in cases occurred between August and October, hot dry season. The median time from symptom onset to presentation for treatment was 2 days and 63.6% (154/242) of IS diagnoses were made during surgery. The bowel resection rate was 46.6%. A high CFR of 23.3% was observed.CONCLUSION: the number of intussusception cases in Zambia was relatively small and remained stable over the 12-year study period. However, a high CFR was observed among cases.

AB  - Despite growing interest in Indigenous entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial orientation, few studies bridge these two domains empirically. We address this gap by developing a model for exploring entrepreneurial orientation in Indigenous communities. We assess the possible dimensions of Indigenous entrepreneurship orientation in a qualitative study of Maori business owners in New Zealand. The findings suggest that Indigenous worldview and entrepreneurial ecosystem influences the entrepreneurial orientation of participants, leading to a continuum of Indigenous entrepreneurial orientation. The results have important implications for Indigenous entrepreneurship policy, practice and theory.

TI  - Flood susceptibility mapping using GIS and multi-criteria decision analysis: A case of Dodoma region, central Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods have become common natural disasters that lead to devastating destruction to the infrastructure and natural environment. With the eminent climate change and weather variability, it might not be possible to prevent floods. However, flood prevention and mitigation can be facilitated by flood susceptibility mapping. Dodoma Region was selected due to its susceptibility to flash floods every year. The map presented in this paper is produced based on the analytical hierarchy process methodology which is an interactive decision-making approach under multi-criteria decision analysis. The method can check the consistency of the model obtained. A total of seven influencing factors are considered for mapping the flood susceptible areas within the Dodoma region, i.e. elevation, slope, geology, drainage density, flow accumulation, land-use/cover, and soil. This study established that around 40.27% of the region (17,073.323 km(2)) is under high to very high, whereas, 59.73% (24,517.679 km(2)) accounts for very low to moderate probability of flooding, respectively. The validation process of the analytical hierarchy process is executed based on the comparison of the historical flood locations of the different flood susceptible zones on the final map and AUC of 87.24% give a significant accuracy of the model. Therefore, the flood susceptibility map presented in this paper serves as a valuable tool for key stakeholders both state and non-state actors assessing flood risks in Dodoma region and the country at large.

TI  - Sub-Pixel Mapping Model Based on Total Variation Regularization and Learned Spatial Dictionary
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research study, we deal with remote sensing data analysis over high dimensional space formed by hyperspectral images. This task is generally complex due to the large spectral, spatial richness, and mixed pixels. Thus, several spectral un-mixing methods have been proposed to discriminate mixing spectra by estimating the classes and their presence rates. However, information related to mixed pixel composition is very interesting for some applications, but it is insufficient for many others. Thus, it is necessary to have much more data about the spatial localization of the classes detected during the spectral un-mixing process. To solve the above-mentioned problem and specify the spatial location of the different land cover classes in the mixed pixel, sub-pixel mapping techniques were introduced. This manuscript presents a novel sub-pixel mapping process relying on K-SVD (K-singular value decomposition) learning and total variation as a spatial regularization parameter (SMKSVD-TV: Sub-pixel Mapping based on K-SVD dictionary learning and Total Variation). The proposed approach adopts total variation as a spatial regularization parameter, to make edges smooth, and a pre-constructed spatial dictionary with the K-SVD dictionary training algorithm to have more spatial configurations at the sub-pixel level. It was tested and validated with three real hyperspectral data. The experimental results reveal that the attributes obtained by utilizing a learned spatial dictionary with isotropic total variation allowed improving the classes sub-pixel spatial localization, while taking into account pre-learned spatial patterns. It is also clear that the K-SVD dictionary learning algorithm can be applied to construct a spatial dictionary, particularly for each data set.

AB  - Land subsidence is one of the main geological disasters in the Beijing Plain. Accurate and quantitative monitoring of the evolution of land subsidence will help scientifically guide the prevention and control of land subsidence. We use PS-InSAR technology and TerraSAR 3m resolution images as our data source to study the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of Beijing's land subsidence from 2012 to 2015. The research indicates that, from a spatial perspective, the land subsidence presents a funnel shape, the central area of the settlement funnel is maintained at 112.5km(2), and the total land subsidence area remains basically unchanged. From the temporal point of view, the central area of the ground subsidence funnel subsides at a rate of 110mm/y, the ground subsidence rate in other areas decreases as it far away from the settlement center.

TI  - Performance Assessment of Optical Satellite-Based Operational Snow Cover Monitoring Algorithms in Forested Landscapes
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover is a crucial factor that influences the performance of optical satellite-based snow cover monitoring algorithms. However, evaluation of such algorithms in forested landscapes is rare due to lack of reliable in situ data in such regions. In this investigation, we assessed the performance of the operational snow detection (SCA) and fractional snow cover estimation (FSC) algorithms employed by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service for High-Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring (HRSI) with a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8 satellite scenes, lidar-based, and in situ datasets. These algorithms were evaluated over test sites located in the forested mountainous landscape of the Pyrenees in Spain and the Sierra Nevada in the USA. Over the Pyrenees site, the effectiveness of snow cover detection was evaluated with respect to a time-series of in situ snow depth measurements logged over test plots with different aspects, canopy cover, and solar irradiance. Over the Sierra Nevada site, the impact of ground vegetation was assessed over the under canopy fractional snow cover retrievals using airborne lidar-derived fractional vegetation cover information. The analyses over the Pyrenees indicated a good accuracy of snow detection with the exception of plots with either dense canopy cover or insufficient solar exposure (shaded forested slope), or both. The operational HRSI algorithm yielded similar performances (25-30% RMSE) as the computationally intensive spectral unmixing approach while retrieving the subcanopy ground FSC over the Sierra Nevada site. It was observed that a more accurate lidar-derived tree cover density map did not improve the subcanopy FSC retrievals.

TI  - The Image of the Goddess Umay in the Contemporary Fine Art Culture of Kazakhstan
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the ethnographic and art-history aspects of the reflection of the artistic image of the ancient Turkic goddess Umay in the modern visual culture of Kazakhstan. The image of this goddess is one of the most widespread in the work of modern Kazakhstani artists, who refer to the symbolism of Tengrian culture in their works. Each of the masters, due to their individual worldview and creative style, interprets it in their own way, thereby enriching the modern visual culture of independent Kazakhstan. It is also necessary to mention that the embodiment of symbols and artistic images of the ancient Turkic Tengrian culture by contemporary artists of Kazakhstan in the visual arts reflects the desire to preserve and rethink the national identity in the context of globalisation processes. The study is an attempt at art criticism analysis based on the application of the hermeneutic methodology of numerous author's interpretations of the artistic image of the goddess in the fine arts of modern Kazakhstan. The study of the problem of finding and embodying artistic images of the Goddess Umay, reflecting the sacred and mythological aspects of the Tengrian worldview, traditional for the nomadic peoples of the Great Steppe, in the visual culture of modern Kazakhstan, has an important theoretical and educational and methodological value. The conclusions of this study can be used and continued not only in the historical and theoretical works of art historians, cultural experts but also in research and educational-methodical works, when creating courses on the history and theory of fine and applied arts, scientific projects of the teaching staff, students, undergraduates and doctoral students, as well as in the artistic practice and creative activity of contemporary artists.

AB  - Road transportation is one of the largest sectors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions affecting climate change. Tackling climate change as a global community will require new capabilities to measure and inventory road transport emissions. However, the large scale and distributed nature of vehicle emissions make this sector especially challenging for existing inventory methods. In this work, we develop machine learning models that use satellite imagery to perform indirect top-down estimation of road transport emissions. Our initial experiments focus on the United States, where a bottom-up inventory was available for training our models. We achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 39.5 kg CO2 of annual road transport emissions, calculated on a pixel-by-pixel (100 m(2)) basis in Sentinel-2 imagery. We also discuss key model assumptions and challenges that need to be addressed to develop models capable of generalizing to global geography. We believe this work is the first published approach for automated indirect top-down estimation of road transport sector emissions using visual imagery and represents a critical step towards scalable, global, near-real-time road transportation emissions inventories that are measured both independently and objectively.

TI  - Establishment of the Invasive <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in the West Valley Area of San Bernardino County, CA
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), is the most aggressive invasive mosquito species with worldwide distribution. In addition to being a notorious nuisance species, it can pose significant public health concern because of its ability to transmit various viral pathogens. The first adult capture in the West Valley area of San Bernardino County, CA, occurred in September 2015 in Montclair. A strategic surveillance plan was implemented accordingly by the West Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District to document the infestation. The Biogent Sentinel (BG-2) trap augmented with BG-Lure and carbon dioxide (CO2) was deployed as a routine surveillance tool during 2017-2019. Extensive trapping revealed an expanding infestation, when positive trap nights (TN) increased from 14.2% in 2017 to 23.9% in 2018 and 55.6% in 2019. The average counts/TN increased from 0.65 in 2017 and 0.90 in 2018 to 3.83 in 2019. The cities of Montclair, Chino, and Ontario had much higher infestation than other cities in the district with the highest positive TN of 46.0% in Montclair, and highest average trap count of 3.23/TN in Chino. It was interesting to note that males coincided with females with more profound trend during warmer months of July to October when ratios of males ranged 28.4-35.0%. The BG-2 trap significantly outperformed the CO2 trap and gravid trap. The establishment of this invasive species in semiarid inland Southern California was further confirmed by concurrent larval collections.

TI  - Impacts of reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen on coastal marine eco-system during substantial shift in human activities in the twenty-first century
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel infectious disease (COVID-19) took only a few weeks from its official inception in December 2019 to become a global pandemic in early 2020. Countries across the world went to lockdown, and various strict measures were implemented to reduce the further spread of the infection. Although, the strict lockdown measures were aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19, however, Its positive implications were also observed for the environmental conditions across the global regions. The present study attempted to explore the eco-restoration of coastal marine system in response to reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (NO2) emission during the substantial shift in human activities across the global metropolitan cities. Remotely data of NO2 emission were taken from Ozone Monitoring Instrument and the coastal water quality along the marine system was estimated from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 using Semi-Analytic Sediment Model (SASM). The changes in tropospheric NO2 in 2020s were also compared with the long-term average changes over the baseline period 2015 - 2019. A significant reduction in anthropogenic mobility (85 - 90%) has been observed in almost all countries over different places, especially grocery, parks, workplaces, and transit stations. A massive reduction in tropospheric NO2 was detected in Wuhan (53%), Berlin (42%), London (41%), Karachi (40%), Paris (38%), Santiago (35%), and Chennai (34%) during the strict lockdown period of the early 2020 as compared to the last five years. However, after the partial lockdown was lifted, tropospheric NO2 values bounced back and slightly increased over Karachi (6%) and Bremen (12%). For water turbidity, the rate of reduction was found to be the highest along the different coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea (51%), West Atlantic Ocean (32%), East Atlantic Ocean (29%), and Indian Ocean (21%) from Apr to Jun 2020. The monthly comparison of overland-runoff in 2020 compared to 2019 across the different costal watersheds indicates that the observed decline in turbidity might have been due to the reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. The findings of this study suggest that the recent decline in tropospheric NO2 and water turbidity might be associated with reduced emissions from fossil fuels and road transports followed by COVID-19 forced restrictions in the twenty-first century. The inferences made here highlight the hope of improving the global environmental quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions using innovative periodic confinement measures on heavy transport and industries while securing public health and socioeconomics.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the national cognitive nature, the hidden essence of non-verbal techniques. The main purpose of the study is to prove that nonverbal signs are used to convey a confidential message to show that in international communication there is a change in the semantics of nonverbal actions depending on the culture and individual knowledge of each nation.Methods: In human life, in parallel with verbal communication, an experiment was conducted on nonverbal techniques, sometimes used in pure form to convey a secret and hidden message. The article presents an analysis based on a statistical method compared with some kinemes used in a common language.In the studies on non-verbal techniques, it is noted that they perform a crucial function in the relations between people. In this article, in the course of analyzing the nature of nonverbal techniques, we characterized some kinemes used depending on the worldview of the Kazakh people and concluded that their background is directly related to the mystery.Application of the study: The results, the materials, and the conclusions of the work can be used in the history of language, sociolinguistics, and paralinguistic studies, and allow researchers of gesture semantics to explore nonverbal techniques from a new perspective.Scientists-linguists, psychologists have created many works related to the definition of human nature, character, and the place of nonverbal techniques in the speech act. However, it was not said that auxiliary means located outside the language will be used to transmit confidential, non-public information. In this work, we stopped at the place of nonverbal methods of transmitting confidential, hidden information and analyzed the functions in a confidential communication.

AB  - Algorithms were developed to predict spatial variation of yield and quality within winter wheat crops intended for bread-making. Bayesian networks were used to predict spatial probability maps of yield and quality based on data sources including yield maps, fertiliser applications, soil variables and Sentinel 2 satellite data. Results presented here for five UK fields show that there was a 65% likelihood of achieving a grain protein premium with variable rate nitrogen application compared to 50% with uniform N. Achieving this premium would increase revenues by (sic)150/ha. A similar comparison for five German fields did not demonstrate a higher probability of profit.

TI  - WORLDVIEW SEARCH FOR REFORMING THE KOMSOMOL ACTIVITIES BY THE YOUTH OF THE NOVOSIBIRSK ACADEMGORODOK IN THE MID-1960s
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the socio-political aspect of Novosibirsk Academgorodok history in the 1960s has attracted more and more interest. On the one hand, this period is interesting as a stage in the formation of a new science center, on the other hand, as a stage of the greatest public activity, the study of which is the key to comprehending the phenomenon of the sixties as a whole. One particular feature of Akademgorodok was its democratic social environment, partly explained by the high level of its resident's education and the patronage of the Siberian Branch administration, which tried to maintain the image of the "City of the Sun" to attract the best scientific minds of the Soviet Union. The dominant role in the life of the scientific center belonged to the scientific intelligentsia, which considered itself a special caste and was in the position of scientism and belief in the possibility of building socialism "with a human face." This factor determined the peculiarity of the activities of the Komsomol organization of Akademgorodok. The goal of the study is to identify the main ideological and philosophical trends and ways of their implementation in the work of the Komsomol organization of Akademgorodok. In addition to archive data, the article uses materials from oral history. Interviews were recorded with some of the participants in those events. Khrushchev's "thaw" led to philosophical shifts in the mentality of the youth of Akademgorodok, most noticeable in the mid-1960s. This led to public discussions and demands for specific reforms of the Komsomol. In 1964-1965, Komsomol meetings were held in many institutes of the scientific center, discussing important question, - "Why do we need the Komsomol?" In some organizations, this wording meant the search for new forms of work, in others, this issue led to the decision to dissolve the Komsomol. The youth of Akademgorodok suggested giving more independence to the Komsomol, relieving it of the control and patronage of the Communist Party. The demand for greater democratization of the Komsomol and the revision of a number of provisions of its charter led to the political crisis in December 1965, marked by the confrontation between the Komsomol activists of Akademgorodok and regional and city party bodies. The party leadership responded with repressive measures: the Komsomol committee of the Siberian branch, which united scientific youth, was dissolved. Anatoly Slutsky, the first secretary of the city Komsomol committee and an ardent supporter of the Komsomol activists of Akademgorodok, was removed from his position. Despite that, representatives of the young scientific intelligentsia were able to maintain their main positions in the leadership of the Komsomol of the Soviet district. As a result, many new forms of work and economic activism have been implemented. The scientific association "Fakel" was created at the initiative of the youth of Akademgorodok, which allowed the Komsomol to obtain huge financial resources to support its clubs.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay considers political affect in the open world action-adventure survival horror game Days Gone (SIE Bend Studio, 2019). Through an examination of its rendering of the Pacific Northwest landscape as ideology, much is revealed about a deeply troubled and oppositional worldview. While this research addresses matters of representation-particularly notions of fraught masculinity and a struggle for recognition-its focus is on how the game functions as a window onto a fantasy of American self-reliance and populism that strongly resonates with a Trump-era nationalist turn in the U.S. The essay also gestures toward a methodology of experiential close-reading, one focused on working-through and sitting with a difficult aesthetic object that may at first seem entirely generic. In this essay, the author reaches through the offending, formulaic image to grasp the political affect that emanates from a sustained aesthetic experience of playing Days Gone.

AB  - In 2021, the forest fires in the Mediterranean Region led to substantial loss of life and property. In our country, average annual forest area of 10350 ha was affected by fire between years 1997-2018. The fires that occurred particularly close to the residential regions damage residential areas, ecosystem and cause civilian injuries and deaths. Generation of accurate information and keeping information up-to-date in being prepared for the forest fires is only possible with up-to-date information technologies. Fast and accurate data flow and simultaneous analysis of this data is crucial in determining the fire vulnerability, conducting risk analyses and keeping them up-to-date, as well. Herein, remote sensing images are important data source. The geographic information systems, which enable the analysis of all information together, are indispensible in taking precautions and process management. In this study, firstly remote sensing was referred in forest fire studies and then the results of the risk analysis that was conducted in Cakirlar-Antalya with geographic information system (GIS) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarcy Process (FAHP) were presented.

TI  - Protocol for active safety monitoring of a cohort of patients using a dolutegravir-based antiretroviral regimen in Mozambique
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasingly being used as the preferred first-line regimen for the treatment of HIV in low-income and middle-income countries. The National Program for the Control of STI/HIV/AIDS in Mozambique has planned a phased introduction of the tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (TLD) regimen. In 2019, concerns about a potential safety signal identified with dolutegravir identified in the results of the Tsepamo study, conducted in Botswana, led the National Directorate of Pharmacy and the National Program for the Control of STI/HIV/AIDS to establish an active pharmacovigilance surveillance system among newly placed patients on a TLD regimen. This activity aims to establish an active pharmacovigilance system to monitor adverse events in patients on a TLD regimen to support the effectiveness of Mozambique's public health programmes in improving the process of care and treatment outcomes for people with HIV/AIDS. Methods and analysis This is a prospective, non-interventional, descriptive cohort study to monitor HIV patients managed with TLD at 10 sentinel health centres in Mozambique. The cohort consists of HIV-infected patients commencing treatment with TLD, either as treatment naive patients or switched from other ART regimens. Patients have monthly routine follow-up visits for the first 3 months after starting HIV treatment with TLD, and subsequently every 3 months for a total period of 1 year. Patients are monitored to identify possible adverse events during the follow-up period. The intended size of the cohort is 3000 patients. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the National Commission on Bioethics in Health in Mozambique. Written informed consent is obtained from each participant who agrees to participate to have their information collected, analysed and stored. Findings will be reported to the Ministry of Health and participating health centres to inform policy and practice as well as disseminated by peer-review publications.

TI  - MAGMATOLOGICAL TECTONICS: ALFRED RITTMANN'S PARADIGM
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to present the life and research of Alfred Rittmann (1893-1980). He was an Earth scientist in the broadest sense: a petrographer, mineralogist, magmatologist, tectonist, geodynamicist, planetologist, volcanologist and, what is more, a philosopher of geosciences. He is considered the founder of contemporary, volcanology by combining in his interdisciplinary research the study of volcanic phenomena at the surface with tectonic activity and magmatology. In his books, Rittmann discussed the first correlations between volcanism and tectonics; his geodynamic model comprises complex studies of geology, volcanology, magmatology and geodynamics. We propose to name his scientific worldview 'Magmatological Tectonics' (MT) and to describe it as a Kuhnian paradigm. The leading concept of all geological processes is the fundamental law. Rittmann also made abundant use of Chamberlin's method, the method of multiple working hypotheses. Some brief interpretations will be proposed regarding the importance of Rittmann in the history of geosciences in the twentieth century and the emergence of some philosophical problems deriving from this research.

TI  - On Omens Associated with the Magpie (On the Material of Old Mongolian Written Sources from the National Museum Named after Aldan-Maadyr of the Republic of Tyva)
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of old Mongolian written monuments in from the National Museum named after Aldan-Maadyr of the Tyva Republic is of great interest to researchers in terms of studying the history of the Buddhist tradition among the Tuvans. Moreover, it provides material for reconstructing and depicting in full detail all the richness of Buddhist literature that was circulating among the clergy and laymen and has survived up to now. Although some samples of Mongolian written sources from the museum collection have been introduced into scientific circulation, still a large layer of literature is not known to a wide circle of Buddhist and Mongolian scholars. The author aims at considering handwritten materials that describe the signs associated with the magpie, and conducting textological and thematic analyses, as well as identifying the general and special in the texts that describe the signs associated with birds. The author made a selection of texts from the museum collection, including the newly described ones, in which the magpie is mentioned, as well as signs associated with other birds, analyzed their content, and determined the characteristic features. A description is given of 7 handwritten texts written in Old Mongolian graphics, which include descriptions of signs associated with the magpie. The considered texts allow us to conclude that the signs associated with birds have ancient roots, are the result of observations of nomadic pastoralists over nature, the surrounding world, represent a way of understanding it and commenting the events taking place in it, i.e. reflected the worldview and worldview of the people. Having evolved over the centuries, they now provide universal formulas containing a description of natural phenomena associated with the behavior of birds (magpies, crows), as well as explanations that reveal patterns of events occurring in this world. This explains the stability of these formulas in the oral tradition, which was codified in writing, and later borrowed by Buddhist preachers, who included these patterns in the texts with signs and fortune-telling.

TI  - Natural resource-use in the Lower Tana River Delta based on household surveys and remote sensing of land cover and land use patterns
T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Household survey data and spatially explicit Sentinel-2 satellite images of land cover and land use during the dry and wet seasons were used to investigate livelihood strategies in the Lower Tana River Delta in Kenya, where food security and economic activity rely almost exclusively on ecosystem goods and services. Land cover classification of satellite imagery successfully showed seasonal changes to estuary-related vegetation and habitats from which land use cycles could be inferred. Flood-recession agriculture and part-time fishing were the most common activities at Ozi village, some 10 km upstream from the estuary mouth, whereas full-time fishing dominated activities at Kipini town, where the Tana Estuary discharges into Ungwana Bay. Seasonality of fishing at Kipini depended on favourable sea conditions, arrival of migrant fishers and peaks in shrimp abundance. Seasonality of agriculture at Ozi depended on the freshwa- ter flooding regime, visible in satellite images as an inverse relationship of areas covered by wetlands and cultivated lands. The predominance of fishing assets at Kipini indicated specialization, which underlies a socio-economic net- work of fish processing, marketing, distribution and logistical support services. In contrast, mixed farming assets and traditional fishing gear at Ozi reflected more diversified farmer-fisher livelihoods, as a risk avoidance strategy. Key out- comes of this study were that land cover and land use were strongly seasonal, that coastal and upstream communities in the Tana Estuary relied on different combinations of ecosystem goods and services, and that livelihood strategies at the two locations differed fundamentally. Combining social, spatial and ecological data to describe socio-ecological systems typical of the Tana Estuary provided a broad platform for shared resource management strategies.

TI  - The Features of the Formation and the Functioning Principles of Oil and Gas Field Technogeosystems
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The stadial structure of the formation of technogeosystems of oil and gas fields (TGSOGF) are characterized based on field and laboratory studies using remote sensing data from 12 key study plots within oil and gas fields in the Volga-Ural steppe region. TGSOGF is understood as a complete set of modified natural components and technological facilities that function as a whole during the development of an oil and gas field. Two main principles of the formation and functioning of a TGSOGF are distinguished. The first principle implies the temporal stadiality of development, determined by the period of field development and by the level (variety) of technogenic load on the landscape. The other principle is the reversible and irreversible transformation of landscape components, leading to changes in mutual physical-energy connections of its vertical and horizontal structures. The random diffuse-linear distribution of structural links of oil and gas fields forms a specific space of technogenic influence, which is characterized by the overlap, intersection, and combination of impact zones of oil and gas production facilities. There are five stages of transformation of the initial landscape with varying degrees of involvement of components in the transformation process. The initial landscape structure is formed from a technogenic block, including units with the irreversible introduction of structures of liquidated and/or temporarily abandoned wells at the final stage of field development. This results in the manifestation of equifinality: the completion of the oil and gas production process becomes equivalent for different landscapes and the natural invariant is replaced by the natural-technogenic one. Analysis of the features of oil and gas fields and determination of patterns of their functioning gave rise to the proposed concept of formation of a TGSOGF and made it possible to rationalize the optimization of the environmental management of oil and gas fields, taking into account the systematic principles of TGSOGF development and stadiality.

TI  - Effects of Satellite Revisit Rate and Time-Series Smoothing Method on Throughout-Season Maize Yield Correlation Accuracy
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Predictions of crop yield made during the growing season aid in crop management and economic planning. Many yield prediction models are made by performing regression between satellite-derived vegetation indices (VI) and yield. This article studied the effects of time-series end date and satellite imaging frequency on the accuracy of VI-yield correlation. Daily, 3-m resolution, multispectral images were obtained over a maize field near Beltsville, MD, USA, in 2018 and 2019. Plot-average green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) was extracted from these images. GNDVI time-series data were resampled to different revisit intervals, gap-filled and smoothed, temporally realigned, and correlated with plot-average yield at every day of the growing season. These experiments were then repeated with data removed from the end of the time-series. All methods tested performed well on time-series ending 72 d or more after green-up in 2019 (R-squared = 0.95) or time-series ending 65 d or more after green-up in 2018 (Flexfit R-squared = 0.92; shape model fitting R-squared = 0.89). All methods had poor correlation for time-series ending prior to the day of peak GNDVI. Mean R-squared values for GNDVI-yield correlations decreased with increasing revisit intervals. These trends were stronger in the 2019 data, with mean R-squared decreasing by more than 0.05 when sampled from 1 to 30-d revisit intervals (Flexfit) or to 22-d revisit intervals (shape model fitting). These findings, along with cloud-contamination statistics, were used to recommend an optimal methodology for yield correlation and an optimal overpass frequency of 1-4 d for future yield-monitoring satellite systems.

AB  - Grasslands are the most widespread terrestrial ecosystem in the United Kingdom (UK). They represent a critical carbon (C) reservoir and provide forage and fodder to millions of livestock. Quantifying how management and climate affect grassland C dynamics is key to achieving climate-resilient farming, to shaping and monitoring data-informed policies, and to transitioning to a zero-C agri-food sector. To this end, remote sensing systems provide information on grassland vegetation in near-real time, across large domains and at high resolution. Bio-geochemical models use our continuously-developing knowledge on ecosystem functioning to describe ecosystem C dynamics and the effects of weather and human management on them. Field measurements of C pools and fluxes provide direct ground observations of grassland C losses and gains. The combination of earth and ground observations with modelling represents a robust way for quantifying, monitoring and verifying grassland ecosystem C stocks. This presentation demonstrates our current capabilities in regards to this. We have developed and tested a model-data fusion (MDF) framework that uses earth observation data (Proba-V and Sentinel-2) on vegetation canopy (leaf area index) to infer vegetation management (grazing, cutting) and inform a validated process-based model of field-scale C dynamics (DALEC-Grass). The framework was applied for 2017-2018 at 1855 grassland fields that were sampled from across the UK. The MDF-predicted livestock density per area and the corresponding agricultural census-based data had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.68. The MDF-predicted annual yield (harvested and cut biomass) was within the range of relevant measured data and reflected the variation of grassland management intensity across the UK. On average, the simulated grasslands were C sinks in 2017 and 2018 but the 2018 European summer heatwave resulted in a 9-fold increase in the number of simulated fields that were C sources in 2018 compared to 2017. We argue that earth observation data can be used in a MDF framework to monitor grassland vegetation management and to simulate its impacts on the C balance of any UK grassland field as well as to attribute changes in annual C balance to human activities and weather anomalies.

AB  - This paper provides the results of assessing the possibility ofusing remote sensing data obtained from the Sentinel-2 with a spatial resolution of 10 m and simple Markov chains to predict the degree of development of Galega orientalis within the local area. The possibility of using remote sensing data obtained with the Phantom-4ProV 2.0 to assess the productivity of Silphium petfoliarum and Zea mays biomass was also evaluated The studies were carried out in 2017-2020 on the territory of Gorki district (Republic of Belarus). The research indicated that the use of the Markov model and the raster image of the NDVI index as a predictor makes it possible to accurately predict the areas with very poorly developed poorly developed moderately developed, developed and well-developed vegetation (chi(2)(empiric) = 0.401; chi(2)(critical) = 9.488). Vegetation indices ExG, VARI, WI, and EXGR, are suitable for creating a predictive multiple linear regression model that allows predicting the productivity of Silphium perfoliatum in the stalking phase with an error not exceeding 2%, while indices RGBVI, ExQ and EXGR it is advisable to use for yield predicting of corn (MAPE=5.19%).

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF BELARUS-AGRARIAN SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agromonitoring is one of the most important sources of obtaining up-to-date and timely information about the state of agricultural crops. It is possible to speed up and reduce the cost of its implementation process using remote sensing data (RSD) obtained with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Possibility of using ultra-high-resolution remote sensing to determine productivity of Silphium perfoliatum biomass has been evaluated using Phantom-4ProV 2.0 UAV. The shooting was carried out in RGB mode, the shooting height was 50 m, the spatial resolution was 2.5 cm. Based on the results of the survey, a height map and orthomosaic were created, which were later used to assess productivity of plants. To obtain the plant height values, the difference between the vegetation cover heights obtained from the surface model raster and the minimum height determined within the raster has been calculated. The actual height of plants measured in the field was compared with the data obtained using the UAV, and after the biomass productivity calculated from the actual and predicted heights was determined. The determination coefficient for equation of paired linear regression between the actual and predicted values of productivity made 0.97, and the value of the average approximation error was 3.3 %. To verify the results obtained, 60 samples of biomass were taken in the field within the study area, with the length of the plants determined using a tape measure, and the sampling sites coordinated using GPS positioning. 13 vegetation indices have been determined using pixel-based calibrated orthomosaic and normalized RGB channels, four of which (ExG, VARI, WI, and EXGR) showed to be suitable for creating a predictive model of multiple linear regression, which allows estimating and predicting the productivity of Silphium perfoliatum biomass during stemming phase with an error not exceeding 2 %. The results of the study can be useful both in development of prediction methods and in the direct prediction of Silphium perfoliatum biomass and other forage crops productivity, in particular Helianthus annuus and Helianthus tuberosus.

AB  - This article is the result of the study of the following problem - the role of culture in the formation and spiritual development of the individual. To assess the significance of culture, the author considers various interpretations of the "culture" concept, the nature of culture as a means of accumulation, storage, transmission of human experience, its multitasking, as well as the process of spiritual development of the individual in the triunity of "body-soul-spirit" in the cultural space. The author analyzes the humanitarian culture that contributes to the spiritual growth and perfection of the individual. The conclusion is made about the relationship between culture and spirituality: the possibility of developing and educating the spirit, soul and body at different levels of influence - spiritual, intellectual, cultural, moral, labor, physical, aesthetic, etc. An important emphasis in the article is placed on the problems of spiritual and moral guidelines of the modern generation, brought up in the conditions of digitalization of everyday life, the predominance of contactless (correspondence, network) ways of communication. At the same time, the education of universal and national cultural values is an integral part of a harmonious personality development, which is emphasized by both teachers and psychologists, and is reflected, in the state approach to education, patriotism and national identity promoted in society. General cultural humanitarian values should become the basis for the development of the spiritual world of a person, regardless of the technological structure and the prevailing norms of behavior, country, race, and religion.

T2  - GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The localization of Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) as a potential heat risk for the urban population was evaluated. The paper aimed to propose an approach to quantify and localize (SUHI) based on Landsat series TM, ETM+, OLI satellite imageries from the period 1996-2018 and recognize the Atmospheric Urban Heat Island (AUHI) effects from long term temperature measurements. Using the theoretical relation between the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the LST (Land Surface Temperature), SUHIintensity and SUHIrisk maps were created from the combination of LST, NDVI, NDBI using threshold values to localize urban heat island in the Katowice conurbation. Negative values of SUHI intensity characterize areas where there is no vegetation, highly built-up areas, and areas with high surface temperatures. The urban grow - revealed from SUHI - and global climate change are acting together to strengthen the global AUHI effect in the region as the temperature measurements were indicated.

AB  - This paper proposes an effective and efficient destriping method for remote-sensing data. Destriping of remote-sensing data is an essential task because stripe noise not only degrades the visual quality but also seriously affects subsequent processing. We formulate the destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving zero-gradient constraints, where the constraints are designed to exploit the fact that the spatial and temporal gradients of stripe noise equal to zero. Our method imposes such strong constraints on stripe noise, and thus can fully capture the nature of stripe noise, leading to very effective destriping. Also, operations required for handling the zero-gradient constraints in optimization are simple, which enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for solving the problem by a primal-dual splitting method. We demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing methods on destriping experiments using remote-sensing data.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for diagnosis of lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundPelvic lymphadenectomy provides prognostic information for those diagnosed with endometrial (womb) cancer and provides information that may influence decisions regarding adjuvant treatment. However, studies have not shown a therapeutic benefit, and lymphadenectomy causes significant morbidity. The technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), allows the first draining node from a cancer to be identified and examined histologically for involvement with cancer cells. SLNB is commonly used in other cancers, including breast and vulval cancer. Different tracers, including colloid labelled with radioactive technetium-99, blue dyes, e.g. patent or methylene blue, and near infra-red fluorescent dyes, e.g. indocyanine green (ICG), have been used singly or in combination for detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN).ObjectivesTo assess the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the identification of pelvic lymph node involvement in women with endometrial cancer, presumed to be at an early stage prior to surgery, including consideration of the detection rate.Search methodsWe searched MEDLINE (1946 to July 2019), Embase (1974 to July 2019) and the relevant Cochrane trial registers.Selection criteriaWe included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tracers for SLN assessment (involving the identification of a SLN plus histological examination) against a reference standard of histological examination of removed pelvic +/- para-aortic lymph nodes following systematic pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PLND/PPALND) in women with endometrial cancer, where there were sufficient data for the construction of two-by-two tables.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors (a combination of HN, JM, NW, RG, and WH) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, classified studies for inclusion/exclusion and extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We calculated the detection rate as the arithmetic mean of the total number of SLNs detected out of the total number of women included in the included studies with the woman as the unit of analysis, used univariate meta-analytical methods to estimate pooled sensitivity estimates, and summarised the results using GRADE.Main resultsThe search revealed 6259 unique records after removal of duplicates. After screening 232 studies in full text, we found 73 potentially includable records (for 52 studies), although we were only able to extract 2x2 table data for 33 studies, including 2237 women (46 records) for inclusion in the review, despite writing to trial authors for additional information.We found 11 studies that analysed results for blue dye alone, four studies for technetium-99m alone, 12 studies that used a combination of blue dye and technetium-99m, nine studies that used indocyanine green (ICG) and near infra-red immunofluorescence, and one study that used a combination of ICG and technetium-99m. Overall, the methodological reporting in most of the studies was poor, which resulted in a very large proportion of 'unclear risk of bias' ratings.Overall, the mean SLN detection rate was 86.9% (95% CI 82.9% to 90.8%; 2237 women; 33 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In studies that reported bilateral detection the mean rate was 65.4% (95% CI 57.8% to 73.0%) . When considered according to which tracer was used, the SLN detection rate ranged from 77.8% (95% CI 70.0% to 85.6%) for blue dye alone (559 women; 11 studies; low-certainty evidence) to 100% for ICG and technetium-99m (32 women; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The rates of positive lymph nodes ranged from 5.2% to 34.4% with a mean of 20.1% (95% CI 17.7% to 22.3%).The pooled sensitivity of SLNB was 91.8% (95% CI 86.5% to 95.1%; total 2237 women, of whom 409 had SLN involvement; moderate-certainty evidence). The sensitivity for of SLNB for the different tracers were: blue dye alone 95.2% (95% CI 77.2% to 99.2%; 559 women; 11 studies; low-certainty evidence); Technetium-99m alone 90.5% (95% CI 67.7% to 97.7%; 257 women; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence); technetium-99m and blue dye 91.9% (95% CI 74.4% to 97.8%; 548 women; 12 studies; low-certainty evidence); ICG alone 92.5% (95% CI 81.8% to 97.1%; 953 women; 9 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); ICG and blue dye 90.5% (95% CI 63.2.6% to 98.1%; 215 women; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence); and ICG and technetium-99m 100% (95% CI 63% to 100%; 32 women; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-regression analyses found that the sensitivities did not differ between the different tracers used, between studies with a majority of women with FIGO stage 1A versus 1B or above; between studies assessing the pelvic lymph node basin alone versus the pelvic and para-aortic lymph node basin; or between studies that used subserosal alone versus subserosal and cervical injection. It should be noted that a false-positive result cannot occur, as the histological examination of the SLN is unchanged by the results from any additional nodes removed at systematic lymphadenectomy.Authors' conclusionsThe diagnostic test accuracy for SLNB using either ICG alone or a combination of a dye (blue or ICG) and technetium-99m is probably good, with high sensitivity, where a SLN could be detected. Detection rates with ICG or a combination of dye (ICG or blue) and technetium-99m may be higher. The value of a SLNB approach in a treatment pathway, over adjuvant treatment decisions based on uterine factors and molecular profiling, requires examination in a high-quality intervention study.

AB  - In the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel calls the stage of Geist reached through critical reflection on the French Revolution as the moral worldview, which this article attempts to analytically reconstruct and critically estimate.The moral world view is, as the general cultural atmosphere after Kant, the world view of consciousness that can sublate his own individual immediacy and promote the universally valid will. However, this world view on the basis of dualism between morality and nature is also the nest of various contradictions. Hegel, per his own interpretation, analyzes these as Kant’s postulates of the harmony between morality and happiness, the harmony between morality and sensibility, and the God as the ruler of the world. According to this, although presupposing the postulated harmonies as being beyond, consciousness cannot help but to ignore the postulates just in its own act of realizing these harmonies actually. Or, from the viewpoint of its own moral imperfection and the completeness of the postulates harmonies, it cannot but deny its sensible action. Therefore, it dissimulates in various ways.Finally, as Hegel diagnoses, the consciousness that seeks the possibility to rebuild human life ruined by the revolution with the Kantian moral view comes to fall into an indecisive trilemma of the postulated completeness, the imperfect action, and the intermediate state.

AB  - In ancient Chinese culture, history and philosophy, “heart” represents all activities of consciousness. Buddhism regards “the heart is the root of all the wonderful things” and believes that all the things in the universe are present in the heart, and “there is no realm outside knowledge”. Therefore, Buddhism is called mind teaching, and Dharma is mind Dharma.Zhao Zhifeng, a famous monk in the Southern Song Dynasty, is proficient in San Zang and knows the hearts of all living beings. Although the group of stone sculptures on Da fo wan cliff in Bao ding mountain built by him is a perfect combination of various sects, the design of the whole group of statues is a system of its own with obvious personality differences. He had a deep insight into folk customs, so he got rid of prejudices, became involved in the world, valued ethics, respected Confucianism, and consciously promoted filial piety in the Da fo wan cliff sculpture schema of Bao ding mountain in Da zu, Large scale group sculptures such as “parents' kindness in dissimilation”, “Ulambana Sutra of Mahavaipulya Buddha” and “Hell dissimilated” have been carved, so that most believers believe that “the theme of Da zu, Bao ding stone carving is to promote filial piety”.However, Zhao Zhifeng practice careful mind Dharma, he cited Confucianism aid Buddha, the promotion of filial piety can be well intentioned, It is not only a metaphor of reason, but also a symbol of emotion, and even more a admonition of law. In the process of carving, he paid attention to the relationship between the external features of different characters, such as the facial features, shape, posture and movement, and their internal features, in order to express the spirit and write from the heart. So it has always orderly integrated the Buddhist worldview, life view, epistemology practice method with the Confucian ethics and the Neo-Confucianism mind. It can be said that the dozens of statues in Bao ding shan Da fo wan are all related to and predestined to the heart. It can be said that they are all caused by the heart and made by the heart.In this paper, a few groups of stone statues representing the Buddhist philosophy are taken as examples. “The Six Consumption Diagram of the Heart Bound Ape Lock” which is emphasized is “the essence of mind nature”, and embodies the essence of mind Dharma, such as “knowing the original mind, knowing the mind and seeing the Buddha”. “The Six Path of Samsara” that expounds the basic doctrines of Buddhism, such as “thousands of reasons originate in the mind”, so that people can feel the existence of “mind” and its importance in life. “Guan Jing disguised” Complex doctrinal texts were abridged, mainly to reflect the “sixteen views” of the “essence of mind training”. “Cattle Herding” The group of ten oxen and ten herdsmen illustrates the cultivation of Zen's mind and profoundly reveals the different understandings and mindsets of practitioners. Yuan jue cave integrates decoration, drainage and lighting, and always uses the abstract theme of “listening” to create its mood, fully showing Zhao Zhifeng's design theme of “listening to reflect the heart”.Through a review of the above groups of statues, the author tries to clarify that “the supreme mind and law” is the ideological theme of the group of stone carvings in the fowan cliff of baoding mountain.

AB  - Precise monitoring of the earth cover and its historical archive are very important for preserving the healthy earth environment. Since the majority of quad pol data sets acquired with ALOS-PALSAR have been saved unprocessed, National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology have completed full-processing and opened a website on which everyone can search, view and download the global data. These numerous data sets including SLC as well as ortho-rectified scattering power decomposition images can be utilized freely for checking the long-term temporal variation of the land cover. They will serve as a good reference for advanced microwave remote sensing.

AB  - Forests are the most important and essential natural resources used by mankind for various usage. Loss of these forests has emerged as a major environmental concern in recent years. But for the purpose of development, many forests are being cut resulting in deforestation. Due to this cutting of forests, deforestation rate is increasing day by day and the world is facing severe disasters. Therefore, this continuous clearing of forests has a major degraded impact on the soil quality, climate change, hydrological cycle and ecosystem etc. This paper suggests suitable remote sensing techniques which can be used for the analyses of planet scope 3m resolution satellite data of Yavatmal district of Maharashtra state. Remote sensing techniques along with the GIS i.e. geographic information system are used to detect the changes in forest cover of Yavatmal district. For recognition of forest cover, layer stacking of bands 3 and 4 by using Erdas Imagine software is done. For forest classification, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is experimented. The NDVI values reveal the change of forest cover and various other categories resulting in increase and decrease of categories. It is concluded that out of total forest area (76740.32 hectare), decreased category shows 29.44% due to forest cutting, forest fires and leaf shedding etc.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdowns induced land surface temperature variability in mega urban agglomerations in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown in India for months when close to 1.3 billion people were confined to their homes. An abrupt halt in the majority of the urban activities reduced the generation of anthropogenic heat which often exacerbates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in the urban pockets of the country. We studied the lockdown impact on seven highly populated and polluted mega urban agglomerations across India, namely Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, using near-anniversary Landsat 8 data. The results revealed that the lockdowns have improved the air quality and reduced the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and hence the UHI effect over these cities. Each of the cities experienced an improved Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 18 to 151 units except Chennai (with a marginal 8 units increase in AQI), a decrease in mean LST in the range of 0.27 degrees C to 7.06 degrees C except Kolkata which showed an increment by similar to 4 degrees C, and a reduction in daily averaged air temperature ranging from 0.3 degrees C to 10.88 degrees C except Hyderabad which witnessed an increase of 0.09 degrees C during the lockdown (April 2020) compared to the previous years (April 2019 and 2018). Delhi exhibited the maximum positive impact of the lockdown in all aspects with two-fold improved air quality, and Ahmedabad showed the least improvement. In addition to the variations in regional land use and land cover and proportion of essential industries that remained operational throughout the lockdown, the geographic location, topography, local meteorology and climate were some of the other factors also responsible for either aiding or overcompensating the large scale LST variabilities observed in these cities. These results hint at an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of periodic planned lockdowns as a possible mitigating measure to reduce LST spikes and degraded air quality in urban areas in the future.

AB  - An earthquake and liquefaction in Palu and Sigi on September 28, 2018, caused serious damage in the rice fields and agricultural infrastructure. The aim of this research was studying and mapping the impact of the disasters by using high-resolution satellite images and field verification. This research uses a visual analysis method to compare images before and after the disasters. The results showed that 6,467 ha of rice fields affected by the disaster. The heavy damaged rice fields were caused by earthquakes, damaged river embankment, and liquefaction. The landscape with undulating slope having height difference of 1 to 5 m, reversed soil surface, crack width > 100 cm, damage on the irrigation system, and sand boiling, were naturally cannot be used again for rice fields. It can be used as tourism spot or historical sites with natural landscape. Whereas rice fields with undulating slope having height difference 20 to 100 cm, crack width up to 100 cm, and sand boiling were classified as moderate. The lightly damaged rice fields could not be planted because the irrigation system was destroyed. It can be used as rice fields after repairing the irrigation system to support water availability.

AB  - Paddy fields area has a strategic function as the main food provider for the majority of Indonesia's population. Based on the fixed area of paddy fields from 2013 to 2019, there have been three significant changes in the national paddy fields area. Changes in paddy fields into other land use occurred massively, especially in urban and semi-urban areas. The utilization of remote sensing can be one of the methods in detecting changes in paddy fields area temporally. The purpose of this study was to calculate changes in the area and its distribution of paddy fields in Klaten Regency from 2016 to 2020 using multi-sensor remote sensing data. The method used in this study was detecting paddy fields area temporally in 2016, 2018, and 2020 adopting machine learning approach Random Forest classification using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The results of the analysis of paddy fields area with Random Forest method using Sentinel-2 indicated an average test accuracy value of 95% compared to Sentinel-1 analysis with an average test accuracy value of 92%. The results of the analysis of the changes in paddy fields area in Klaten Regency using Sentinel-1 showed that in 2016 there were 30,480 hectares of paddy fields area and in 2020 it decreased to 29,588 hectares. Furthermore, the results of the analysis paddy fields area using Sentinel-2 in 2016 was 31,683 hectares and decreased to 31,196 hectares in 2020. These results demonstrated an under-estimate in the calculation of the results of paddy fields area analyzed by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 compared to the officially fixed area of paddy fields released by ATR/BPN.

TI  - Improved air quality and associated mortalities in India under COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - India enforced stringent lockdown measures on March 24, 2020 to mitigate the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we examined the impact of lockdown on the air quality index (AQI) [including ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3), and ammonia (NH3)] and tropospheric NO2 and O-3 densities through Sentinel-5 satellite data approximately 1 d post-lockdown and one month pre-lockdown and post-lockdown. Our findings revealed a marked reduction in the ambient AQI (estimated mean reduction of 17.75% and 20.70%, respectively), tropospheric NO2 density, and land surface temperature (LST) during post-lockdown compared with the pre-lockdown period or corresponding months in 2019, except for a few sites with substantial coal mining and active power plants. We observed a modest increase in the O-3 density post-lockdown, thereby indicating improved tropospheric air quality. As a favorable outcome of the COVID-19 lockdown, road accident-related mortalities declined by 72-folds. Cities with poor air quality correlate with higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (r = 0.504 and r = 0.590 for NO2; r = 0.744 and r = 0.435 for AQI). Conversely, low mortality was reported in cities with better air quality. These results show a correlation between the COVID-19 vulnerable regions and AQI hotspots, thereby suggesting that air pollution may exacerbate clinical manifestations of the disease. However, a prolonged lockdown may nullify the beneficial environmental outcomes by adversely affecting socioeconomic and health aspects. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NITROGEN DIOXIDE CONCENTRATION IN SELECTED EUROPEAN CITIES IN THE FIRST COVID-19 WAVE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the nitrogen oxides, NO2 has the greatest impact on humans. The areas with its highest concentrations within the EU are these most populated and industrialised ones. Excessive nitro-gen dioxide concentrations are responsible for around 75,000 premature deaths of EU residents each year; in Poland, this value reaches almost 1,900. Since 2017, there have been new possibi-lities to measure NO2 concentration, made as part of the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. Hence, it is purposeful to analyse changes in nitrogen dioxide emissions in the most important Polish cities against the EU in spring and summer 2020. The basis for the analysis was satellite data collected during the Copernicus Sentinels-5P Programme. In 2020, there were huge chan-ges in NO2 concentration, which were the consequences of the implementation of restrictive safety measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic: a significant reduction in road traffic and the closure or limiting of production in many industrial plants. It was found that, as a result of lockdown, nitrogen dioxide concentrations in Poland's largest cities fell to a much lesser de-gree than in cities of similar size in southern or western Europe. The analyses indicated that data obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite will play a key role in monitoring chan-ges in nitrogen dioxide concentration throughout the EU. Ground-based observations of nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which have dominated until recently, will remain only of comparative importance in the assessment and analysis of the compound concentration.

M3  - Video-Audio Media
AB  - We present a case describing the use of the AngioVac system (AngioDynamics, Inc.) and SENTINEL cerebral protection system (SCPS; Boston Scientific) in a patient with COVID-19 who initially presented with a large deep-vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity, complicated by a pulmonary embolism. Although he initially improved with systemic alteplase, he later developed a second large clot diagnosed in transit in the right atrium. Within 12 hours from initial thrombolysis, this large clot wedged across an incidental patent foramen ovale (PFO), the atrial septum, and the cavotricuspid annulus. We emergently performed a percutaneous clot extraction with preemptive placement of the SCPS in anticipation of cardioembolic phenomenon. A large (> 10 cm) clot was extracted without complication, and the patient was discharged home. The combined use of SCPS and AngioVac in this case suggests a potential role for percutaneous treatment of severe and consequential thromboembolic disease, especially in patients with a PFO, and may be considered as an alternative and less-invasive option in patients with COVID-19. While cerebral embolic protection devices are approved for and widely used in transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures, there is a theoretical benefit for use in percutaneous thrombolectomies as well.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on soil degradation are essential for environmental preservation. Since almost 30% of the global soils are degraded, it is important to study and map them for improving their management and use. We aimed to obtain a Soil Degradation Index (SDI) based on multi-temporal satellite images associated with climate variables, land use, terrain and soil attributes. The study was conducted in a 2598 km(2) area in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, where 1562 soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected and analyzed by conventional methods. Spatial predictions of soil attributes such as clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil organic matter (OM) were performed using machine learning algorithms. A collection of 35-year Landsat images was used to obtain a multi-temporal bare soil image, whose spectral bands were used as soil attributes predictors. The maps of clay, CEC, climate variables, terrain attributes and land use were overlaid and the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to obtain five groups, which represented levels of soil degradation (classes from 1 to 5 representing very low to very high soil degradation). The SDI was validated using the predicted map of OM. The highest degradation level obtained in 15% of the area had the lowest OM content. Levels 1 and 4 of SDI were the most representative covering 24% and 23% of the area, respectively. Therefore, satellite images combined with environmental information significantly contributed to the SDI development, which supports decision-making on land use planning and management.

T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing coupled with the measurement of physical, chemical and biological variables is an important tool in water resource management. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the dynamics of the physical, chemical and biological variables of the waters of an intermittent river and an artificial surface reservoir using multivariate analysis and in response to land use and occupation in the hydrographic basin. The study was carried out in the hydrographic basin of the River Cruxati in four study areas (three river areas and one artificial reservoir), with images obtained from the OLI sensor of the Landsat-8 satellite. The limnological variables measured were pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and chlorophyll a. The limnological variables were analysed using Principal Component Analysis - PCA, Tukey's test and Cluster Analysis. Eutrophication of the areas under study was calculated using the Trophic State Index. The PCA allowed three components to be selected that indicated the quality of the surface water, river and artificial reservoir, explaining 88.57% of the total variance. The limnological variables responsible for the grouping were electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity. Land use and occupation has influenced water quality in the stretches of river. Anthropisation has had an influence on the levels of dissolved oxygen, and the presence of agricultural areas has caused an increase in turbidity. However, the most conserved landscape (artificial reservoir) had the highest degree of eutrophication due to the difference in water dynamics between the lentic and lotic environments.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Since the 1940s, in the context of accelerated immigration flowing from rural villages to Istanbul, settled city dwellers have perceived the immigrants as a threat to their urban values and have developed several distinctive discriminatory attitudes and practices. In the urban cultural sphere, where modern Western values are embraced, Eastern and rural practices and the relevant consumer culture have been assessed and judged as inferior. The social groups who abandoned their home villages but still lacked the symbolic capital that would enable them to live out an urban lifestyle considered mass consumption to be a shortcut for adapting to city life. Thus, they developed an inappropriate aesthetic style, also referred to as the field of kitsch. The rosary, the typical sign-object of the Haciaga stereotype suggesting nouveau riche men, or the thick golden necklace that is emblematic of the Maganda stereotype with its vulgar masculinity or inappropriate combinations of whiskey and lahmacun, exemplify disseminated judgements embodied through objects. The Kezban profile was initially that of a naive country girl in popular movies of the 1970s; however, in the following decades, she was portrayed as a vulgar woman in various media productions. Kezban, with her consumption patterns, taste, and worldview, represents distaste for the modern urban woman. Through the sample, composed of 18 urban middle-class participants, possible sign-objects of the Kezban profile were investigated. Qualitative analysis informed the use of emerging repetitive thematic patterns such as 'decorations disjointed from the function' and 'the ostentatious appropriations of local agents'. The objects under these themes are discussed in the category of kitsch and show similarities with the aesthetics of 'arabesque'.

AB  - Cerebral toxoplasmosis and cerebral malaria are two important neurological diseases caused by protozoan parasites. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the innate immune responses of microglia and astrocytes to Toxoplasma and Plasmodium infection. In both infections, these tissue-resident glial cells perform a sentinel function mediated by alarmin crosstalk that licenses adaptive type 1 immunity in the central nervous system. Divergent protective or pathogenic effects of type 1 activation of these astrocytes and microglia are revealed depending on the inherent lytic potential of the protozoan parasite.

AB  - Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) represents by now an established tool for the remote monitoring of the ground displacements occurring on our planet. In addition, this technique is benefiting from the recent advancements in radar, navigation and aeronautical technologies. These indeed allow us on one side to avail of wide-coverage SAR satellites to observe larger and larger areas of the Earth's surface. On the other side, they make it possible to profit of cost-efficient aerial SAR systems, whose operative flexibility can play a crucial role to observe phenomena possibly hidden to satellite sensors and for the prompt monitoring in emergency scenarios. In this work, we provide the results of a ground deformation analysis performed over the municipality of Vazante, Brazil, based on the DInSAR processing of the data acquired by both the space-borne C-band Sentinel-1A and the drone-borne multi-frequency (P/L/C-bands) DBSS SAR systems.

TI  - Analysis of the Maximum Principal Stress Directions in the Himalayas: A Remote Sensing Based Approach
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tectonic activity in the Himalayan region is reflected through major and minor lineaments associated with the major fault and thrust systems. In the present study, we used multi-sensor optical and microwave radar remote sensing images and topographic elevation data for extraction of lineaments. Image enhancement of remote sensing data and relief shading of topographic elevation data were performed for highlighting the lineaments. Eight structural domains were selected in and around the major thrusts and strike slip faults in north-western and central Himalayan regions. From the angular distribution of lineaments, the vector mean orientations of major and minor lineaments were determined for each of the structural domains. Considering areal coverage of individual litho-units, area-weighted internal friction angles were obtained for eight structural domains. Finally, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria, the directions of maximum principal stress (s(1)) were estimated from the orientations of shear fractures. The study shows a good agreement between minor lineaments based maximum principal stress directions and GPS based plate motion vectors. But, we found a significant deviation between major and minor lineaments based principal stress directions and plate motion vectors for some of the structural domains those were affected by post-thrusting strike-slip fault tectonics. This is perhaps due to the fact that major lineaments give rise to the maximum principal stress direction of older collision and post-collision phases whereas minor lineaments represent essentially recent to sub-recent active tectonics phase. Further, subtle local deviations in the principal stress directions may be attributed to litho-tectonic heterogeneities.

TI  - Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Against Influenza-Related Mortality in Australian Hospitalized Patients: A Propensity Score Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Data on influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against mortality are limited, with no Australian data to guide vaccine uptake. We aimed to assess IVE against influenza-related mortality in Australian hospitalized patients, assess residual confounding in the association between influenza vaccination and mortality, and assess whether influenza vaccination reduces the severity of influenza illness.Methods. Data were collected between 2010 and 2017 from a national Australian hospital-based sentinel surveillance system using a case-control design. Adults and children admitted to the 17 study hospitals with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for influenza using nucleic acid testing; all eligible test-positive cases, and a subset of test-negative controls, were included. Propensity score analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of vaccination, with IVE = 1 - aOR x 100%. Residual confounding was assessed by examining mortality in controls.Results. Over 8 seasons, 14038 patients were admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The primary analysis included 9298 cases and 6451 controls, with 194 cases and 136 controls dying during hospitalization. Vaccination was associated with a 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3%-51%; P = .033) reduction in influenza-related mortality, with similar estimates in the National Immunisation Program target group. Residual confounding was identified in patients >= 65 years old (aOR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.06-3.46]; P = .031). There was no evidence that vaccination reduced the severity of influenza illness (aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, .76-1.50]; P = .713).Conclusions. Influenza vaccination is associated with a moderate reduction in influenza-related mortality. This finding reinforces the utility of the Australian vaccination program in protecting those most at risk of influenza-related deaths.

TI  - Assessing MODIS16A2 actual evapotranspiration across three spatial resolutions in Uruguay
T2  - AGROCIENCIA URUGUAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key process in hydrological systems and, consequently, in agroecosystems. It can be measured or derived with a large variety of models at scales ranging from leaf to catchment. MODIS16A2 is a satellite ET product with 500 meters / 8-day spatio-temporal resolution worldwide. It is based on the PenmanMonteith equation and considers the effect of vegetation dynamics, albedo and land cover. This technical paper compares the ET estimated from MODIS16A2 against the ET estimated at different scales from three reference methods: (1) the INIA-GRAS Water Balance on a country-scale, (2) the SWAT model of the Santa Lucia basin on the catchment scale, and (3) the Eddy Covariance Flux located in Colonia on a farmer scale. The analysis shows similarities between MODIS16A2 and the reference methods depending on seasonality, geographic location and scale of ET estimation. The assumptions about vegetation cover, vegetation dynamics, meteorological forcing and soil characteristics of the reference methods compared with MODIS16A2 ones could explain some deviations in the ET estimations. The results of this work contribute with a first approximation towards the quantification of the uncertainty of MODIS16A2 in Uruguay.

TI  - Influence of the Changes in Land-Use and Land Cover on Temperature over Northern and North-Eastern India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the influence of land-use and land cover (LULC) changes on the temperature over North India (NI) and North-Eastern India (NEI) during 1981-2006 by subtracting the reanalysis temperature from the observed temperature (observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the AVHRR satellite for the period 1981-2006 were analyzed to understand the type of LULC changes during this period and their linkage with the temperature change over the two regions. The results from OMR indicated that the LULC change over NI during 1981-2006 resulted a warming of 0.03 degrees C, and that of NEI during this period resulted a cooling of 1.5 degrees C. The results from LULC changes during the said period indicated an increase of dry land/snow cover and agriculture/fallow land by similar to 0.1% of total area and a decrease of shrubs/small vegetation and dense forest over NI by about 0.1-0.2%. Over NEI, the areas under agricultural/fallow land, open forest and dense forest showed an increase by about 0.8-2.4% during this period, and the areas under dry/snow cover and shrubs/small vegetation indicated a decrease by similar to 0.7-3.6%. The comparison between the OMR analysis and LULC changes indicated that the warming over NI during 1981-2006 is due to the expansion of the dry land and the decline of dense forest. On the other hand, the cooling over NEI during the period is attributed to the decline of non-vegetated/small vegetated lands and the expansion of agricultural land/forest covers in that period. This study has an overall implication towards the modeling studies for the impact assessment of LULC changes in the present as well as future climate.

TI  - Marine oil spill detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar over Indian Ocean
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Four oil spill events over the Indian Ocean including Chennai, Sharjah, Al Khiran and Mubarak Village are analyzed using Sentinel-1 satellite data. General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) model is utilized for oil spills trajectory production, whereas oil spills weathering processes are modeled using Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spill (ADIOS). Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based oil spill detection technique provided reliable results at the wind speed between 3 to 9 m/s for all events. Maximum oil spill movement (33 km) from the source point is observed in the Al Khiran, whereas evaporation rate of crude (degraded) oil is observed as high (low). The Near Real Time (NRT) detection of oil spill using SAR imagery needs high computational power, however, provides better results. This study concludes that SAR based oil spill detection is a cost-effective technique and can be utilized for mapping of oil spills.

M3  - Article
AB  - The bottom relief of the Keltma hollow (ancient river valley), which connects the modern basins of the Vychegda River and Kama River, was studied. For this purpose, traces of the Late Pleistocene over-flow of water from the dammed glacial lake of the Vychegda River depression into the Kama River basin were analyzed using the factual materials on the southern (Kama) territory of the Keltma hollow. The ongoing discussion about the timing of this event fuels the interest in this problem: some paleogeographers believe that the last overflow took place at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene (Kalin time), while others date it to the end of the Late Pleistocene (Ostashkov time). Historically, supporters of both these versions investigated the bottom of the dammed lake (Vychegda River basin). With the help of the satellite images, the Vychegda depression deposits were analyzed and dated. The remote sensing of the Earth's surface within the raised bogs and the alluvial-lake terrace showed traces of the ancient channel forms, occasionally not related to the Pre-Holocene rivers. Some of the ancient channel forms are traces of the overflow of water across the watershed rapids.

TI  - Comparison of In Situ and Remote-Sensing Methods to Determine Turbidity and Concentration of Suspended Matter in the Estuary Zone of the Mzymta River, Black Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of a comparison of water turbidity and suspended particulate matter concentration (SPM) obtained from quasi-synchronous in situ and satellite remote-sensing data. Field measurements from a small boat were performed in April and May 2019, in the northeastern part of the Black Sea, in the mouth area of the Mzymta River. The measuring instruments and methods included a turbidity sensor mounted on a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth), probe, a portable turbidimeter, water sampling for further laboratory analysis and collecting meteorological information from boat and ground-based weather stations. Remote-sensing methods included turbidity and SPM estimation using the C2RCC (Case 2 Regional Coast Color) and Atmospheric correction for OLI 'lite' (ACOLITE) ACOLITE processors that were run on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/2B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data. The highest correlation between the satellite SPM and the water sampling SPM for the study area in conditions of spring flooding was achieved using C2RCC, but only for measurements undertaken almost synchronously with satellite imaging because of the high mobility of the Mzymta plume. Within the few hours when all the stations were completed, its boundary could shift considerably. The ACOLITE algorithms overestimated by 1.5 times the water sampling SPM in the low value range up to 15 g/m(3). For SPM over 20-25 g/m(3), a high correlation was observed both with the in situ measurements and the C2RCC results. It was demonstrated that quantitative turbidity and SPM values retrieved from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A/2B MSI data can adequately reflect the real situation even using standard retrieval algorithms, not regional ones, provided the best suited algorithm is selected for the study region.

T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this research is the concept of Laughter in Russian emigre literature. The particular aim of this article is to analyse this concept in the memoirs of Nadezhda Teffi, one of the writers from the first wave of Russian emigration. The subject of this analysis is the lexis taken from the volumes Memoirs (1933) and My Chronicle (2015). The analysis focuses on distinguishing the semantic structure of the concept of Laughter, and the ways of its linguistic expression in the literary text. During the process of analysis, we refer to the methodology proposed by Josif Stemin which made it possible to distinguish, in the structure of concepts, various mental units of the author's image of the world as verbalised in literary texts (objective and individual-author meanings and images). Moreover, this study uses a descriptive method and a functional and stylistic analysis. Based on the linguistic analysis carried out, we conclude that the concept of Laughter is widely represented in Teffi's memoirs. The individual-author's meanings representing the periphery of the concept analysed have a different connotation. The feelings and emotions expressed through laughter in the depicted world are positive, negative and neutral. The frequency of use of the lexical units, and the variety of their updating, prove that the concept of Laughter has an important place in Teffi's linguistic worldview.

TI  - Cross-Bands Information Transfer to Offset Ambiguities and Atmospheric Phenomena for Multispectral Data Visualization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visualization of multispectral images through band selection methods determines an information loss that in utmost cases proves to be critical for the adequate understanding of the represented scene. The R-G-B representation obtained by mapping the visual bands to the R, G, and B channels is highly used due to its great resemblance with the natural color one and aspects perceivable by the human eye. However, despite the similarity in terms of color code, ambiguities between classes such as water and vegetation or atmospheric phenomena like fog, clouds, and smoke that have been penetrated by other bands, remain visible and hinder the process of visualization of the Earth surface. This article presents a set of five different methods to offset the effects caused by ambiguities, fog, light clouds, and smoke by transferring relevant information between bands in order to visually reconstitute those parts of the image affected by atmospheric phenomena. The general concept shared by these methods implies a stacked autoencoder that successfully encompasses the information from all spectral bands into a latent representation used for visualization. Each proposed method is defined by different combination of input and error function formula. Spectral and polar coordinates features represent the possible options for the input, while formulas based on mean squared error or angular spectral distances determine the potential choices in terms of error function definition. The property of angular spectral distance and polar coordinates transformation to obtain illuminant invariant features determined their use in three out of five methods. We evaluate the methods through spectral signature graphical comparison and visual comparison related to the R-G-B representation. We conduct experiments on multiple Sentinel 2 full images.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides, has experienced severe declines in recent years in part due to the effects of changing climate and extreme drought. This study set out to investigate these effects by assessing associations of climatic, edaphic and topographic variables with physiological drought stress in aspen. The study took place on the Zumwalt Prairie in northeastern Oregon, a semi-arid bunchgrass prairie where aspen occur in isolated stands associated with riparian areas and late-season persistence of snow drifts. Using a 33-year time series of Landsat imagery to detect associations of aspen stands late-season snow cover and field measurements of soil moisture in aspen stands during 2017, we found while snow dominated stands were associated with greater soil moisture during spring, levels had equilibrated to those of other upland stands by summer. Measurements of predawn and midday stem Psi in multiple height classes of aspen ramets revealed associations of both shallow soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit with physiological drought stress in aspen. Analysis of soil texture class revealed an important association with midday stem Psi, with finer textured soils associated with decreased stem Psi in comparison to coarser textured soils. While neither topographical characteristics nor snow cover were found to be important drivers of drought stress, topographical curvature was found to have a strong influence on summer soil moisture in upland stands. These findings contribute to our understanding of aspen physiology, drought ecology and landscape hydrology toward the xeric margin of aspen's range. This information can help land managers anticipate and adapt to changing climates and understand their effects on key plant species such as aspen.

AB  - Thee study is devoted to the analysis of the correlation of the confessional element with the ethnic element within the construction of "ethnoconfession" for the Catholic Germans of Siberia. Thee relevance of the study of the topic is dictated by the modern processes of ethnic and confessional identification/self-identification that have replaced globalization. Notably, due to the multi-ethnic and multi-confessional nature of the Siberian population, a peculiar and unique concept of the frontier has developed, determined by historians as the "Siberian frontier". Thee temporal boundaries of the study include the twentieth century: from the moment of mass migrations from the Crimea, the Volga region and Ukraine to the Trans-Urals in the context of the Stolypin agrarian reform to the beginning of the active return movement of Russian Germans to Germany. Thee methodological basis of the study was the work of both ethnographers and sociologists. Thee content analysis method revealed the peculiarities of the mentality of representatives of various confessional groups within the German ethnic group. Thee research is based on the materials of the Russian State Historical Archive. Thee conclusions about the importance of confessional self-awareness are important for the self-identification and successful socialization of Russian Germans. Thee article is intended for specialists in the field of history and ethnography of Russian Germans, as well as for researchers interested in the features of frontier communications in Siberia.

AB  - Background: Lymph node status has a prognostic role in endometrial cancer patients and it determines the adjuvant therapy to be administered postoperatively. Complete lymphadenectomy carries the risk of serious complications. Sentinel Lymph Node mapping (SLN) may be a good option to reduce these complications. Cervical injection of methylene blue may be a suitable technique for SLN mapping, which can be applied in low-resource institutes.Objective: Assessment of the detection rate, sensitivity and false negative rate of SLN mapping using cervical injection of methylene blueMethods: A total of 76 patients with early stage endometrial cancer were included. Methylene blue was injected into the cervix prior to surgery and open surgical approach was used. SLNs were de-tected by direct visualization of stained lymph nodes after opening of pelvic spaces. SLNs were excised and pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed when indicated and surgically feasible. Specimens were examined by H&E staining.Results: The SLN detection rate was 47.4% and all detected SLNs were pelvic nodes. All patients with lymph node metastasis had metastatic disease in their SLNs. The technique had 100% sensitiv-ity, 100% negative predictive value and a 0% false-negative rate. An inverse relationship between SLN detection and BMI was detected.Conclusion: Cervical injection of methylene blue dye with an open approach to detect SLNs in patients with early stage endometrial cancer has a low detection rate. The most important factor associated with failed mapping is increased BMI. Further trials are needed to investigate the useful-ness of this technique.

TI  - Satellite altimetry over small reservoirs in the Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northeast Brazil is one of the most populated semiarid regions in the world. The region is highly dependent on reservoirs for human water supply, irrigation, industry, and livestock. The objective of this study was to validate water level time series from the satellites Envisat, SARAL, Sentinel-3A/-3B, Jason-2/-3 in small reservoirs in Northeast Brazil. In total, we evaluated the water level time series of 20 reservoirs. The Sentinel-3B outperforms the other altimeters with a maximum RMSE of 0.21 m. In seven reservoirs with updated depth-area-volume curves, the altimetric water level was used to calculate the corresponding volume. The obtained volume was then compared to the volume given by the same curve by using in situ stage. Our investigations showed that, in the case of small reservoirs, the precision of water level time series derived from satellite altimetry is mainly governed by the seasonal variability of the water storage especially at the end of the 2012-2017 drought period.

TI  - Game Essence of Alternative Reality: Methodological, Philosophical and Culturological Aspects
T2  - AGATHOS-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fake news is seen as creating a parallel reality by the media. The spread of fake news is associated with the worldview transformation of society, where truth has ceased to be a harmonious whole. Fake news in the context of an alternative reality presupposes unconditional faith in the information presented to people, which is typical for games. The authors of this study came to the conclusion that the playful nature of fake news explains the accompanying phenomena of this issue: the non-critical perception of information, the unwillingness of the media to suppress fake news, and the involvement of a large number of people in this process.

AB  - At the Siberian lidar station, long-term measurements of the ozone vertical distribution are continued at the sensing wavelength pairs of 299 and 341 nm, 308 and 353 nm. The report presents a quasi-three-year seasonal model of vertical ozone profiles formed in recent years, obtained using the differential absorption lidar complex of the Siberian lidar station and the Aura, MetOp satellites in the upper troposphere - stratosphere. A typical seasonal feature of the vertical ozone distribution in Western Siberia is presented. The ozone profiles were retrieved using the vertical temperature distribution from the meteorological satellite data. We analyzed how the existing sets of absorption cross sections influence the deviation of the ozone profiles, retrieved with their application, from the Krueger model and the quasi-three-year model. Since 2021, measurements have been performed at the lidar station with different spatial resolutions from 10 m to 100 m. An analysis and estimation of how different spatial resolutions influence the error of retrieving ozone profile from lidar and satellite measurements in 2021 was conducted.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Sharpening Using a Single Unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network With MTF-Based Degradation Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation provides multispectral images at 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m resolution bands. Obtaining all bands at 10 m resolution would benefit many applications. Recently, many model-based and deep learning (DL)-based sharpening methods have been proposed. However, the downside of those methods is that the DL-based methods need to be trained separately for the 20 m and the 60 m bands in a supervised manner at reduced resolution, while the model-based methods heavily depend on the hand-crafted image priors. To break the gap, this article proposes a novel unsupervised DL-based S2 sharpening method using a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to sharpen the 20 and 60 m bands at the same time at full resolution. The proposed method replaces the hand-crafted image prior by the deep image prior (DIP) provided by a CNN structure whose parameters are easily optimized using a DL optimizer. We also incorporate the modulation transfer function-based degradation model as a network layer, and add all bands to both network input and output. This setting improves the DIP and exploits the advantage of multitask learning since all S2 bands are highly correlated. Extensive experiments with real S2 data show that our proposed method outperforms competitive methods for reduced-resolution evaluation and yields very high quality sharpened image for full-resolution evaluation.

TI  - Predicting Future Urban Flood Risk Using Land Change and Hydraulic Modeling in a River Watershed in the Central Province of Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood risk is a significant challenge for sustainable spatial planning, particularly concerning climate change and urbanization. Phrasing suitable land planning strategies requires assessing future flood risk and predicting the impact of urban sprawl. This study aims to develop an innovative approach combining land use change and hydraulic models to explore future urban flood risk, aiming to reduce it under different vulnerability and exposure scenarios. SPOT-3 and Sentinel-2 images were processed and classified to create land cover maps for 1995 and 2019, and these were used to predict the 2040 land cover using the Land Change Modeler Module of Terrset. Flood risk was computed by combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability using hydrodynamic modeling and the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. We have compared flood risk in 1995, 2019, and 2040. Although flood risk increases with urbanization, population density, and the number of hospitals in the flood plain, especially in the coastal region, the area exposed to high and very high risks decreases due to a reduction in poverty rate. This study can provide a theoretical framework supporting climate change related to risk assessment in other metropolitan regions. Methodologically, it underlines the importance of using satellite imagery and the continuity of data in the planning-related decision-making process.

AB  - The current study used a combination of Sentinel-1A (SE-1A) radar and Sentinel-2A (SE-2A) optical images in mapping land use/land cover (LULC) in Dak Nong province in 2018. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to digitally categorize Landsat images into LULC maps according to ten different LULC classes included: evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, deciduous forest, plantation, rubber, industrial plants, crop land, residential area, water surface and others. The results indicated an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 81.40%, Kappa = 0.79, respectively. Based on the results of classified image, a 2018 LULC map of the study area was simulated. Accordingly, the natural forests account for 34.27% of the total area of the province, distributed scattered in districts. In which, the evergreen forest occupies the highest area with more than 166.600 ha, equivalent to 74.54% of the total natural forest area, and concentrated in the high mountain areas. Non-forest covers occupy more than 63% area of Dak Nong province. The industrial and agricultural cropland indicated a high area in the study area with a rate of 34.82% and 11.38%, respectively. This shows a strong development in the scale of industrial and agricultural crops in the study area. The objective information on current land use/land cover in this study can serve as the basis for policymakers to orient the local forest resource sustainability strategies. Besides, the study also shows that the use of a combination of Sentinel-1A radar and Sentinel-2A optical image to classify and construct the LU/LC map is a high-efficiency research direction.

TI  - Estimate tropical forest stand volume using SPOT 5 Satellite Image
T2  - ENVIRONMENT, RESOURCES, AND EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Environment, Resources and Earth Sciences (ICERES)
CL  - Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM
AB  - This study tested solutions aiming to improve the estimates of tropical forest stand volume (SV) for the large area using SPOT 5 data and field data. Firstly, forests were stratified into four forest strata using a hybrid classification of ISODATA (Iterative Self - Organization Data Analysis) unsupervised, and Maximum likelihood supervised (MLC) based on SPOT 5 image and field data. A set of 111 sample plots was distributed in these four forest strata, which represented disturbed forests under different levels by human-induced. Within the sample plots, diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) were measured to calculate standing volume using the SV equation from the previous study for the area. The method of k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) was applied to estimate the stand volume for different datasets of SPOT 5 bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and combination of SPOT 5 bands and NDVI. The estimates were separately tested for the whole area and each forest stratum. Leave one out cross-validation method was employed to validate the quality of the predictions. The results indicated the accuracy of the estimate was significantly improved when applying for each stratum comparing to for the whole area with both SPOT 5 and NDVI data. The lower errors were found in the forest strata that are fewer disturbances than the heavily degraded stratum. Among the image data, the estimates were based on the NDVI give a lower accuracy compared to others.

AB  - Forest stand volume is one of the important variables to assess forest management. In this study, the integration of Sentinel-2A images and forest field data was used to estimate the forest volume for separate stratum and for the entire area of the study area. Accordingly, the forest area was divided into relative homogeneous strata as dense forests and open forests. A total of 202 sample plots were placed throughout the forest strata to measure relevant variables such as diameter at breast height and tree height. Spectral bands and vegetation indices within the plot were also extracted to correlate with forest stand volume. The predictions were separately tested for the entire area and for each forest stratum. The result indicated 8 out of 21 predictor variables (spectral and vegetation indices) were selected as optimal variables to build the estimate models. The results show that when separable stratum prediction is used instead of entire area estimation, the accuracy of estimates is more likely to be improved, especially with the forest stand under low disturbance. The accuracy of open forest was also found higher dense forest.

CP  - International Conference on Environment, Resources and Earth Sciences (ICERES)
CL  - Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM
AB  - Different spatial resolutions of optical satellite imagery provide different details in land use/land cover (LULC) mapping. Therefore, it is essential to decide the appropriate classification system for specific spatial resolution. This study used the same classification system to extract land use/land cover for District 2 and District7 of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2018 from two different spatial resolutions, Sentinel-2 (10 m) and VNREDSat-1 (2.5 m), images. Using the same set of ground truth data, the accuracy of the classified maps was assessed to select the right image for the study area corresponding to the given classification system. The outcomes revealed that both optical satellite images produced high overall accuracy (83% for Sentinel-2 images and 86% for VNREDSat-1 images) on the same classification system. It is easier to classify the cropland, grassland, roads, and industrial zones with VNREDSat-1 image whereas perennials, bare land, and aquaculture were easily classified with Sentinel-2 due to their homogeneity at a lower spatial resolution. This shows the importance of choosing the right spatial resolution following the requirements of the classification system.

TI  - Random Region Matting for the High-Resolution PolSAR Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery can provide more intuitive and detailed SAR polarization information, and it is widely used in the classification and semantic segmentation of remote sensing. To bridge the PolSAR data and application, the 2020 Gaofen Challenge on Automated High-Resolution Earth Observation Image Interpretation provides a set of high-quality PolSAR semantic segmentation dataset. A series of preprocessing methods is first used to analyze the PolSAR images to improve the semantic segmentation performance of the PolSAR imagery. A special polarimetric decomposition method is used to extract the features, and the filter and the data truncation are implemented to enhance local and global information of images. And the random region matting method is proposed to expand the training samples. Finally, the DeepLabV3+ method with the ResNet101-V2 is employed to achieve the semantic segmentation. A variety of comparison experiments verifies the effectiveness of our methods. Simultaneously, compared with the classification methods of other groups in the competition, our methods have obvious advantages in the inference time and semantic segmentation accuracy. The proposed method achieved a frequency weighted intersection over union of 75.29% in the contest.

TI  - Compact Global-Local Convolutional Network With Multifeature Fusion and Learning for Scene Classification in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature learning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has gained considerable attention and achieved good performance on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image scene classification. However, the performance of the existing convolutional feature learning methods is limited for generating the distinguishable feature representations because such techniques inherently suffer from shortcomings, i.e., they do not consider the local feature distribution of deep orderless feature statistics and deep orderless multifeature learning style. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a compact global-local convolutional network with multifeature fusion and learning (CGML) for SAR image scene classification, which contains double branches of convolutional feature learning net (C-net) and local feature distribution learning net (L-net). L-net employs the localized and parameterized affine subspace coding layer for local feature distribution learning and captures the feature statistics of each cluster center via detailed local feature division. The standard convolutional feature map is utilized for the convolutional feature learning in C-net. Subsequently, the compact multifeature fusion and learning strategy captures the compact global second-order orderless feature representation and allows the double branches to interact with each other via the tensor sketch algorithm. Especially, the feature learning strategy of L-net is defined in affine subspace which fully characterizes the feature distribution inside each cluster space. Finally, we concatenate the outputs of the multifeature fusion and learning network, then pool and feed them into softmax loss. Based on extensive evaluations on TerraSAR-X1 and TerraSAR-X2 image scene classification datasets, CGML can yield superior performances when compared with those of several state-of-the-art networks.

AB  - The Tianwan nuclear power plant is located in Jiangsu province of China. It discharges warm water from its cooling system into the Yellow Sea, which is bound to have ecological consequences. Herein, the changes in sea surface temperature (SST) after the operation of the Tianwan nuclear power plant were studied using Landsat data. First, the SST near the Tianwan nuclear power plant was estimated using a single-channel algorithm; subsequently, the datum temperature was extracted. Second, the area of thermal discharge was calculated. Finally, the thermal discharge was continuously monitored and analyzed, together with the overall trend of thermal discharge, its seasonal distribution characteristics, and the relationship between temperature rise and the impact of thermal discharge on the marine environment. Furthermore, there was no evident temperature pollution before the nuclear power plant was put into operation in May 2007; however, after the operation of the nuclear power plant, the thermally polluted area clearly expanded. An expansion of 66.77 km(2) was observed from 2001 to 2020 for areas experiencing higher temperatures. The largest thermally polluted area is observed in spring, followed by those in summer, winter, and autumn. In 2018, the temperature rise area in winter is 44.82 km(2) larger than that in autumn. The rise in SST at the Tianwan nuclear power plant meets the national quality standards for marine environments, and does not pollute the surrounding environment.

AB  - The Vegetation Optimality Model along a precipitation gradient: influence of carbon costs and benefits on vegetation properties Ecological and hydrological processes are strongly interlinked by vegetation and its properties. Models often use static values for vegetation properties, that are in reality highly dynamic, or prescribe vegetation properties based on remotely sensed data. The Vegetation Optimality Model (VOM, Schymanski et al., 2009) optimizes vegetation properties in order the maximize the Net Carbon Profit, i.e. the difference between the total carbon taken up by photosynthesis and all the carbon costs of the plants. The VOM schematizes perennial trees and seasonal grasses each as a single big leaf with an associated root system, and optimizes rooting depths, foliage cover, photosynthetic capacity and water use strategies. More details of the model can be found online (https://vom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In this repository, the Vegetation Optimality Model is applied along the North-Australian Tropical Transect (NATT). The NATT consists of five study sites with an increasing rainfall amount from North to South. Long-term data on evaporation and CO2-measurements are available at these sites, which are used to validate the modelling results. In this study, we hypothesize that: - The optimality-based model is not substantially worse at capturing the seasonal amplitudes and mean annual values of observed carbon and water fluxes than conventional models analyzed by Whitley et al. (2016) along the NATT. - The plant hydraulic system has carbon costs that only depend on the plant size, represented by root depth and vegetation cover, and a constant independent of species and climate (i.e. the water transport cost parameter). - The optimality-based dynamic vegetation cover, as a result of maximizing NCP, reproduces the carbon and water fluxes better than a prescribed mean seasonal phenology in the VOM, derived from remote sensing data. - The optimality-based constant rooting depth at each site, as a result of maximizing NCP, reproduces the carbon and water fluxes better than a prescribed homogenous rooting depth across all sites in the VOM.

TI  - FEMALE NAMES ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE SAKHA REPUBLIC (YAKUTIA)
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oikonyms derived from female names make the subject of the research. The issue has not been studied earlier since female names are rare in the names of settlements in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). The small amount of such oikonyms is due to the social inequality of women compared to men in the past. The linguoculturological analysis of geographical names showed that a special status of women in the North was manifested in the fact that she was perceived not only as a home keeper and some sort of national customs' translator, but also as a strong personality capable of overcoming any difficulties and being equal to a man. The toponymic system is one of the most significant in the language of each nation, since it encodes the information about a person's perception of the surrounding space and society, which are the most important components of the worldview.

TI  - THE ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY "RUSSIAN LANGUAGE" AND THE HISTORY OF ITS PUBLICATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF PHILOLOGICAL CRITICISM
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the new edition of the encyclopedia "The Russian Language" of the point of view of the traditional Russian lexicography and terminology. The article mentions the continuity of the compilation of dictionaries of linguistic concepts, starting with the first "Grammatical Dictionary" by N. N. Durnovo. It is noted that the book under analysis differs from the previous encyclopedias, typical by genre. Attention is drawn to the role of extralinguistic factors, and above all ideology, in the formation of the system of scientific views in the Soviet era. The achieve this goal, the following methods are used: historical-linguistic, comparative, contextual, method of critical analysis, sociolinguistic method. They allowed the author to identify and characterize the most informative and valuable dictionary entries, compare them with previous editions of the encyclopedia " The Russian Language", point out the strengths and weaknesses in the preparation of terminological material, note the urgency of new approaches in the lexicographic description of the language system. The article dwells on the concepts of the encyclopedia and the dictionary in detail. said the author speaks about the innovative nature of some elements of the book. It is stressed that the updated image of the language in the linguistic terminology and discourse of philological science of the 21st century was presented at the right time. Emphasis is placed on the unconventionality of the entires on the history of the Russian language and the depth of analytical description of parts of speech and grammatical categories in diachrony. Considerable attention is paid to the critical assessment of essays on the personalities of Russian linguists. The author of the article criticizes the inconsistency of the editorial choice of surnames, the lack of completeness of the entries and insufficient bibliographic support. The author points out obvious omissions of well-known names and inaccuracies in the description. The author argues that the concept of a terminological dictionary is anthropocentric, and that the dictionary is an independent object of research from the point of view of philological criticism of scientific knowledge. The author suggests concrete ideas to improve the structure and content of the publication. The urgency of the encyclopedia for the study and generalization of information about the metalanguage of science is emphasized. The results of the analysis can be used in the theory and practice of lexicography, in terminology, in the theory of methods of language teaching as a system of concepts that forms the philologist's worldview.

TI  - A. I. SOLZHENITSYN'S "RUSSIAN DICTIONARY OF LANGUAGE EXPANSION" AS A LEXICOGRAPHICAL EXPERIMENT
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the concept of the "Russian Dctionary of Language Expansion" by A. I. Solzhenitsyn in line with the national lexicographic tradition. The article emphasizes the author's continuity in the compilation of thesauruses as sources for enriching speech with obsolete words and expressions that have come out of regular communicative practice. It notes the role of V. I. Dahl as the author of the first dictionary of "The Living Great Russian Language" and his influence on the basic idea of the book by Solzhenitsyn, who inherited the classical principles of philological work with language as a phenomenon of national culture. Attention is drawn to the role of extralinguistic factors in the preparation of this publication. The study employs the following methods: comparative, semantic, sociolinguistic and textual. They have made it possible to identify the idiosyncrasies of Solzhenitsyn as a linguist, to show the originality of the method of selection and characteristics of vocabulary units, to characterize the features of the genre of the author's lexicography works and to determine its role in linguistic science of the late 20th - early 21st centuries. The article analyzes the conceptual features of this publication: the composition and structure of the dictionary borrowed from the 19th century, the need to supplement and revive it with folk-figurative, occasional and literary elements from the heritage of Russian poets and writers of the 19th 20th century, the concise character of the description of meanings, the presence of swear words, etc. Fragments Solzhenitsyn's letters are used for contextual comparison. The article formulates idea about the need to treat the visual and expressive side of the language carefully and to restore and preserve the lost fragments of everyday speech of the past as facts of traditional verbal culture. The urgency of the book is seen in it being a successful experience of metaphilological understanding and restoration of classical linguistic works. The results of the study can be used in the theory and practice of compiling experimental dictionaries, in hermeneutics, in the historico-cultural study of the lexicographic heritage of the 19th - 20th centuries. They can motivate scholars to search for new ideas and methods of analyzing texts presenting interest for the formation of the basic values of the national linguistic worldview.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to reparametrize the OVATION Prime (2010) empirical auroral precipitation model using the Russian polar cap index ( PC index) is considered. For this purpose, the integrated auroral power of particle precipitation obtained from the Polar satellite data for the period from December 1996 to June 1998 is compared with the PC index and the Newell's coupling function. The analysis revealed that the PC index at the time delays up to 5-20 minutes correlates with the magnitude of auroral power much better (the correlation coefficient R similar to 0.76-0.87) than the Newell's coupling function (R similar to 0.46-0.82). Thus, for the purpose of nowcasting the zone of active particle precipitation, the PC index showed much higher scores, although the predicting abilities of the Newell's coupling function for the time delays of more than 20 minutes remain the best.

TI  - A Picture of the World in the Spiritual Odes by Mikhail Lomonosov
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The research is based on the analysis of Mikhail Lomonosov's poetic works, which he himself designated as the general genre of `Spiritual Odes.' In the beginning of the work, the authors reveal the differences in the interpretation of the "benefits of sciences" by the great Russian poet and scientist and his European predecessors (Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes). The originality of Lomonosov's response to this question becomes evident when compared with the prior assessments that had emerged in the Russian literary discourse. All these differences are explained by the conceptually new solutions offered by Mikhail Lomonosov in the world modeling process. A detailed analysis of his spiritual odes from the viewpoint of the spatial organization of their artistic world indicates the emergence of a completely new subjective position, which is absent in the works of both his literary predecessors and contemporaries (Vasiliy Trediakovskiy, Alexander Sumarokov). This is the position of a scientist, the emergence of which leads to significant adjustments to the artistic description of the spatial positions of God and man (an ordinary "mortal"). This results in a radical change of the artistic view of the world itself, presented in Mikhail Lomonosov's spiritual odes. This event is considered to be one of the most important in the Russian literary history of the 18th century.

TI  - Analysis of Epithelial Cell Responses to Microbial Pathogens
T2  - HOST-FUNGAL INTERACTIONS: Methods and Protocols
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The epithelial cell is usually the first host cell that interacts with the microbiota present at mucosal surfaces. Although initially thought of as "bystander" cells with barrier function, the epithelial cell is now known to be a sentinel cell in the recognition and discrimination of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms and a key cell in initiating subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, we describe the main assays utilized in analyzing the activation of epithelial cell signaling (western blotting), transcription factors (TransAm), gene expression (quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)), cytokine responses (ELISA, Luminex), and damage induction (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release). While our laboratory focuses on the epithelial response to Candida pathogens, these assays can be applied universally to analyze the activation of epithelial cells in response to any microbial pathogen.

TI  - Encyclopedias as tools of modernization: Stalinist versions of agrarian knowledge
T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers directions of the agrarian modernization as presented in the four editions of the Soviet agricultural encyclopedia from the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s. On the basis of some historical examples and theoretical concepts, the author explains the scientific, ideological and political significance of encyclopedias in the formation of social knowledge and ideology; shows how during the Stalinist period, the Soviet agricultural encyclopedias passed through several successive 'great leaps' in the representation of agrarian knowledge under the accelerated Soviet modernization; stresses the manipulative way of managing agrarian knowledge and human capital in agriculture - on behalf of the leader and ruling party. The article describes the transition from the first Soviet encyclopedia of the 1920s, which focused on the modernization of peasant Russia, to the encyclopedia of the early 1930s, which denied the importance of the peasantry and praised the projects of large-scale industrial-agricultural production; many authors of the first peasant encyclopedia were repressed. The encyclopedia of the late 1930s reflects the fight against the authors of the previous encyclopedia of the 'great leap' and the purges in the name of the ideology of the planning-management approach in the further modernization of Soviet agriculture. The encyclopedia of the late 1940s - early 1950s reflects the victory of the technocratic-bureaucratic worldview and personnel approach to the agrarian sphere, which prevailed in the agriculture of the USSR until the very end of the Soviet era. The author focuses on the influence of the subjective factor (political leaders, editors-in-chief and anonymous authors) on the ideology, topics and style of encyclopedic articles. In conclusion, the author notes that the strong ideological control and volatile political situation distorted knowledge in the Soviet agrarian encyclopedias, which negatively affected the quality of rural human capital and largely predetermined the stagnation of rural development in the late USSR.

AB  - In this research, we carried out the analysis of long-term continuous ground deformation (subsidence or uplift) based on C-band Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR). This technique is employed to investigate ground deformation of the Yokohama and Miura cities of Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. The observation was starting from October 28th, 2017 to May 3rd, 2019. The study data used Sentinel1 C-band data provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). The results of the research show that the maximum subsidence velocity of ground deformation was 5.89 cm/year, and the maximum uplift velocity was 8.36 cm/year in Yokohama city. Also, in Miura city, the maximum subsidence velocity of the ground deformation was 4.5 cm/year, and the maximum uplift velocity was 11.4 cm/year. In both cities, satellite SAR analysis results have the same tendency with each GNSS control point, and the difference of the subsidence was within approximately 0.5 cm. This result shows the analysis data of DInSAR was almost equal compare to the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data by Geographical Survey Institute (GSI). This research shows the capability of the DInSAR technique to investigate long-term continuous ground surface conditions over a wide area with high accuracy in association with the occurrence of heavy rains and typhoons.

AB  - This study focused on the a 20-year evaluation of the dynamism of critical thermal anomalies in Busan metropolitan area prompted by unusual infrastructural development and demographic growth rate.Archived Landsat thermal data derived-LST was the major input for UTFVI and hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*). Results revealed that the surface urban heat island-affected area has gradually expanded overtime from 23.32% to 32.36%; while the critical positive thermal anomalies (level-3 hotspots) have also spatially increased from 19.88% in 2000 to 23.56% in 2020, recording a net LST difference of > 5Â°C between the maximum level-3 hotspot and minimum level-3 coldspot each year. It is been observed that thermal conditions of Busan have gradually deteriorated with time, which is potentially inherent in the rate of urban expansion. Thus, this work serves as an eye-opener to powers that be, to think and act constructively towards a sustainable thermal conform for city dwellers.

AB  - Slag consists mostly of mixed oxides of elements such as silicon, and recycled slag may be used for cultivating. The relationship between slag fertilization and plant growth rate can be expected to change depending on the volume of slag applied. Quantifying the chlorophyll content, an effective indicator of disease as well as nutritional and environmental stresses on plants, will enable optimal slag fertilization and then monitoring chlorophyll content using field measurements would enable the determination of optimal slag fertilization rates. In this study, radish plants (Raphanus sativus L), which belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is popular root vegetable in both tropical and temperate regions, were cultivated with slag fertilization and the potential use of hyperspectral reflectance was evaluated. Some preprocessing techniques were effective for retrieving chlorophyll contents in radish leaves from hyperspectral reflectance and then the regression model based on random forest and continuum-removed reflectance had the highest performance with a root mean square error of 5.141 mu g cm(-2) and RPD values of 1.858 for the test data set.

AB  - A magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Kumamoto region of Japan in April 2016. The earthquake caused extensive building damage in the Mashiki-town. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an effective tool for assessing building damage. The author has analyzed the damage immediately after the earthquake using the coherence of PALSAR-2 onboard ALOS-2. The results showed that the damage in Mashiki-town was larger than that in Kumamoto City. The purpose of this study is to monitor the status of damaged area using the coherence generated from the pair of images after the earthquake. The coherence analysis was conducted both pairs of ascending and descending. The results quantitatively show that the coherence is lower in Mashiki-town than in Kumamoto City even after the earthquake.

TI  - The Genre Aspect of Ambrose Bierce's Military Prose
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the early prose of Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914?), one of the most distinctive American writers of the second half of the 19th century, journalist and the Civil War veteran. The aim of this work is to reveal the genre features of the writer's war stories. The research is based on the collection "Tales of Soldiers and Civilians", published in 1891. In Bierce's military prose, the author discloses the features typical of a short story. The problem of differentiating between small forms, such as novella, story, short story, etc., is also discussed. The elements of a parable in the writer's works are studied, revealing the main attributes of parable, as well as the features of its modern variety. The detailed research of the two plans of meaning that interacts on the level of characters' system is made. It is established that in Bierce's works, each character represents either the first or the allegorical plan of meaning. Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas (for the first plan characters) and Stoicism (for allegorical characters) are defined as the basis of character's worldview. The analysis shows that Bierce's works belong to the genre of a short story and genetically ascend to a parable. The relevance of this research come from a necessity to examine the genre as a specific issue of the writer's stories. The scientific novelty of the research is to consider the parabolic origin in Bierce's short stories about the Civil War as a meaningful aspect of his prose.

AB  - A three-year experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of Z'Fix on soil physical properties and crop status. Z'Fix is an agent recommended as an addition to animal bedding to prolong its function and to lower ammonia emissions in stables. Concurrently, a positive effect on organic matter transformation in resulting manure is claimed. The experiment involved control, farmyard manure (FYM), and farmyard manure with Z'Fix (FYM_ZF) as variants. In-field sampling was conducted for cone index, water infiltration and implement a unit draft, where the latter two showed significant differences in favour of FYM_ZF. Also, concerning crop yields, FYM_ZF consistently attained the highest values, followed by FYM throughout all three seasons. Furthermore, remotely sensed data were analysed to describe crop status via normalised difference vegetation index where significant differences were found across all variants. Based on the study, FYM_ZF demonstrated positive effects both on soil properties and crop conditions.

AB  - Major problems related to mapping activities in developing countries is lack and out of date spatial data. Although, spatial data is paramount important as a basis for decision-making. The same case occurs at Merapi volcano which often requires urgent decisions by local authorities based on spatial data of geological disasters. This study aims to build spatiotemporal data of pyroclastic deposits, and to determine the direction and the extent of pyroclastic deposits as well. The methodologies were focused on image interpretation, virtual fieldwork, and accuracy assessment. The preprocessing of remote sensing images included a radiometric correction and image sharpening. Radiometric correction was implemented to convert the original image value to the Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance value. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fieldwork could not be conducted, hence we replaced it using virtual fieldwork in order to classify objects on Landsat satellite imagery manually. After the virtual fieldwork, we analyzed the direction and the area of pyroclastic deposits in order to produce a map of pyroclastic deposits of Merapi Volcano. The result indicates that the pyroclastic deposits of the Merapi Volcano in 2011 were spread to the southeast, west and north. While in 2020, the deposits were directed to the west. The sediment area is 39.935.176 m(2) in 2011 and 7.772.015 m(2) in 2020. The result can be used to support decision-making by authorities and stakeholders in this volcanic area.

AB  - Quick and accurate landslide mapping is crucial for emergency response, disaster mitigation, and increasing the understanding of landslide events. Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.

AB  - This dataset presents multi-temporal glacier photography from the Rupal Valley, south of Nanga Parbat in the north-western Himalaya. The elevation of viewpoints of re-photographic surveys ranges between 2940 and 5370 m a.s.l. The research is based on the hypothesis that repeat photography of these mountain glaciers allows for a longer monitoring period than remote sensing data as historical metric photographs from the years 1934, 1958, and 1987 are available. All relevant historical photographs showing glacier aspects taken during scientific expeditions have been collected from archives and repeated from the same viewpoints during several surveys between 1992 and 2010. Prints of the selected photographs were taken to the field in order to identify the exact viewpoints. The camera was always mounted on a tripod for careful selection of the view angle and frame. This multi-temporal dataset allows for a detailed visual assessment of glacier fluctuations, changes in glacier snout positions, ice volumes, and debris cover over a period of seven to eight decades. It offers insights for a better understanding of glacier changes in this prominent Himalayan mountain region and can serve as a baseline for further studies. The dataset provides baseline data for a recently published article (Nusser and Schmidt, 2021) with original archival material and replicated glacier photography.Publication:Nusser, M., Schmidt, S. 2021.

T2  - IADIS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification has recently become a field of interest in the remote sensing (RS) community. However, such data contain multidimensional dynamic features that make it difficult for precise identification. Also, it covers structurally nonlinear affinity within the gathered spectral bands and the related materials. To systematically facilitate the HSI categorization, we propose a spectral-spatial classification of HSI data using a 3D-2D convolutional neural network and inception network to extract and learn the in-depth spectral-spatial feature vectors. We first applied the principal component analysis (PCA) on the entire HSI image to reduce the original space dimensionality. Second, the exploitation of the spatial hyperspectral input features contiguous information by 2-D CNN. Besides, we used 3-D CNN without relying on any preprocessing to extract deep spectral-spatial fused features efficiently. The learned spectral-spatial characteristics are concatenated and fed to the inception network layer for joint spectral-spatial learning. Furthermore, we learned and achieved the correct classification with a softmax regression classifier. Finally, we evaluated our model performance on different training set sizes of two hyperspectral remote sensing data sets (HSRSI), namely Botswana (BT) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and compared the experimental results with deep learning-based and state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification methods. The experiment results show that our model provides competitive classification results with state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the considerable potential for HSRSI classification.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The detection of clouds in satellite images is an essential preprocessing task for big data in remote sensing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly advanced the state-of-the-art in the detection of clouds in satellite images, but existing CNN-based methods are costly as they require large amounts of training images with expensive pixel-level cloud labels. To alleviate this cost, we propose Fixed-Point GAN for Cloud Detection (FCD), a weakly-supervised approach. Training with only image-level labels, we learn fixed-point translation between clear and cloudy images, so only clouds are affected during translation. Doing so enables our approach to predict pixel-level cloud labels by translating satellite images to clear ones and setting a threshold to the difference between the two images. Moreover, we propose FCD+, where we exploit the label-noise robustness of CNNs to refine the prediction of FCD, leading to further improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Landsat-8 Biome cloud detection dataset, where we obtain performance close to existing fully-supervised methods that train with expensive pixel-level labels. By fine-tuning our FCD+ with just 1% of the available pixel-level labels, we match the performance of fully-supervised methods. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/jnyborg/fcd.

AB  - This study is a basic study of science textbooks translated and developed by William Baird and his wife Annie Baird, founders of Pyong-yang Soongsil among science textbooks directly influenced by the West. Therefore, we reviewed prior studies related to science textbooks in encountering the modern, and presented the characteristics of Christian science textbooks in the process of transition from radical science to science. The characteristics of science textbooks published in Soongsil, Pyong-yang were found in the Christian worldview that embraced the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin, and analyzed with the curriculum of Union Christian College in Pyong-yang. This study is significant in that it traced the influence of Westerners and analyzed the nature of the textbooks in the formation of new science and education through science textbooks in the modern transition period. Through this, it can be said that it provides a clue to study the relationship between Christianity and science in the future through an interdisciplinary approach.

TI  - Science engagement with faith communities: respecting identity, culture and worldview
T2  - JCOM-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most adults in the U.S. and worldwide claim a religious affiliation. As an element of identity and worldview, faith informs many individuals' views of science, technology, and society at large. Engagement with faith communities and religious leaders about science can improve public perceptions and trust of scientists, advance evidence-based policy, and improve diversity, equity and inclusion in science fields. This commentary outlines examples and suggests guiding principles for science engagement with faith communities.

TI  - Segmental Arterial Mediolysis (SAM) Leading to Chronic Renal Insufficiency
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY AND RENOVASCULAR DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare self-limiting non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vasculopathy. SAM typically affects the visceral arteries of the abdomen to include the celiac, mesenteric, and renal arteries. SAM has a favorable prognosis in most cases with an asymptomatic course but can have mortality rates as high as 50% due to acute aneurysmal rupture. Very few cases of adverse long-term sequelae involving SAM have been described, and this report of chronic kidney disease represents a sentinel case illustrating that chronic disease can and does occur as a result of SAM and should be investigated for at follow-up.Case Presentation: In this case report, we describe a case of a 45-year-old male with erectile dysfunction but without any readily identifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or vasculopathy, who presented with bilateral renal infarction and parenchymal infarcts due to SAM and who subsequently developed CKD at follow-up. We conduct a mini-literature review that discusses the pathogenesis of SAM in the context of vasospastic diseases, as well as compares the outcomes of observation-only, versus medicalmanagement, versus endovascular-interventions in patients with SAM.Conclusion: This is the first case to our knowledge of CKD occurring as an outcome of SAM without any preceding significant comorbidity, highlighting that whereas SAM is of itself rare and typically resolves, chronic disease can linger and should be evaluated for on follow-up. Further, we argue that radiological evidence of precursor vasospastic disease may exist in several locations apart from the index lesion and thus warrants wider whole-body radiographic exploration for lesions as an opportunity to prevent chronic sequelae as illustrated in this case report from occurring. Finally, a review of published case-series suggests that disease progression is less likely to occur after endovascular-intervention compared to observation-only or medical management and the risk of intervention vs conservative management should therefore be discussed with the patient.

TI  - Random Forest Regression Model for Estimation of the Growing Stock Volumes in Georgia, USA, Using Dense Landsat Time Series and FIA Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest volumes are essential as they are directly related to the economic and environmental values of the forests. Satellite-based forest volume estimation was first developed in the 1990s, and the accuracy of the estimation has been improved over time. One of the satellite-based forest volume estimation issues is that it tends to overestimate the large volume class and underestimate the small volume class. Free availability of the major satellite imagery and the development of cloud-based computational platforms facilitate an immense amount of satellite imagery in the estimation. In this paper, we set three objectives: (1) to examine whether the long Landsat time series contributes to the improvement of the estimation accuracy, (2) to explore the effectiveness of forest disturbance record and land cover data as ancillary spatial data on the accuracy of the estimation, and (3) to apply the bias correction method to reduce the bias of the estimation. We computed three Tasseled-cap components from the Landsat data for preparation of short (2014-2016) and long (1984-2016) time series. Each data entity was analyzed with harmonic regressions resulting in the coefficients and the fitted values recorded as pixel values in a multilayer raster database. Data included Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) unit field inventory measurements provided by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the National Land Cover Database and disturbance history data added as ancillary information. The totality of the available data was organized into seven distinct Random Forest (RF) models with different variables compared against each other to identify the ones with the most satisfactory performance. A bias correction method was then applied to all the RF models to examine the effectiveness of the method. Among the seven models, the worst one used the coefficients and fitted values of the short Landsat time series only, and the best one used coefficients and fitted values of both short and long Landsat time series. Using the Out-of-bag (OOB) score, the best model was found to be 34.4% better than the worst one. The model that used only the long time series data had almost the same OOB score as the best model. The results indicate that the use of the long Landsat time series improves model performance. Contrary to the previous research employing forest disturbance data as a feature variable had almost no effect on OOB. The bias correction method reduced the relative size of the bias in the estimates of the best model from 3.79% to -1.47%, the bottom 10% bias by 12.5 points, and the top 10% bias by 9.9 points. Depending on the types of forest, important feature variables were differed, reflecting the relationship between the time series remote sensing data we computed for this research and the forests' phenological characteristics. The availability of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and accessibility of the precise locations of the FIA data are likely to improve the model estimates further.

TI  - Estimating Forest Canopy Height With Multi-Spectral and Multi-Temporal Imagery Using Deep Learning
T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Canopy height is a vital indicator to asses carbon uptake and productivity of forests. However, precise measurements, such as from airborne or spaceborne 3D laser scanning (LiDAR), are expensive and usually cover only small areas. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model that can generate detailed maps of tree canopy heights. In contrast to previous approaches that use a single image as input, we process multi-temporal data via a an adaptation of the popular U-Net architecture that is based on the EfficientNet and 3D convolution operators. To that end, our model receives multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery as input and can predict continuous height maps. As labeled data, we resort to spatially sparse LiDAR data from ICESat-2. Thus, with such a model, one can produce dense canopy height maps given only multi-spectral Landsat data. Our experimental evaluation shows that our our model outperforms existing and improved single-temporal models. To test generalizability, we created a non-overlapping dataset to evaluate our approach and further tested the model performance on out-of-distribution data. The results show that our model can successfully learn drastic changes in distribution.

TI  - Biological control of <i>Halymorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in apple orchards versus corn fields and their adjacent woody habitats: High versus low pesticide-input agroecosystems
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Halymorpha halys is an invasive pest in the USA that inflicts damage to specialty crops, and conventional growers have increased use of broad-spectrum insecticides to manage this pest. The impacts of pest management programs on natural enemies of H. halys were examined in high vs. low intensity insecticide input agroecosystems in western North Carolina (USA). Apple orchards and corn fields, with their adjacent wooded habitats, served as the high and low-input environments, respectively. Sentinel egg masses and yellow sticky cards were deployed in these agroecosystems to compare predation and parasitism on H. halys eggs, and presence, abundance, and richness of natural enemies. A total of approximately 85% of all sentinel eggs deployed in apple orchards in both 2018 and 2019 produced a healthy stink bug nymph, higher than all other habitats. A total of 26.6% and 32.9% of eggs deployed in wooded habitats bordering corn exhibited mortality due to natural enemy attack in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Comparatively, eggs deployed in apple borders had 10.0% and 17.8% of total eggs killed by natural enemies, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Corn agroecosystems generally had greater predation and parasitism of sentinel eggs, and greater richness and abundance of predators detected on yellow sticky cards compared to apple agroecosystems. Wooded habitats bordering crops serve as population reservoirs for H. halys, allowing for egg laying and dispersal into crops. If these areas are protected as refuge areas free from insecticide drift, such as from apple orchards, they can also harbor thriving natural enemy populations that could reduce populations of H. halys. Wooded areas free from harsh broad-spectrum insecticides are an important component for successful conservation and augmentative biological control in neighboring crops.

AB  - The phenomenon of post-Christianism accelerated by COVID-19 has long been visible with numerous evidence, including the decline of Western Christianity, the emergence of new Christianity, the rapid progress of secularization, the rise of various ideas and cultures, and the decline of Christians. In this situation, the church sought an answer to how to deal with social culture and effectively implement a Christian worldview.To this end, the researcher first diagnosed the post-Christian phenomenon and the response of Korean churches, reviewed the ecclesiologies of reformers and the latest scholars to find theological criteria, and established a new ecclesiology for Korean churches in this era and proposed a preaching based on it: Empathy and listening community, Community that advises, and Preaching made by preachers and congregations together.The new ecclesiology starts from the place where congregations stay, but should not let them stay there. Just as Peter and John let a sitting man who asked for earthly value at church stand up not by silver and gold but by holding on to heavenly value through the power of Jesus Christ’s name in Acts chapter 3, we as church has to follow them. As Jesus sent his disciples on a mountain back to village in order to raise the ‘unbelieving generation’(boy possessed by a spirit, his father and disciples) in Mark chapter 9, this ecclesiology will help church to be spiritual faith community having heavenly value and Christ’s glory and let the world to experience and share them.This paper defines it as ‘community ecclesiology’. Within it, preaching aims to establish the identity of the church and congregations based on ‘the different world’ in the Bible and for a change of the world that pays attention to ‘the difference'.

T2  - 한국문예비평연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study calculated the characteristics of zombie characters in webtoons and analyzed cultural perceptions of pandemic situations such as COVID-19. Zombies are different from other monster characters whose motif is infection. Zombies are infections caused by viral infections, not by bloodsucking or physical attacks. Zombies are indiscriminate enough to paralyze a city or an entire country. Zombies show the ambiguous boundaries between humans and monsters through the fact that the subject and the other, the infected and the uninfected, were actually our family and friends. Early zombie webtoons followed the traditional zombie narrative strategy. Recently, zombie webtoons have gone beyond the cliches of the existing zombie narratives to express a variety of thematic consciousness. The zombie epic of the past recreates the fierce competition for survival between the infected and the non-infected against the background of an apocalyptic worldview. On the other hand, recent zombie narratives deal with the problems of human existence after infection, the underlying trauma or wounds, and daily life and family love. Unlike monster narratives in which the subject eliminates monsters, zombie characters often present the problem of restoration of humanity and salvation at the end. This has nothing to do with the vague boundaries of the zombie character that both the infected and the non-infected were human or one family.

T2  - Journal of Biblical Text Research
T2  - 성경원문연구

AB  - The researcher analyzed the paragraphs of Ecclesiastes 3:10-15 as verb syntax and semantics of a relative tense system, and focused on the expression and meaning generation of the text paragraph. Within the sub-paragraph, the verb has various functions. Verbs within this unit function in various ways. First of all, the verb form qatal is characteristic of the past and pluperfect, and starts observation, reflection, and enlightenment. Yiqtol uses not only individual facts of the future but also general facts and repetitive (habitual) usages. The timelessness of the form of existence is universally transforming statements. In addition, Ecclesiastes 3:10-11 convincingly expresses one’s own statements through strategic use of alternating individual concepts and general concepts.The way the passages in Ecclesiastes 3:10-15 deploy is a narrative development of wisdom that leads to observation (v. 10)-reflection (v. 11)-enlightenment (vv. 12-13; v. 14). Unlike the position of King-Qohelet (1:13b), the Evangelist Qohelet observes the contradictory facts pre-set by God, saying that this is what God has allowed to a humble (or devote) man (3:10c). He says that there is a proper time (v. 11a) when all things are beautiful, but that man cannot understand God’s event as a whole (v. 11bγ) and implies the partial possibility and partial impossibility of man (v. 11bβ). Observation and reflection reach dual enlightenment, and the anthropological dimension of the pre-set kairos-time is not transcendental, but exists in the possibility of simple enjoyment (eating, drinking, seeing good) It is realized in the good and good behavior (v. 12b). On the theological level, enlightenment - this good event of God - continues in the future, and has the sovereignty (v. 14aγ) of sovereign personality that cannot be added or subtracted as a human. People who are habitually fearful of God (v. 14bβ) are enchanted by His aesthetic beauty. Therefore, a person’s limited understanding is not limited, but partial. Even if it is a part of a person and if he can enjoy it and do good things, even though he lives for a limited time (v. 12b), he can enjoy the kairos-reality of “Olam-time” (eternal time, v. 11bα). The thought of Ecclesiastes 3:10-11 is very marvelous: God is not just a distant, incomprehensible, indescribably fearful being (deus tremendus), but a fascinus (deus fascinus). Man does not know God’s events as a whole, but has partial understanding and possibility of capture. Even if it is subject to the passage of time (years), the possibility of partial enjoyment of a person remains. The evangelist says that such enjoyment is also God’s gift. The thought of Ecclesiastes 3:10-15 is far from a skeptical, pessimistic worldview.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to reveal the peril of premillennial dispensationalism, a missiological black hole. The gravity of this black hole is so strong that earth and matter, each a part of the respective heaven/earth and spirit/matter pairs cannot escape from it. Premillennial dispensationalism undermines the biblical worldview by exclusively situating the renewal of creation after the return of Jesus Christ. Premillennial dispensationalism afflicts the witness of the church, hampering its healing role in creation. Chapter 2 deals with dispensationalism. Chapter 3 handles amillennial dispensationalism, postmillennial dispensationalism, and premillennial dispensationalism. After giving a warning that premillennial dispensationalism has risen repeatedly in church history, Chapter 4 concludes this article by introducing Howard A. Snyder’s reconstructed lyrics of H. L. Turner’s old hymn “It May Be at Morn.” Having full fellowship with God and one another now and in the final new creation is the anchor to avoid the black hole of premillennial dispensationalism.

AB  - This study monitors and models spatio-temporal land use changes in Okomu National Park over two decades (2000 - 2020) with the aim of projecting forest cover changes for the near future. A probabilistic cellular automata (CA) model was created and used to simulate land use changes with the aim of prediction. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images for years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were classified into Forest and Non-Forest using maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm. The overall classification accuracy for the years under study was 98.1838%, 97.5169%, 96.3325%, 91.6647%, and 94.6124% with overall kappa coefficients of 0.9654, 0.9557, 0.9524, 0.8563, and 0.9094 respectively. State transition probabilities for 2000-2005, 2005-2010, 2010-2015, and 2015-2020 were calculated from the classified images. A probabilistic cellular automata model using Moores neighborhood with a Von Neumann extension was used to simulate land use changes for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 with year 2000 as the base year. Simulation accuracy was 77.46% for year 2005, 74.1% for year 2010, 70.98% for year 2015, and 78.27% for year 2020. Projections was made for years 2025 and 2030 and it shows a 27.41% decline from the base year by 2025, and a 29.90% decline by 2030.Keywords: Cellular Automata, Markov Chain, Simulation, Supervised Classification Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0

T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors address the phenomenon of small plastic - modified bones of hoofed animals in the cultures of Eurasia from the archaic to the present time. The focus of the research is astragalus etc., modified in form, decorated as objects of play, art and magic. The methodology includes reconstruction, typology, semantic analysis, etc. The interpretation of figurines is based on extrapolation into antiquity of ethnographic realities (play, fortune-telling, magic practices) representing the culture of hunters and pastoralists, mainly of the Turkic and Mongol peoples. The research proceeds from the initial integrity and syncretism of culture; the unity of the existence of the human community and its natural environment, the inextricable connection between Man and Animals. The diachronic analysis carried out within the framework of the study allows us to assert that in archaeological and ethnic cultures for three millennia, astragalus were distinguished by the stability of forms and functions. They are used in game, fortune telling and magical practices, and correlated with the idea of vitality - as a kind of entity that unites the world of people and animals. The structural-semiotic approach defines one of the main conclusions of the work, according to which the universalism and stability of ideas about joints are rooted in the initially syncretic mythos-ecological picture of the world, with its characteristic identity of anthropo- and zoomorphic codes of the chronotope.

TI  - Jean Barraque: Path Towards Serialism and Aesthetic Views of the First Half of the 1950s
T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the aesthetical views of French composer Jean Barraque during the period of the formation and development of the principles of serialism. The roles of Schoenberg and Beethoven in the formation of the master's artistic worldview are singled out. The path towards the new conception of sonar thinking for Barraque were determined by Olivier Messiaen's music analysis courses, the familiarization with the books of Rene Leibowitz devoted to the serial technique created by the representatives of the Second Viennese School, as well as artistic contacts with the leading composers - Pierre Boulez, Karel Goeyvaerts and Michel Fano. On the basis of an overview of Barraque's articles from the 1950s the key musical figures (Webern, Berg, Schoenberg, Messiaen and Stravinsky) and issues that interested the composer during the researched period of time are disclosed, and a comparison is made between the composer's utterances with the discourse of Boulez. Notice is drawn to the fact that the questions of serial technology proper were of little interest to Barraque. His attention was focused on the historical needs of musical practice and its ontological essence. The composer attributed special significance to the concept of musical dialectics, considering it to be defining for the concept of serialism. Barraque's familiarization in the mid-1950s with Hermann Broch's novel "The Death of Virgil" stipulated the further development of his music. The center of the composer's interests turned out to be questions related to the nature of art and artistic creativity, the true expression of which were served by the oppositions between life and death, creation and destruction. In the article's conclusion the connection between Barraque's viewpoints with the romantic aesthetics is demonstrated.

The results show that the vegetation coverage in Iceland reaches a maximum in the period from the middle of July to late August, with an average of about 65% of the total area (66858 km(2)). There is not a strong relationship between NAO phases and the occurrence of the dry (less vegetation) or green months, which means that a dry year can be accompanied by a negative NAO phase (i.e. July 2009 with NDVI anomaly=-3.35 and NAO =-2.15) or with a positive phase (September 2005 with NDVI anomaly=-2.23 and NAO=0.63). The most important factor influencing the occurrence of months with denser/less dense vegetation is shifting west/eastward of Greenland Low height (GL), which is accompanied by a green/dry month in Iceland, respectively. The knowledge of this can help us to understand the variations in Iceland's vegetation and also enables us to have a closer look at the impact of changes in global atmospheric patterns on the vegetation productivity in Iceland.

TI  - The Phenomenon of the Modern Ukrainian Voter: Essence, Peculiarities and Trends of its Development
T2  - CUESTIONES POLITICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the peculiarities of the modern Ukrainian voter as a special phenomenon in political science. The main objective of the research is to form a portrait of the modern voter based on data from some sociological surveys, as well as to address the emergence and formation of the image of a desirable candidate for the voter. Historical and statistical analysis methods as well as the comparison method were used. In the results they emphasize that in the personality of the voter we will understand a subject who makes a conscious choice of that political figure that he (the voter) considers capable of solving urgent problems of life, both State and of his person. In this regard, the focus is on revealing the moods in modern Ukrainian society, to describe the image of "an ideal candidate" in the eyes of a modern voter. Special attention was paid to personality as an integral element of the socio-political space and the worldview of the political and electoral sphere. It is concluded that the historical context is very important in the formation of the Ukrainian political environment, which makes us glimpse analytically the peculiarities of the meaning of the act of suffrage.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This methodologic paper arises from the necessity to gather Land Surface Temperature (LST) data over a relatively large period and territory: 2000-2018, Portugal. The computational power required to complete this task was found to be a major barrier. However, platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offer a vast data archive freely accessible through a web interactive development environment or an application programming interface, namely, Python's API. Additionally, the computation using GEE is hosted in Google's servers, drastically reducing the processing times. However, computing LST through Landsat-7 satellite imagery resulted on a difference of -8 degrees C +/- 6 degrees C compared to the values from meteorological ground stations. As such, this paper aims to further calibrate computed LST through meteorological stations and make the methodology and corresponding code available, thus encouraging cooperation on the development and integration of local calibration methods. A sensitivity analysis of the representativeness of each station was performed using three methods of temperature extraction: station coordinate's pixel, buffers around the station, and surrounding soil occupation (identifying the area with the same soil occupation as the station's location). Pearson's correlation coefficient was on average significant at 0.81 in the raw data and increased to 0.89 after clearing data from outliers. The best representativeness method for meteorologic stations was the one based on soil occupation, which resulted on a Pearson's r of 0.91. As a result, we advise researchers to complement their remote sensing work with ground data whenever possible through the usage of a method like the one here described.

TI  - The incremental houses of urban fringes: Yoruba personhood and popular culture in Ibadan, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article, based on a qualitative study of incremental self-help housing in a peripheral neighbourhood of Ibadan, southwest Nigeria, focuses on the motivation for homeownership of urban low-income earners. It offers an anthropological perspective, with particular attention paid to social embedding of homeownership. The article depicts incremental homes as reflective of a local consciousness of personhood and autonomy, as well a response to a growing urban culture of homeownership. I argue that people move into the incremental homes they build through self-help as owner-occupiers so as to attain a level of social ostentation that by popular accounts confers personhood on the individual, and likewise as a protest against the unequal power relationship between low-income renters and city landlords in Nigeria. In either case, the article reckons the poor-quality homes as occurring altogether as a material expression of both an enduring and emerging worldview of the self and self-actualisation.

TI  - Understanding environmental factors affecting forest canopy heights in the Philippines using remote sensing data from ICESat
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses remote sensing datasets to assessenvironmental factors affecting forest canopy heights in the Philippines. Data for a total of 144 point locations with information on maximum canopy height and Lorey's mean height (the latter defined as the crown-area-weighted canopy heights) were extracted from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR instrument that was aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Waveform LiDAR data were collected between October 2004 and March 2008. Maximum canopy heights were evaluated fordifferent geographic classes generated from the digital elevation model (DEM). Maximum canopy heights at elevations above 1000 m, and those at slopes below 18% and above 50%, were statistically different from other classes, indicating different forest formations. Although differences in canopy height did not differ significantly across aspect classes (p=0.172), there was a conspicuous pattern of canopy heights being lower on north, east and south facing slopes, and generally higher on northeast, southeast and southwest aspects. Furthermore, the influence of soil type, climate and topography were evaluated by univariate regression to evaluate whether they influenced Lorey's canopy heights. Rasterized soil types were based on the FAO-UNESCO project while climate parameters were from the WorldClim global data. Mean canopy heights were significantly affected by elevation and slope (p<0.010), soil type (p<0.050), and diurnal temperature range, annual temperature range and isothermality (p<0.050). It is important to note that the three climatic variables are functions of maximum and minimum temperatures. These findings could be useful for modeling forest type distribution and consequently for adaptive forest management with climate change. Obtaining additional data on canopy heights and using updated information on soil types are recommended to improve the analysis of the relationships explored in this study.

T2  - GEOLOGY GEOPHYSICS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the problem of climate warming and the effect of melting ice caps. The problem of climate warming is discussed in two stages. In the first stage, the factors affecting global warming are discussed in detail and the effects and risks of ablation extensively described. Analyses were conducted on data available online from NASA and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center. The Greenland area (Jakobshavn Glacier) was selected to visualize glacier calving front changes. The analysis of changes was performed on the selected satellite images covering the summer period (June to September) provided by the Landsat program. Then, the changes in the position of the calving front of the Jakobshavn Glacier were visualized for the period 1985-2020, with a repeatability of every 5 years. Thus, our results addressed the challenges of environmental changes to remote sensing data processing. In addition to the visualization, a surface summary of these changes was presented in the study. The results were discussed in the context of climate change data processed by means of the GIS method. Furthermore, an analysis of the effects of greenhouse gases on glacier surface changes was performed. In summary, the results reveal that satellite imagery is an excellent source of data on which to visualize glacier calving rates, comparing individual layers showing the position of the glacier calving front and calculating the area of calved ice.

AB  - A GIS-based Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) was analyzed using space-based data between 1972 and 2011 as Input data. The result of the NDVI using Landsat 7 ETM+ shows clearly that the values range from 0.19 to -0.31. Mountains and highlands of the Itagunmodi-Igun area revealed stressed vegetation cover between 0.11 to -0.31. The NDVI was also performed on Landsat imageries of four different epoch: 1972, 1986, 2000, and 2010. Results showed that vegetation index ranged from -0.105 to 0.033, -0.25 to 0.480, -0.313 to 0.19 and -0.29 to 0.5 in 1972, 1986, 2000 and 2010 respectively. The analysis revealed that the study area experienced an increase in biomass between 1972 and 1986 but with some areas experiencing outright disappearance of vegetation as indicated by the lower bands of index values in 1972 (-0.105) and 1986 (-0.25). The result showed that the Basin experienced a rapid and significant increase in biomass between 2000 and 2010, as indicated by the lower bands of index values in 2000 (-0.291) and 2010 (0.5). The results of the NDVI in 1972 ranged from -0.105 to 0.033 while NDVI in 1986 ranged from -0.25 to 0.480 which indicated a significant increase in the vegetation index. The results of the NDVI in 2000 ranged from 0.291 to 0.5 also indicated a significant increase in the vegetation index. The study concluded that artisanal mining could cause land and vegetation degradation with consequent loss of biodiversity, ecological modification.

CL  - Savannah, GA
AB  - Monitoring dams is critical for identifying vulnerabilities affecting its performance and managing the risk of failure. Traditionally, dam monitoring is performed by a combination of visual surveillance and instrumentation. American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has been giving a D grade for the nation's 91,000-plus dams since the beginning of the grading system (1998) to date. The traditional approach can be subjective and laborious, considering the monitoring needs in the United States. This study presents the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) application for monitoring deformations at dam sites to understand its vulnerability. The study evaluates the use of InSAR at three (two in India and one in the United States) dam sites to monitor its safety. The Sentinel-1 and ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images were processed using Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI). Results indicate that, combined with traditional methods, remote sensing using radar offers an opportunity for long-term dam monitoring and the development of a deformation-based early warning system.

TI  - Health promotion interventions supporting Indigenous healthy ageing: a scoping review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Aging well is a priority in Canada and globally, particularly for older Indigenous adults experiencing an increased risk of chronic conditions. Little is known about health promotion interventions for older Indigenous adults and most literature is framed within Eurocentric paradigms that are not always relevant to Indigenous populations. This scoping review, guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the PRISMA-ScR Checklist, explores the literature on Indigenous health promoting interventions across the lifespan, with specific attention to Indigenous worldview and the role of older Indigenous adults within these interventions. To ensure respectful and meaningful engagement of Indigenous peoples, articles were included in the Collaborate or Shared Leadership categories on the Continuum of Engagement. Fifteen articles used Indigenous theories and frameworks in the study design. Several articles highlighted engaging Elders as advisors in the design and/or delivery of programs however only five indicated Elders were active participants. In this scoping review, we suggest integrating a high level of community engagement and augmenting intergenerational approaches are essential to promoting health among Indigenous populations and communities. Indigenous older adults are keepers of essential knowledge and must be engaged (as advisors and participants) in intergenerational health promotion interventions to support the health of all generations.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forest aboveground biomass estimations have always been of crucial importance for sustainable forest management. However, a choice of the suitable statistical modelling method and predictor variables from remotely sensed data remains the keystone for providing accurate aboveground biomass estimates. The present study intended to compare the potential of four modelling techniques, including RandomForest, Support vector machine, multilinear regression, and K-nearest neighbour for estimating aboveground biomass using vegetation indices, spectral information, and both vegetation indices and spectral bands. The results have revealed that machine learning algorithms provide better results than the multilinear regression method. Indeed, the multilinear regression method produced the lowest R2 and the greatest RMSE. Besides, the RandomForest performed better by providing accurate results compared to other machine learning algorithms. However, comparing the three sets of predictors, the vegetation indices have yielded accurate results of aboveground biomass and the strongest modelling power. Our results have also revealed that the RF is the best choice for predicting aboveground biomass for the purpose of reducing over- or under-estimation problems. This study has demonstrated the potential of the machine learning algorithms in predicting aboveground biomass in the tropical forest, using freely remotely sensed data derived from sensors with medium spatial resolution.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper dwells on a new concept of knowledge emerged as a result of active collaboration between the scientific community and business corporations. The authors analyse a possible mode of interaction between business and scientific community within the framework of an upgraded information environment - wikinomics - described by Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams. It is suggested that the global scientific and intellectual space can merge and develop in a new form: a virtual Library of Alexandria. The authors study the system of the Mouseion at Alexandria, which included a museum, a library and a research institute and facilitated the collaboration among leading scholars and their students as well as the progress of scientific knowledge. The phenomenon of ancient mouseion is characterized here as a cosmos. Medieval encyclopaedism, which shaped a different, novel worldview, can be found in the works of Isidore of Seville, patron saint of the Internet and computers. The article demonstrates that the experience of Alexandria Library goes beyond the modern archiving of knowledge and concerns the processes of knowledge generation and development for further scientific and technological progress. The authors conclude that today a new single cosmos of knowledge is being formed. Self-organization skills enhance human ability to find, deliver, sort, evaluate, select, increase and develop knowledge. A scientist has to join gradually in this process and to be competitive in order to stay afloat in both the digital and the scientific world. A network consisting of universities and academic institutions can become a collaboration platform. In a crisis situation, such a network is able to provide continuous transmission of knowledge.

TI  - PEDAGOGICAL MODEL FOR DECOLONISING, INDIGENISING AND TRANSFORMING SCIENCE EDUCATION CURRICULA: A CASE OF SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Africa, Science education curricula have been instrumental in promoting Western worldviews as being universal. An educational transformation and decolonisation of the school curriculum is required. A focus on an African worldview and an integration of the local context and community-based information is necessary for survival, i.e., Indigenous Knowledge System (IKS). While IKS is enshrined in the schooling curriculum, Educators experience challenges with implementing it, because the pedagogical strategies have not been clearly described. An in-depth qualitative study was conducted with the Indigenous Knowledge (IK) holders of the Zulu cultural group and Senior High School (SHS) Science teachers to explore how IK on environmental sustainability could be taught in South African science classrooms. The research employed an interpretivist, multi-site ethnographic, qualitative approach, and naturalistic research style. In-depth interviews were used to generate data from the purposively selected community persons. The thematically analysed findings were used to develop a culturally specific pedagogical model on how to teach IK in science classrooms: touring cultural places; demystifying indigenous practices and perception; utilizing indigenous pedagogies; teaching wisdom behind indigenous practices etc. The research recommends that future studies be conducted on applying the model in different geographical and cultural schooling contexts.

TI  - Investigation of the effect of urban expansion on surface temperature in Mersin city
T2  - GEOMATIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and industrialization, which is seen with rapid population growth in cities over time, causes the destruction of natural areas and transforms them into surfaces (concrete, asphalt, etc.) that absorb solar energy. Urbanization causes the temperature in urban centers to be higher than the natural areas such as agricultural lands and forests. This is known as the urban heat island and causes local climate change, air pollution, energy consumption, health problems. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of urbanization on the surface temperature of the city of Mersin, where there has been a rapid population increase recently. In this context, the Land Surface Temperature maps of the years 1990-1999-2007-2011-2018 were produced using Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI satellite images. Also, CORINE land use/cover data were used to identify urban areas in 1990 and 2018. As a result of this study, it was observed that many natural areas were destroyed and transformed into artificial areas in 28 years period and as a result of this, an average temperature increase of around 6 degrees C was observed for Mersin city center.

TI  - Input imagery, classifiers, and cloud computing: Insights from multi-temporal LULC mapping in the Cambodian Mekong Delta
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased open-access availability of radar and optical satellite imagery has engendered numerous land use and land cover (LULC) analyses combining these data sources. In parallel, cloud computing platforms have enabled a wider community to perform LULC classifications over long periods and large areas. However, an assessment of how the performance of classifiers available on these cloud platforms can be optimized for the use of multi-imagery data has been lacking for multi-temporal LULC approaches. This study provides such an assessment for the supervised classifiers available on the open-access Google Earth Engine platform: Naive Bayes (NB), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A multi-temporal LULC analysis using Sentinel-1 and 2 is implemented for a study area in the Mekong Delta. Classifier performance is compared for different combinations of input imagery, band sets, and training datasets. The results show that GTB and RF yield the highest overall accuracies, at 94% and 93%. Combining optical and radar imagery boosts classification accuracy for CART, RF, GTB, and SVM by 10-15 percentage points. Furthermore, it reduces the impact of limited training dataset quality for RF, GTB, and SVM.

TI  - Large-area inventory of species composition using airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species composition is an essential attribute in stand-level forest management inventories and remotely sensed data might be useful for its estimation. Previous studies on this topic have had several operational drawbacks, e.g., performance studied at a small scale and at a single tree level with large fieldwork costs. The current study presents the results from a large-area inventory providing species composition following an operational area-based approach. The study utilizes a combination of airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data and 97 field sample plots of 250 m(2) collected over 350 km(2) of productive forest in Norway. The results show that, with the availability of hyperspectral data, species-specific volume proportions can be provided in operational forest management inventories with acceptable results in 90% of the cases at the plot level. Dominant species were classified with an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa-value of 0.73. Species-specific volumes were estimated with relative root mean square differences of 34%, 87%, and 102% for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and deciduous species, respectively. A novel tree-based approach for selecting pixels improved the results compared to a traditional approach based on the normalized difference vegetation index.

AB  - Accurate information of solar radiation from satellites is crucial for many applications, mainly in regions with lack of ground-based measurements. In this sense, comparison with ground-based measurement is necessary to ensure the reliability of the information. In this work, the daily global solar irradiation data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA-POWER; power.larc.nasa.gov) were compared with ground-based measurements in the 8 stations of the Saver-Net solar irradiance network (http://www.savernet-satreps.org/en) installed in the south of South America. A linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the agreement between satellite data and ground-based measurements. The coefficient of determination shows very good correspondence with a mean value of 0.95. The mean absolute error (0.63 kWh/m(2)/d) and the root mean squared error (0.48 kWh/m(2)/d) reflect a low difference.

TI  - Use of TanDEM-X and Sentinel Products to Derive Gully Activity Maps in Kunene Region (Namibia) Based on Automatic Iterative Random Forest Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gullies are landforms with specific patterns of shape, topography, hydrology, vegetation, and soil characteristics. Remote sensing products (TanDEM-X, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2) serve as inputs into an iterative algorithm, initialized using a micro-mapping simulation as training data, to map gullies in the northwestern of Namibia. A Random Forest Classifier examines pixels with similar characteristics in a pool of unlabeled data, and gully objects are detected where high densities of gully pixels are enclosed by an alpha shape. Gully objects are used in subsequent iterations following a mechanism where the algorithm uses the most reliable pixels as gully training samples. The gully class continuously grows until an optimal scenario in terms of accuracy is achieved. Results are benchmarked with manually tagged gullies (initial gully labeled area <0.3% of the total study area) in two different watersheds (408 and 302 km(2), respectively) yielding total accuracies of >98%, with 60% in the gully class, Cohen Kappa >0.5, Matthews Correlation Coefficient >0.5, and receiver operating characteristic Area Under the Curve >0.89. Hence, our method outlines gullies keeping low false-positive rates while the classification quality has a good balance for the two classes (gully/no gully). Results show the most significant gully descriptors as the high temporal radar signal coherence (22.4%) and the low temporal variability in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (21.8%). This research builds on previous studies to face the challenge of identifying and outlining gully-affected areas with a shortage of training data using global datasets, which are then transferable to other large (semi-) arid regions.

TI  - How Much Greenness Can Mitigate Urban Warming? A Tentative Answer Based on Thermal Data from Landsat Missions
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Urban areas temperature conditions appears to be relevant in defining wellbeing of people, suggesting that some analyses have to be made concerning possible effects of climate change. In this study, monthly Landsat 4, 5, 7, 8 Land Surface Temperature (LST) monthly composites covering the period 1984-2020 were processed by Google Earth Engine (GEE) to test the existence of increasing trends in the study area. This concerned the whole municipality of Torino (Piemonte, NW Italy) and focused on the role that built and green areas can play in a metropolitan context of about 800,000 inhabitants in the global warming framework. The basic idea was to demonstrate how free available data from long-lasting satellite missions (like the Landsat one) could support planning policies by supplying quantitative estimates of both temperature trends and consequent relationship with land cover classes that constitute the urban patchwork. City management will represent a great challenge for future policy makers and topologic relationship between green and built areas will be an important issue to deal with. With these premises, green and built areas were mapped by the CORINE land cover level 3 map. A time series of LST images from the Landsat missions was generated by GEE and analyzed at pixel level to test local trend. Preventively pixels possibly switched from one class to another were recognized and masked out. Only class-invariant pixels were retained and used to test temperature trends. For these pixels, LST trend was modelled by a 1(st) order polynomial and the significance of the related gain evaluated. Significant gain values were averaged at class level (built and green classes). Built areas showed a steeper increasing trend than vegetated ones. Assuming that vegetation can partially compensate temperature increasing, a paradigmatic case study was proposed to translate such information in planning concerns. It relied on the assumption that the municipality of Torino could be considered like a closed system made of two classes completely filling the area included within its administrative borders. If, along time and for planning reasons, an area moves from one class to the other, one has to admit that one class gains the same area that the other losses. Within these constraints, a model was developed to test how long a switching strategy where built zones turn to green ones can maintain the present average temperature condition over the area. It was found that, in spite of whatever planning efforts, the mitigation effect by green areas will stop within few years.

TI  - The Roots of the Movement of 'Socially Progressive' Catholics. The Transcription of an Unpublished 1975 Discussion of the Activists and Writers of the PAX Association Titled: '<i>How Today and Tomorrow</i> Was Formed'
T2  - PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC
M3  - Article
AB  - The movement of "socially progressive" Catholics, initially known under the name "Today and Tomorrow" and subsequently the PAX Association, began to be shaped in 1945 pursuant to an agreement between Boleslaw Piasecki and General Ivan Serov as well as discussions between a group of Catholic intellectuals led by Aleksander Bochenski and Jerzy Borejsza. The presented text of the discussion regarding these events by its participants, which was held thirty years later, allows us to understand their motivations and dilemmas. Coming from diverse milieus and disappointed by the failure of their political concepts, they sought their place in the new reality, believing that undertaking armed resistance against the communists would be disastrous. This is all the more interesting as many of them had previously beloved to the Falanga National Radical Camp and the National Confederation, sharply anti-communist organizations, while others held a conservative worldview. The attitude that they adopted in 1945 led them to a tar-reaching acceptance of the communist system in Poland. The transcription of this debate, which was never published in the PAX Association's press, is also an excellent historical source on the political history of the first years of People's Poland, demonstrating the authorities' attempts at creating conflicts between Catholic milieus.

T2  - RUDN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV SERIYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past thirty years, social memory of the Eurasian youth has been influenced by many 'actors of the commerative space', who often pursue their own goals in the struggle to legitimize the new political order and their policies of the radical economic transformation. The results of their efforts should be taken into account in the implementation of one of the most important joint projects of the post-Soviet countries - Eurasian integration, because social memory of the youth is the most important resource for its success. The study aims at clarifying and evaluating the mechanisms for preserving information about the past, the peculiarities of the generation Y ideas about the common history and the current stage of the EAEU construction, which are present in the public discourse, and at revealing the relationship between attitudes to the past and to the Eurasian integration, the influence of social memory on the personal worldview, the forms and methods of its reconstruction in the interests of the post-Soviet countries interaction and efficiency of the politics of memory. The formation of social memory is defined as the activity of actors (individuals, groups, organizations, social institutions, communities) aimed at the interpretation of the collective past and common present by the youth of the countries participating in the Eurasian integration. The empirical object of the study - young citizens of the member states and candidates for joining the EAEU (18-38 years old), who live, study or work in Moscow. The article considers the respondents' assessments of the contribution of each of the actors to the social memory formation and describes social memory of the generation Y as a set of views, feelings and moods reflecting the perception of the Soviet past and the common present. The authors insist on the purposeful policy of the leaders of the countries, participating in the Eurasian integration, to ensure the reconstruction of the youth's social memory and the consolidation of societies.

TI  - Exploring Risk, Antecedents and Human Costs of Living with a Retained Surgical Item: A Narrative Synthesis of Australian Case Law 1981-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective(s): This study aimed to critically examine the circumstances contributing to, and the human costs arising from, the retention of surgical items through the lens of Australian case law.Design, Setting and Participants: We reviewed Australian cases from 1981 to 2018 to establish a pattern of antecedents and identify long-term patient impacts (human costs) of retained surgical items. We used a modified four-step process to conduct a systematic review of legal doctrine, combined with a narrative synthesis approach to bring the information together for understanding. We searched LexisNexis, AustLII, Coroner Court websites, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency Tribunal Decisions and Panel Hearings, Civil and Administrative Tribunal summaries, and other online sources for publicly available civil cases, medical disciplinary cases, coronial cases, and criminal cases across all Australian jurisdictions.Results: Ten cases met the inclusion criteria, including one coronial case, three civil appeal cases, and six civil first instance cases. Time from item retention to discovery ranged from 12 days to 20 years, with surgical sponges the most frequently retained item. Five case reports indicated possible deviations from standard protocols regarding counting procedures and record-keeping. In the four cases that reported on count status, the count was deemed correct at the end of surgery. Case reports also showed the human costs of retained surgical items, that is, the long-term impacts on patients associated with a retained surgical item. In eight of the nine civil cases, ongoing pain was the most frequently reported physical symptom; in three cases, patients suffered psychosocial symptoms requiring treatment.Conclusion: While there was little uniformity in the items retained or how items came to be retained, we identified significant time delays between item retention and item discovery, coupled with long-lasting physical and psychosocial harms suffered by patients living with a retained surgical item. Current prevention strategies, including national standards-based professional practices, are not always effective in preventing retained surgical items. An internationally standardised taxonomy and reporting criteria, more consistent reporting, and open access to event and risk data could inform a more accurate global estimate of risk and incidence of this hospital-acquired complication.

TI  - USING MULTISPECTRAL DATA FROM LANDSAT ETM plus TO ESTIMATE LEAF AREA INDEX OF PECAN ORCHARDS
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant physiologists use leaf area index (LAI) as an essential tool to predict vegetation cover, growth and yield. The objective of this two-year study was to determine whether multispectral reflectance indices derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) can estimate LAI of pecan (Carya illinoinensis Wangenh. C. Koch) orchards. The study was conducted on two mature (20-30 years old) pecan orchards, one growing on a sandy loam soil and the other on a clay loam soil. Ground reference LAI measurements were synchronized with overpasses of Landsat ETM+ satellite acquisition times. For both orchards, single band surface reflectance, band ratio and vegetation indices were determined and their correlations with LAI were assessed. At sandy loam site, ground reference LAI ranged from 1.11 to 2.06. At the clay loam site, LAI was between 1.01 and 1.60 across the growing seasons. Our results revealed that surface reflectance from single bands did not significantly correlate with LAI at both sites. Additionally, the relationship between LAI and most studied vegetation indices was inconsistent or/and not significant across both orchards (sandy and clay sites). However, three vegetation indices showed significant correlation (P-value < 0.05) with LAI in both pecan orchards. In the orchard grown on the sandy soil, the correlation coefficient (r) for normalized difference infrared Index-band 5 (NDII5) was 0.84, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) was 0.83. The correlations for the orchard grown on the clay soil were, NDII5 = 0.75, EVI = 0.65 and GNDVI = 0.63. Overall, we conclude that multispectral data derived from Landsat ETM holds promise for estimation of the LAI of pecans grown on clay and sandy soils.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - The validation of low-resolution remote sensing products using high-resolution data may be affected by different error factors that would eventually imply unrealistic accuracy estimations. The usual validation methodologies were designed for high or medium resolution but may be not very adequate for coarse resolution, particularly when trying to separate those errors associated to classification from those related to the actual pixel size. The Pareto Boundary methodology can be a good alternative to discriminate between those two sources of errors. We tested its application to a recently released global burned area product based on AVHRR data. This product was developed within the Fire_cci project of the European Space Agency (ESA). The product, named FireCCITL11, has the coarsest resolution (0.0 (5) over bar degrees) and the longest time series (1982-2018) compared to all other global BA products. Furthermore, FireCCILT11 is the only global BA product without a dichotomy classification which detects BA proportions.The accuracy of the FireCCILT11 was validated by Pareto Boundary and an independent reference dataset of Landsat at 0.05 degrees. FireCCILT11 was usually close to boundary curve or below it, which indicates suitable performance. Commission errors (Ce) were usually lower than Omission errors (Oe) in the time series, like other BA products such as those based on MODIS sensor. Both types of accuracy errors present low values, although there were unbalanced years. Year 2014 showed the lowest errors for the entire time series with balanced errors (Ce = 0.12 and Oe = 0.14).

TI  - Predictive Modeling of Transport Infrastructure Space for Urban Growth Phenomena in Developing Countries' Cities: A Case Study of Kano - Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global urbanization has the most tremendous negative effects on the changing landscapes in many developing countries' cities. It is necessary to develop appropriate monitoring techniques for tracking transport space evolution. The work explores the impacts of urban growth dynamics of transport space over the past decades as a basis for predicting future space demands in Kano, Nigeria. Three epochs of Landsat images from 1984, 2013 and 2019 were processed, classified and analyzed. Spatial classifications of land-use/land-cover (LULC) types in Kano include transport space, built-up areas, vegetation, farmland, bare land and water. The data analysis involves model calibration, validation and prediction using areas using the hybrid modeling techniques-cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) in IDIRISI SELVA 17.0 and remote-sensing ARC-GIS 10.7 softwares. The result finds significant expansion of transport and built-up areas while other LULC receded throughout the entire study period. Predictive modeling of transport infrastructure shows spatial expansion by 345 km(2) (3.9%) and 410 km(2) (11.7%) in 2030 and 2050 respectively. Kappa reliability indices of agreement (K-IA) classified images and ground maps were 85%, 86% and 88%, respectively, for 1984, 2013 and 2019 time series. The calibration quality met the 80% minimum suggested in literature for the spatial-temporal track and prediction of urban growth phenomena.

TI  - Changes in land cover and land use from 2016 to 2019 in south-east Cote d'Ivoire: impacts of cash crops on forests
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cote d'Ivoire, over half of all forest cover (57%) has been destroyed in a quarter of a century (1990-2015), with considerable loss of biodiversity. In order to support policies aiming to reduce forest losses and to better understand the dynamics at work, detailed and regular mapping of land cover and land use changes is essential. However, mapping studies are rarely conducted over large areas and can quickly become obsolete because of the rapidly evolving human processes underlying changes. This study aims to assess changes in land cover and land use from 2016 to 2019 in three regions of south-eastern COte d'Ivoire, with a particular focus on the dynamics of deforestation and forest degradation. The methodology is based on the use of images from Sentinel-2 with 10 to 20-metre resolution over a study area covering 22,014 km(2). Data for training purposes were first marked out according to a description of the zone identifying 16 land cover and land use categories. These were then analysed with the Random Forests algorithm to produce maps of land use and land cover in 2016 and 2019 with an overall precision of 92% and 87% respectively. Finally, the maps were cross-analysed to describe forest transitions in the study zone. The results clearly show that the extension of cash crops (cacao and coffee, rubber and oil palm), undifferentiated crops, fallow lands and infrastructure (dwellings and roads) has caused deforestation at a rate of 4.95% per year over the period investigated. Our study thus provides a detailed and up-to-date picture of changes in land cover and land use and input for discussions on the introduction of a national land use surveillance system.

AB  - Background The long-term benefits of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) remain unknown because of serotype replacement. We aimed to estimate the effect of PCV implementation on invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in France.Methods We did a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis using data from a French national prospective surveillance system. We included all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in children and adults from more than 250 participating hospitals between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2017. The primary outcome was incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (meningitis and non-meningitis) over time, analysed by segmented regression with autoregressive error. Isolates were serotyped by latex agglutination with antiserum samples.Findings We included 75 903 patients with invasive pneumococcal disease, including 4302 (5.7%) children younger than 2 years and 37 534 (49.4%) adults aged 65 years or older. Before PCV7 implementation, the estimated monthly incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was 0.78 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, which did not change significantly up to May, 2010. PCV13 implementation in 2010 was followed by a significant decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (-1.5% per month, 95% CI -2.2 to -0.8), reaching an estimated monthly incidence of 0.52 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in December, 2014. From January, 2015, the incidence rebounded (1.8% per month, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6), reaching an estimated monthly incidence of 0.73 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in December, 2017. The estimated monthly incidence increased from 0.93 cases per 100 000 in December, 2014, to 1.73 cases per 100 000 in December, 2017, for children younger than 2 years, and from 1.54 cases per 100 000 in December, 2014, to 2.08 cases per 100 000 in December, 2017, for adults aged 65 years or older. The main non-PCV13 serotypes involved in the increase were 24F in young children and 12F, 22F, 9N, and 8 in adults aged 65 years or older.Interpretation PCV13 implementation led to a major reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, a rebound in cases among children and adults since 2015, driven by several emerging non-PCV13 serotypes, jeopardises the long-term PCV benefits. These findings, if confirmed in the coming years, should be considered in the development of next-generation PCVs and might guide policy makers in the selection of future pneumococcal vaccines.

AB  - This study assessed 30 years (1989-2019) of urban heat phenomena variations for the case study of Gaborone City (Botswana) through the analysis of the land surface temperatures (LST). The LST variability was determined using the Landsat Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) band and the land surface emissivity (epsilon(lambda)) factor. The study investigated the influence of land-use and land-cover change (%LULC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference building index (NDBI) on the variability of LST. For the city boundary which occupies 190.96 km(2), the vegetation cover decreased by nearly 40%, built-up area increased by 38.9%, water bodies decreased by 3% and bare-land increased by approximately 4.1%, while the 30-year mean near-air temperature was observed to have increased by +2.6 degrees C. The urban LST variations were observed to increase exponentially with LSTmin of -2.5 degrees C-14.4 degrees C and LSTmax of 24.4 degrees C-30.2 degrees C respectively from 1989-2019. Using multiple linear regression, the mean LST was observed to be inversely proportional to NDVI (-0.934) and directly proportional to NDBI (+0.949). In correlation with %LULC, the land surface temperature increased with increase in density of the built-up area and bare-land but decreased with increase in vegetation cover and water bodies. Regression of NDVI, NDBI and %LUCC indices for the prediction of LST showed their suitability in the estimation of LST in the arid urban environment with R2 of 0.996.

TI  - Classification of Individual Tree Species in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Based on Convolution Neural Network
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species investigation has been faced with problems such as high cost, low efficiency, and low precision. The use of remote sense can greatly increase the work efficiency of tree species investigation and save cost. Although convolutional neural network (CNN) has made many breakthroughs in natural image classification area, few people have used CNN model to carry out individual tree species classification. Based on the above considerations, this paper builds CNN models, and integrates them with high-resolution remote sensing imagery to classify individual tree species. In the course of semi -automatically constructing the sample set of remote sensing imagery of individual tree species with high-resolution imagery, the crown slices from imagery (CSI) delineation, manual annotation, and data augmentation are used. Meanwhile, in order to train the sample set of remote sensing imagery of individual tree species, five CNN models are adapted. Through comparative analysis, it is found that LeNet5_relu and AlexNet_mini cannot achieve the best classification effect. GoogLeNet_mini56, ResNet_mini56, and DenseNet_BC_mini56 have the best classification effect for different species respectively. DenseNet_BC_mini56 has the highest overall accuracy (94. 14%) and the highest Kappa coefficient (0. 90), making it the best classification model from all aspects. The research proves the effectiveness of CNN in the classification of individual tree species, which can provide a critical solution for forest resource investigation.

AB  - Changes in Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) generate several impacts which affect the energy balance of the Earth and, consequently, modifying the climate of a region. Accordingly, one of the most important indicators of this modification is the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The present work aims to analyze the relationship between LULC and LST, determining the influence of LULC on LST using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. The selected study area was the San Luis Potosi Basin, Mexico (SLPB). A temporal analysis has been developed for 2007 and 2020. Satellite images from Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI/TIRS has been used to calculate LST through a single-channel algorithm for winter and spring. LULC has been determined from a supervised classification with neural network algorithm. Finally, change rates for LULC and LST were assessed. The results indicate that an LST increase of 11 degrees C from 2007 to 2020 has been detected in the region. Also, results showed that covers with spare vegetation or without vegetation have the highest temperatures (29 degrees C to 32 degrees C). In comparison, the covers with dense vegetation and water showed the lowest temperatures (23 degrees C to 25 degrees C). This type of research allows addressing the LULC effects on LST, as well as prove its importance in improving land use planning systems.

AB  - To create reproductive of forests and their special ecosystems with the highest possible success after a fire, it is important that the ecological, technical and economic analyzes to be carried out in the burned areas are carried out as detailed as possible and in a way that best reflects the natural processes. In this context, the planning of restoration works after the determination of ecological and economic damage in the burned areas, determination of operational purposes, pioneer species analysis, study of habitat and site conditions (climatic, edaphic and physiographic factors), determination of the possibilities of using natural seeds, and as a result of these analyzes, site preparation, the supply of seed material from improved seed sources for sowing and planting applications, the use of correct afforestation and restoration techniques, maintenance and other cultivation techniques are important factors that directly affect the processes of reproduction of these areas. Remote sensing is defined as the most effective tool for the prevention and monitoring of forest fires. Remote sensing data used together with geographic information systems provide important information to researchers in monitoring and assessment studies for the mapping of forest fires, fire severity and re-establishing the ecosystem in burned areas in the long term. Different types of remote sensing data are required for different techniques, methods and models in order to fully understand the complexity of forest fires and the subsequent regeneration of the ecosystem. In this context, vegetation cover and change before and after the fire, topographical and other environmental conditions are factors that should be considered to understand and model the effects of the fire in the region.

TI  - Environmental analysis of Turkish upstream petroleum sector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this manuscript, an environmental analysis of Turkish upstream petroleum sector has been performed from the methane emission point of view. Methane is emitted during the production of crude oil and natural gas. Although methane's lifetime in the atmosphere is much shorter than carbon dioxide, methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide. The flared gas amount of Turkey resulting from upstream petroleum activities were estimated and compared with the satellite data, which shows consistency. It is observed that the flared gas amount of Turkey based on the upstream petroleum activities is low due to the production level and the characteristics of crude oils. The annual flared volume of associated gas is estimated as 15 million m(3) and the vented methane is estimated as 3 million m(3). Carbon dioxide emission of the sector were also estimated with some assumptions. [Received: July 28, 2020; Accepted: October 22, 2020]

AB  - The Balts received God's counsel and energy and regained health in energetically strong places but the Latvian worldview formed on the thousands of years was encoded in the Lielvarde belt, which is Latvian womenfolk costume's element. Bishop (1199-1229) Albert founded the town of Riga for the Riga Bishopric centre on the right bank of the Daugava.It was the four-part Riga Old Town semicircledivided by two main streets as the cross.Soon after the Great Fire in 1214, the construction ofthe Riga Cathedralbegan tocreate sacral urban space in areasof the Old Town and the New Town of Riga (in nova civitate Rige).Now, eastwards of Lielvarde, landscape artist Shunmyo Masuno from Japan has visualized the Garden of Destiny, where people obtainsolace to the past, strength to the present and inspiration to follow dreams in the future. Through this set of relationships, architecture maintains the cosmological connection and dialogue with all the scales of the World. Research object: Latvian places for the worship of God.Research goal: analysis of Latvian urban sacral space. Research problem: common and different features of the sacral space of the Latvians and other nations have been little studied. Research novelty: detailed studies of generative design of sacral spaces and contemporary places of worship in Latvia. Research methods: analysis of archive documents, cartographic and urban planning materials, a study of published literature and inspection of sacral places in nature.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - The cities in Turkey are currently witnessing rapid, unplanned expansion, which needs to be regulated. Cittaslow Network-which comprises initiatives such as the prioritization of infrastructural projects, precise planning of sustainable cities, facilities to support people with disabilities, and the provision of renewable and eco-energy for vehicles-has the potential to facilitate better planning of the slow cities in Turkey. To control unplanned urban expansion and overcome infrastructural deficits, participation of the citizens in the Cittaslow Network is important in the rapidly expanding Turkish cities. Although Turkey currently has 18 slow cities, many other Turkish cities are undergoing the application process to qualify under this criterion. The built-up index, which is rarely opted for by researchers in Turkey but frequently used in studies abroad, has been used in this research. The built-up index is a model that extracts urban areas from satellite data. This model determines micro-urban structures and demonstrates the extent of urbanization. The temporal changes observed in 17 Cittaslow Cities in Turkey from 2002 to 2020 were examined in this research. The findings reveal that slow cities such as Yalvac, Akyaka, and Gokceada are expanding rapidly, whereas Cittaslow cities such as Vize, Uzundere, Goynuk, and Egirdir have been experiencing slow growth.

To assess the effects of fire on the flora and soil surface, we integrated field and remote sensing (RS) data to propose a local burn severity classification, which was later used to map and quantify the areas affected with different levels of severity. Also, this local classification was then compared with other three classifications developed in other ecosystems. Field estimations were based on the GeoCBI index and RS data was represented by dNBR, derived from Sentinel 2 images. The model relating GeoCBI and dNBR explained 87 % of data variability. All fires showed heterogeneous levels of burn severity within their boundaries. Overall, from the 280,853 ha burnt in large fires, most area was affected with moderate (48.5 %), followed by low (27.6 %) and high (23.9 %) burn severity. Shrublands and grasslands were affected with moderate to low severity, while forests had moderate to high burn severity, reinforcing the idea that fires represent a threat to forest conservation. The comparison between the local and other severity classifications showed underestimation of burn severity in two cases, while the other provided similar maps and statistics. Nevertheless, the biological and ecological meaning of these categories should not be extrapolated. These results demonstrated the importance of developing local burn severity classifications and the need for testing the suitability of foreign burn severity classifications when they are going to be applied in a different ecosystem than the one where they were proposed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are complex and diverse ecosystems, both in their biological characteristics and physical processes that determine their functioning. Their expression varies according to various factors, such as weather, geological environment, relationships between surface and groundwater and anthropogenic influence. The area is located at the confluence of the Atuel and Salado Rivers, in a semi-arid region within an extensive alluvial plain with many channels and flooded areas. The hydrological regime is drastically modified by upstream uses, which complicate the understanding of its functioning. The objective of the study was to describe changes in the spatial patterns of flooded areas, based on remote sensing with optical satellite images (Landsat 5TM, 8 OLI and Sentinel 2A). For the analysis of the inter-annual and monthly spatial variation, the events and continuous series between 1984 and 2017 were used. The surface and groundwater interaction was analyzed by comparing flows, variation of the water table and hydrochemistry. The activation of the wetlands shows an expansion and contraction related to the hydrological regime of both rivers, with a predominantly influential character. Groundwater gradients have the same direction as the surface flows. The lack of these flows drastically deteriorates chemical quality of the groundwater. The flooded pattern differs according to the magnitude of the runoff events. The synchronicity of high flows in both rivers determines the area expression of the wetlands and the surface outflow from the system.

AB  - The Romanist Hugo Schuchardt is best known today for his contributions to the study of language contact, language mixing and creole languages. Less well known are the theoretical requirements of such research, which Schuchardt established early in his career. This article uses Schuchardt's 1870 proof lecture "On the classification of Romance dialects" to point out the central theoretical lines and arguments that have crystallisation points in the critique of the genetic tree model and the search for alternatives, as well as a hitherto unknown but indispensable model for Schuchardt's linguistic worldview in the ideas of the American linguist William D.

AB  - One of the impacts of climate change is drought. Drought is a hydrological problem that significantly affects survival on earth. This study aims to identify drought through the approach of one of the indices related to water, namely Normalized Difference Latent Heat (NDLI). NDLI values were obtained through a multispectral Landsat OLI calculation process, namely band 3 - green, band 4 - red, and band 6 - SWIR. Each band interprets variables related to heat and water content. The coverage area of research is in the Maros watershed, which is one of the watershed supplying water to the city of Makassar. Maros watershed has an area of +/- 72,000 ha with relatively high human activity. NDLI values range from +1 to -1, where positive values indicate areas with good water content with latent heat and poor water content. In Maros watershed, NDLI values ranged from 0.37 to -0.25. Based Drought classification level, the level of drought in Maros watershed is moderately wet to moderately drought, and mildly wet is the most extensive drought levels in Maros watershed.

T2  - INTERLITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Yoko Tawada (1960) is for good reason one of the prime examples for contemporary German exophonic literature. She is a very successful writer in Japanese and in German and provides in her Germanophone writings an ethnography of the German worldview, as Wilhelm von Humboldt famously called languages, or of the German language-mindset. This article focuses on her 2010 poetry volume Abenteuer der deutschen Grammatik ('Adventures of German Grammar') to demonstrate how exophonia can allow us to develop an acute awareness of the ways in which language structures shape our patterns of thinking. Coming from a very differently organised language, Japanese, Tawada comments in playful ways on the implications of German, and compares it translinguistically with Japanese. Looking at German from an outside position enables her to be very creative and to make Germans discover their language with new eyes. Translingual writing, even though also present in a real mixing of languages in Tawada, appears here as a way to understand how much our ideas are shaped by our linguistic structures, and that there are alternative worldviews. It thus contributes greatly to a relativisation of one's own perspective and helps to open up to difference and creativity.

TI  - Measuring the degree of hydrological variability of riparian wetland using hydrological attributes integration (HAI) histogram comparison approach (HCA) and range of variability approach (RVA)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological variability (HA) in the river due to damming is well explored but there is a dearth of research about the HA on the riparian wetland. Time series data scarcity perhaps withstands against such research. The present work intended to measure the degree of HA of the river using flow data of gauge station and riparian wetland using time-series remote sensing data derived wetland indices as a proxy of water depth. For the first time, it is attempted to measure the degree of HA of wetland at pixel levels multi-analytical approaches like image-based hydrological attributes integration (HAI) approach, Histogram comparison approach (HCA), and Range of variability approach (RVA). The result has demonstrated that both river and wetlands have experienced sig-nificant HA after damming over the Atreyee river basin of India and Bangladesh. The degree of HA of the river in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons respectively are 35.73% and 20.90% as per HCA and 27% and 28% as per RVA. In the wetland, this degree is quite higher ( 66%) as per HCA and < 33% as per RVA over 68% to 84% area. Image centric HAI shows that 14.85% and 22.75% hydrologically rich wetland area is converted lower hydrological zones for NDWI and MNDWI indices. Remote sensing data based HA analysis is successful and can be used in other environments. This HA in consequence of the dam on river and wetland may lead to a reverse impact on wetland habitat and ecosystem. Maintenance of ecological flow is necessary to make the situation ecologically relevant.

TI  - Proposing multicriteria decision based valuation of ecosystem services for fragmented landscape in mountainous environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape structure or fragmentations have important effects on ecosystem services, with a common assumption being that fragmentation effects can reduce ecosystem services provision. Impact of Land use land cover (LULC) change on ecosystem service value is well explored techniques in recent times, but landscape fragmentation effect on ecosystem services value (ESV) is yet not quantitatively explored. The present work has intended to focus on the fragmentation effect on ESV introducing a new approach along with the effect of LULC change on ESV. All the analysis is done considering four times (1991, 2001, 2011, 2019) from Landsat images. Fragmentation analysis in ArcGis software has generated six hierarchic landscape units like patch, edge, perforated, small core, medium core and large core. For showing fragmentation effect ESV is computed for a typical LULC as a whole using Coefficient value (CV) of Costanza (1997) and 2014 and ESV of the fragmented landscapes using weighted CV based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Result has clearly demonstrated that due to fragmentation of forest and water body, a major means of qualitative degradation of eco-region, ESV of the respective lands have reduced from 24.43 to 20.57 million USD/year from 1991 to 2019. Total ESV of agriculture and built up land were respectively 43.62 and 4.15 million USD in 1991 and it was changed to 37.92 and 5.85 million USD in 2019. Computed ESV of forest without considering fragmentation effect is 14.68 million USD/year but it is diminuend only 5.71 million USD/year if fragmentation effect is considered in 2019. The ESV of the water body is six times lower in the fragmented landscape as per 2019. Anthropogenic effects have a paramount role for growing land use change, fragmentation and change of ESV in a natural landscape.

TI  - Monitoring the Vertical Land Motion of Tide Gauges and Its Impact on Relative Sea Level Changes in Korean Peninsula Using Sequential SBAS-InSAR Time-Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative sea-level changes from tide gauges in the Korean peninsula provide essential information to understand the regional and global mean sea-level changes. Several corrections to raw tide gauge records are required to account for coastal vertical land motion (VLM), regional and local coastal variability. However, due to the lack of in-situ measurements such as leveling data and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), making precise assessments of VLM at the tide gauges is still challenging. This study aims to address the above limitation to assess the VLM in the Korean tide gauges using the time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique. For 10 tide gauges selected in the Korean peninsula, we applied the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS)-Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to C-band Sentinel-1 A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired during 2014/10-2020/05, with the novel sequential interferograms pair selection approach to increase the slowly decorrelating filtered phase (SDFP) pixels density near the tide gauges. Our findings show that overall the tide gauges in the Korean peninsula are stable, besides the largest VLM observed at Pohang tide gauge station (East Sea) of about -26.02 mm/year; also, higher rates of uplift (>1 mm/year) were observed along the coast of Yellow Sea (Incheon TG and Boryeong TG) and higher rates of subsidence (<-2 mm/year) were observed at Jeju TG and Seogwipo TG. Our approach estimates the rate of VLM at selected tide gauges with an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution and is applicable when the in-situ and GNSS observations are not available.

AB  - Precision agriculture is increasingly considered as a powerful solution to mitigate the environmental impact of farming systems. This because of its ability to use multi-source information in decision support systems to increase the efficiency of farm management. Among the agronomic practices for which precision agriculture concepts were applied in research and operational contexts, variable rate (VR) nitrogen (N) fertilization plays a key role. A promising approach to make quantitative spatially distributed diagnoses to support VR N fertilization is based on the combined use of remote sensing information and few smart scouting-driven ground estimates to derive maps of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this study, a new smart app for field NNI estimates (PocketNNI) was developed, which can be integrated with remote sensing data and the environmental benefits related to its application were evaluated with Life Cycle Assessment approach. In particular, the environmental performances of rice fertilized according to VR information derived from the integration of Pocket NNI and satellite data was compared with a treatment based on uniform N application. Results showed that VR fertilization allowed reducing the environmental impact by 11.0% to 13.6% as compared to uniform N application. The highest environmental benefits were achieved in terms of energy consumption for fertilizer production and of emission of N compounds. These preliminary results are promising and provide a first quantitative indication of the environmental benefits that can be achieved when digital technologies are used to support N fertilization.

TI  - Environmental Drivers of Water Use for Caatinga Woody Plant Species: Combining Remote Sensing Phenology and Sap Flow Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the water use of Caatinga vegetation, the largest seasonally dry forest in South America. We identified and analysed the environmental phenological drivers in woody species and their relationship with transpiration. To monitor the phenological evolution, we used remote sensing indices at different spatial and temporal scales: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and green chromatic coordinate (GCC). To represent the phenology, we used the GCC extracted from in-situ automated digital camera images; indices calculated based on sensors included NDVI, SAVI and GCC from Sentinel-2A and B satellites images, and NDVI products MYD13Q1 and MOD13Q1 from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). Environmental drivers included continuously monitored rainfall, air temperature, soil moisture, net radiation, and vapour pressure deficit. To monitor soil water status and vegetation water use, we installed soil moisture sensors along three soil profiles and sap flow sensors for five plant species. Our study demonstrated that the near-surface GCC data played an important role in permitting individual monitoring of species, whereas the species' sap flow data correlated better with NDVI, SAVI, and GCC than with species' near-surface GCC. The wood density appeared to affect the transpiration cessation times in the dry season, given that species with the lowest wood density reach negligible values of transpiration earlier in the season than those with high woody density. Our results show that soil water availability was the main limiting factor for transpiration during more than 80% of the year, and that both the phenological response and water use are directly related to water availability when relative saturation of the soil profile fell below 0.25.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in coastal aquaculture area of Zhelin Bay
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Mariculture has become a major source of pollution in offshore waters. Chlorophyll-a, as a parameter of primary productivity, is an important indicator of water quality evaluation. We took Zhelin Bay of Guangdong Province as our study area. Using Sentinel-2 spectral image on September 4, 2018 and in-situ measured chlorophyll-a concentration, we constructed an estimation model of chlorophyll-a concentration to obtain the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration. In the chlorophyll-a concentration inversion model, we selected a linear regression model, a three-band model and the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) for comparative analysis. Through comparison and evaluation, a model with high inversion accuracy was used to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration in multiple months of 2018 and analyze its distribution characteristics. The results showed that the inversion accuracy of the NDCI model was significantly higher than that of the other models. The decision coefficient R-2 of the NDCI model was 0.8, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 9.7, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 0.99. The time applicability of the NDCI model was tested by the measured data, which showed that the NDCI model could more accurately and effectively estimated the spatial distribution characteristics of chlorophyll-a concentration. The chlorophyll-a concentration showed a trend of decreasing from nearshore to the outside of the bay. The overall trend of chlorophyll-a concentration in the aquaculture area was as follows: pond breeding area > tidal flat breeding area > cage culture area > floating raft breeding area. Under the influence of water exchange, rainfall and culture activities, the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the culture area of the fish pond was the lowest in February when the fish was in the seedling stage, and its change trend was February < April < June < December. This study provides a valuable reference for environmental monitoring of marine aquaculture waters in Zhelin Bay.

TI  - The potential of CO<sub>2</sub> satellite monitoring for climate governance: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Good-quality CO2 emission data are fundamental for effective climate policy and governance. Data manipulation should be deterred, while developing countries are generally weaker than developed countries in compiling bottom-up CO2 emission inventories due to less adequate data collection capacity. This paper assesses the capabilities of CO2 satellites as objective, independent, potentially low-cost and external data sources for monitoring energy-related anthropogenic CO2 emissions at regional/national, megacity and point-source geographical scales. After overviewing all major CO2 satellites, SCIAMACHY, GOSAT and OCO-2 are focused on due to their wider research applications and higher CO2 sensitivity in total column measurements that include near surface emissions. Nighttime light satellite data for proxy CO2 monitoring are also brought into comparison to distinguish the importance of direct CO2 satellite monitoring. Studies are reviewed from the perspectives of spatial and temporal capability and accuracy to comprehend the current statuses of applications, assess the strengths and weaknesses of research methods, investigate major challenges and propose suggestions for future progress. We conclude that CO2 satellite monitoring can strengthen the data foundation for implementing international climate treaties and domestic climate policies.

AB  - Assessing large-scale infrastructure systems and determining their health state under inservice or extreme hazard events post great challenges due to the less access in system level, particularly with the increase of their complexity. In this study, we explore the deep learning approaches integrated with computer vision for conditional assessment of large-scale systems through extracting critical information from the remote sensing data (e.g., satellite images or other resources). The original data were preprocessed on pixel level. The deep learning (R-CNN) model were selected and designed to gain each critical component condition. A full connected neural network was then used to assess the health state of the whole systems. The results demonstrated that the deep learning model accurately detected the damage location and level, while a full connected neural network effectively assisted the rapid identification and conditional assessment, thereby leading to high potential for large-scale bridges, and oil/gas pipeline assessment at both spatial and temporary scales over conventional methods, and particularly the deep learning quantitatively provided valuable information for infrastructure conditional assessment.

TI  - Meteorological driving factor of eutrophication in Lake Xingyun, Yunnan based on the Coupling Model of Wavelet analysis and Neural Network
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a link between changes of climate and the degree of eutrophication of lakes. Eutrophication of lakes has a negative impact on human health, ecosystems, and socioeconomics. Based on statistical data and remote sensing data, coupling models of Morlet wavelet analysis and BP neural network in different time scales were used to analyze the eutrophication trends of Lake Xingyun in Yunnan from 1986 to 2011 and their multi-scale relationships with the climatic variables including monthly precipitation, monthly average temperature, monthly average wind speed, and monthly sunshine duration. The results show that the fluctuation period of climatic factors are important for affecting the monthly variation in the bloom intensity. The coupling models of Morlet wavelet analysis and BP neural network can effectively improve the accuracy of data fitting. Goodness of fit of the optimal coupling model is 0.605 which is higher than the BP neural network's goodness of fit (0.292). The optimal coupling model can analysis and describe eutrophication better than the BP neural network. The mean square error and the correlation coefficients of the optimal coupling model were better than those by the BP neural network. The monthly average temperature was the dominant climatic factor affecting the eutrophication of Lake Xingyun, followed by the monthly precipitation, monthly average wind speed and monthly sunshine duration in the optimal coupling model. In conclusion, we show that the coupling models of Morlet wavelet analysis and BP neural network, which has better adaptability to periodically changing sample data and higher prediction accuracy than the BP neural network, can provide reliable reference for the protection and eutrophication control of Lake Xingyun.

TI  - Analysis of Variation Characteristics and Driving Factors of Tonle Sap Lake's Surface Water Temperature from 2001 to 2018
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) has a significant impact on aquatic ecosystem. This study aimed to reveal the variations and driving factors of LSWT in Tonle Sap Lake, the largest freshwater lake in South Asia. For this purpose, the datasets of LSWT-day, atmospheric temperature (AT), lake surface area (LSA), watershed land use and cover change (WLUCC) were extracted based on MODIS products and AT images by remote sensing technology. Then, through GIS geospatial analysis technology and mathematical statistical methods, the spatial-temporal variations of LSWT-day, AT, LSA and WLUCC were analyzed, and the relationships between LSWT-day and AT, LSA, WLUCC were further discussed. Results showed that: 1) from 2001 to 2018, the annual mean LSWT-day and AT showed a significant warming trend. AT was a main driving factor affecting LSWT in Tonle Sap Lake. 2) LSA showed a slightly decreasing tendency and had an obvious negative correlation with LSWT-day, which was an important factor affecting LSWT. 3) WLUCC had undergone drastic changes and its influence on LSWT could not be ignored. In summary, this paper fills the gap of the long-term series of LSWT research in Tonle Sap Lake and enhances the understanding of LSWT changing mechanism for similar lakes.

CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - To obtain the fine characteristics of the atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption spectrum, the imaging spectrometer must have high spectral resolution, but the volume of the instrument will increase simultaneously which is not conducive to remote sensing detection on satellite platforms. To solve this problem, we used a silicon immersion grating as dispersion element that diffraction occurs inside the silicon grating medium, the dispersion and spectral resolution are increased by 3.4 times respect to the conventional grating, and the volume of the spectrometer can be reduced to 1/40 at most. Smile is introduced because of the dispersion difference of light between the non-principal section and the principal section, which affects the spectral fidelity, data retrieval and detection accuracy. We established a model to analyze the smile by the silicon immersion grating and used the distortion of off-axis lens to correct. To miniaturize the instrument, optical system adopted the Littrow structure that the dimension is 410 mmx130 mmx110 mm. The optical system works in the short-wave infrared carbon dioxide weak absorption band 1.594-1.624 mu m with a spectral resolution of 0.08 nm, entrance slit length is 16 mm and F number is 2. The optimized MTF is greater than 0.87 at the Nyquist frequency of the detector, the RMS radius of the spot diagram is within the Airy disk, and the maximum smile is less than 0.1 mu m, which is less than 1% of a single detector pixel. The optical system has excellent imaging performance, meeting the requirements of atmospheric carbon dioxide detection.

TI  - Assessment Methods of Small Watershed Ecosystem Health
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of watershed ecosystem health promotes the construction of ecological civilisation in China, and assessment results are an important basis for watershed planning and management. At present, research on and application of small watershed ecosystem health assessment in China are deficient. Thus, small watershed protection and management in China are restricted. The research object of this study is a small watershed of Changqing River in Yongtai County of Fuzhou City. Using satellite image data, digital elevation data as well as field and monitoring data combined with 3S technology, the health status of the small watershed ecosystem was evaluated by three assessment systems consisting of remote sensing data, measured survey data and multi-source data. The watershed ecosystem health status was quantitatively analysed, and a comparative analysis with the results of different evaluation methods was conducted. Results show that, in general, the comprehensive indexes of ecosystem health obtained by the three evaluation methods are 70.29, 77.68 and 63.87. The evaluation results support the notion that the research status of the watershed ecosystem is satisfactory. The overall ecosystem health status of the high mountains sub-watershed in the northwest and in the southwest of the watershed is relatively acceptable but that of the middle and lower reaches is relatively poor. Finally, the evaluation results of the three methods were compared, and their differences were analysed, it can provide a basic idea for the ecosystem health evaluation of the small watershed.

TI  - Understanding Urban Expansion on the Tibetan Plateau over the Past Half Century Based on Remote Sensing: The Case of Xining City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is an important area that affects global sustainable development. Quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization is crucial for maintaining the sustainability on the TP. This study took Xining City, the largest city on the TP, as an example to understand the urban expansion in this region in the past 50 years. We combined the high-resolution spy satellite data and China's long-term urban land dataset (CULD) to quantify the urban expansion of Xining City. The object-oriented random forest classification was performed to extract urban land from spy satellite data in 1969, and the inter-annual correction was used to combine urban land information from 1969 to 2017. We found that the proposed approach can accurately quantify the urban expansion of Xining City over the past half century with an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Such high accuracy benefits from the fine resolution of spy satellite data and the consistency of CULD. We also found that Xining City experienced accelerated and fragmented urban sprawl to higher altitude areas, as a result of socioeconomic development and topographical limitations. The acceleration of urban expansion was more obvious, and the urban landscape fragmentation was more serious at high altitude areas. Such urban expansion encroached on cropland and grassland, and caused increased risks of landslides and other geological disasters. Therefore, Xining City urgently needs to promote the development of compact cities to control urban sprawl at higher altitude areas and provide a reference for improving urban sustainability across the TP. In this study, we analyzed the urban expansion of Xining city from 1969 to 2017, and provided a reliable way to understand the long-term spatiotemporal urbanization based on remote sensing, which has the potential for wide applications. In addition, the extracted urban information can help to improve the urban sustainability of Xining City and the entire TP.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The study is an effort to map analytically fire hazard zones and assess the fire risk within Cephalonia and Ithaca islands (in western Greece), utilizing modern and reliable Sentinel 2 satellite multispectral imagery as well as several other related geospatial datasets. According to the extracted zonal statistics in relation to the natural factors, the "moderate" to "high" hazard of fire exists in areas with a predominant vegetation structure of sparse shrubs and trees, slopes ranging between 10-30% and aspect of land surfaces of mainly north to east or northwest orientation. Regarding anthropogenic factors, it appears that the zones of "moderate" to "very high" hazard are located at a distance of more than six hundred meters from the roads and more than three kilometres from the settlements. The final map of the potential fire risk areas, is a reliable informational background for updated strategical plans of forest fires in the Cephalonia and Ithaca islands, indicating areas, locations and routes for planning actions or establishment of appropriate infrastructure, aiming at early warning and decrease of the forest fires across the whole study area.

AB  - In the present work deep-learning based super-resolution (SR) is applied on Sentinel-2 images of the Zakynthos island, Greece, with the intention of detecting stress levels in supercentenarian olive trees due to water deficiency. The aim of this study is monitoring the stress in supercentenarian olive trees over time and over season. Specifically, the Carotenoid Reflectance Index 2 (CRI2) is calculated utilizing the Sentinel-2 bands B2 and B5. CRI2 maps at 10m and at 2.5mspatial resolutions are generated. In fact, the images of band B2 with original spatial resolution 10m are super-resolved to 2.5m. Regarding the images of band B5, these are SR resolved from 20m firstly to 10m and secondly to 2.5m. Deep-learning based SR techniques, namely DSen2 and RakSRGAN, are utilized for enhancing the spatial resolution to 10m and 2.5m. The following five seasons are considered autumn 2019, spring 2019, spring 2020, summer 2019 and summer 2020. In the future, comparisons with field measurements could better assess for the proposed methodology effectiveness regarding the recognition of stress levels in very old olive trees.

TI  - COMPARISON OF GEOBIA CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS BASED ON WORLDVIEW-3 IMAGERY IN THE EXTRACTION OF COASTAL CONIFEROUS FOREST
T2  - SUMARSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - With their ecological, economic, aesthetic, and social function, coniferous forests represent an important part of European forest communities. The main objective of this paper is to compare the most used GEOBIA (Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis) classification algorithms (Random Trees - RT, Maximum Likelihood - ML, Support Vector Machine - SVM) for the purposes of the coastal coniferous forest detection on a high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery on the topographic basin of the Split settlement (Figure 1). The methodological framework (Figure 2) includes: (1) derivation of a sharpened multispectral image (WV-3MS) (Figure 3); (2) testing of the user-defined parameters in segmentation process (Figure 4); (3) marking of test samples (signatures); (4) classification of a segmented model; (5) accuracy assessment of the classification algorithms, and (6) accuracy assessment of the final model. The developed ACP tool (Automated Classification Process) (Supplement figure 5) for speeding up the entire classification process, enabled the simultaneous generation of output results for three selected classification algorithms (RT, ML and SVM) (Figure 6). Metric indicators (correctness - COR, completeness - COM, and overall quality - OQ) have shown that RT is the most accurate classification algorithm for the coastal coniferous forest detection (Table 1; Figure 7). The iterative setting of segmentation parameters enabled the detection of the most optimal values for generating a segmentation model. It is found that shadows can cause significant problems if classification is done on high-resolution images (Figure 8). The solution may be to collect a larger number of samples in different areas for the purpose of more detailed class differentiation. The modified Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) indicator shown the accuracy of the final model of 87.38% (Table 2; Figure 9). WV-3MS can be considered as very good data for the detection of coniferous forests using the GEOBIA method (Figure 10). According to this research, 31.36% of the Split topographic basin is covered by highly and extremely flammable vegetation.

TI  - Morphology-based spatial filtering for efficiency enhancement of remote sensing image fusion
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Better visual interpretation and high-level feature extraction are always desired for remotely sensed image processing applications. The fulfillment is most prominent when a Multi-Spectral (MS) image fused with a PANchromatic (PAN) image for the same geographic location produces another MS image with added spatial resolution. Development of such fusion algorithms based on approaches like Component Substitution (CS) and Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) is continuously researched over the last few decades. In this paper, the authors propose the morphological operator-based image fusion algorithm featuring nonlinear decomposition. Also, the use of morphological operator based spatial filtering is successfully demonstrated for efficiency enhancement of the proposed and a few of the sophisticated image fusion algorithms based on CS, MRA, and state-of-the-art deep learning approach. The potential of the presented work is proved through reduced-and full-resolution assessment procedures utilizing two data sets acquired by WorldView-3 and WorldView-2 satellite sensors.

AB  - Accurate aerosol optical depth (AOD) forecasting aids in the air quality analysis as it is an important parameter that provides a quantitative measure of aerosols existing in the atmosphere. To an extent, to date, AOD forecasting has been limited to conventional statistical methods such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). Prophet models have gained popularity recently due to their simple interpretable parameters and efficiency in dealing with strong seasonal time-series data. This paper aims at the development and analysis of Prophet Model for the AOD forecasting across Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Trivandrum in India based on the monthly mean AOD(550nm), data obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over 19 years (2001 to 2019). Conventional SARIMA model is used to validate the performances of the Prophet model. The forecasts for the upcoming 5 years were implemented at a 95 percent confidence interval. The model evaluation was carried out based on the performance metrics and the execution time taken. The performance metrics considered are the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The Prophet Model performed reasonably better than the SARIMA model with the lowest MAPE and RMSE in all four regions. The correlation obtained by the Prophet Model are 0.83, 0.79, 0.522, and 0.55 and by SARIMA are 0.81, 0.76, 0.520, and 0.51 across Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Trivandrum respectively. Prophet based models took only a few seconds to execute, unlike SARIMA which took a minimum of half an hour.

TI  - The significance of sheep and beef farms to conservation of native vegetation in New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relying solely on public conservation lands for habitat provision will be inadequate for achieving national conservation goals. Production landscapes in New Zealand make up 60% of the land area and contain potential conservation habitat however, the amount of native vegetation they contain is poorly known. While there have been previous assessments of native vegetation cover in New Zealand, no study has undertaken a national-scale assessment of multiple native vegetation cover types on different land uses. This absence limits the potential to manage production landscapes for conservation. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by using GIS and remote-sensing data to estimate the area of native vegetation, including forests, grasslands and wetlands, present on different land-use classes and in different environments. We found that while most of the country's remaining native vegetation was found on public conservation land, it was not evenly distributed across land environments and was biased towards high-elevation vegetation types. Yet private land, in particular sheep and beef farms, contained a quarter of the remaining native vegetation in the country, and 17% of remaining native forest. While this vegetation was often highly fragmented, it contained forest types that were otherwise under-represented on public conservation land. We conclude that sheep and beef farms in New Zealand have the potential to add to nationwide conservation efforts. However, realising this potential will involve improving the connectivity, area and quality of native vegetation.

TI  - Stylistic and Semantic Features of Epitaphs (Based on Texts of Provincial Cemeteries in Perm Krai). Part I
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The first part of the article describes the stylistic features of poetic epitaphs recorded during field surveys of provincial cemeteries in Perm Krai in 2019. These texts have not only historical and source-study, but also cultural value. The establishment of the features of the broad epitaph heritage in a particular historical period leads to an understanding of the worldview of representatives of everyday life of the given time. When classifying the material, the author took into account the nature of authorship and the genre function. On these grounds, the collected texts are divided into four groups. Group 1 is folklore texts for which the epitaph function is initial. These are epitaphs generated in the folk environment, they are characterized by anonymity, a characteristic set of topics, variability, a high degree of formulaicity and a typified subject. They are broadcast not only in real conditions, but also on the Internet. Group 2 is folklore texts for which the epitaph function is secondary. Such texts are a rare occurrence in cemetery poetry associated with subcultural folklore. Group 3 is authorial texts for which the epitaph function is initial. This group is organized by anonymous works of amateur nature. Fixed in a single copy, they do not find variants either in cemeteries or on the Internet. The stylistic differences between naive epitaphs and folk epitaphs are reduced to the individualization of the dead through their lifetime qualities, as well as the manifestation of the author's poetic talent. Group 4 is authorial texts for which the epitaph function is secondary. According to the genre of the source, these works belong to poems, novels, dramas, literary epitaphs, aphorisms, and songs. Poetic quotations in the function of epitaphs can be transmitted verbatim or be reworked in accordance with new content and stylistic tasks. In addition to these categories, the studied material also reveals as a transitional phenomenon, when a popular text loses its connection with the author and functions as a folk text. The basis for identifying transient phenomena is provided by Internet statistics. In the final section of the first part, conclusions are drawn about 1) the prevalence of epitaph texts in the cemetery space of the province; 2) the correlation of the author's classification with previous works on the style of epitaphs; 3) the thematic features of cemetery poetry; 4) the presence of regional specificity in the presented set of texts.

The observed InSAR LOS displacement only measure displacement toward and away from satellite sensor, thus is rather hard to be used in depicting the deformation source intuitively. Here we attempt to resolve 2.5-D coseismic surface deformation due to the 2020 Elazig (Turkey) Earthquake by using three coseismic interferometric pair of Sentinel-1 data. The 2.5-D surface deformation show a dominant westward motion with maximum displacement of 3.92 m, which is located southwest to the earthquake epicenter. Additionally, maximum ground subsidence of 0.29 m is detected at southern area of the earthquake epicenter. The estimated 2.5-D displacement is consistent with the typical surface displacement generated by sinistral strike-slip fault. Significant westward motion also indicates that the fault is characterized by left-lateral motion. To validate these findings, LOS displacement from both ascending and descending orbits were inverted for the source model of this event. The preferred source model shows two asperities with a maximum slip of 2.6 and 4.4 m, respectively, concentrated at a depth between 5 and 12 km, releasing a geodetic moment of 1.54 x 10E+19 Nm (Mw = 6.7). Primary slip mechanism of this event is left-lateral strike-slip motion confirming the finding of 2.5-D displacement analysis.

AB  - In this work a precipitated water long-term data array is collected for the period since 2006 to 2019 over the Black Sea region. A comparative research of MODIS Terra / Aqua satellite data and ground AERONET network photometer measurements was carried out. The monthly average arrays were analyzed and the trends of PW parameter changes were revealed. Comparative analysis showed a deviation upwards of 0,40 cm from satellite measurements from AERONET measurements. This amount of discrepancy falls within the confidence interval of values and is the acceptable range of errors. PW data for AERONET stations have a high correlation with MODIS satellite data (95%).

TI  - Monitoring Invasive Plant Species Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The species richness and biodiversity of vegetation in Hungary are increasingly threatened by invasive plant species brought in from other continents and foreign ecosystems. These invasive plant species have spread aggressively in the natural and semi-natural habitats of Europe. Common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) is one of the species that pose the greatest ecological menace. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to map and monitor the spread of common milkweed, the most common invasive plant species in Europe. Furthermore, the possibilities to detect and validate this special invasive plant by analyzing hyperspectral remote sensing data were investigated. In combination with field reference data, high-resolution hyperspectral aerial images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform in 138 spectral bands in areas infected by common milkweed were examined. Then, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms were applied to the highly accurate field reference data. As a result, common milkweed individuals were distinguished in hyperspectral images, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.95% in the case of supervised SVM classification. Using the ANN model, an overall accuracy of 99.61% was achieved. To evaluate the proposed approach, two experimental tests were conducted, and in both cases, we managed to distinguish the individual specimens within the large variety of spreading invasive species in a study area of 2 ha, based on centimeter spatial resolution hyperspectral UAV imagery.

TI  - Quality assessment of the PRODES Cerrado deforestation data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prominent role assumed by Brazil in the global environmental agenda in recent years has prompted the creation of legal provisions and the formulation of environmental policies and instruments aimed at improved and sustainable territorial governance. Within this context, the Brazilian government implemented in 2016, with the support of the Forest Investment Program (FIP), the first systematic and official monitoring initiative focused on the detection of vegetation suppression (since 2000) in the Cerrado, the second largest biome in Brazil and a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we assess, based on sampling procedures and field work, the quality of the PRODES Cerrado data, which is being generated according to the well-known and consolidated PRODES Amaz <^>onia methodology. Our sample-based validation indicated an overall accuracy of 93.17 +/- 0.89% (in line with the four fieldworks findings) and that the anthropization process in the Cerrado surpassed 50% of the biome in 2013, a situation identified by the PRODES Cerrado only in 2018. Although this discrepancy, there is a very good convergence between the PRODES Cerrado data and the sample estimates in more recent years. In fact, the PRODES Cerrado is a product in process of continuous improvement, in which the quality of the detected deforestation increases over the years. Therefore, the PRODES Cerrado monitoring system is adequate to be used in support of governance instruments capable of curbing or even zeroing deforestation in the biome, where, as our study revealed, there are similar to 104,000 km(2) of abandoned land, which could be used for the expansion of the Brazilian agricultural production in the coming years.

TI  - Association between Influenza Vaccine Administration and Primary Care Consultations for Respiratory Infections: Sentinel Network Study of Five Seasons (2014/2015-2018/2019) in the UK
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza, a vaccine preventable disease, is a serious global public health concern which results in a considerable burden on the healthcare system. However, vaccine hesitancy is increasingly becoming a global problem. One prevalent misconception is that influenza vaccinations can cause the flu. We carried out this study to determine whether people undertaking influenza vaccination presented less with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) and influenza-like-illness (ILI) following vaccination. We utilised the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel database to examine English patients who received vaccination between 2014/2015 and 2018/2019. Of the 3,841,700 influenza vaccinations identified, vaccination details and primary care respiratory consultation counts were extracted to calculate the relative incidence (RI) per exposure risk period using the self-controlled case series methodology. Results showed a significant increase in the RI of respiratory consultation rates within fourteen days of vaccination across all five years. Less than 6.2% of vaccinations led to consultations for ARTI or ILI in primary care (crude consultation rate 6196 per 100,000). These findings, particularly if confirmed in further research, may reduce the risk of cross-infection between waiting patients and increase uptake of influenza vaccine.

T2  - Cancer treatment and research communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Ultrasound is the recommended modality to assess axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer; nevertheless, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) diagnostic efficiency, to identify suspicious lesions, is also considered. We aim to report discrepancies in ultrasound and 18F-FDG PET/CT results.METHODS: This single-centered retrospective analysis selected consecutive patients with invasive ductal biopsy-proven breast cancer, for whom divergent 18F-FDG PET/CT and axillary ultrasound imaging (and/or core needle biopsy if available) had been performed, and described clinical, histological, imaging, and surgery data.RESULTS: This retrospective study included 560 patients and identified discordant results between 18F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound (suspicious 18F-FDG PET/CT and normal ultrasound imaging and/or core needle biopsy) in 20 (4%) patients. Axillary lymph node involvement was confirmed in 17 (85%) out of these 20 patients. Further, the lymph nodes were smaller than one centimeter in 12 (60%) patients, macrometastasic involvement (involvement >2mm) was detected in 13 (65%) patients, and more than 3 macrometastases were detected in 6 (30%) patients. All patients had an aggressive breast cancer. The sentinel node biopsy performed in 9 (45%) patients allowed to reveal lymph node involvement, even in cases of macrometastatic involvement.CONCLUSION: Discordant results were issued from normal ultrasound imaging and/or core needle biopsy, and suspicious 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed that 18F-FDG PET/CT may overcome axillary ultrasound limits in the specific case of aggressive breast cancers, especially for axillary lymph nodes smaller than 1 centimeter. Sentinel node biopsy remains a valuable aid, even in patients with macrometastatic involvement.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the case conceptualization of biblical counseling. Case conceptualization is the process of establishing goals and strategies by analyzing the client’s information in counseling and is composed of structures and hypotheses. In terms of structure, the Sperry & Sperry model is widely used as the definition of case conceptualization as it is and in terms of hypotheses, major elements for case conceptualization have been proposed in various counseling theory approaches. In Christian counseling, it has been emphasized that the biblical worldview, perspective on human beings and ‘change model’are reflected. Len Sperry proposed a counseling model that integrates pastoral counseling and spiritual direction and showed the possibility that reflects the spiritual dimension and evaluates spiritual elements in an integrated way. Therefore, the model can be used for biblical counseling case conceptualization. In particular, it was suggested to review the existing case conceptualization factors by prioritizing the authority of the Bible as well as the biblical perspective on human beings and change model in the analysis of Predisposition and Perpetuants. What is important is the perspective of the counselor with this spiritual awareness. This study is meaningful in that it provides insight into biblical counseling and education by examining the applicability of case conceptualization of biblical counseling centering on the Sperry’s model.

AB  - As the rapidly changing VUCA worldview has become more important recently, Universal Design needs to establish a design strategy that presents experiences that can satisfy psychologically and sensibly in addition to functions that vary widely and assist users in need of consideration. Unlike the general public, visually impaired people have low independence in their daily lives and need various help for their lives, but there are very few household development cases with universal design for the visually impaired in the household environment. Therefore, this study proposed a furniture design with safety, clarity, and aesthetics in consideration of the specificity of visually impaired users that are not well covered in Korea. In addition, by analyzing cases of universal indoor furniture at home and abroad for the blind, problems were identified, and design development based on user-centered processes and PPP evaluation was developed, and design furniture emphasizing safety maximizing curvature, aesthetics satisfaction of users, and quantitative evaluation of non-visual information. Through design development cases based on systematic methodology in this study, it is expected that it will be helpful in future universal design research as data for product development that considers indoor life for the blind in the future.

AB  - The goal of the study is to analyze why ‘the usage of the fallen flowers’ in Hwang Seok-yeong’s Novel Baridegi, and the traditional epic Bari Gongju. In order to analyze the difference, the Theory of the Novel by Lukacs Gyorgy was used, mainly what is ‘the stars’ that Lukacs emphasized in the modern world, and how ‘stars’ and ‘the usage of the fallen flowers’ are related. As the result of the analysis, the research could find that ‘the stars’ was an individual’s ‘virtue’, which is accompanied by sacrifice. The world of Baridegi is, unlike that of Bari Gongju,utilizes ‘the usage of the fallen flowers’ without sacrifice,meaning that ‘the star’ is non-existent. The study confirmed that in Hwang Seok-yeong’s Baridegi, an individual ‘Bari’ left leeway to the recovery of the era where ‘the star’ existed, by not using one ‘fallen flower.’ In doing so, the study expanded the meaning of the novel, and provided different ways to read into the text, based on Lukacs’ novel theories.

TI  - Estimation of Spatially Continuous Near-Surface Relative Humidity Over Japan and South Korea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface relative humidity (RHns) is an essential meteorological parameter for water, carbon, and climate studies. However, spatially continuous RHns estimation is difficult due to the spatial discontinuity of in situ observations and the cloud contamination of satellite-based data. This article proposed machine learning-based models to estimate spatially continuous daily RHns at 1 km resolution over Japan and South Korea under all sky conditions and examined the spatiotemporal patterns of RHns. All sky estimation of RHns using machine learning has been rarely conducted, and it can be an alternative to the currently available RHns data mostly from numerical models, which have relatively low spatial resolution. We combined two schemes for clear sky conditions (scheme A, which uses satellite and reanalysis data) and cloudy sky conditions (scheme B, which uses reanalysis data solely). The relatively small numbers of data in extremely low and high RHns conditions (i.e., <30% or >70%, respectively) were augmented by applying an oversampling method to avoid biased training. The machine learning models based on random forest (RF) and XGBoost were trained and validated using 94 in situ observation sites from meteorological administrations of both countries from 2012 to 2017. The results showed that XGBoost produced slightly better performance than RF, and the spatially continuous RHns model combined based on XGBoost yielded the coefficient of determination of 0.72 and a root-mean-square error of 10.61%. Spatiotemporal patterns of the estimated RHns agreed with in situ observations, reflecting the effect of topography on RHns. We expect that the proposed RHns model could be used in various environmental studies that require RHns under all sky conditions as input data.

AB  - This paper compares and examines the fantasy genre that is currently popular in Korea and Japan, and examines its internal logic. Through this, it is revealed that subculture genre literature also includes a social masterplot, and in particular, among the fantasy genres, the form of Isekai objects and their derivative genres is an effective means of realizing problem consciousness and narrative solution method for contemporary reality. Focusing on locality, the fact that genre literature is not composed only of the fads among enthusiastic readers or the inner logic of the web novel ecosystem, but reflects the psychological situation and desire of the members of the community in a contemporary context and in a broad sense. I have looked at it. It also emphasizes the fact that the narrative composition, genre format, and comprehensive masterplot reflecting this change according to locality.Genre literature including web novels cannot be defined or classified as simply setting, worldview, and iconic understanding. Despite being a common genre in Korea and Japan, their perceptions of the world and alternative means of problem solving are quite different. Through imaginary regression, Japanese things from different worlds replace the world itself with microscopic ties that can provide a stronger sense of belonging even though they are independent of the real world. On the other hand, Korea's Isekai objects are used as a tool to visualize and show fantasy in reality rather than using the other world as an alternative world.Therefore, the problem solving method does not bypass the other world, but utilizes the fantasy and ideology of people who deeply reflect the structural problems of the real world. It strongly reflects today's surplus meritocracy as the structural logic of the narrative. However, this structural fantasy is still subordinate to the structure that reproduces the problem. Therefore, in order to try other alternative means to overcome this, the fantasy genre of Korea is reborn as a variety of derivative genres, not the basic form of Isekai.

AB  - Recently, the number of damages on social infrastructure has increased due to natural disasters and the frequency of earthquake events that are higher than magnitude 3 has increased in South Korea. Liquefaction was found near the epicenter of a 5.4 magnitude earthquake that occurred in Pohang, South Korea, in 2017. To explore increases in soil moisture index due to soil liquefaction, changes in the remote exploration index by the land cover before and post-earthquake occurrence were analyzed using liquefaction feasibility index and multi-cyclical Landsat-8 satellite images. We found that the soil moisture index(SMI) in the liquefaction region immediately after the earthquake event increased significantly using the Normal Vegetation Index(NDVI) and Surface Temperature(LST).

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to apply the random forest (RF), XGBoost, and LightGBM machine learning (ML) algorithms to land cover classification, and to present the model tuning process for each algorithm. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used for land cover classification, and the land cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea was used as label data. Each ML algorithm was applied using the constructed dataset. In addition, each ML algorithm was optimized by three methods (grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization). The grid search took the longest time to optimize the hyperparameters because it required the highest number of search iterations, but the accuracy was highest. The random search was the fastest method of optimizing the hyperparameters. The accuracy of XGBoost was the highest for each ML algorithm. The prediction of XGBoost was the most consistent with the land cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment. However, the LightGBM algorithm has a major advantage in terms of the algorithm optimization and application time. Therefore, our study is meaningful in that we obtained a higher accuracy and shorter time for each ML algorithm.

AB  - Everyone expects that the ecology of the church, including worship, will change rapidly in the “new normal” era. Even in order to avoid being accused of taking the lead in spreading the virus, the church was faced with the change in communication techniques in the non-face-to-face era. As non-face-to-face communication continues for a long time, online demand has surged, and only a portion of all church members are attending in-person worship. The time has come for a theological guideline for the future of Korean Protestant worship that takes advantage of dynamic prayer and praise.In this situation, it is necessary to break away from the passive position that insists on the legitimacy and necessity of online worship, and to establish the theological establishment of the difference between the world experienced online and the world experience experienced offline. Since online experiences do not accompany physical experiences, it is necessary to reconsider the existing idea that they are temporary and unreal experiences that replace reality.In the real world where online/offline, real/non-real, physical/virtual space are intricately intertwined with each other and deeply penetrate each other’s lives, the dualism that divides these two extremes divides the world itself. “I” in the virtual space and “I” in the physical space interact and share perceptions, but it becomes difficult to determine which experiences are real and which ones are not. However, new elements cannot be immediately absorbed into this worldview. To become part of this world from disorder, one must pass through a stage called chaos. The deconstruction of the boundaries of certainty/uncertainty, reality/image, fact/story, reality/virtuality, and science/fantasy causes chaos. However, transition is necessary for the future, and chaos is inevitable at this transitional stage.Religion is no longer a social system that produces active norms. Religion should pay attention to the change of religious experience according to the new social

TI  - Prediction of Active Microwave Backscatter Over Snow-Covered Terrain Across Western Colorado Using a Land Surface Model and Support Vector Machine Regression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this article is to develop a physically constrained support vector machine (SVM) to predict C-band backscatter over snow-covered terrain as a function of geophysical inputs that reasonably represent the relevant characteristics of the snowpack. Sentinel-1 observations, in conjunction with geophysical variables from the Noah-MP land surface model, were used as training targets and input datasets, respectively. Robustness of the SVM prediction was analyzed in terms of training targets, training windows, and physical constraints related to snow liquid water content. The results showed that a combination of ascending and descending overpasses yielded the highest coverage of prediction (15.2%) while root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 2.06 to 2.54 dB and unbiased RMSE ranged from 1.54 to 2.08 dB, but that the combined overpasses were degraded compared with ascending-only and descending-only training target sets due to the mixture of distinctive microwave signals during different times of the day (i.e., 6 a.m. versus 6 p.m. local time). Elongation of the training window length also increased the spatial coverage of prediction (given the sparsity of the training sets), but resulted in introducing more random errors. Finally, delineation of dry versus wet snow pixels for SVM training resulted in improving the accuracy of predicted backscatter relative to training on a mixture of dry and wet snow conditions. The overall results suggest that the prediction accuracy of the SVM was strongly linked with the first-order physics of the electromagnetic response of different snow conditions.

AB  - It is very essential to estimate the water body area using remote exploration for water resource management, analysis and prediction of water disaster damage. Hydrophysical detection using satellites has been mainly performed on large satellites equipped with optical and SAR sensors. However, due to the long repeat cycle, there is a limitation that timely utilization is impossible in the event of a disaster/disaster. With the recent active development of Micro satellites, it has served as an opportunity to overcome the limitations of time resolution centered on existing large satellites. The Micro satellites currently in active operation are ICEYE in Finland and Capella satellites in the United States, and are operated in the form of clusters for earth observation purposes. Due to clustering operation, it has a short revisit cycle and high resolution and has the advantage of being able to observe regardless of weather or day and night with the SAR sensor mounted. In this study, the operation status and characteristics of micro satellites were described, and the water area estimation technology optimized for micro SAR satellite images was applied to the Daecheong Dam basin on the Korean Peninsula. In addition, accuracy verification was performed based on the reference value of the water generated from the optical satellite Sentinel-2 satellite as a reference. In the case of the Capella satellite, the smallest difference in area was shown, and it was confirmed that all three images showed high correlation. Through the results of this study, it was confirmed that despite the low NESZ of Micro satellites, it is possible to estimate the water area, and it is believed that the limitations of water resource/water disaster monitoring using existing large SAR satellites can be overcome.

T2  - Archives of Hand and Microsurgery
M3  - research-article
AB  - Breast cancer-related lymphedema is a major complication of breast cancer surgery. The lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach, a surgical technique that can prevent breast cancer-related lymphedema, creates a lymphovenous bypass between the damaged axillary lymphatics during axillary lymph node dissection and the axillary vein. We report a case using the unilateral lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach in a patient with bilateral breast cancer. A 58-year-old woman diagnosed with bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma underwent a bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy. The lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach was performed on the left side after axillary lymph node dissection; the lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach was not performed after axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy on the right side. Six months after the surgery, MD Anderson Cancer Center stage 2 lymphedema was observed in the lymphography images of the right arm, where the lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach had not been performed.

AB  - This paper implements and verifies the notch filter based anti-jamming scheme, which has been conventionally proposed to enhance the survivability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). As a performance metrics, this paper employs signal to noise ratio (SNR), initial synchronization acquisition time, and anti-jamming performance against to the tone jamming signal. According to the hardware implementation and performance test results, in case of low jamming to signal ratio (JSR), the proposed scheme shows the lower SNR performance(approximately less than 1 dB or similar depending on bandwidth) because the proposed scheme suppresses the more effective signal than the conventional nulling-based anti-jamming scheme.However, in case of higher JSR (e.g. 20 dB), the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional scheme because jamming signals are much more suppressed than the effective signal(approximately 1∼4 dB better performance regardless of bandwidth). In conclusion, it is expected that the proposed notch based anti-jamming scheme will improve the survivability and reliability of a satellite data link if it is applied to a satellite-based datalink system.

AB  - Groundwater recharge rates vary widely by location and with time. They are difficult to measure directly and are thus often estimated using simulations. This study employed frequency and regression analysis and a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm in a machine learning method to estimate groundwater recharge. CART algorithms are considered for the distribution of precipitation by subbasin (PCP), geomorphological data, indices of the relationship between vegetation and landuse, and soil type. The considered geomorphological data were digital elevaion model (DEM), surface slope (SLOP), surface aspect (ASPT), and indices were the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), normalized difference residue index (NDRI). The spatio-temperal distribution of groundwater recharge in the SWAT-MODFLOW program, was classified as group 4, run in R, sampled for random and a model trained its groundwater recharge was predicted by CART condidering modified PVI, NDVI, NDTI, NDRI, PCP, and geomorphological data. To assess inter-rater reliability for group 4 groundwater recharge, the Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy and confusion matrix using K-fold cross-validation were calculated. The model obtained a Kappa coefficient of 0.3-0.6 and an overall accuracy of 0.5-0.7, indicating that the proposed model for estimating groundwater recharge with respect to soil type and vegetation cover is quite reliable.

AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion of multi-sensor satellite images with different spatial and temporal resolutions can generate time-series images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions to monitor phenological changes of indigenous plants. This paper evaluates the predictive performance of spatio-temporal fusion models to generate Landsat-like images by fusing MODIS into Landsat images. Three spatio-temporal fusion models including STARFM(spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model), ESTARFM(enhanced STARFM), and FSDAF (flexible spatiotemporal data fusion) are compared via an experiment using MODIS and Landsat red and near infrared images in Mt. Halla where increasing decline and death of Korean fir have been reported. The prediction accuracy of ESTARFM using two pairs of input images was higher than that of the other two models in 2009, but FSDAF using one pair of input images outperformed better than ESTARFM in 2020. These different prediction results were mainly due to the strength of correlation between input images on base and prediction dates. When the correlation was relatively weak, ESTARFM using multiple-pair images yielded the best prediction accuracy. On the contrary, the stronger the correlation, the greater the prediction accuracy of FSDAF. Therefore, the statistical relationships between input images and spatial patterns of input and output images should be considered to selecting the best spatio-temporal fusion model for monitoring phenological changes.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This thesis is an ecological interpretation of the dietary law of Leviticus 11. In Chapter 1, it was argued that the church is also responsible as a member of society for the ecological crisis facing modern society, and that an ecological reading of the Bible is necessary to solve this problem. In Chapter 2, I analyzed the structure and content of Leviticus 11:1-23. And I introduced various interpretations of the food law, such as arbitrary inter- pretation, allegorical interpretation, ritual interpretation, hygienic inter- pretation, anthropological interpretation, and ethical interpretation. And I have summarized these interpretations into three categories as follows. First, the dietary law is based on Israel’s worldview and legal system. Second, the dietary law is a way of life that reveals that Israel is God’s holy people. Third, limiting the number of animals that can be eaten in the dietary law implies respect for life. In Chapter 3, I looked at the theological implications of the dietary in the Old and New Testaments. I explained that the Old Testament meaning of the the dietary law was linked to the prohibition of bloodshed and that tthe dietary law was a sign that Israel was God’s people. It was also explained that limiting the number of animals that can be eaten has implications for suppressing meat consumption and thereby protecting various animal species. And in the New Testament, the distinction between clean and unclean animals was lost due to the Cornelius incident, and it was explained that all animals are good in the sight of God. In Chapter 4, an ecological interpretation of the dietary law was made based on the theological interpretation. First, the question of what to eat is a matter of faith. Second, the dietary law implies the suppression of hu- man desires. Because the current ecological crisis is the result of human greed. Third, I argued that humans should strive for the protection of various species because all animals are ontologically valuable. In conclusion, eco- logical bible reading is a very necessary task for the church to fulfill the stewardship mission of managing the earth.

AB  - The study explores worldview and artistic reflection of Teilhard de Chardin's work that influenced the ideas of the third-generation Russian Korean artist Anatoli Kim. The evidence that Anatoli Kim was immersed in the ideas of the French theologian and paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin is revealed not only through the mentioning of his name and writings, but also on a deeper level such as through thematic adaptation in Anatoli Kim's works. Accordingly, this study observes the aspect of concepts such as "biosphere," "noosphere," and "omega point," which are based on the evolutionary biology of Teilhard, being reflected on the natural philosophy of Anatoli Kim's works. Such attempts to analyze the aspects of Teilhard's theories or perspectives being embraced in the worldview of Anatoli Kim and artistically projected in his works can be a significant case study on the convergence of science, theology, and philosophy into cultural art.

AB  - This paper examines Momaday’s idea of the Native’s survival in House Made of Dawn, paying attention to his representations of Abel (a Pueblo Jemez, war veteran, traumatized protagonist who has suffered from his loss of cultural identity). In this paper, I will argue that the writer highly suggests the reading public to be fully aware of the significance of storytelling, by exemplifying the psycho-somatically battered protagonist’s ordeal and recovery through his ‘remembering’ of the Native’s culture (language, songs, and stories). This paper focuses on the events of Abel’s consecutive meetings with three storytellers (Angela, Benally, and Francisco) who all support him to ‘recall’ his hereditary songs and stories. First, Abel hears from Angela the legend of the ‘bear’ of the Kiowa tribe, which symbolizes vitality and valor. Next, when Abel lives a hard life in a white man-centered city, he meets Benally who remembers the Navajo traditions and encounters the Navajo's traditional song, Night Chant. With this Night Chant, Abel gets closer to tribal traditions and feels the importance of traditional worldview and consciousness. Returning to his hometown, Abel takes care of his dying grandfather Francisco. Francisco tells him various traditional stories from his youth and stresses the importance of staying connected to Navajo’s traditions. Accepting Francisco’s lesson and wisdom, Abel finally participates in Jemez Pueblo's traditional ritual of ‘dawn running’ and sings Night Chant. This experience helps him to heal his cultural trauma and restores his bond with the earth.

AB  - Water stress and environmental drivers are important factors to explain the variance of gross primary production (GPP). Environmental drivers are used to generate GPP in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm and process-based model. However, MODIS algorithm only consider the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data while the process-based biogeochemical model also uses limited data to express water stress. We compared the relationship between environmental drivers and GPP from eddy covariance method, MODIS algorithm, and Community Land Model 4 (CLM 4) simulation in normal years and drought years. To consider water stress specifically, we used VPD and evaporative fraction (EF). We evaluated the effects from environmental drivers and EF towards GPP products using the structural equation modeling (SEM) in South Korea. We found that GPP products from MODIS algorithm and model simulation results were not restricted from VPD data if VPD was underestimated. We also found that in the cropland area, irrigation effects can relieve VPD effects to GPP. However, GPP products derived from MODIS and CLM 4 had limitation to explain the irrigation effects to GPP. Overall, these results will enhance the understanding of GPP products derived from MODIS and CLM 4.

TI  - Knowledge action repertoires and the outcomes of collective action: local community action for environmental protection
T2  - PARTECIPAZIONE E CONFLITTO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article uses the knowledge practice repertoire approach, combined with an integrated opportunity approach, to investigate the role that local community knowledge based on holistic worldviews plays in the formation of collective actors, action and outcomes. This is argued to be crucial given that environmental governance is shaped instead by knowledge based on a worldview of a nature/culture divide, and that local community knowledge is key to responding to the planetary crisis and subject to this potential ontological clash. Attention to local community collective action using this lens can shed light on whether and how spaces can be made for different approaches, giving a fresh view to how outcomes matter. The article presents two case studies of local community collective action through community protocols from South Africa and Argentina. Community protocols are documents, recognised in international environmental law, where local communities set out their worldviews, their traditional knowledge and practices in support of environmental protection, and link these to rights and protections in national and international law as a basis for collective action. They are thus ideal sites for investigating knowledge practices and ontological politics. Focusing on different types of knowledge practices and opportunity contexts helped to untangle the complex question of how outcomes mattered to the local communities in these cases.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the aspect of literary imagination implied in the biographical picturebooks created by Peter Sis. The subject of this study included 4 biographical picturebooks. For the data analysis, the components of the picturebooks and literary imagination were used as an analysis frame through the hermeneutic circulation process. The results of this study are as follows: the aspect of literary imagination implied in Sis’s biographical picturebooks are the great man’s worldview represented by repetition of motifs, voluntary reading induced by double spread and vignettes, a map transited into specific chronotope as a visual code, discontinuous story by multilayered narratives and multiple focuses, and a fantastic image of cultural entanglement. The results suggest that literary imagination is important factors improving the quality of biographical picturebooks and adding educational significance, encouraging young readers’ interaction with books and voluntary reading, and empathy and reference to a great life.

AB  - Mount Agung is an active volcano located in Bali island, Indonesia, which had been dormant since 1963. However, Mount Agung began to show volcanic activity with severe earthquakes in August 2017. The intense seismicity peaked in early October 2017, and the volcano did not erupt until November 21, 2017. However, a violent explosive eruption with rapid lava-spewing occurred, forcing 140,000 people to evacuate between November 25 and 29, 2017. This study aims to monitor surface deformation induced by volcanic activity of Mount Agung by Persistent Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) using Sentinel-1 SAR from 2014-2021. This study employed 250 Sentinel-1 SAR satellite images (from October 2014 to April 2021). These results show that displacement increased from May to November 2017 and then decreased for about a year and a half before increasing from May to July 2019. The seismic activity started again on May 28, 2019, and the volcano erupted on June 13, 2019. Before this period, PS-InSAR had detected a small sign of increasing displacements, especially in the northern part of Mount Agung. Furthermore, PS-InSAR provided the surface displacement results from the pre-eruption, co-eruption, and post-eruption periods. These results will be significant for understanding the active cycle of Mount Agung and for predicting future potential crisis periods.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the factors and process of change in the land use and land cover change-induced landscape dynamics in the Durgapur Sub-Division region of West Bengal in 1989, 2003, and 2018 by employing the satellite imageries of Landsat 5 (1989 and 2003) and Landsat 8 (2018). The images of the study area were categorized into seven specific land use classes with the help of Google Earth Pro. Based on the supervised classification methodology, the change detection analysis identified a significant increase in built-up land from 11% to 23% between 1989 and 2003 and from 23% to 29% in 2003 and 2018. The areas under fallow land and vegetation cover have mainly decreased, while the areas of industrial activities and urbanization expanded during the study period.

TI  - Short-run environmental effects of COVID-19: Evidence from forest fires
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has raised questions about changes in economic production and subsequent effects on the environment. This article employs satellite data on real-time active fire locations in Nepal to evaluate the short-term environmental effects of COVID-19. Using plausibly exogenous variation in the number of reported COVID-19 cases across the country, this study finds that the incidence of COVID-19 led to a strong negative effect on the incidence of human -induced forest fires. Results indicate that an additional reported case of COVID-19 resulted in a 4.54% decrease in the number of forest fire incidents and a 11.36% reduction in fire radiative power associated with these events. Findings also show that districts with smaller areas of community-managed forests per capita experienced a 8.11% decrease in the number of forest fire incidents. Restrictions on movement of people across districts in response to the pandemic likely reduced the incidence of forest fire events in Nepal. These short-run estimates of environmental benefits, which do not account for negative consequences of the virus outbreak on health and labor market outcomes, partially offset the social cost of pandemics in the developing world.

TI  - Knud Rasmussen Glacier Status Analysis Based on Historical Data and Moving Detection Using RPAS
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses partial results of an international scientific expedition to Greenland that researched the geography, geodesy, botany, and glaciology of the area. The results here focus on the photogrammetrical results obtained with the eBee drone in the eastern part of Greenland at the front of the Knud Rasmussen Glacier and the use of archive image data for monitoring the condition of this glacier. In these short-term visits to the site, the possibility of using a drone is discussed and the results show not only the flow speed of the glacier but also the shape and structure from a height of up to 200 m. From two overflights near the glacier front at different times, it was possible to obtain the speed of the glacier flow and the distribution of velocities in the glacier stream. The technology uses a comparison of two point clouds derived from a set of aerial photos taken with the eBee drone, and calculating the M3C2 (Multiscale Model-to-Model Cloud Comparison) distances with CloudCompare software. The results correlate with other measurement methods like accurate and long-term measurement with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), satellite radar, or ground geodetical technology. The resulting speed from the drone data reached in the middle part of the glacier, was approximately 12-15m per day. The second part of the paper focuses on the analysis of modern satellite images of the Knud Rasmussen Glacier from Google Earth (Landsat series 1984-2016) and Sentinel 2a, and a comparison with historical aerial images from 1932 to 1933. Historical images were processed photogrammetrically into a three-dimensional (3D) model. Finally, orthogonalized image data from three systems (drone photos, historical aerial photos, and satellite data) were compared in the ArcGIS software. This allows us to analyze glacier changes over time in the time span from 1932 to 2020, with the caveat that from 1933 to 1983 we did not have data at our disposal. The result shows that more significant changes in the area of this glacier occurred after 2011. The main aim of this article is to research the use of photogrammetric methods for monitoring the condition and parameters of glaciers based on non-traditional technology, such as drones or new processing of historical photos.

TI  - The Lonesome Mind or an attempt of an Existential Philosophy of Mind
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - This article is a review of Ben Lazare Mijuskovic's book "Consciousness and Loneliness: Theoria and Praxis" (2018). The problem of the dividedness of the contemporary philosophy into the two different traditions has recently become apparent. This is evidenced by the growth of a number of investigations aiming to embrace contemporary thought in its wholeness. Among such studies is the new work of American philosopher Ben Lazare Mijuskovic. He attempts to defend the human microcosm from the threat of its neglection by philosophical naturalism. However, it is not only Mijuskovic's anti-naturalistic position that is interesting. He also provides an in-depth analysis of such an Existenzial of the human life as loneliness. The rich philosophical material drawn by the author is an indisputable merit of the study. However, this same merit also constitutes a problem. Mijuskovic's arguments are reduced to a mere repetition of the philosophical ideas of the past and are thus unable to undermine contemporary naturalism. Meanwhile, the parts of the study in which the phenomenon of loneliness is discussed are the most interesting part of the book. Mijuskovic discusses loneliness as the feeling of loneliness per se and does not replace its phenomenological analysis by an economical investigation or by an evolutionary explanation. The author's recognition of the significance of the content of conscious experience leads him to a disagreement with naturalism and to the acceptance of the position of substance dualism along with its known shortcomings. It seems that such a move is not at all necessary. In order for the content of our conscious experience to become significant, there is no need to exaggerate the ontological autonomy of the very conscious experience. It is always possible to commit to "weaker" ontological views without abandoning the scientific worldview and common sense.

TI  - TABOO IN TRADITIONAL LINGUISTIC CULTURES (BASED ON THE YAKUT LANGUAGE AND RUSSIAN OLD-TIME DIALECTS OF YAKUTIA)
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is devoted to the study and analysis of the phenomenon of taboo in the traditional cultures of peoples living in the Arctic zone of Russia. The unique lexical material of the language of the Russian old-timers of the Arctic, reflecting the peculiarities of their worldview, is introduced into the scholarly discourse. The forbidden vocabulary and taboos on actions presented in the material under consideration cover, first of all, such language systems as the semantic fields "Hunting and fishing", "Disease", "Death" in a regular way. Due to the continuity of generations, in traditional cultures, many ancient prohibitions (maybe some in a distorted form) and ideas about them have survived to this day. The area of taboo reflects the features of the traditional life and management of peoples living in the Far North, serving as material for reconstructing fragments of the linguistic worldview.

AB  - The goal of this work is to utilize the General Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect potential earthquake pre-cursory variations in Earth's ionosphere-lithosphere geomagnetic system and observe their spatial-temporal signatures along seismotectonic fault lines. Two major earthquake episodes in China have been selected for this study: an M6.0 earthquake, which occurred on 19th January 2020 at ENE of Arzak, and another M6.3 earthquake, occurring on 22nd July 2020 in western Xizang. The spatial-temporal variability patterns in an similar to 800 km radius of earthquake epicentres were calculated from geomagnetic data recorded by SWARM satellites A, B and C. The results of EOF spatial components and associated time-series principal components (PCs) revealed anomalous patterns along and on borders of the local tectonic fault lines and around earthquake epicentres. The Planetary A and K geomagnetic storm indices did not show abnormal activities around the same time periods. This could suggest a pre-cursory connection between the detected geomagnetic anomalies and these earthquakes.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Using "Heterotopia" Concept in the Analysis of Urban Fantasy
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of "heterotopia" was proposed to the scientific discourse by Michel Foucault, and now it can be useful for the analysis of a fictional city. However, at first it must be clarified. In the article it is proposed to explore a text about the fictional urbis, paying attention not only to the opposite of "one's own" and "another's", "center" and "outskirts / deviation", but also considering the functions of heterotopia. Heterotopia is disturbing and makes you defend your worldview. It violates the logic of our existence and statements, habitual classifications, values and connections. However, it is no longer perceived as an intolerably threatening reality. The existence of everyday life and heterotopia, the recognition of both entities as legitimate, sets a new possibil- ity: if there is no idea of the reality uniqueness, then sometimes it is possible to create a new reality, without any social conventions. This practically created utopia is imposed above the known boundaries and generally outside the confrontation between "one's own" and "another's", not as a precedent, but as a single existential act. By the example of urban fantasy by China Mieville "The City & the City", this trend can be seen in the actions of the narrator, police officer, Tjader Barlow. As a result of play-of-meanings, given to different locations, and due to the practical cancellation of borders, the hero single-handedly creates a new ontology. In fact, the author gives him renaissance features, although the idea of the work, introduced to the readers, is as if did not imply such consequences. At the same time, Mieville emphasized that his text can be a subject to metaphorical interpretation.

TI  - THE MYTHOLOGEMES "TREE OF LIFE" AND THE "SUN" IN THE WORLD FOLK PICTURE OF UKRAINIANS (FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE PRESENT)
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the transformations that took place with the mythical images "tree of life" and "sun" in the folk worldview of Ukrainians from the pagan era to the present. The sources were the texts of the oldest Ukrainian folklore works, written monuments of the Kievan Rus period, scientific research of East Slavic ethnologists, folklorists and dialectologists of the 19th and 20th centuries, field records on ethnographic topics. Considered in a comparative typological aspect, the ancient texts of folk poetry and literary works, descriptions of the spiritual practices of past generations of Ukrainians, the traditions preserved by the people in rituals and in arts and crafts, testify to the deep sacred etymology of the mythologems "tree of life" and the "sun" in the picture of the world of the Ukrainian people's ancestors, its consonance with other ethnic groups in the context of world culture. In the Ukrainians' national picture of the world, the mythical images of the "tree of life", the "sun" underwent transformations under the influence of changes in worldview guidelines. The forms of embodiment of these mythologemes in the Ukrainians worldview of the 21st century, as expected, narrowed down to metaphorical images, but not only are not lost, but tend to be preserved, thanks to the revival of national identity in the public consciousness.

TI  - THE CONCEPT OF THE FAMILY IN THE THINKING OF THE YOUNG GENERATION OF UKRAINIANS
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to analyze the reflections on the word-stimulus FAMILY, provided by participants of a free-associative experiment, to establish the semantic and structural organization of the studied concept's associative field and identify values that determine the image of a family in the young generation. The language best reflects the nationally determined and individual features of the worldview of the individual and gives an idea of the semantic content of ethnocultural constants that exist in the collective consciousness. Analyzing the associations obtained through an associative experiment; it is possible to make "visible" to the researcher the processes of thinking, the functioning of consciousness and psyche of an individual or social group. The main method of studying the isolated language-thinking construct is an associative experiment. At the stage of processing empirical material, the method of mathematical calculations is applied. The selected conceptual features allowed reproducing the family's image in the language consciousness of the young generation of Ukrainians. The image of this fragment of social reality in young people's minds is multifaceted, covering a range of conceptual features that allow saying that the family for the young generation of Ukrainians is a "personal terminal value" that will determine their behavior in society and personal life. Associative reactions to the word-stimulus FAMILY received lead to the conclusion that in the minds of young Ukrainians ingrained awareness of the importance of the traditional family in creating a comfortable psycho-emotional environment for development and social vital activity of the individual.

TI  - THE INTERNET RESOURCES AS A MEANS FOR FORMING STUDENTS' NATIONAL AND PATRIOTIC WORLDVIEW
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the problem of information and communication technologies using in the process of patriotic education and the upbringing of student youth. Special attention is dropped to the teachers' social role for the formation of patriotism and national identity of the young generation of Ukrainians in the modern social and political realities. Using the method of content analysis, it was defined the possibilities of involving Ukrainian-centric information media channels, educational platforms and blogs with the aim to form students' patriotic outlook. Thus, it was created the model of an interactive process that is presented through the triad "student youth - information and communication technologies - formation of national and patriotic outlook". During the empirical research and use of the focus group method, we determined psychological features of the students' activity and their main interest direction in the fields of nationally valuable information and awareness with the help of online sources that represent reliable, scientifically substantiated knowledge about the historical past of Ukrainian people and modern social and political life of Ukraine. Such investigations revealed the contradictions between the awareness of the importance of patriotism for the national idea realization and building a strong sovereign state and the ideas of young people about the meaningful filling of the patriotic worldview of the citizen and the actual implementation of their patriotic beliefs. In conclusion, we formulated the logical structure of pedagogical actions and impacts to make the process of patriotic outlook formation more effective. This structure includes three levels of practical means and tools such as cognitive, emotional and behavioural. Based on the analysis of empirical data, we developed the algorithm of educational influence on young people with the purpose of encouraging them to purposefully use the opportunities of the global network in search of valuable information that can help them to understand all modern processes in the social and political life of Ukraine, to comprehend historical lessons, to expand the personal communication space and to start a dialogue with competent people. As a result of all these scientific reflections, it was defined perspective directions of educational work with students in the field of information and media literacy raising with the aim to improve their critical thinking and perception of the Internet content. It was also determined the importance of studying the possibilities of creating effective models of integration of information and media literacy in the professional training courses and process in general.

AB  - One of the most critical factors which determine the accuracy of deformation maps provided by Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) are atmospheric artefacts. Nowadays, one of the most popular approaches to minimize atmospheric artefacts is Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS). Nevertheless, in the literature, the authors reported various effects of GACOS correction on the deformation estimates in different study areas Therefore, this paper aims to assess the effect of GACOS correction on the accuracy of DInSAR-based deformation monitoring in USCB by using Sentinel-1 data. For the accuracy evaluation, eight Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) permanent stations, as well as five low-cost GNSS receivers were utilized. GACOS-based DInSAR products were evaluated for: (1) single interferograms in different geometries; (2) cumulative deformation maps in various geometries and (3) decomposed results delivered from GACOS-based DInSAR measurements. Generally, based on the achieved results, GACOS correction had a positive effect on the accuracy of the deformation estimates in USCB by using DInSAR approach and Sentinel-1 data in each before mentioned aspect. When considering (1), it was possible to achieve Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 1 cm for a single interferogram for only 20% and 26% of the ascending and descending investigated interferograms, respectively when compared with GNSS measurements. The RMSE below 2 cm was achieved by 47% and 66% of the descending and ascending interferograms, respectively.

AB  - Satellite differential interferometry has proven to be a useful method for the deformation estimation caused by underground mining. This underground human intervention may influence mining-induced tremors which can even affect human lives. Having considered the importance of the problem, the goal of the presented study is to check whether DInSAR estimated deformations can be correlated with mining tremors. For analyses, 51 differential interferograms have been processed using Sentinel 1A/B ascending images. Seismic events of the biggest magnitude have been selected for detailed investigation. Time series deformations in the centre of the subsidence basins as well as the time series deformation profiles have been used to search for evidence of the mining induced tremors. Unfortunately, achieved results for these specific events did not present characteristic changes in the deformation behaviour which can be attributed to particular seismic events. This can be due to the small magnitude of the tremors (Mw approximate to 2.8), geological settings, properties of the study are as well as the depth of the extraction (1km). Achieved results portray that finding any sign or evidence of the induce tremors in time series deformations is a complex and challenging task even if such an effective satellite interferometric methods are available.

TI  - Nanoparticles in Combating Cancer: Opportunities and Limitations: A Brief Review
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nanomedicine is a good alternative to traditional methods of cancer treatment but does not solve all the limitations of oncology. Nanoparticles used in anticancer therapy can work as carriers of drugs, nucleic acids, imaging agents or they can sensitize cells to radiation. The present review focuses on the application of nanoparticles to treating cancer, as well as on its problems and limitations. Using nanoparticles as drug carriers, significant improvement in the efficiency of transport of com- pounds and their targeting directly to the tumour has been achieved; it also reduces the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on the body. However, nanoparticles do not significantly improve the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agent itself. Most nanodrugs can reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy, but do not significantly affect the effectiveness of treatment. Nanodrugs should be developed that can be effective as an anti-metastatic treatment, e.g. by enhancing the ability of nanoparticles to transport chemotherapeutic loads to sentinel lymph nodes using the immune system and developing chemotherapy in specific metastatic areas. Gene therapy, however, is the most modern method of treating cancer, the cause of cancer being tackled by altering genetic material. Other applications of nanoparticles for radiotherapy and diagnostics are discussed.

TI  - Models for optimizing selection based on adaptability and stability of cotton genotypes
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In multi-environment trials (MET), large networks are assessed for results improvement. However, genotype by environment interaction plays an important role in the selection of the most adaptable and stable genotypes in MET framework. In this study, we tested different residual variances and measure the selection gain of cotton genotypes accounting for adaptability and stability, simultaneously. Twelve genotypes of cotton were bred in 10 environments, and fiber length (FL), fiber strength (FS), micronaire (MIC), and fiber yield (FY) were determined. Model selection for different residual variance structures (homogeneous and heterogeneous) was tested using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The variance components were estimated through restricted maximum likelihood and genotypic values were predicted through best linear unbiased prediction. The harmonic mean of relative performance of genetic values (HMRPGV) were applied for simultaneous selection for adaptability, stability, and yield. According to BIC heterogeneous residual variance was the best model fit for FY, whereas homogeneous residual variance was the best model fit for FL, FS, and MIC traits. The selective accuracy was high, indicating reliability of the prediction. The HMRPGV was capable to select for stability, adaptability and yield simultaneously, with remarkable selection gain for each trait.

TI  - Drivers of change and stability in the gut microbiota of an omnivorous avian migrant exposed to artificial food supplementation
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Human activities shape resources available to wild animals, impacting diet and likely altering their microbiota and overall health. We examined drivers shaping microbiota profiles of common cranes (Grus grus) in agricultural habitats by comparing gut microbiota and crane movement patterns (GPS-tracking) over three periods of their migratory cycle, and by analyzing the effect of artificially-supplemented food provided as part of a crane-agriculture management program. We sampled fecal droppings in Russia (non-supplemented, pre-migration) and in Israel in late fall (non-supplemented, post-migration) and winter (supplemented and non-supplemented, wintering). As supplemented food is typically homogenous, we predicted lower microbiota diversity and different composition in birds relying on supplementary feeding. We did not observe changes in microbial diversity with food supplementation, as diversity differed only in samples from non-supplemented wintering sites. However, both food supplementation and season affected bacterial community composition and led to increased abundance of specific genera (mostly Firmicutes). Cranes from the non-supplemented groups spent most of their time in agricultural fields, likely feeding on residual grain when available, while food-supplemented cranes spent most of their time at the feeding station. Thus, non-supplemented and food-supplemented diets likely diverge only in winter, when crop rotation and depletion of anthropogenic resources may lead to a more variable diet in non-supplemented sites. Our results support the role of diet in structuring bacterial communities and show that they undergo both seasonal and human-induced shifts. Movement analyses provide important clues regarding host diet and behavior towards understanding how human-induced changes shape the gut microbiota in wild animals.

AB  - costeLAB is a pre-operative thematic cloud-type platform characterized by and specialized in the sector of geospatial services for coastal environment management. The platform integrates a large set of processors and algorithms and exploits multi-mission and multi-sensor Earth observation data, from the European and Italian Space Agencies' missions, such as ESA Sentinels and Italian Space Agency (ASI)'s COSMO-SkyMed and (in future) PRISMA missions. It covers a broad range of application domains from emergency management in the event of sea storms, incidents of occasional pollution or instability of coastal landslides, to monitoring and protection of the territory.This platform, developed entirely with Open Source technologies, aims to provide various types of users, from both public and private organizations, a homogeneous environment equipped with a set of software tools to visualize, analyse and process data from multiple sources (Ground Truth, multi-mission Earth Observation, etc.) and with various dimensions (single observations, time series, etc.).Furthermore, costeLAB allows the generation and visualization of new products, providing scientific users with a collaborative environment for the development and testing of innovative algorithms in order to build and test new processing chains.The approach of the proposed architecture keeps computing resources close to data, i.e. by exploiting the access and processing capabilities typical of the cloud, costeLAB avoids the transfer of large amounts of data to the user. The platform is addressed to institutional, scientific and industrial users and allows the study, experimenting and developing new downstream pre-operational services for the monitoring of the coastal area environment.The platform has been designed and developed to run in a pre-operational context in the framework of "Progetto Premiale Rischi Naturali Indotti dalle Attivita Umana - COSTE", n. 2017-I-E.0, funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR), and promoted and coordinated by ASI. The platform has been developed by e-GEOS S.p.A. and Planetek Italia with the participation of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Meteorological Environmental Earth Observation (MEEO) and Geophysical Applications Processing (G.A.P.) s.r.l. as subcontractors.

TI  - Total Tumor Load of mRNA Cytokeratin 19 in the Sentinel Lymph Node as a Predictive Value of Axillary Lymphadenectomy in Patients with Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has proved to be able to diagnose axillary lymph node status safely and reliably, there is still not enough evidence to suggest that it can be used in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for lymph node-sparing surgery. The present study used molecular approaches to determine whether SLNB can be reliably used in patients who have been treated with NAC before SLN surgery, and whether the total tumor load of the SLN can be used as a predictive factor in axillary lymphadenectomy (ALD). We used one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) to analyze a total of 111 consecutive patients who presented operable invasive breast carcinomas and who had been treated with NAC. SLN was positive in 55 patients and the identification rate was 100%. In 9 of these 55 patients, ALD showed that other lymph nodes were also involved. In all of the other 46 patients, the only lymph node to be identified as positive was SLN. Metastasis was not found in any of the axillary lymph nodes in the isolated tumor cell group. The total tumor load, defined as the amount of cytokeratin 19 mRNA copy numbers in all positives SLN (copies/mu L), showed three risk groups related to the possibility of positive non-sentinel nodes. OSNA is a diagnostic technique that is highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible and it can be used to analyze sentinel lymph nodes after NAC. Total tumor load may be able to help predict additional metastases in axillary lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Mapping damage on forests burnt in Central Chile by modelling <i>ex-ante</i> and <i>ex-post</i> spectral indices
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimated the severity of Nilahue-Barahona and Las Maquinas wildfires, occurred in central Chile during the summer of 2016-17, by an empirical-statistical modelling based on pre- and post-fire arithmetic differences of spectral indices sensitive to vigor, turgor and calcination states of vegetation. By doing this, map of damages were created to aid the efficient management and ecological restoration of disturbed forestry ecosystems. The index differences were calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images, acquired anually in the summers spanning from 2016 to 2019. The resulting nine index-derived differences were used as predictors of burn severity, field-measured during the summer of 2019 using the CBI (composite burn index) method, into a linear stepwise regression that allowed for selecting those with the highest predictability. CBI yielded low correlations as its calculation includes low vegetation strata largely recovered at the time of the field data collection. However, when overstory field data were used alone, correlations increased (70 % of the data >= 0.80, P < 0.05). This was because this stratum was still appreciably damaged during the field campaign, along with its best representation from the image planimetry. The burn severity of both wildfires was mapped using the overstory data as regressand in a model based on NDWIex-ante-2019, NDWIex-ante-2018, NBR ex-ante-2018 and NBRex-ante-2017 differences (R-2 ad = 0.77, RMSE = 0.35).

T2  - Harvard Dataverse
M3  - Data study
C8  - 1
AB  - We use 2011-2019 aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) instrument over East Asia to infer 24-h daily surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at continuous 6km x 6km resolution over South Korea, eastern China, and Japan. We use PM2.5 observations from national networks to train and cross-validate a random forest (RF) algorithm that predicts PM2.5 from the gap-filled GOCI AOD, meteorological variables, and other predictor variables. The predicted 24-h PM2.5 for sites entirely withheld from training in a ten-fold crossvalidation procedure correlates highly with observed concentrations (R2 = 0.89) with single-value precision of 26-32% depending on country. Prediction of annual mean values has R2 = 0.96 and single-value precision of 12%. More information is available in the associated publication. Here we supply a NetCDF containing the inferred daily PM2.5 fields from 2011-19 for use in further research. If you use this data, please cite the associated publication, and feel free to reach out via email to discuss this work.

TI  - Investigation of land surface phenology detections in shrublands using multiple scale satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrublands occupy about 13% of the global land surface, contain about one-third of the biodiversity, store about half of the global terrestrial carbon, and provide many ecosystem services to a large amount of world's human population and livestock. Because phenology is a sensitive indicator of the response of shrubland ecosystems to climate change, the alteration of ecosystems following species invasions, and the dynamics of shrubland ecosystem function, biodiversity, and carbon budgets, it is critical to monitor and assess phenological dynamics in shrubland ecosystems. However, most current land surface phenology (LSP) products derived from satellite data do not provide phenology detections in some semiarid shrublands where the amplitude of seasonal vegetation greenness is small. Therefore, we investigated the LSP detection using multiple spatial resolution satellite data and examined the impacts of spatial scales and shrubland ecosystem components (shrub and herb cover) on LSP detections over the western United States. Specifically, greenup onset date (GUD) in shrublands was detected from 30 m Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data and 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data to quantify scale effects. The GUD spatial patterns were explored with 30 m pixel variations in shrubland ecosystem components. The results show that GUD values varied with percent vegetation cover and shifted to earlier dates with increasing vegetation cover, demonstrating that satellite observations were not able to capture greenup onset until a threshold of green vegetation cover is reached. GUD was mostly undetectable from both HLS and VIIRS pixels with vegetation cover less than 10% and became fully detectable with vegetation covers larger than 50%. Similarly, the differences of GUD between HLS and VIIRS detections also decreased with increased vegetation cover. As a result of high shrubland heterogeneity, GUD from 30 m HLS pixels could be partially detected within a 500 m pixel despite GUD being undetectable from VIIRS time series. Moreover, vegetation cover heterogeneity also made it difficult for GUD at 30 m to be aggregated to coarse scales (such as to 500 m VIIRS pixels). These findings have significant implications to the detection and characterization of shrubland LSP responses to environmental and climate changes.

TI  - A roadmap for high-resolution satellite soil moisture applications - confronting product characteristics with user requirements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil moisture observations are of broad scientific interest and practical value for a wide range of applications. The scientific community has made significant progress in estimating soil moisture from satellite-based Earth observation data, particularly in operationalizing coarse-resolution (25-50 km) soil moisture products. This review summarizes existing applications of satellite-derived soil moisture products and identifies gaps between the characteristics of currently available soil moisture products and the application requirements from various disciplines. We discuss the efforts devoted to the generation of high-resolution soil moisture products from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter observations and/or through downscaling of existing coarse-resolution microwave soil moisture products. Open issues and future opportunities of satellite-derived soil moisture are discussed, providing guidance for further development of operational soil moisture products and bridging the gap between the soil moisture user and supplier communities.

TI  - How to quantify the cooling effect of urban parks? Linking maximum and accumulation perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks can significantly alleviate the urban heat island, an ecological issue caused by urbanization. Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits.

TI  - Integrated fusion framework based on semicoupled sparse tensor factorization for spatio-temporal-spectral fusion of remote sensing images
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion is considered a cost effective method for handling the tradeoff between the spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions of current satellite systems. However, most current fusion methods concentrate on fusing images in two domains among the spatial, temporal and spectral domains, and a few efforts have been made to comprehensively explore the relationships of spatio-temporal-spectral features. In this study, we propose a novel integrated spatio-temporal-spectral fusion framework based on semicoupled sparse tensor factorization to generate synthesized frequent high-spectral and high-spatial resolution images by blending multisource observations. Specifically, the proposed method regards the desired high spatio-temporal-spectral resolution images as a four-dimensional tensor and formulates the integrated fusion problem as the estimation of the core tensor and the dictionary along each mode. The high-spectral correlation across the spectral domain and the high self-similarity (redundancy) features in the spatial and temporal domains are jointly exploited using the low dimensional and sparse core tensors. In addition, assuming that the sparse coefficients in the core tensors across the observed and desired image spaces are not strictly the same, we formulate the estimation of the core tensor and the dictionaries as a semicoupled sparse tensor factorization of available heterogeneous spatial, spectral and temporal remote sensing observations. Finally, the proposed method can exploit the multicomplementary spatial, temporal and spectral information of any combination of remote sensing data based on this single unified model. Experiments on multiple data types, including spatio-spectral, spatio-temporal, and spatio-temporal-spectral data fusion, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - We use satellite imagery to identify cloud types and correlate with irradiance data from a solar platform. Processing the large images takes several minutes. Integrating into a web service would enable multiple users to estimate solar irradiance using just satellite imagery. It would also allow for the processing of many images at once as more remote sensing satellites are launched and data is easily accessible. The Sentinel 2 Cirrus Band shows an 81% correlation with the diffuse solar irradiance values measured at the platform.

AB  - The possibilities of using long-term satellite data to monitor the environmental situation in the area of oil and gas enterprises are considered. The studies were carried out for the territory of Tomskneftepererabotka oil refinery as an example. The data of the MODIS spectroradiometer (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) for the years 2015-2019 were used as the initial information. To assess the state of the vegetation cover in the study area, the values of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were included in the analysis. The minimum and maximum values of EVI index for the study area were determined, and a trend of an increase in the index values since 2018 was revealed, which is evidence of vegetation cover restoration.

TI  - CULTURAL COLONIALISM: ART AND WRITING IN AL-ANDALUS SINCE 1492
T2  - ANDULI
M3  - Article
AB  - Relationships among visual signs, society and memory reveal the dominant cultural order in a given context as well as the causes that maintain it (influence and imposition) and the effects on the population where it occurs (alienation and cultural resilience). Therefore, it is possible to identify deeper social processes with a purely visual and symbolic reading. Visual signs (two-dimensional), in addition to configuring the way space is understood (three-dimensional), reflect social and political dynamics (the time factor). To have a more complete vision of the moment and context, it is necessary to interrelate art with sociology and history. In the specific case of al-Andalus, there is a turning point at which there are changes in visuality that are mainly reflected in writing (Arabic and Latin), the use of symbols (the Mudejar, the cross) and the organization of the spaces designated for art (temples, museums, exhibition halls); hence, these changes function as visual indexes of social dynamics that reach to the present day. The visual supports the social and vice versa, configuring and maintaining a certain worldview. If there is visual continuity, there is continuity in the social sphere.

TI  - Participatory collective farming as a leverage point for fostering human-nature connectedness
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-nature connectedness is key to foster environmental and socio-cultural sustainability in agricultural landscapes since it promotes the establishment of belonging, stewardship, and connections to nature. Cooperation, collective action, and the role of women at sustainable agroecological practices could be leverage points in which small interventions may hold great potential for system transformation. We analyse the different types of human-nature connectedness mediated by the Agrolab participatory collective farming initiative running in Madrid (Spain). Our results described and quantified a participatory collective farming initiative using the leverage point perspective, and identified factors explaining nature relatedness of participants (i.e. social importance of agricultural landscapes, linkages with farming activities, time spent outdoors, gender and a negative relationship with the rural residence). We found that women showed a stronger and broader worldview on the philosophical arguments about their connection with nature, while men identified themselves and nature through more cognitive responses. Our results give indication of participatory collecting farming as a leverage point to foster human-nature connectedness. Finally, we discussed how participatory collective farming activities are suitable for introducing nature into people's daily lives and may help to identify pathways towards a stronger human-nature connectedness.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Groundwater Usage Level Corresponding to Land Displacement Trend Derived from Time-Series SAR Interferometry and GNSS Measurements
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - Concerning monitoring the water resource, the impact of the extensive groundwater extraction can be assessed based on subsidence. Geospatial analysis was performed by integrating spatial information of the groundwater usage level with the distribution of land displacement indication derived from an advanced time-series SAR Interferometry (InSAR) analysis of Persistent-Scatterer (PS) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods in Bali Island, Indonesia.The data source consists of well data and satellite data. (1) The monitoring well data contains a database of well locations, capacities, and percentage of water supply (service coverage). The information was collected from the River Basin Agency of Bali Penida (BWS-BP), Public Works Service (DPU) in Bali Province, Regional Public Works Service (DPU), and Regional Drinking Water Agency (PDAM). Based on the data collected in 2017, the groundwater usage levels were categorized into high (> 50 l/s), moderate (25 - 50 l/s) and low (<25 l/s).(2) The satellite data utilized to extract information of land subsidence, i.e., SAR data of Sentinel-1A, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) data. The entire data processing was performed using open-source computer software, i.e., InSAR processing system of GMT5SAR, RTKLIB with GNSS data, and QGIS for spatial data extract and mapping.The results pointed out the correlation between groundwater usage and subsidence in the area. Furthermore, the information can be employed as a reference to determine vulnerabilities of the resource development strategies.

T2  - REVISTA TEMPOS E ESPACOS EDUCACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the phenomenon of "medical humanities" as an independent interdisciplinary area of research, formed on the basis of the international experience integration as a reality. The phenomenon is comprehended simultaneously in the field of Russian patristic tradition and medicine, since it focuses pedagogical strategy and moral practice. In the Russian spiritual tradition, it fits into the processes of educating humanity, which receives a modern consideration both in moral and religious categories, and in the categories of natural science, which are significant for medicine. Spirituality is the category of thinking that changes the idea of a person in the existing reductionist approach to his integrity in medicine. The action of the worldview of the individual is considered as a mandatory constant, which acts as a constructive mechanism for the transformation of the value foundations of thinking and ethical reflection. The fundamentals of spiritual and moral education and patristic experience make complex conditions for the restoration of humanitarian culture in medicine. The purpose of the process is to qualitatively change its anthropological, ethical and psychological components. Systemic humanitarian knowledge is main for medical education. The author reveals the significance of the positive convergence of the humanities for medicine.

T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - A study on the vertical pattern of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence was undertaken in the Mafia Channel off Kimbiji, Tanzania. Data was collected during the Southeast Monsoon (SEM) and Northeast Monsoon (NEM) seasons. There was higher Chl-a concentration of 0.1 to 1.1 mgm(-3) in the surface layer off Kimbiji to about 50 m depth due to the presence of mixed layer depth (MLD) which allowed water mixing in the layer. A deep Chl-a maximum was recorded at around 40 m depth during the NEM and between 40 and 70 m in the SEM. Surface water between longitude 39.9 degrees E and 40.2 degrees E had low Chl-a from the surface to about 50 m depth due to poor nutrient input. The NEM had an insignificantly higher Chl-a value than the SEM (p > 0.05) which differed from other studies in which Chl-a was higher during the SEM than the NEM, than, the Chl-a concentration was higher at the surface during the SEM than during the NEM. Satellite data showed higher Chl-a in the SEM than NEM, localized along the Mafia Channel. During the SEM season the wind pushes higher Chl-a water from the Mafia Channel towards the north and leads to a higher concentration at Kimbiji.

T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Global long-term SST record is being created under the AVHRR GAC Reanalysis (RANs) project, by historical reprocessing 4 km data of the AVHRR/2 and /3 instruments flown onboard multiple NOAA satellites from 1981 - present. The AVHRR data are reprocessed with the NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) system. During RANs, the ACSPO algorithms are being adjusted to mitigate various issues intrinsic to AVHRR sensors, especially AVHRR/s on the earlier NOAA missions in 1980s and 1990s. The focus of the latest interim release of RAN2, Beta 02, is the contamination of retrieved SSTs with massive cold biases, originating from two sources. First, in all AVHRR missions, periodic cold SST outliers occur at night due to solar impingement on the black body calibration target, when the satellite orbit approaches the terminator. Second, multiple cold outliers appear in the NOAA-7, -11 and -12 SSTs following three major volcanic eruptions of Mt. El Chichon (1982), Mt. Pinatubo (1991) and Mt. Hudson (1991). The current mitigation algorithm exploits the fact that in both cases, the spatial densities of the cold outliers exhibit well-expressed latitudinal dependencies. The algorithm identifies 5 degrees latitudinal bands with abnormally high density of outliers and makes the cloud mask more conservative within those bands. This improves filtering cold SST outliers in the contaminated areas without increasing the false cloud detection rate in the unaffected parts of the ocean. We also discuss the ongoing development to mitigate cold SST biases by correcting AVHRR L1b calibration (rather than eliminating the affected SST data).

AB  - Bedadung watershed is one of the largest watersheds in Jember Regency. The Bedadung watershed in upstream area is generally hilly with steep slopes, so it is prone to landslides and potential to erosion. The upstream area is a protected forest that functions as a water catchment area, turning into plantation and production forest to become the target of logging and deforestation. Conservation activities in the upstream watershed area is essential in the management of water resources. Natural resource management activities in the upstream area significantly affect the success of efforts to provide water and control water resources downstream damage. This study aimed to identify conservation activities in the upstream Bedadung watershed and the impact of changes in upstream land use on environmental damage. The conservation activities in the Jompo, Antrokan, Rempangan, and Rembangan Sub-watersheds is coffe plantation, cover crop, forestry, terrace, restoration, bush, grassland. The highest increase in land change in the four sub-watersged was irrigated land / field, while the decrease was non-irrigated land. The results of comparisons between the 2001 RBI map with the 2015 Landsat Image show an 8% forest loss and 7% increase in irrigated fields.

TI  - The Image of the Information Society in Culture: Optimism Gives Way to Pessimism?
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - During its existence, the idea of an information society has undergone significant changes, many concepts of the information society have appeared, as well as related concepts of a network, communicative, digital society. The purpose of this article is to trace the transformation of the "image" of the information society in culture from the stage of expectations of the embodiment of its main parameters to the peculiarities of vision and assessment of its characteristics, which have become everyday reality today. In the definitions and assessments of the information society, proposed by philosophers and sociologists at the end of the last century, its technological characteristics, which are quite optimistic for society, were emphasized. Three decades later, negative assessments of the modem "information landscape", such as Internet addiction, information pollution, information stress, began to prevail in discussions about the impact of these characteristics on everyday life. "Technological optimism" is replaced by "humanitarian pessimism", that is, the emphasis from technological advances is shifted to the impact of information technology on a person, his psycho-emotional state, consciousness, worldview, and cognitive abilities. The objectives of the article include the analysis of real changes in consciousness, psyche and human brain, caused by the introduction of information technology in the daily life of people. All these processes lead to the formation of a negative image of the "digital society", to the rejection of the realities associated with it. But the fact that the information society in its ideal embodiment did not take place does not negate the growing role of information technologies in modem life. And against this background, the author believes, a purposeful, including a philosophical analysis of relevant problems is needed in order to understand how to balance the image of the "person - information environment" system. Information ecology can play a significant role in such analysis.

TI  - Aachen - the Second Rome: a City as a Symbol of Power in Poetic Carolingian Texts
T2  - ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals the construction of Aachen as a symbol of the power of Charlemagne (742/4 814). It discusses the poetic Carolingian texts, which played an important role in the formation of the medieval ideology of the unity of the City and the power of its creator. It is shown that the most striking example of the statement of such a worldview is the third book (v. 1-536) of the anonymous epic poem (not fully preserved), known in the early Middle Ages under the title "Charlemagne and Pope Leo" (Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa). It is noted that this text, containing a description of the construction of the Second Rome - Aachen, influenced the subsequent Carolingian poetic tradition, serving as a turning point in the development of narrative poetry during the reign of Charlemagne.

AB  - The reflection of the artistic image of a person is the fundamental principle in art. The problem of the research is to find effective methods of pedagogical influence aimed at the formation of an artistic image in the drawing of a portrait of students. Through understanding the image of a person, the creative potential inherent in each student is revealed, a worldview is formed, the general cultural and professional level increases, the inner world is enriched. The formation of the worldview of the younger generation requires an integrated approach to learning. It follows from this that in modern conditions, education in art institutions cannot be limited to the acquired skills and skills of a competent image of a person, but requires solving a number of tasks related to the formation of an artistic image in a portrait.

AB  - The International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia was created in London in August of 1992 as an instrument for the negotiations conducted by the United Nations and the European Community, represented by Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen. Until the end of the year, they developed a detailed proposal to settle the Bosnian conflict, known as the Vance-Owen Peace Plan (VOPP). The VOPP was presented to the leaders of the warring factions in Geneva during the first session of talks in January of 1993. On the basis of archive material, judicial records, published documents, and memoirs of the participants, this article aims to reconstruct the dramatic negotiation process, which consisted of several rounds. An analysis of the declared Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian positions during the negotiations, as well as the interactions among the delegations and relations within them, reveals that all the parties were had been deeply engaged in double dealing. The Croatian side was seemingly ready to sign the VOPP but was undermining it by launching a conflict in the field at the same time. The Serbian side was escalating as well, the Bosnian Serb leaders were not ready to accept the plan, despite the suggestions they had received from Belgrade. Sarajevo was procrastinating, hoping for a direct US involvement in the crisis following the inauguration of the new Clinton Administration. That administration did undermine the plan, which damaged the credibility of the international negotiators. In such circumstances, the plan had slim chances of succeeding. Although a ceasefire would have shortened the Bosnian war by almost three years and cut human losses by at least half, the main negotiators found a compromise solution to be unacceptable. As they defined and propagated maximalist goals, acceptance of a compromise was both damaging their grip on power and defying their worldview.

TI  - TENDENCIES TO BEING. DISPOSITIONALISM BETWEEN ANTHROPOLOGY, ONTOLOGY AND ECHOLOGY
T2  - SGUARDO-RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses some fundamental traits of contemporary dispositionalism, on an anthropological and ontological level. I start claiming that the current relevance of dispositionalism also depends on the fact that we are immersed in a sort of 'dispositionalist atmosphere', in a double sense: we are experiencing a power oriented towards 'capacitation' and not coercion; we are living the diffusion of the implicit ideal of hidden potential, connected to a vision of the human being as potential ( 0). Then, I define such a potential nature as generic, and describe its three main characteristics, in order to point out their wider conceptual consequences. starting with the recognition that any power is both particular and plastic at the same time: openness; habituability; historicity ( 1). This allows me to highlight the basic task that every dispositionalist perspective has to fulfil today: to move in a perspective which is at once neo-Aristotelian and post-Darwinian ( 2). Afterward, I dwell on analytical dispositionalist ontologies, presenting three key aspects of the dispositions, and discussing their implications: a) potentiality; b) independence; c) directionality ( 3). Finally, I examine the continental context, focusing on the position of G. Deleuze, in order to contribute to a 'mutual enlightenment' between dispositionalism and deleuzism, and to the construction of a genuine non-fixist and non-substantialist worldview: I not only explain that Deleuze would be a pandispositionalist tending towards structuralism in the contemporary spectrum, describing his position with respect to points a), b) and c), but I also show that his perspective allows to pinpoint at least two other relevant issues, such as d) duration and e) echology ( 4)

TI  - A Study of The Effect of Black Swan Events on Stock Markets - and Developing a Model for Predicting and Responding to them
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Black Swan events are rare and seemingly random in nature. In the famous paper by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, it is posited that Black Swan events cannot be reliably predicted, and it is instead important to be prepared for them at all times (Musgrave, 2009). This study aims to understand various Black Swan events in recent history from the point of view of equity markets, and performs a comparative study between different events across time and geography in order to understand if there are any standard early indicators. In this study, a total of seven global events have been observed within the selected period from FY 1997 to FY 2019. All events have been considered from the standpoint of their impact on S&P 500 index. Apart from assessing the sensitivity factor, the impact of each event was observed for any statistical similarity through a One-Way ANOVA test of their normalised values.

TI  - QoS and Handover-Aware Resource Allocation for Flexible Gateway Diversity
T2  - 2021 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE (AEROCONF 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The paper relates to flexible gateway diversity and dynamic resource allocation for high throughput multi-spot beam satellite systems, including a plurality of cooperative gateways; a software-defined networking (SDN) terrestrial infrastructure connecting through a plurality of SDN switches; a SDN controller in charge of dynamically setting up different routing paths for different traffic priority classes through flexible gateways and sending the forwarding rules to the SDN switches; and a cluster of autonomous gateway agents endowed with situational awareness measurements, predictive traffic estimates and resource allocation techniques. In clear sky conditions, the design and implementation of an adaptive architecture with a feedback control loop judiciously allocates gateway resources shared by the said queues such that the network-side discontent; e.g., unmet throughput per traffic class, is minimized. In contrast with ad-hoc approaches that often rely on laborious tuning and design iterations, the use of coordination and control supported by local gateway agents is further investigated to systematically design feedback-based gateway switching mechanisms with proven performance guarantees when subject to degradation of one or more feeder links in potential outage events. Properties of the gateway switching as proposed herein include robust relative handover guarantees and resource utilization efficiency.

TI  - Safety of live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in Australian adults 70-79 years of age: an observational study using active surveillance
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To assess the safety of live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine live (ZVL) through cumulative analysis of near real-time, participant-based active surveillance from Australia's AusVaxSafety system. Design and setting ZVL was funded in Australia for adults aged 70 years from November 2016, with a time-limited catch up programme for those up to 79 years. This cohort study monitored safety in the first two programme years through active surveillance at 246 sentinel surveillance immunisation sites. Participants Adults aged 70-79 years vaccinated with ZVL who responded to an opt-out survey sent via automated short message service (SMS) 3 days following vaccination (n=17 458) or contributed supplementary data through a separate, opt-in online survey at 16 and 24 days following vaccination (n=346). Primary and secondary outcome measures Rates of overall and prespecified adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) by sex, concomitant vaccination and underlying medical condition. Signal detection methods (fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian updating analyses) were applied to reports of medical attendance. Results The median age of participants was 72 years; 53% were female. The response rate following automated SMS was high (73% within 7 days of vaccination). Females were more likely than males to report any adverse event within 7 days of vaccination (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.31); injection site reaction was the most commonly reported (2.3%, n=377). Concomitant vaccination was not associated with higher adverse event rates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Rates of medical attendance were low (0.3%) with no safety signals identified. Supplementary opt-in survey data on later onset adverse events did not identify any difference in AEFI rates between those with and without underlying medical conditions. Conclusions ZVL has a very good safety profile in the first week after vaccination in older adults. Active, participant-based surveillance in this primary care cohort is an effective method to monitor vaccine safety among older adults and will be used as a key component of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance in Australia.

TI  - A Probabilistic Model and Capturing Device for Remote Simultaneous Estimation of Spectral Emissivity and Temperature of Hot Emissive Materials
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the temperature of hot emissive samples (e.g. liquid slag) in the context of harsh industrial environments such as steelmaking plants is a crucial yet challenging task, which is typically addressed by means of methods that require physical contact. Current remote methods require information on the emissivity of the sample. However, the spectral emissivity is dependent on the sample composition and temperature itself, and it is hardly measurable unless under controlled laboratory procedures. In this work, we present a portable device and associated probabilistic model that can simultaneously produce quasi real-time estimates for temperature and spectral emissivity of hot samples in the [0.2, 12.0 mu m] range at distances of up to 20 mu m. The model is robust against variable atmospheric conditions, and the device is presented together with a quick calibration procedure that allows for in field deployment in rough industrial environments, thus enabling in line measurements. We validate the temperature and emissivity estimates by our device against laboratory equipment under controlled conditions in the [550, 850 degrees C] temperature range for two solid samples with well characterized spectral emissivity's: alumina (alpha -Al2O3) and hexagonal boron nitride (h - BN). The analysis of the results yields Root Mean Squared Errors of 32.3 degrees C and 5.7 degrees C respectively, and well correlated spectral emissivity's.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI images for estimating the ecological quality of port waters
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that the TRophic IndeX (TRIX) is informative on the ecological quality of Mediterranean port waters and can be estimated by the processing of multispectral observations collected in situ. The current study investigates the alternative use of multispectral data acquired by medium-high spatial resolution optical satellite sensors, i.e. the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). The study analyzes the impact of the main factors influencing TRIX estimation using datasets collected in several Mediterranean ports and particularly in those of Civitavecchia and Viareggio (Central Italy). The experimental results indicate that the spectral configurations of OLI and MSI have a marginal impact on TRIX estimation, while major effects are caused by the different spatial and temporal features of the two sensors. The enhanced spatial properties of MSI are important particularly in the smaller port of Viareggio; the higher acquisition frequency of this sensor brings significant advantages for operational monitoring applications. Overall, the accuracy of TRIX estimation based on in situ spectral measurements is reduced significantly by the use of OLI images and only marginally by that of MSI images. Both image types represent an advancement for the operational monitoring of port waters.

TI  - "Concordia Discors" and Other Musical Images in A.K. Tolstoy's Dramatic Poem "Don Juan"
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines one of the important components of the creative evolution of Alexei Konstantinovich Tolstoy, who paid great attention to understanding music as an extraterrestrial principle and as a form of art. The article attempts to show that Tolstoy's idea of the ontological worldview and the musical nature of the universe goes back not only to romantic aesthetics and philosophy, as is commonly believed in research, but also to medieval Christian concepts that are consistent with the time of the poet's utopian historiosophy. The poem contains the combination "disagreeable according to" which is a Russian translation of the slightly modified formula "concordia discors" (dissenting consent). The formula goes back to antiquity and means the harmonization of incompatible (contradictory) objects, phenomena, concepts, images. So, in Tolstoy, Satan claims total domination over the universe ("the Lord" "only for beauty"), and the heavenly angels believe that the inconsistency of phenomena is included in the original and totally incomprehensible divine plan. In his "Letter to the Publisher" in 1862, Tolstoy explained the general meaning of his work as follows: "It was an accidental and involuntary protest against the practical direction of our fiction". It seems that in the image of Satan one can see a slight hint of nihilists - modern "new people". In Tolstoy, Satan imitates oblivion of his origins, but the heavenly spirits restore the truth. Another concept that goes back to early Christian literature and is relevant for the poet is the concept of "love" as a single divine principle that brings order to the structure of the musical universe. As L. Spitzer showed, in the early Christian Middle Ages, in particular, in the theological works of Augustine the Blessed (undoubtedly known to Tolstoy), the concept of Pythagorean-Platonic musical harmony was rethought. According to the scholar, the Pythagoreans identified music with the cosmic order, whereas Christian philosophers identify love with music.

AB  - Numerical simulations of wave conditions in Callao bay in normal and extreme conditions were carried out to characterize the wave dynamics in the bay. Bathymetry data from the navigation charts to represent bottom depth were used. Waves in deep waters from numerical reanalysis were calibrated with satellite data that have allowed define scenarios of wave propagation to shallow water in normal and extreme conditions. Model results were compared with in situ wave data obtaining good approximation between modeling and observed waves. Results indicates that waves coming from Southwest and South-Southwest, which is the most predominant waves in deep waters, due to the diffraction effects caused by San Lorenzo Island generate two areas with different wave height conditions, in this way in the area affected by diffraction wave reach height between 0.5 to 1m, while area unaffected by diffraction effects wave reach heigh between 2 to 5m. Waves coming from Northwest has more influence in the bay, due to diffraction effects are neglected and in general terms all the bay increase the wave height around to 2 to 5m.

TI  - Exploiting high frequency monitoring and satellite imagery for assessing chlorophyll-a dynamics in a shallow eutrophic lake
T2  - JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are challenged by cultural eutrophication across the globe, and it is a priority for water managers to implement water quality monitoring at different spatio-temporal scales to control and mitigate the eutrophication process. Phytoplankton abundance is a key indicator of the trophic and water quality status of lakes. Phytoplankton dynamics are characterized by high spatio-temporal variation, driven by physical, chemical and biological factors, that challenge the capacity of routine monitoring with conventional sampling techniques (i.e., boat-based sampling) to characterise these complex relationships. In this study, high frequency in situ measurements and multispectral satellite data were used in a synergistic way to explore temporal (diurnal and seasonal) dynamics and spatial distribution of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, a proxy of phytoplankton abundance, together with physico-chemical water parameters in a shallow fluvial-lake system (Mantua Lakes). A good agreement was found between Chl-a retrieved by remote sensing data and Chl-a fluorescence data recorded by multi-parameters probes (R-2 = 0.94). The Chl-a maps allowed a seasonal classification of the Mantua lakes system as eutrophic or hypertrophic. Along the Mantua lakes system an increasing gradient in Chl-a concentration was recorded following the transition from a fluvial to lacustrine system. There was significant seasonal heterogeneity among the subbasins, probably due to different hydrodynamics, influenced also by macrophyte stands. High-frequency data revealed the importance of rainfall events in the timing and growth dynamics of phytoplankton, particularly for spring and late summer blooms. Combining temporal and spatial data at high resolution improves the understanding of complex fluvial-lake systems. This technique can allow managers to target blooms in near-real time as they move through a system and guide them to localized hot spots enabling timely management action in ecosystems of high conservation and recreational value.

TI  - Applications of Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution for Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been widely used in natural images; however, their applications in satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) have not yet been fully discussed. Hence, it is necessary to analyze the validity of deep learning-based SR methods in SST reconstruction. In this study, an SR model, including multiscale feature extraction and multireceptive field mapping, was first proposed. Then, the proposed model and four other existing SR models were applied to SST reconstruction and analyzed. First, compared with the bicubic interpolation method, the SR models can improve the reconstruction accuracy. Compared with four other SR models, the proposed model can achieve the lowest mean squared error (MAE) in the East China Sea (ECS), in the northwest Pacific (NWP) and in the west Atlantic (WA), the second-lowest MAE in the southeast Pacific (SEP); the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) in ECS andWA, the second-lowest RMSE in NWP and SEP. Additionally, ODRE model can acquire the highest or the second-highest peak single-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index in ECS, NWP, and SEP. Moreover, the number of missing pixels and SST variety are two essential factors in the SRperformance. The proposed multiscale feature extraction process can enhance the SR performance, especially for small regions and stable SST regions. Finally, while a deeper network can be helpful in achieving SR performance, the approach of simply adding more dilation convolutions may not enhance the reconstruction accuracy.

TI  - URBAN (DIS)SIMILARITIES BETWEEN BRAGA AND GUIMARAES (1984-2016): SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF RHYTHM AND GROWTH MODES BASED ON THE LANDSAT ARCHIVE
T2  - FINISTERRA-REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban evolution, a primary question of Urban Geography, has always been limited by the lack of continuous spatial-temporal data. Recently, this limitation has been overcome by the processing in Geographic Information System of sequential snapshots acquired by Remote Sensing. Therefore, we use the Landsat archive to reveal the (dis)similarities of the urbanization process (rhythm and modes) experienced by the municipalities of Braga and Guimaraes between 1984 and 2016. The results show that, more than temporal (When?) or quantitatively (How much?), the urbanization process in the two municipalities presents spatial disparities (Where? and Flow?). The Landscape Expansion Index (LEI) highlights that more than 50% of urban growth occurs in contiguity with the pre-existing fabric. Infilling constitutes the second most important mode in Braga, but not in Guimaraes, where this position is occupied by outlying growth. Consequently, in Braga the urban perimeter captures better the urbanization process than in Guimaries. Thus, LEI can make an important contribution to the understanding of diffuse urbanization, a territorial model constantly called banal, and that - due to such an assertion - has been ignored in relation to other problem-areas.

TI  - SLAVS IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD
T2  - ZBORNIK MATICE SRPSKE ZA SLAVISTIKU-MATICA SRPSKA JOURNAL OF SLAVIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to present in general terms the picture of the Slavs at the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, as a totality of Slavic peoples and cultures, in the light of the crisis in which the modern world, in particular the Slavic, is immersed. In the first part of the work, special attention is paid to cultural, religious, demographic, and other issues, problems of identity of modern Slavs, as well as centrifugal and centripetal processes that determine its present and future. In the second part of the article, the focus is on those processes in the modern world that significantly affect the fate of the Slavs in general and individual Slavic peoples in particular. Most of these processes are characterized by a crisis nature, while ideological, political, economic, educational, cultural, military, and other forms of their manifestation are mainly of a spiritual and eschatological nature. This.pposition of the form and essence of global problems determines the actual confrontation between the dominant worldviews, value systems, archetypes, and cultural codes in the modern world. Without diminishing the importance of national and cultural Slavic identity, as well as scientific, cultural, economic, and any other inter-Slavic cooperation, the author claims that for the Slavs in the modern world it is extremely important to assert and support everything that leads to the spiritual unity of the Slavic peoples as much as possible in the current crisis period at the junction of historical and civilizational eras.

TI  - From high temporal resolution to synthetically enhanced radiometric resolution: insights from Night Thermal Gradient results
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Electromagnetic emissions in thermal infrared bands are an important research topic on pre-earthquake studies. Satellite thermal data have been investigated by many independent research groups looking for their anomalous behaviour before main earthquake's occurrences. Among them, geosynchronous satellite data are reported as less prone to artefacts during data processing. In this work, the Night Thermal Gradient (NTG) algorithm is presented, which has been specifically proposed for geostationary thermal infrared data processing. NTG method relies on the exploitation of high temporal resolution data to find coherent low frequency components of a hypothetical precursory signal of seismic activity. In this paper, the method is presented by giving details about the applied procedures, steps, theoretical assumptions and results obtained during the studies of L'Aquila 2009 earthquake and the seismic activity of Central Italy and Sardinia.

TI  - Improvement of soil property mapping in the Great Clay Belt of northern Ontario using multi-source remotely sensed data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to improve the accuracy in modelling the properties of forest soil by employing a variety of remotely sensed data. In addition to the commonly used multispectral satellite imagery, airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data were exploited to derive detailed vegetation properties and topographic variables. Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches were applied to classify soil types in terms of texture, calcareous substrate reaction to hydrochloric acid, and ELC (Ecological Land Classification) moisture regime. The developed methods were tested on data acquired over a boreal region (49 degrees - 50 degrees N, 81 degrees - 84 degrees W) with a combined area of 4,085 km(2) in the Great Clay Belt (GCB) region, Ontario, Canada. Compared with the fieldcollected data, the overall accuracies and kappa coefficients of the retrieved soil properties were greater than 0.7 and 0.5, respectively. The accuracies attained between the RF and SVM approaches were similar, but in general the highest accuracies were achieved by the RF method. The models developed for the whole GCB regions generated accuracies comparable to those for the three sub-regions. The lowest modelling uncertainties occurred in areas dominated by peatland, whereas the highest modelling uncertainties existed in the regions with dry moisture regime or clayey soil at the surface. The results also showed that environmental covariates corresponding to vegetation were most important in the prediction of soil properties. Specifically, canopy height model (CHM) and gap fraction derived from LiDAR data, were among the most important variables.The inclusion of LiDAR-derived covariates demonstrated potential, applied in addition with topographic and climatic covariates and optical imagery. CHM pertains to the vertical dimension, and gap fraction relates to the density of the canopy layer, respectively; both covariates that offer supplemental detail that is not necessarily ascertained for the canopy by optical imagery.

AB  - Data sets providing repeated observations of land use at fine spatial scales have enabled a new generation of land-use studies. In the past decade, these analyses have put increasing emphasis on empirical research designs that provide more convincing causal estimates. I review the use of instrumental variables, matching, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design, and randomized controlled trials in the recent land-use economics literature, exploring how new data havemade possible the use of these research designs. I show that these estimators have produced different results than were obtained with traditional approaches and have provided new insights into important land-use policy issues such as additionality and spillover effects.

TI  - The NASA MODIS-VIIRS Continuity Cloud Optical Properties Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Aqua MODIS and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) climate data record continuity cloud properties products (CLDPROP) were publicly released in April 2019 with an update later that year (Version 1.1). These cloud products, having heritage with the NASA Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD06 cloud optical properties product and the NOAA GOES-R Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Cloud Height Algorithm (ACHA), represent an effort to bridge the multispectral imager records of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA's current generation of operational weather satellites to achieve a continuous, multi-decadal climate data record for clouds that can extend well into the 2030s. CLDPROP offers a "continuity of approach," applying common algorithms and ancillary datasets to both MODIS and VIIRS, including utilizing only a subset of spectral channels available on both sensors to help mitigate instrument differences. The initial release of the CLDPROP_MODIS and CLDPROP_VIIRS data records spans the SNPP observational record (2012-present). Here, we present an overview of the algorithms and an evaluation of the intersensor continuity of the core CLDPROP_MODIS and CLDPROP_VIIRS cloud optical property datasets, i.e., cloud thermodynamic phase, optical thickness, effective particle size, and derived water path. The evaluation includes analyses of pixel-level MODIS/VIIRS co-locations as well as spatial and temporal aggregated statistics, with a focus on identifying and understanding the root causes of individual dataset discontinuities. The results of this evaluation will inform future updates to the CLDPROP products and help scientific users determine the appropriate use of the product datasets for their specific needs.

TI  - Electroacoustic Experiments in French Film Music: On the Issue of Prerequisites
T2  - NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the phenomena of European art of the first half of the 20th century, which not only prepared the birth of electroacoustic music, but also contributed to the dialogue between this trend of academic art and film music. The new view on the phenomenon of sound was the result of scientific and technological progress, powerful social transformations, and a change in the worldview paradigm. The first part of the article discusses the idea of autonomous sound in the works of Luigi Russolo, the concept of "liberation of sound" in the music of Edgar Varese, and the role of noise design in the creative actions of Dadaists and performances of Antonin Artaud's "theatre de la cruaute" ("theatre of cruelty"). The second part is devoted to an in-depth study of sound-noise experiments in the French film music of the 1930s and 1940s. Analyzing samples of musical and noise collages (collaborations of Jacques Tati and Jean Yatove in the film Jour de fete, Rene Clair and Georges Auric-in A nous la liberte, Jean Vigo and Maurice Jaubert-in L'Atalante, Jean Renoir and Joseph Kosma-in La Bete humaine); methods of manipulating the optical track and the "partition retrograde" (the product of the "co-authorship" of directors Jean Gremillon and Julien Duvivier and composers Alexis Roland-Manuel and Maurice Jaubert); examples of enriching the timbre palette of film music through electronic instruments (ondes Martenot in the music of Arthur Honegger, Adolphe Borchard, Maurice Thiriet to the films of Abel Gance, Dimitri Kirsanoff, Sacha Guitry, Marcel L'Herbier) in the context of global trends in art and technology, the author comes to the conclusion that by the beginning of the 1950s, the ground for electroacoustic experiments and their immediate introduction into film music was fully prepared, and that in the previous years, filmmakers had realized the expressive power of noise and electronic sounds.

TI  - PRISHVIN AND TROTSKY: A MAN "LIKE A PHARMACIST" IN THE NOVEL "THE WORLD CUP", JOURNALISM AND THE WRITER'S DIARY
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the subject of the article is the question of the influence of L. D. Trotsky [Bronstein], who was one of the key leaders of Bolshevism, who headed the October Revolution, on the worldview and creativity of M. M. Prishvin, which has not yet been considered in the European studies. It is shown that in Russian art it is difficult to find an artist of the word, whose work would be to the same extent conditioned by the influence of the ideological and political context. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that for the first time an attempt was made to show how, through individual characters in his works, Prishvin in an artistic and figurative form reflected the characteristic features of behavior, everyday habits, the style of thinking and speech of Trotsky. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of previously unpublished due to censorship restrictions of the writer's works: the story "The World Cup", journalism of the revolutionary years and the 18-volume Diary, which became available to the reader only in the post- Soviet period. It is shown that, depicting Trotsky as a "pharmacist" who, according to his recipes, is trying to create the future of a huge country, Prishvin seeks not only to artistically reflect his moral appearance and personality traits, but also to convey the features of the ideological and political struggle in Soviet society.

T2  - THEOLOGY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The manipulation of popular religiosity by drug trafficking at the epicenter of the world drug market represents a challenge for Latin American theology. How might it reflect on popular religiosity in areas replete with cartels? How might it help popular religiosity to become the fruit of true justice without imposing the judgmental worldview of enlightened elites? This article will attempt to answer both questions over the course of four sections. First, it will describe the history of Latin American revaluations of popular religiosity as a theological starting point. Second, it will demonstrate the conceptualization of popular religion by Latin American and Hispanic scholars and theologians in the United States. Third, it will analyze how drug trafficking permeates popular religiosity in Latin America. Finally, it will propose an appropriate pastoral and theological approach to popular religiosity in areas affected by drug trafficking.

T2  - JOURNAL FUR KULTURPFLANZEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital farming enables software tools with which processes such as plant protection can be planned in detail before the application of plant protection products (PPPs) and decisions can be made on this basis. The developed assistance system implements precisely this for plant protection and makes it available for practical farming. By integrating various services, the creation of application maps is made possible and a wide variety of information sources from web services are made available. The data input initially consists of long-term yield data, zone management maps, digital elevation data, satellite data and also sensor data, which are processed in the assistance system, can also be post-processed by the user if necessary and are applied by the field sprayer on a site-specific basis with the aid of the map material generated. The assistance system accompanies the user through the entire process - planning, preparation, application and documentation - of crop protection. For this purpose, for example, distance requirements specific to the medium, user protection regulations, the drift reduction potential of the technology used, the current weather conditions and other information are processed by the digital assistance system and taken into account in the recommendations.

TI  - A new simple topo-climatic model to predict surface displacement in paraglacial and periglacial mountains of the European Alps: The importance of ground heating index and floristic components as ecological indicators
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape evolution is occurring at rapid rates in alpine areas in response to recent climate warming, also due to the susceptibility and the heterogeneity of these environments. Here we present a prediction model of surface displacements that takes into account both topographic and climatic variables. Observed points of surficial displacements have been associated to non-climatic (altitude, slope, solar radiation, till deposit type, deposit age, vegetation coverage) and climatic (days of snow permanence, ground surface temperature index, ground heating index, ground cooling index) variables through a general regression model in the European central Alps.The model output shows the importance of slope and ground heating index (GHI) - an estimation of the amount of energy transferred to the ground, to predict surface displacements independently from the type of considered processes. In particular, the general regression model shows that steep zones with high GHI are more susceptible to undergo periglacial and paraglacial processes producing surface displacements. As expected, slope is fundamental to trigger processes such as gravitation, nivation, solifluction and their interactions. The results of our model emphasize the key role of GHI, highlighting the importance of climate in controlling the surface displacement. Indeed, in areas in which GHI is higher, the ground can remain snow free for a longer time and snow melting can be faster, the former favoring more runoff and slopewash, and the latter promoting the saturation of the deposits consequent to a higher intensity of solifluction and/or mass movements processes.Within the study area, the sites with the largest displacements (> 35 cm) were detected where permafrost degradation occurred since 1990. This permafrost degradation process could remain one of the main triggering factors of future surface displacements. Our results confirm that when movement involves material with coarse texture (pebbles and boulders) exceeding the rooting depth, only tolerant plant species can withstand the high movement rates. The areas where this can happen (like rock glaciers or screes) act as a physical barrier to grasslands species not adapted to surface displacements and trying to shift towards higher altitude in response to climate warming. However, plant species not considered as indicators of movement (such as graminoids), can develop also with large surface displacements in specific geomorphic conditions. Therefore, the combination of surface displacement type (deep vs surficial), material texture (fine vs coarse) and vegetation cover (high vs low) and floristic composition can be used as a valuable ecological indicator of movement.Our results suggest that both landscape degradation and vegetation displacement can be rapid especially where the air warming was strong as in the selected study area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers some modem approaches to understanding social -philosophic basis for Russian World theory. The author gives a conclusion that modem approaches to understanding this concept and this phenomenon accumulating mostly social-philosophic and sociological theories take their roots in western European tradition. The article presents an approach to understand metaphysical view of the Russian World as a religious idea basing on Russian philosophic tradition. It also deals with the position that the basis for the concept of the Russian World finds itself in the Orthodox ethics of interactions forming a specific reality for the bearers of such an idea in their everyday practices and determining their way of thinking notwithstanding their religious and philosophic positions. The author assumes that having accepted the Orthodox religious basis for the supporters of the concept of the Russian World does not necessarily mean following this religious dogmatics by all participants of such an interaction.

TI  - The Formation of the Poetics of the Visual in Ontological Poetry at the Turn of the 19th Century
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The topicality of the issue in question is associated with the need to identify the tradition and innovation of Russian poetry at the turn of the 19th century in the aspect of visualizing an artistic image. The novelty of the research is seen in the expansion of concepts about the poetics of the visual through analyzing the concept of the artistic worldview, not only of the key figures of the historical and literary process, but also of the heirs to G.R. Derzhavin's poetic style of understudied poets (M.N. Muravyov, A.A. Volkova), whose best poems are significant in the historical and literary process. The analysis of visual metaphors in the poetry of G.R. Derzhavin, M.N. Muravyov, A.A. Volkova proved that in Russian poetry at the turn of the 19th century, a peculiar manner of vision took shape, associated with the perception of the contemplated world as a picture, and, as a result, a new aesthetic vector of self-knowledge and knowledge of the world through glance took shape, the diversity and greatness of God's world is emphasized in visual representations, it is through them that the causal relationship of the phenomena of reality is comprehended. The article reconstructs the features of the artistic thinking of poets at the turn of the 19th century, identifies certain ways to create a visual verbal image based on transforming the visually perceived world into a verbal form. Consideration of the genesis of the poetics of the visible, associated with the creation of an allegorically presented worldview, allows us to describe with high accuracy the most vivid methods of representing visual images, to present an effective pattern for analyzing landscape ecphrasis in the works of Russian poets.

TI  - Wind energy potential for the electricity production - Knjazevac Municipality case study (Serbia)
T2  - ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial potential for harvesting wind energy is not an easy task to perform in conditions of deficiency of accurate data in remote and large areas (macro to medium locations). There are different methodologies available to identify the most suitable location for the installation of wind power generators. One of the most suitable approaches that employ the Multi-Criteria Analysis method for wind energy potential of the Municipality of Knjazevac (East Serbia) is combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information Systems. Collection and creation of geospatial data for the research encompassed meteorological data from all available sources, digital elevation model (DEM) to analyze the orography of the terrain, and Landsat 8 satellite data to analyze six land cover (LC) classes. The identification of three best locations for the wind power generators (wind farms) using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) analysis solved the major location problem: how to select the best locations for investment in the renewable energy sector and minimize the impact on the environment. The result indicates that only one part of the municipality, at the hub height of 100 m, has enough wind potential to produce energy.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF SOIL EROSION DYNAMICS USING REMOTE SENSING AND SWAT IN KOPAONIK NATIONAL PARK, SERBIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a global environmental and economic problem that is significantly related to land-use changes. Over the last decades, several mountain areas in Serbia were exposed to strong human pressure caused by winter tourism development. The largest ski center in Serbia is situated on Kopaonik Mountain within the boundaries of Kopaonik National Park, where the conflict between economic and conservation goals is rapidly growing. In this study, we calculated the sedimentation and surface runoff in three sub-basins in the area of Kopaonik ski resort for two years (1984 and 2018) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and analyzed the changes that occurred during the observed period. The results show an increase in surface runoff and sediment yield in sub-basins 1 and 3 and a decrease in sub-basin 2. The analysis of land cover change shows an expansion of evergreen forests, appearance of barren soil and urban areas, reduction of mixed forests and pastures, and the appearance of deciduous forests. These findings indicate that in the area studied, the dominant processes are the development of tourism and natural revegetation of abandoned agricultural land. Application of remote sensing techniques and SWAT contributes to identifying and monitoring land degradation problems and improving conservation and management practices.

AB  - The Salton Sea is one of the largest inland man-made water bodies in California and supports vital habitat for birds and wildlife. However, the lake has been in a critical situation in the past few years due to decreasing water levels, receding shorelines, and increasing salinity. In this study, we quantify and analyze the long-term changes in the surface area and volume of the Salton Sea utilizing remote sensing-based spectral water indices and GIS. Landsat TM images of every five years during the period of 1995-2015 were used. Normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were computed to delineate open water features. These spectral indexes were calculated, analyzed, and classified independently to extract the lake surface area for each year in GIS. The index threshold for water was adjusted using aerial imagery from Google Earth as reference. The index that provided clear demarcation of water-non water boundary was chosen from visual analysis at lake-river confluence. The Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI) was used for surface area validation. The lake surface maps were generated from all remote sensing images and overlaid to produce lake surface area change maps over the study period. The volume calculation utilized one-foot bathymetric contour data, water surface elevation, and water maps. The calculated area agreed well with the validation data set with the difference of less than 0.5%. The assessment of the area and volume over the study period demonstrated significant variations. The reduction of surface area by 7.5% and volume by 19% was observed. Volume of the lake showed the potential of significant reduction in comparison to area and elevation. The proposed method can be used for the regular assessment of Salton Sea's dynamics and can help planners for developing various mitigation, management, and restoration projects of the Salton Sea.

TI  - A Computational Methodology for the Calibration of Tephra Transport Nowcasting at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based remote sensing equipment have the potential to be used for the nowcasting of the tephra hazard from volcanic eruptions. To do so raw data from the equipment first need to be accurately transformed to tephra-related physical quantities. In order to establish these relations for Sakurajima volcano, Japan, we propose a methodology based on high-resolution simulations. An eruption that occurred at Sakurajima on 16 July 2018 is used as the basis of a pilot study. The westwards dispersal of the tephra cloud was ideal for the observation network that has been installed near the volcano. In total, the plume and subsequent tephra cloud were recorded by 2 XMP radars, 1 lidar and 3 optical disdrometers, providing insight on all phases of the eruption, from plume generation to tephra transport away from the volcano. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and FALL3D models were used to reconstruct the transport and deposition patterns. Simulated airborne tephra concentration and accumulated load were linked, respectively, to lidar backscatter intensity and radar reflectivity. Overall, results highlight the possibility of using such a high-resolution modelling-based methodology as a reliable complementary strategy to common approaches for retrieving tephra-related quantities from remote sensing data.

TI  - Identification of Phyllosilicates in the Antarctic Environment Using ASTER Satellite Data: Case Study from the Mesa Range, Campbell and Priestley Glaciers, Northern Victoria Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Antarctica, spectral mapping of altered minerals is very challenging due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of poorly exposed outcrops. This investigation evaluates the capability of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite remote sensing imagery for mapping and discrimination of phyllosilicate mineral groups in the Antarctic environment of northern Victoria Land. The Mixture-Tuned Matched-Filtering (MTMF) and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM) algorithms were used to detect the sub-pixel abundance of Al-rich, Fe3+-rich, Fe2+-rich and Mg-rich phyllosilicates using the visible and near-infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER. Results indicate that Al-rich phyllosilicates are strongly detected in the exposed outcrops of the Granite Harbour granitoids, Wilson Metamorphic Complex and the Beacon Supergroup. The presence of the smectite mineral group derived from the Jurassic basaltic rocks (Ferrar Dolerite and Kirkpatrick Basalts) by weathering and decomposition processes implicates Fe3+-rich and Fe2+-rich phyllosilicates. Biotite (Fe2+-rich phyllosilicate) is detected associated with the Granite Harbour granitoids, Wilson Metamorphic Complex and Melbourne Volcanics. Mg-rich phyllosilicates are mostly mapped in the scree, glacial drift, moraine and crevasse fields derived from weathering and decomposition of the Kirkpatrick Basalt and Ferrar Dolerite. Chlorite (Mg-rich phyllosilicate) was generally mapped in the exposures of Granite Harbour granodiorite and granite and partially identified in the Ferrar Dolerite, the Kirkpatrick Basalt, the Priestley Formation and Priestley Schist and the scree, glacial drift and moraine. Statistical results indicate that Al-rich phyllosilicates class pixels are strongly discriminated, while the pixels attributed to Fe3+-rich class, Fe2+-rich and Mg-rich phyllosilicates classes contain some spectral mixing due to their subtle spectral differences in the VNIR+SWIR bands of ASTER. Results derived from TIR bands of ASTER show that a high level of confusion is associated with mafic phyllosilicates pixels (Fe3+-rich, Fe2+-rich and Mg-rich classes), whereas felsic phyllosilicates (Al-rich class) pixels are well mapped. Ground truth with detailed geological data, petrographic study and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis verified the remote sensing results. Consequently, ASTER image-map of phyllosilicate minerals is generated for the Mesa Range, Campbell and Priestley Glaciers, northern Victoria Land of Antarctica.

M3  - Article
AB  - Acute hydrological natural hazards, such as floods, not only affect the lives and properties of people but also cause severe damage to the critical infrastructures, which needs to be function even in substandard situations. Therefore, it is significant to predict the flood-prone areas for understanding how critical infrastructures are exposed to massive flooding. For this aim, flood-prone areas and their susceptibility are mapped using machine learning techniques including boosted regression tree (BRT) and generalized linear model (GLM) with the help of Sentinel 3 satellite images in Google Earth Engine. The BRT model achieved the highest precision (AUC = 81.10%) in comparison to GLM (AUC = 78.30%) and was utilized for evaluating the flood risk on critical infrastructures. In addition, the flood risk in four large and famous watersheds, namely Zohre, Dorodzan, Tashk-Bakhtegan, and Qareagaj located in Fars Province was analyzed, among which Zohre had the highest risk to flooding. The assessment of flood risk on critical infrastructures, such as hospitals, pharmacies, banks, fire stations, automated teller machines, fuel stations, speed cameras, and mosques located in Shiraz County (capital of Fars Province) disclosed that these structures had high and very high flood hazard. The evaluation of flood risk on schools situated in nine most populated cities of Fars Province was also carried out, which revealed that Shiraz had the maximum percentage (92.98%) and Marvdasht had the least percentage (60.75%) of schools that fall under very high risk. This article aids the decision makers in better planning for flood resilience and risk management.

TI  - Persistent pollutants in Northern Gannet <i>Morus bassanus</i> eggs in Ireland: Levels and colony differences
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seabird eggs are considered a favourable matrix for monitoring marine pollutants and are widely used as higher trophic level indicators. Persistent organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other organochlorine compounds (OCs) as well as metals have been shown to have deleterious impacts on seabirds. The Northern Gannet Morus bassanus is an avian sentinel; the largest breeding seabird in Ireland and an obligate piscivore. Gannet eggs were collected from two island colonies off the east coast of Ireland in locations with divergent history of industrialisation. Contaminant levels were measured and differences in concentrations between colonies compared. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were measured in each egg to understand the influence of diet and trophic position on contaminant levels detected. Significantly higher levels of Sigma 14PCBs, Sigma 7PBDEs and total mercury were detected in Gannet eggs from Lambay Island near Dublin (Ireland's industrialised capital city) compared to Great Saltee Island. No differences were observed in levels of other OCs (HCB, Sigma HCH, Sigma CHL, Sigma DDT) between the two colonies. Though Gannets travel significant distances when foraging for food, tracking studies have demonstrated that birds from proximal breeding colonies maintain exclusive feeding areas. Stable isotope ratio analysis in this study demonstrated that Gannets at both locations occupy similar dietary niches, indicating that dietary differences may not be the driver of differing contaminant levels between colonies. Levels of persistent pollutants in the Gannet eggs fall below most existing thresholds for adverse effects and are within internationally reported values. Recent population growth and range expansion of Gannets in Ireland suggest that persistent pollutants are not having an immediate impact on the Gannet population. This study will inform potential monitoring programmes that can help Ireland achieve good environmental status under the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated the dust aerosol influx into the snow cover in the region of Nizhnevartovsk. The average content of solid insoluble particles in snowmelt waters for conventionally background area is 12.0 mg/L, four times larger than for the reference uncontaminated territories. The high local background is typical for the Middle Ob River area and is due to the effect of remote oil production plants. Under urban conditions, the aerosol dust influx increases by a factor of 7.5 relative to conventionally background area. The dust particle influx leads an intense alkalization of snow cover. Results obtained during field tests are compared with spectral properties of snow. Landsat-8 (OLI sensor) data are used to calculate snow indices (normalized difference index, normalized index, and contamination index), which agree with ground-based observations and can be used to estimate the technogenic contamination level. The normalized snow index is optimal to estimate the amount of dust sediments, and snow contamination index is optimal to estimate acid-base (pH) conditions.

CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Deformation map prediction is a critical tool to foresee signs of abnormal events. Such forecasting facilitates quick countermeasure to avoid undesirable conditions. This work presents a novel recurrent neural network to forecast time-series deformation maps from InSAR data. Our proposed recurrent network employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to identify vital temporal features that influences subsequent deformation maps. We have evaluated our model on volcanic monitoring data using the Micronesia islands (Canary and Cape Verde archipelagos) Sentinel-1 imagery acquired between 2015 and 2018. The proposed method achieves minimal prediction error compared to the observed deformation values, suggesting the high reliability of our approach. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in forecasting deformation maps with high accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Various ablation studies were conducted to study and validate the effectiveness of the multi-scale attention mechanism for deformation map forecasting.

AB  - Mapping cities is difficult due to the dense and varied development of infrastructures in urban contexts. To adapt cities for modern faculties, regular monitoring of developing infrastructures is essential. The built-up land use map derived from remote sensing images shows how cities expand horizontally across the landscape as they grow over decades. Recent studies have shown that when planning for a more sustainable future in metropolitan settings, adding vertical components in the computation of built-up is beneficial for better understanding. As illustrated in this paper, the built-up area of an urban region is extracted from high-resolution LISS IV satellite sensor image data using deep learning techniques. The height of an urban built-up is estimated from Cartosat-1 stereo images using photogrammetric methods and automatic terrain extraction. This study combines the use of a deep learning model with the use of high-resolution remote sensing data to extract the urban built up volume. The results demonstrate that the western and northwestern areas of the study region see greater changes in urban volume compared to the central business district and other parts of the city. This work demonstrates a step-by-step strategy for studying urban growth patterns. It helps in understanding urban growth, population mobility patterns, societal typology, environmental indicators. The outcome of such study could be useful in the evaluation of various indicators of growth such as economic growth, traffic density conditions, utility planning, policy framework such as master plan preparation, and so on for governmental authorities.

TI  - Enhanced Estimation of Significant Wave Height with Dual-Polarization Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most advanced open-access satellite systems available, benefitting from its capability for earth observation under all-weather conditions. In this study, more than 280 Sentinel-1 SAR images are used to derive significant wave heights (H-s) of the sea surface using a polarization-enhanced methodology. Two study areas are selected: one is located near Hawai'i in a deep water region, and the other is in transitional water off the U.S. west coast, where the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy data are available for validations. The enhanced H-s retrieval methodology utilizes dual-polarization SAR image data with strong non-Bragg radar backscattering, resulting in a better estimate of the cut-off wavelength than from those using single-polarization SAR data. The new method to derive H-s is applied to SAR images from 2017 taken from both deep water (near Hawai'i) and coastal water locations (off the U.S. West coast). The assessments of the retrieved H-s from SAR images suggest that the dual-polarization methodology can reduce the estimated H-s RMSE by 24.6% as compared to a single-polarization approach. Long-term reliability of the SAR image-derived H-s products based on the new methodology is also consolidated by large amount of in-situ buoy observations for both the coastal and deep waters.

AB  - In recent times, satellite data availability has increased significantly, helping researchers worldwide to explore, analyze and approach different problems using the most recent techniques. The segmentation of sediment load in coastal areas using satellite imagery can be considered as a cost-efficient process as sediment load analysis can be costly and time-consuming if done hands on. In this work, we created dataset of Bangladesh marine area for segmenting sediment load and showed the applicability of deep learning technique to segment sedimentation into 5 different classes (Land, Hight Sediment, Moderate Sediment, Low Sediment and No Sediment) using deep neural network called U-Net. As our collected satellite image is enormous, we showed how patch-wise learning technique can be an effective solution in the context of batch-wise training. Highest dice coefficient of 86% and validation dice coefficient of 87% has been acquired for Dec-2019 time frame data. The highest 77% of pixel accuracy and 78% of validation pixel accuracy was achieved on the same time frame data.

TI  - Assimilation of satellite and other data for the forecasting of tropical cyclones over NIO
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Cyclones that occur over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) are warm cored, highly devastating and short-lived compared to other oceanic basins. Numerical prediction of these cyclones is mainly an initial value problem. Accuracy of the initial position largely depends on forecasting model, density & quality of observations and data assimilation scheme. State of the art numerical modeling systems are able to predict the genesis of most cyclonic systems reasonably well, but often, they fail to maintain the correct position and intensity. Satellite observations play an important role in cyclone prediction as they also cover data sparse open ocean. Often intensity and structural characteristics of these systems need to be inferred from the remotely sensed data. Satellite observations are increasingly being used to better initialize the tropical cyclones' location and intensity in the NWP systems. This study highlights India's efforts in the reception and assimilation of satellite and various other observations from different sources. The impacts of these observations are studied by carrying out Observing System Experiment (OSE) and through Forecast Sensitivity Observation Impact (FSOI) studies. Some of the recent OSEs on Tropical Cyclones over the NIO and a list of more beneficial observations through FSOI are presented in this paper.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Samarinda is one of the big cities on Kalimantan Island, which is also the capital of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The proximity with the prospective new Indonesia State Capital, Penajam Paser Utara, and increasingly massive urban activities can potentially increase considerable changes in green open space in the future. The availability of trees in green open spaces has an important role in mitigating climate change because of its ability to store carbon stock. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an inventory, monitoring, and evaluate the above ground carbon stock value in Samarinda. This study aims to find a suitable vegetation index for carbon stock estimation, as well as determine the total and spatial distribution of carbon stocks using the best vegetation index in green open space vegetation in Samarinda City using Sentinel-2 imagery. Sentinel-2 L2 MSI imagery was utilized to build a carbon stock model based on field sample calculation. Empirical modeling with the allometric equation was carried out, wherein carbon stocks at points of samples correlate with the index value of each transformation selected by the ability to assess vegetation (DVI, EVI2, GNDVI, NDVI, OSAVI, SARVI, and SARVI). Statistical analysis performed is normality test, correlation analysis with Pearson Product Moment method, and regression using simple linear analysis. The significance test was carried out using the ANOVA Test and Partial T-Test, while the accuracy-test used the Standard error of estimate (SEE) method on independent validation samples. The results showed that the best vegetation indices were GNDVI with the highest coefficient of determination of 0.552. Moreover, the significance test shows that all indices significantly affect the estimation of carbon stocks in Samarinda. The accuracy test shows that GNDVI has a maximum accuracy of 55.816% by an estimated error of 1.775 tons/pixel.

AB  - The proposed work tells about safety helmet which is used to avoid the accidents which will cause in the work space with a low-cost sensor. This helmet will help in maintaining the safety of worker and also operational ability of work. This helmet will reduce the safety monitoring costs to the company. This work suggests the safety helmet with number of sensors which will continuously monitor the worker health condition minute to minute and will store the data that is collected by the sensors to the cloud data base. The supervisors or the controllers can spectate the workers all the time. In this helmet there is GPS which will provide the location of the worker in case he is unable to move. The sensors provided in the helmet will trigger the alarm in case of hazardous conditions. There is sensors and interne' continuous link using hot spot towers which can intermediate the data flow. In this project we use node MCU as controller which is embedded with Wi-Fi drives so it can be used as long term communications. In work places communication plays vital roles so long term communications is much useful compared to short term communications. The device always connects to the interne' so the controller of the workers always checks the data. Here we use temperature sensor, gas sensor, GPS, humidity sensor etc.

TI  - A Novel Approach Based on a Hierarchical Multiresolution Analysis of Optical Time Series to Reconstruct the Daily High-Resolution Snow Cover Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution (HR) snow cover maps derived by remotely sensed images are an asset for data assimilation in hydrological models. However, the current satellite missions do not provide daily HR multispectral observations suitable for an accurate snow monitoring in alpine environments. On the contrary, low-resolution (LR) sensors acquire daily information of snow cover fraction (SCF) but at an inappropriate spatial scale. This article proposes a novel approach that combines multisource and multiscale acquisitions to infer the daily HR snow cover area (SCA) for mountainous basins. The approach builds on the assumption that interannual snow patterns are both affected by the local geomorphometry and meteorology. We derive these patterns through a hierarchical multistep approach based on historical statistical analyses on a long and sparse HR time-series. At each step, we obtain HR snow cover maps with higher number of reconstructed pixels but decreasing level of confidence. Historical data are used to estimate the probability that a HR pixel is covered by snow according to two possible multiscale strategies: 1) HR gap-filling, or 2) LR downscaling. These analyses lead to the identification of the patterns that regularly appear given certain conditions. When no systematic patterns are observed, we reinforce the inference of the pixel class by a generalized additive model that exploits not only the historical data, but also explicit geomorphometric, global snow, and multitemporal properties. The proposed approach has been validated on a catchment in the Sierra Nevada, USA, for three hydrological years (2017-2019) showing an average overall accuracy of 92%.

T2  - SLOVENSKA LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides an insight into the writings of Slovak Catholic literati published between the end of World War II and the establishment of the communist totalitarian rule in Czechoslovakia in 1948. The writing of Catholic literary critics concentrated in two religious-cultural periodicals Nova praca and Verbum. For both magazines, the article draws on their respective historical-contextual backgrounds and points to differences in their visions of cultural work. Subsequently, it characterises the way the periodicals profiled their literary criticism in reviews, glosses, commentaries and articles dealing with more general cultural topics and provides profiles of the three most significant literary critics - Alos Stankovsky (1925- 2002), Vojtech Mihalik (1926 - 2001) and Jozef Kutnik Smalov (1912 - 1982). The article is a contribution towards a better knowledge of the Catholic literary criticism that formed alongside the poetry of Slovak Catholic Modernists. The work of Catholic literary criticism has not been studied as much as the poetry of Catholic Modernists and this article aims at rectifying this deficiency somewhat.

AB  - Crop type maps are often generated using remotely sensed data acquired by sensors mounted on satellites, manned aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or 'drones'), the most popular being multispectral sensors mounted on satellites. Aerial multispectral sensors are more frequently employed where imagery with very high spatial resolution is required. However, the use of Lidar data for crop type mapping is still uncommon. This article outlines research done on creating crop type maps using Lidar, Sentinel-2 and aerial data along with several machine learning classification algorithms for differentiating four crop types in an intensively cultivated area.

T2  - ACTA DERMATOVENEROLOGICA CROATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma can early metastasize to regional lymph nodes. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node draining directly from the site of primary melanoma, and the pathohistological status of the SLN is the most significant prognostic factor for overall survival prevalence and prognosis in patients with melanoma. Ultrasound is a very useful for the imaging of regional lymph node metastases, combined with Doppler and cytopuncture.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ultrasound assessment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma staging.Patients and methods: The study included all patients with primary melanoma detected in the period between 2003 and 2012, in whom diagnostic processing has not proven distant metastases or physical examination did not find enlarged lymph nodes. In total, 202 surgically treated patients were included in the study, of which 101 patients underwent ultrasound examination of regional lymph nodes using a linear probe of at least 12 MHz, while ultrasound of regional lymph nodes was not performed for 101 patients.Results: The results of this study emphasize the importance of ultrasound in the diagnostics and treatment of patients with melanoma. Based on the observation of the occasional positive ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in regional lymph nodes, our results indicate that a proportion of patients can avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In case of a positive ultrasound findings (complemented with FNAC of suspicious nodes), direct dissection of regional lymph nodes is recommended. However, negative ultrasound findings do not exclude the presence of micrometastases due to poor sensitivity of this method and is not a contraindication for SLNB.Conclusion : Therefore, there is a need for further studies on metastatic melanoma, especially those in the sentinel lymph nodes and in its early stage.

TI  - The project of retheoretization of political philosophy in E. Voegelin's <i>A New Science of Politics</i>
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the project of the retheoretization of political science proposed by political philosopher E. Voegelin. By means of retheoretization (restoration) of the classical Platonic and Aristotelian political philosophy, Voegelin attempts to provide an answer to the discredited positivistic worldview of man, politics and history. Voegelin's political philosophy evaluates critically both the methods and the subject matter of political science, explores the human nature and reality of human existence in society and history, comprehends relations between knowledge and reality, penetrates the sources of the disorder of society, probes the limits of instrumental rationality, and establishes an ontological basis for political epistemology. His aim is to regain a truth of political order that has been lost through the process of modernization. In developing the theme of retheoretization, he distinguishes between classical political philosophy as represented in the works of Plato and Aristotle, on the one hand, and the modern understanding as conceived by positivism on the other. Voegelin argues that modern political science, like modernity in general, is the result of the great Gnostic revolution. Retheoretization, he insists, would return political science to the kind of enterprise founded by Plato and Aristotle, and overcome the effects of positivism with its emphasis on emulating the methods of natural science and establishing a value-free mode of inquiry. The article concludes that all of Voegelin's topics are part of his overall plan for the restoration of a true science of politics. This plan, as the authors of the article argue, in A New Science of Politics is not only outlined, but also partially implemented, and Vogelin's work itself is an example of a restored political philosophy.

CP  - IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)
CL  - Indianapolis, IN
AB  - The first two steps of performance analysis and design of transport systems usually consist of identifying the best spatial discretization of the considered study area, namely zoning, and of the relevant Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. In this framework, zones are generally delimited by physical obstacles such as rivers, transport infrastructures, or buildings that can be well-identified in satellite remotely sensed data. Assuming the availability of pre-existing zones and OD matrices for the considered study area, this paper defines a semi-automatic procedure that employs fusion with satellite imagery for supporting the zone discretization and the OD matrix refinement. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world case study consisting of the Italian city of Genoa.

M3  - Article
AB  - The research prominence lies in an increasing interest of the state in patriotic education and physical training of young people for homeland defence. There is an urgent today to reconstruct the ethnic model of patriotic education and its component, in particular military-and-patriotic education, identify the means of physical culture and sports (physical exercise; natural, artificial and hygienic factors) and justify their use under reforms in education following the needs and demands of the individual and the society in Ukraine. The research aims to theoretically justify and experimentally verify the effectiveness of military-and-patriotic education of young people using physical culture and sports based on ethnopedagogy, following neuropedagogical criteria of their psychophysical readiness for homeland defence. The authors of the research offer to introduce the specialized course on martial arts of Ukraine, which refers to the worldview and mindset of Ukrainians underlying the Ukrainian military (combat) culture, as well as strengthening and enhancement of neuropsychological properties and symptom complexes of character. The control group pupils (25) were taught based on the traditional system (they acquired and improved their knowledge, abilities and skills in preliminary military training). The experimental group pupils (25) purposefully studied the specialized course on the martial arts of Ukraine. Such methods as surveys, questionnaires, tests, interviews and observations were used to conduct neuropsychological diagnostics of young people's readiness for homeland defence. In EG, the number of the respondents with a high level of psychophysical readiness for homeland defence has increased by 10.3%; the number of the respondents with an average level of psychophysical readiness for homeland defence has increased only by 2.2%; the number of the respondents with a low level of psychophysical readiness for homeland defence has decreased by 12.5%. Modern military-and-patriotic education of young people can be considered effective if the pedagogical model of military-and patriotic education using physical culture and sports and taking into account neuropsychological and neuropedagogical factors is integrated into the modern system of national education.

TI  - Historical and Near-real Time SST retrievals from Metop AVHRR FRAC with the Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean
T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The first full-mission AVHRR FRAC SST dataset with nominal 1.1km resolution at nadir was created from three Metop First Generation (FG) satellites: A (2006-present), B (2012-present) and C (2018-present), using the NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise system. Historical reprocessing (Reanalysis-1, RAN1) starts at the beginning of each mission and continues into near-real time (NRT) processing. ACSPO generates two SST products: Global Regression (GR) SST, highly sensitive to the skin SST, and Piecewise Regression (PWR) SST, a proxy for the depth SST. The effect of orbital and sensor drift on the stability of the SST time series is mitigated by retraining the regression coefficients daily against matchups with the drifting and tropical moored buoys. Those matchups are collected within moving windows: 91-day for GR and 361-day for PWR, with the offsets adjusted within a 31 day window. In RAN1, all training and offset correction windows are centered at the processed day. In NRT processing, the training and offset delayed windows of the same sizes and ending in 4-10 days prior to the processed day are used. This mitigates long-term calibration trends on scales from 1-2 months in both RAN1 and NRT. Short-term variations in SST biases in NRT are higher than in RAN1 but do not exceed similar to 0.05 K. Delayed-mode RAN processing follows the NRT with a lag of similar to 2 months, resulting in higher quality, more consistent Metop-FG SST record. The presentation evaluates the performance of the ACSPO AVHRR FRAC dataset and compares it with the EUMETSAT OSISAF Metop-A and -B FRAC SSTs available in PO.DAAC.

TI  - DMYTRO STOLYPIN'S SOCIAL EXPERIMENT REPERCUSSIONS IN THE AGRARIAN REFORM OF 1906 - 1917
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research is to study Dmytro Stolypin's social experiment repercussions in the agrarian reform of 1906 - 1917 through the family's vision retrospective concerning the peasant issue's essence in the Russian Empire at the second half of the XIXth - at the beginning of the XXth century. The Methodology of the Research. The key to understanding the publication's subject essence could be found in the plane of the postmodern methodology. Due to the use of the principles of objectivity, multifactorialism, historicism, as well as historical genetic, problem chronological, historical and biographical, retrospective, prosopographic methods and content analysis, the goal was achieved. The scientific novelty. The D. A. Stolypin's experiment is considered not only as one of the domestic sociological science's sprouts, but also the family practice, which influenced P. A. Stolypin's worldview formation, as a microsocial process from the steps of the "problem statement" and the "revolution in consciousness" that preceded the agrarian reform break out in 1906 - 1917. The Conclusions. The social experiment took place in 1874 - 1893 near the village of Mordvynivka, Berdyansk district (povit), Tavriya huberniya (province) and covered 214 people. Its purpose was to create the rental farms in order to increase D. A. Stolypin's estate profitability and to popularize among the local peasantry of the leading at that time the intensive forms of the local management. D. A. Stolypin, Comte's student and follower, the experiment was an empirical proof of the correctness concerning the views on the peasant issue's essence. It became the basis of a report proclaimed in March 1882 in the Moscow Imperial Society of Agriculture. The latter contained proposals for the relaxation and further abolition of ransom payments for the peasants, the introduction of private ownership of communal land, the land management, and stimulating the growth of the peasant land ownership. The comparison with the agrarian legislation of 1905 - 1911 allowed to reveal a number of similar features.

AB  - The aim of this experiment is to classify forest and non-forest areas in the Amazon rainforest in a specific area of interest using documented Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) like U-Net, utilizing Google Colab with Keras and TensorFlow as processing tools, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a satellite imagery data source and classified training data source.Several classifications were performed, each one during the period may-august in different years in an approximately 5-year interval, ergo, different satellite missions were considered to cover a long monitoring period, e.g., 20 years. The satellite missions that were used to classify forest land cover are Landsat 5, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2.FCNN was trained by patches of 3.87 x 3.87 km(2) and 1.29 x 1.29 km(2) for Landsat and Sentinel, respectively, equivalent to 128x128 pixel containing 4 bands: Red, Green, Blue, Near Infrared and a fifth additional band that is the Random Forest (RF) classification which contains the binary labels. This RF classification is performed using the GEE classifier and is taken as the ground truth, therefore, one assumes that RF classification errors can be inherited to the FCNN classification, although, in some cases, it may learn to discard some patterns. The validation of this classification is performed using randomly generated validation points that were manually classified through Collect Earth and high-resolution images, depicting the high goodness of the computed product. The experiment overall produced around 96% accuracy in RF classification and 97% with FCNN.

TI  - Axillary ultrasonography combined with pre- operative wire localisation of clipped node in nodal restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in node positive breast cancer patients: a pilot study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of axillary ultrasonog-raphy (axUS) and ultrasound-guided pre-operative wire localisation of pre-treatment positive clipped node (CN) for prediction of nodal response to neoadjuvant chemo-therapy (NACT) in node positive breast carcinoma patients. Methods and materials: A prospective study was conducted between June 2018 and August 2020 after Ethics Committee approval. Breast carcinoma patients (cT1- cT4b) with palpable axillary nodes (cN1- cN3) and suitable for NACT were recruited after written informed consent. Single, most suspicious node was biopsied and clipped. Nodal response to NACT was assessed on axUS. Wire localisation of CN was performed prior to axil-lary lymph node dissection (ALND). Diagnostic perfor-mances of axUS and CN excision were assessed. Results: Of the 69 patients evaluated, 32 patients (mean age, 43.5 +/- 11.8 years; females, 31/32 [97%]; pre-menopausal, 18/32 [56.3%]) with metastatic nodes who received NACT were included. Nodal pathological complete response rate was 34.4% (11/32) overall and 70% (7/10) in patients with <2 suspicious nodes on pre- NACT axUS. False-negative rates (FNRs) of axUS and CN excision were 4.8% and 28.6% respectively. Combination of post- NACT axUS and CN excision had an FNR of 4.8% overall and 0% in patients with <2 suspicious nodes on pre- NACT axUS. Conclusion: Combination of AxUS and ultrasound-guided wire localisation of pre-treatment positive CN has high diagnostic accuracy for nodal restaging after NACT in node positive breast cancer patients. Advances in knowledge: Addition of axUS assessment to wire localisation of CN reduces its FNR for detecting residual metastasis after NACT.

TI  - Situational Awareness of Large Infrastructures Using Remote Sensing: The Rome-Fiumicino Airport during the COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Situational awareness refers to the process of aggregating spatio-temporal variables and measurements from different sources, aiming to improve the semantic outcome. Remote Sensing satellites for Earth Observation acquire key variables that, when properly aggregated, can provide precious insights about the observed area. This article introduces a novel automatic system to monitor the activity levels and the operability of large infrastructures from satellite data. We integrate multiple data sources acquired by different spaceborne sensors, such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, and Pleiades Very-High-Resolution (VHR) optical data. The proposed methodology exploits the synergy between these sensors for extracting, at the same time, quantitative and qualitative results. We focus on generating semantic results, providing situational awareness, and decision-ready insights. We developed this methodology for the COVID-19 Custom Script Contest, a remote hackathon funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC), whose aim was to promote remote sensing techniques to monitor environmental factors consecutive to the spread of the Coronavirus disease. This work focuses on the Rome-Fiumicino International Airport case study, an environment significantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The resulting product is a unique description of the airport's area utilization before and after the air traffic restrictions imposed between March and May 2020, during Italy's first lockdown. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm provides remarkable insights for supporting an effective decision-making process. We provide results about the airport's operability by retrieving temporal changes at high spatial and temporal resolutions, together with the airplane count and localization for the same period in 2019 and 2020. On the one hand, we detected an evident change of the activity levels on those airport areas typically designated for passenger transportation, e.g., the one close to the gates. On the other hand, we observed an intensification of the activity levels over areas usually assigned to landside operations, e.g., the one close to the hangar. Analogously, the airplane count and localization have shown a redistribution of the airplanes over the whole airport. New parking slots have been identified as well as the areas that have been dismissed. Eventually, by combining the results from different sensors, we could affirm that different airport surface areas have changed their functionality and give a non-expert interpretation about areas' usage.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying cherry fruit quality parameters is essential to maintaining high quality produce throughout the supply chain as it influences consumer confidence in the product. Hyperspectral imaging offers high potential as a non-destructive and fast analytical tool for estimating various quality parameters in different food products. The objective of the study is to investigate the potential of hyperspectral imaging for quality (total soluble solids concentration, TSS and flesh firmness, FF) assessment in fresh cherry fruits. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) was used to evaluate the prediction performance and predictive uncertainty. Test dataset results highlight that GPR can be used to predict TSS (RPDT = 3.04; R-T(2) = 0.88; RMSET = 0.43%) and firmness (RPDT = 2.54; R-T(2) = 0.60; RMSE = 0.38 N) of cherry fruits with high accuracy. In addition, GPR models showed lower uncertainty with a prediction interval coverage probability (PICP) of 0.90-0.97. Overall, hyperspectral imaging combined with multivariate data analysis using GPR can be used as a robust and reliable tool to estimate cherry fruit quality parameters.

TI  - InSAR Multitemporal Data over Persistent Scatterers to Detect Floodwater in Urban Areas: A Case Study in Beletweyne, Somalia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A stack of Sentinel-1 InSAR data in an urban area where flood events recurrently occur, namely Beletweyne town in Somalia, has been analyzed. From this analysis, a novel method to deal with the problem of flood mapping in urban areas has been derived. The approach assumes the availability of a map of persistent scatterers (PSs) inside the urban settlement and is based on the analysis of the temporal trend of the InSAR coherence and the spatial average of the exponential of the InSAR phase in each PS. Both interferometric products are expected to have high and stable values in the PSs; therefore, anomalous decreases may indicate that floodwater is present in an urban area. The stack of Sentinel-1 data has been divided into two subsets. The first one has been used as a calibration set to identify the PSs and determine, for each PS, reference values of the coherence and the spatial average of the exponential of the interferometric phase under standard non-flooded conditions. The other subset has been used for validation purposes. Flood maps produced by UNOSAT, analyzing very-high-resolution optical images of the floods that occurred in Beletweyne in April-May 2018, October-November 2019, and April-May 2020, have been used as reference data. In particular, the map of the April-May 2018 flood has been used for training purposes together with the subset of Sentinel-1 calibration data, whilst the other two maps have been used to validate the products generated by applying the proposed method. The main product is a binary map of flooded PSs that complements the floodwater map of rural/suburban areas produced by applying a well-consolidated algorithm based on intensity data. In addition, a flood severity map that labels the different districts of Beletweyne, as not, partially, or totally flooded has been generated to consolidate the validation. The results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Ciletuh Geopark is one of UNESCO's tourist attractions as one of the Global Geopark located in Sukabumi Regency, West Java, one of the most visited tourist destinations because of its beauty and role in knowledge development. It caused Geopark Ciletuh to have significant growth in facilities and accessibility, which generated land cover change that triggered the critical land. This study aims to analyze the land cover change in Ciletuh Geopark until 2030 to identify essential land. The method used in this study is Cellular Automata-Markov Chain to detect the land cover change and predict its transformation in the future with several driving factors built based on fuzzy logic. The variable contains proximity to the road, the settlement, the coastline, slope, and population density. Land cover map obtained processing Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2010, 2015, and 2020. This study proves that land cover changes are mainly due to housing and facilities' need to support tourism activities. The conversion from the agricultural area that abandoned becomes shrubs. This research was expected to become a medium that will move the government and local people to make the land used well and still be the sustainable geopark.

AB  - Rubber plants are one of the plantation commodities which occupy an important position as a source of non-oil and gas foreign exchange for Indonesia. Rubber production is currently experiencing a decline due to reduced productivity in rubber plantations. Rubber plantation problems related to land resources require effective and efficient technological input to determine the health of rubber plants so that they can increase rubber production. Remote sensing technology is one input that can be used as a decision maker to decide problems spatially and quickly, accurately, and dynamically. This study aims to determine the health condition of rubber plants in Cibungur Plantation, Sukabumi, West Java by using high-resolution satellite imagery, namely Sentinel 2-A images processed using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) method in monitoring the spatial health of rubber plants. The results of this study indicate that the level of distribution of NDVI values in Cibungur Plantation is quite high and rubber plants with very good health conditions have the largest area of 5,365.98 hectares. The NDVI method and Sentinel 2-A image processing used in this study can be used to determine the health of rubber plants in Cibungur Plantation.

AB  - V. I. Vernadsky's work "The Beginning and Eternity of Life" (1922), as well as his other scientific works, made a significant contribution to the development of many branches of natural history. It fundamentally changed the scientific worldview of the twentieth century. This work determined the place of man and his scientific thought in the evolution of the biosphere, made it possible to take a fresh look at the surrounding nature as the environment of human existence. It posed many actual problems and outlined ways to solve them in the future. The combination of deep knowledge in various industries with the history of their development determined the formation of V. I. Vernadsky's views on science as a specific natural phenomenon inherent to the genus Homo sapiens. He considered the progress of science as the natural process of the development of human thought, aimed at the cognition of the laws of nature and the laws of its own development.V. I. Vernadsky has analyzed various mechanisms of the origin of life and came to the conclusion that life could be eternal and had no beginning. He emphasizes two geologically most important points: firstly, the planetary, geologically regular nature of life; secondly, the close connection of all geological processes in the biosphere with the activity of living matter. Consequently, the understanding of life as a planetary phenomenon led V. I. Vernadsky to an understanding of the direct dependence of the existence of the biosphere on the conditions caused by geological processes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research is to analyze the place and role of the culturalcivilizational approach within the problem field of historical research studies. The research methodology is based on the principles of historicism, objectivity, interdisciplinarity. The authors used hermeneutic, cultural historical, historical logical, transdisciplinary, and integrative approaches. The scientific novelty of the study consists in the justification of the feasibility of further development and use of the cultural and civilizational approach in contemporary historical science, which has become especially relevant in the context of nowadays globalization processes. The Conclusions. The results of the study allow us to conclude that the cultural civilizational approach has a powerful potential to become one of the most fruitful tools of the historical exploration in the new millennium. As the approach enables scientists to combine the study of general and specific in history; to analyze the development trends of both planetary society and local civilizations from the standpoint of contemporary achievements and problems; to understand their logic within the worldview and value system of any given culture. The expansion of the functional field of cultural civilizational approach will promote intercultural dialogue of the members of different regional communities, as well as the representatives of historical science; in this dialogue, the various vectors of socio cultural interaction will not exclude, but will mutually complement each other. Reflecting the long-lasting experience of the thinkers who have sought to build a logically consistent and historically accurate image of the past, the cultural civilizational approach will contribute to a well-grounded explanation of the present and predict the future of the world community. The cultural civilizational approach is a promising tendency in the development of the methodology of historical science, which is able to become the basis of mass historical consciousness contributing to the successful human activity in the contradictory postmodern world. The contemporary cultural civilizational approach has to be "embedded" in a broader context, which requires the joint efforts of historians, philosophers, sociologists, political scientists, theologians, psychologists, anthropologists, etc.

Based on the classified aerosol properties, contributions of aerosol inflow and outflow can be inferred and scenarios based on these results were also determined. Column aerosol observation status for two cities showed that the aerosol optical depth (ACID) observed in Seoul is 39.2% (0.18 +/- 0.16) higher than that of Gangneung (0.28 +/- 0.24), and the Angstrom Exponent (AE) was a similar range level (1.29 +/- 0.3). Although aerosol loads are differences between the two regions, the particle size distribution of regions is similar. For the machine learning clustering analysis, all data samples were classified as the best number of classes and optimized scenarios for Seoul and Gangneung were determined. In order to verify the created scenarios, a case was selected from the GOCI RGB image and MODIS L1B, and the scenario algorithm was performed using the actual ground observation data. This methodology is useful for monitoring and predicting fine dust through the characterization and contribution calculation of atmospheric column aerosols.

TI  - Reliability and Integrity of Forest Sector Statistics-A Major Constraint to Effective Forest Policy in Russia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Russia owns one-fifth of the world's forest-covered area but has never been the leader of the global forest sector nor in gross output or relative productivity. The issues of the Russian forest sector have attracted research attention, but for many topics, this is still a green field on the map of sectoral studies. We developed a novel approach to understand the primary causes of the inefficiency of the Russian forest policy through the qualitative assessment of completeness and reliability of forest sector-related data. The main output of this paper is a thorough overview of the available sources of data with an assessment of their quality, completeness and reliability. We show that the Russian official forest sector statistics provide only basic indicators for very short periods with few observations being incomplete and inconsistent. Besides a critical analysis of the official statistics, we also discover some known, but still underemployed, resources of information on the Russian forest sector: textual information of official public bodies and companies, accounting records, remote-sensing data, etc. Finally, we discuss the possible ways to improve the data procurement of the forest sector in Russia to support future decision-making. We are convinced that a prerequisite for the implementation of effective forest policy in Russia is a significant expansion and improvement of the volume and quality of statistics on the dynamics of Russian forests and forest economy. Integration of existing and new data sources is necessary to achieve synergistic effects, both in terms of deepening the understanding of key business processes in the industry and in the sense of solving strategic tasks of its development.

AB  - Large-area crop classification using multi-spectral imagery is a widely studied problem for several decades and is generally addressed using classical Random Forest classifier. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have been proposed. However, these methods only achieved results comparable with Random Forest. In this work, we present a novel CNN based architecture for large-area crop classification. Our methodology combines both spatio-temporal analysis via 3D CNN as well as temporal analysis via 1D CNN. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach on Yolo and Imperial county benchmark datasets. Our combined strategy outperforms both classical as well as recent DCNN based methods in terms of classification accuracy by 2% while maintaining a minimum number of parameters and the lowest inference time.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variation analysis and probability prediction of algal blooms in Lake Chaohu (2009-2018) based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The algal blooms problem caused by eutrophication of lakes has seriously affected the utilization and protection of freshwater resources, hence the rapid, comprehensive and accurate monitoring of algal blooms information is of great significance for the governance of water environment. Taking Lake Chaohu as the research area, this article uses multi-source optical remote sensing images and spatio-temporal fusion technology to reveal the spatio-temporal change trends of algal blooms from the year of 2009 to 2018, by employing band fusion method and supervised classification-based blooms extraction method. The results show that : The algal blooms in Lake Chaohu are mainly sporadic and localized. In 2012, regional cyanobacteria blooms appeared for the first time. Algal blooms in Lake Chaohu has a strong seasonal variation, and there is a big difference between summer and winter which is most significant in 2018; in the last five years, the occurrence frequency of algal blooms was significantly higher than that of the previous five years. The west half lake blooms were more serious than the east half lake blooms, and the northwest part of Lake Chaohu had a high incidence of algal blooms. In 2011, the algal blooms began to spread to the coast; In 2014, the algal blooms first appeared in the southwest lake area; In 2016, the eastern and central parts of Lake Chaohu became the high-occurrence area. Besides, based on the relevant meteorological data of Lake Chaohu, this paper constructs a Logistic forecast model of algal meteoro- logical risk probability with an average prediction accuracy rate of 87.52%. The study of the spatio-temporal variation of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Chaohu can help us to grasp its dynamic trend from a macro perspective, providing a theoretical basis for subsequent lake area governance and ecological environment construction. Besides, the algal blooms meteorological risk probability prediction model can provide decision support for early warning and prevention of Lake Chaohu's algal blooms.

TI  - Observation of HCHO before and after Epidemic in Huaibei Area Based on MAX-DOAS
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) with the characteristics of simple operation, wide range and high sensitivity was constructed, and the time series of HCHO in Huaibei area from October 2019 to May 2020 were obtained continuously. In order to reduce the interference of other gases, different bands are used to retrieve the differential slant column density of HCHO. Through comparison, it was found that when the band of 324-342 nm was selected, the inversion error fluctuation is the minimum, and the concentration of HCHO gas can be obtained precisely. According to the results of HCHO monthly mean values, compared with the before and after COVIN-9 epidemic ,the concentration of HCHO in the COVIN-9 epidemic were decreased by 35% and 23% respectively. The results of daily and weekly variations respectively showed that HCHO concentration in Huaibei area have daily variation characteristics of high in the morning and evening and low in noon, and there is no obvious weekend effect. Combined with Hysplit wind field backward trajectory model, the wind field of high value weather was studied. It was found that during January 12 similar to 14 and 18 similar to 21, 2020, under the influence of northwest wind field, the pollution transport from Dangshan and other places in Huaibei area will be affected, which will lead to the increase of HCHO concentration. The result of MAX-DOAS measurement of HCHO vertical column density were compared with the OMI satellite data, and it was found that the two methods had good consistency (R-2 = 0.87).

TI  - Seismic Microwave Brightness Temperature Anomaly Detection Using Multitemporal Passive Microwave Satellite Images: Ideas and Limits
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal anomalies related to large earthquakes are frequently reported, but focus on the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the uncovered results caused by the diverse method used, data used, and case studies is lacking. Taking seismic anomaly detection using passive microwave remote sensing as an example, this study revealed and illustrated the time series of microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly associated with the May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the April 2010 Yushu earthquake, the April 2013 Lushan earthquake, and the April and May 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence. Cross comparison showed that the spatial distribution of MBT anomalies behaves differently with different background-removal methods. More regional and detailed MBT anomalies (but with weaker intensities) were obtained with higher frequency data, whereas more pronounced MBT anomalies (but with fewer details) were acquired with lower frequency data. The amplitude and spatial scales of MBT anomalies at H polarization were larger than that at V polarization. And 10.7 GHz at H polarization was recommended as the optimal band. The spatiotemporal evolutions of MBT anomalies associated with the four selected earthquake cases were compared and found to be closely related to respective earthquake preparation mechanisms. The aforementioned characteristics and uncertainties of MBT anomalies under different conditions were then discriminated and discussed based on microwave remote-sensing physics, and the applications and limitations of the present study were illustrated and analyzed. The findings of this study are of great significance for remote sensing data selection, reliability assessment, and result interpretation in seismic-anomaly research.

TI  - Mapping Frozen Ground in the Qilian Mountains in 2004-2019 Using Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The permafrost in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs), the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, changed dramatically in the context of climate warming and increasing anthropogenic activities, which poses significant influences on the stability of the ecosystem, water resources, and greenhouse gas cycles. Yet, the characteristics of the frozen ground in the QLMs are largely unclear regarding the spatial distribution of active layer thickness (ALT), the maximum frozen soil depth (MFSD), and the temperature at the top of the permafrost or the bottom of the MFSD (TTOP). In this study, we simulated the dynamics of the ALT, TTOP, and MFSD in the QLMs in 2004-2019 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The widely-adopted Stefan Equation and TTOP model were modified to integrate with the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) in GEE. The N-factors, the ratio of near-surface air to ground surface freezing and thawing indices, were assigned to the freezing and thawing indices derived with MODIS LST in considerations of the fractional vegetation cover derived from MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results showed that the GEE platform and remote sensing imagery stored in Google cloud could be quickly and effectively applied to obtain the spatial and temporal variation of permafrost distribution. The area with TTOP < 0 degrees C is 8.4 x 10(4) km(2) (excluding glaciers and lakes) and accounts for 46.6% of the whole QLMs, the regional mean ALT is 2.43 +/- 0.44 m, while the regional mean MFSD is 2.54 +/- 0.45 m. The TTOP and ALT increase with the decrease of elevation from the sources of the sub-watersheds to middle and lower reaches. There is a strong correlation between TTOP and elevation (slope = -1.76 degrees C km(-1), p < 0.001). During 2004-2019, the area of permafrost decreased by 20% at an average rate of 0.074 x 10(4) km(2)center dot yr(-1). The regional mean MFSD decreased by 0.1 m at a rate of 0.63 cm center dot yr(-1), while the regional mean ALT showed an exception of a decreasing trend from 2.61 +/- 0.45 m during 2004-2005 to 2.49 +/- 0.4 m during 2011-2015. Permafrost loss in the QLMs in 2004-2019 was accelerated in comparison with that in the past several decades. Compared with published permafrost maps, this study shows better calculation results of frozen ground in the QLMs.

TI  - Assessment of Satellite Chlorophyll-Based Leaf Maximum Carboxylation Rate (Vcmax) Using Flux Observations at Crop and Grass Sites
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) is a key parameter in modeling plant photosynthesis. The rapid and accurate acquisition of Vcmax at large scales can improve understanding of global vegetation productivity and the terrestrial carbon cycle. In this article, we assessed the retrieval of Vcmax from satellite data by validating these data using flux observations made at eight crop and grass sites. Firstly, an empirical model applicable to C-3 species that was based on the semimechanistic linkage between leaf chlorophyll and Vcmax was used to derive Vcmax from satellite data. Then, using vegetation, soil, and meteorological variables as inputs, the SCOPE model was used to estimate Vcmax from half-hourly or hourly flux observations at each site. The estimates of Vcmax were assessed by comparing the simulated gross primary production (GPP) against the observed GPP: that is, the Vcmax value corresponding to its simulated diurnal GPP data with minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) was selected as the inverted Vcmax value. Finally, the Vcmax values retrieved from MERIS and Semtinel-3 OLCI satellite data were validated using the in situ flux site observations. The results showed that the estimates of Vcmax based on satellite data successfully captured the seasonal variations in Vcmax retrieved from the tower-based GPP data, giving a mean RMSE value of 15.30 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Our results support the retrieval of Vcmax from satellite data based on the link with leaf chlorophyll content and show that there was good agreement between Vcmax derived from remote sensing and flux data.

TI  - Improve the Accuracy of Water Storage Estimation-A Case Study from Two Lakes in the Hohxil Region of North Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water storage is essential information for lake research. Previous studies usually used bathymetric data to acquire underwater topography by interpolation method, and to therefore estimate water storage. However, due to the large area of Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes, the method of bathymetry was challenging to cover the whole region of one lake, and the accuracy of the underwater topography, in which no bathymetric data covered, was low, which resulted in a comparatively large error of lake water storage estimation and its change. In this study, we used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and in situ bathymetric data to establish the underwater topography of Hohxil Lake (HL) and Lexiewudan Lake (LL) in the Hohxil Region of North TP and estimate and analyzed the changes of lake level and water storage. The results showed HL and LL's water storage was 5.12 km(3) and 5.31 km(3) in 2019, respectively, and their level increased by 0.5 m/y and 0.57 m/y during 2003-2018, respectively. They were consistent with those (0.5 m/y and 0.5 m/y) from altimetry data, and they were much more accurate than those results (0.077 m/y and 0.156 m/y) from bathymetric data. These findings indicated that this method could improve the accuracy of lake water storage and change estimation. We estimated water storage of two lakes by combining with multitemporal Landsat images, which had doubled since 1976. Our results suggested that the increasing precipitation may dominate the lake expansion by comparing with the change of temperature and precipitation and the increasing glacial meltwater contributed approximately 4.8% and 10.7% to lake expansion of HL and LL during 2000-2019 based on the glacier mass balance data, respectively.

TI  - A New Geostationary Satellite-Based Snow Cover Recognition Method for FY-4A AGRI
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important component of the cryosphere. Clouds have a large influence on optical remote sensing satellites when recognizing snow cover. Geostationary satellites, due to their high-frequency observations over coverage areas, can effectively compensate for the drawback of snow cover recognition from polar orbit optical satellites under cloud-covered conditions. However, past geostationary satellites have relatively few band settings to produce sensitive factors for snow cover recognition. The FY-4A Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) satellite has the advantage of high temporal resolution with a wealth of bands, which highlights its potential in reducing the impact of clouds and accurately obtaining snow cover information. Based on the advantages of FY-4A AGRI data and the flow characteristics of clouds, we developed an improved maximum brightness temperature image synthesis algorithm, which can greatly reduce the probability of cloud and snow cover misclassification. Combining the features of FY-4A AGRI data, we reorganized the snow cover recognition factor and developed a new snow cover recognition method. The results show that the proposed method can reduce cloud cover by 57.172% compared with MOD10A1 data. After evaluating the proposed method using meteorological ground observation datasets and MOD10A1 data, we found that the overall accuracy of the proposed method can reach 94.11% and 98.55%, respectively, and the F-score (FS) can reach 73.05% and 85.40%, respectively.

TI  - Exploiting Hierarchical Features for Crop Yield Prediction Based on 3-D Convolutional Neural Networks and Multikernel Gaussian Process
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely prediction of crop yield based on remote sensing data is important for food security. However, crop growth is a complex process, which makes it quite difficult to achieve better performance. To address this problem, a novel 3-D convolutional neural multikernel network is proposed to capture hierarchical features for predicting crop yield. First, a full 3-D convolutional neural network is constructed to maximally explore deep spatial-spectral features from multispectral images. Then, a multikernel learning (MKL) approach is proposed for fusion of intraimage deep spatial-spectral features and intersample spatial consistency features. Specifically, we assign a group of nonlinear kernels for each feature in the MKL framework, which provides a robust way to fit features extracted from different domains. Finally, the probability distribution of prediction results is obtained by a kernel-based method. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on China wheat yield prediction and offer detailed and systematic analyses of the performance of the proposed method. In addition, our method is compared with several competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has certain advantages and can provide better prediction performance than the competitive methods.

TI  - Identifying Pine Wood Nematode Disease Using UAV Images and Deep Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine nematode is a highly contagious disease that causes great damage to the world's pine forest resources. Timely and accurate identification of pine nematode disease can help to control it. At present, there are few research on pine nematode disease identification, and it is difficult to accurately identify and locate nematode disease in a single pine by existing methods. This paper proposes a new network, SCANet (spatial-context-attention network), to identify pine nematode disease based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multi-spectral remote sensing images. In this method, a spatial information retention module is designed to reduce the loss of spatial information; it preserves the shallow features of pine nematode disease and expands the receptive field to enhance the extraction of deep features through a context information module. SCANet reached an overall accuracy of 79% and a precision and recall of around 0.86, and 0.91, respectively. In addition, 55 disease points among 59 known disease points were identified, which is better than other methods (DeepLab V3+, DenseNet, and HRNet). This paper presents a fast, precise, and practical method for identifying nematode disease and provides reliable technical support for the surveillance and control of pine wood nematode disease.

TI  - Sea surface wind speed retrieval from Sentinel-1 HH polarization data using conventional and neural network methods
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional retrieval and neural network methods are used simultaneously to retrieve sea surface wind speed (SSWS) from HH-polarized Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR images. The Polarization Ratio (PR) models combined with the CMOD5.N Geophysical Model Function (GMF) is used for SSWS retrieval from the HH-polarized SAR data. We compared different PR models developed based on previous C-band SAR data in HH-polarization for their applications to the S1 SAR data. The recently proposed CMODH, i.e., retrieving SSWS directly from the HH-polarized S1 data is also validated. The results indicate that the CMODH model performs better than results achieved using the PR models. We proposed a neural network method based on the backward propagation (BP) neural network to retrieve SSWS from the S1 HH-polarized data. The SSWS retrieved using the BP neural network model agrees better with the buoy measurements and ASCAT dataset than the results achieved using the conventional methods. Compared to the buoy measurements, the bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and scatter index (SI) of wind speed retrieved by the BP neural network model are 0.10 m/s, 1.38 m/s and 19.85%, respectively, while compared to the ASCAT dataset the three parameters of training set are -0.01 m/s, 1.33 m/s and 15.10%, respectively. It is suggested that the BP neural network model has a potential application in retrieving SSWS from Sentinel-1 images acquired at HH-polarization.

TI  - Inflammatory Demyelinating Lesions: True Sentinel Lesion or Immune-Mediated Response to Lymphoma?
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory demyelinating changes in the absence of malignant cells can sometimes be found on initial biopsies preceding the diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), resulting in the term "sentinel" lesion. Sentinel lesions have been reported sporadically in literature, resulting in many cases of misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. We aim to address the problem of misdiagnosis in PCNSL presenting as inflammatory demyelinating changes or sentinel lesions on initial biopsies, and to discuss our view of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon.CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we report 3 cases of PCNSL that were diagnosed via brain biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed 2 cases of initially misdiagnosed PCNSL presenting with sentinel lesions at our institution. Careful revision of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed heterogeneously enhancing tumors with strong peripheral enhancement and hypoenhancing cores. Analysis of our 2 cases revealed that initial biopsy samples in both patients were taken from the hypoenhancing regions on MRI. In the third case, we targeted the peripherally enhancing region for sampling and arrived at the proper diagnosis of PCNSL on initial biopsy.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our cases and those reported in literature, we speculate that the inflammatory demyelinating changes observed on initial biopsies are immune-mediated responses that coexist with PCNSL in different tumor regions, and that they are the direct result of inadvertent sampling from hypoenhancing regions of the tumor, rather than sentinel lesions, as their name implies. We strongly recommend that biopsy target the most enhanced region on MRI when there is high clinical and radiologic suspicion for PCNSL.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Contribution of Blue-green Spaces to the Urban Thermal Environment in Changsha, China
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban thermal environment issues have become a potential threat to the urban ecosystem and residents' health. Thermal environment issues in Changsha are becoming more serious with the expansion of built-up areas and the decrease in the area of blue-green spaces. In this study, the spatiotemporal evolution of blue-green spaces and their influence on the thermal environment of Changsha from 1988 to 2019 were assessed using Landsat images. The results show that the loss of blue-green spaces and the exacerbation of thermal environment issues in Changsha began around 1999. Over the study period, the total area of blue-green spaces decreased by 427.27 km(2), corresponding to 16.5% of the study area, leading to an increase in the average land surface temperature (LST) of Changsha of 2.59 degrees C. During summer, the cooling effect of water is the highest among all blue-green space types, which is -1.29 degrees C, followed by cropland (-0.82 degrees C) and forest (-0.55 degrees C). However, the cooling effect of forest in other seasons is always greater than that of cropland. The cooling effect of blue-green spaces in spring, summer, and fall is generally greater than that in winter. Over the study period, the temperature increases caused by spatial changes from water, cropland, and forest to built-up areas are 1.39, 1.17, and 1.1 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Application of Landsat ETM plus and OLI Data for Foliage Fuel Load Monitoring Using Radiative Transfer Model and Machine Learning Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliage fuel load (FFL) is a critical factor affecting crown fire intensity and rate of spread. Satellite observations provide the potential for monitoring FFL dynamics across large areas. Previous studies commonly used empirical methods to estimate FFL, which potentially lacks reproducibility. This study applied Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI data for FFL retrieval using radiative transfer model (RTM) and machine learning method. To this end, the GeoSail, SAIL, and PROSPECT RTMs were first coupled together to model the near-realistic scenario of a two-layered forest structure. Second, available ecological information was applied to constrain the coupled RTM modeling phases in order to decrease the probability of generating unrealistic simulations. Third, the coupled RTMs were linked to three machine learning models-random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron-as well as the traditional lookup table. Finally, the performance of each method was validated by FFL measurements from Southwest China and Sweden. The resulting multilayer perceptron (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.13, and rRMSE = 0.43) outperformed the other three methods. The evaluation of the applicability of the FFL estimates was conducted in a southwest China forest where two occurred in 2014 and 2020. The FFL dynamics from 2013 through 2020 showed that the fire was likely to occur when the FFL accumulated to a critical point (around 27 x 10(6) kg), highlighting the relevance of remote sensing derived FFL estimates for understanding potential fire occurrence.

AB  - The rice-shrimp farming system is considered as a sustainable and beneficial model for the environment. However, the area of rice-shrimp was increasingly narrowed due to the trend of converting from rice to aquaculture by economic reasons. This paper aims to propose a medium scale land use change model for understanding the land use decision of farmers in adaptation to the environment and climate change. The model integrates a land-use decision making process based on multi-criteria selection where the main factors are land suitability, land convertibility, land use situation of neighbors, and profitability of land use patterns. Concerning the land use data, we used historical land use map in 2005, 2015 and 2019. Shrimp cultivation regions was completed by Landsat satellite image processing. The model has been calibrated by rice-shrimp map in 2015 and has been verified with the rice - shrimp map in 2019 of the My Xuyen district, Soc Trang province, Vietnam. The simulated results show that the rice-shrimp area was increasingly narrowed and has been converted to aquaculture land. In addition, the model tends to show that in a scenario of sea level rise of 15 cm in 2030, the share of rice-shrimp and shrimp tends to rise sharply, which is an important lesson for developing complex adaptive strategies of farmers.

TI  - An Overview of Requirements, Procedures and Current Advances in the Calibration/Validation of Radar Altimeters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the radar echoes from a spaceborne altimeter gives information on sea surface height, wave height and wind speed, as well as other parameters over land and ice. The first spaceborne radar altimeter was pioneered on Skylab in 1974. Since then, there have been about 20 further missions, with several advances in the sophistication of hardware and complexity of processing with the aim of increased accuracy and precision. Because of that, the importance of regular and precise calibration and validation ("cal/val") remains undiminished, especially with efforts to merge altimetric records from multiple missions spanning different domains and time periods. This special issue brings together 19 papers, with a focus on the recent missions (Jason-2, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A and HY-2B) as well as detailing the issues for anticipated future missions such as SWOT. This editorial provides a brief guide to the approaches and issues for cal/val of the various different derived parameters, including a synopsis of the papers in this special issue.

TI  - Characterising the spring and autumn land surface phenology of Macaronesian species using Sentinel-2 data: the case of Canary Islands

AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of vegetation analysing phenological metrics phenometrics- derived from vegetation indices time series (VI), has emerged as an important research focus in recent decades as LSP patterns have been considered as an important ecological indicator for understanding the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. LSP from high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery in ecosystems with significant heterogeneity of plant species, such as Macaronesian ecosystems, are needed for a better understanding on how these ecosystems function. The objective of this study was to monitor LSP dynamics of representative species of the Canary Islands: Olea Cerasiformis, Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus turbinata, Pinus canariensis, Myrica Faya and Erica arborea. NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) Sentinel-2 time series at a spatial and temporal resolution of 10 meters and 5 days were generated for the 2018-2020 period. Atmospheric disturbances and noise were reduced using a double-logistic function. SOS (start of the growing season), EOS (end of the growing season) and LOS (length of the growing season) were extracted using a threshold-based method. Thermophilus species, such as Olea Cerasiformis and Pistacia atlantica had the SOS in October-November and the EOS between June and July. Juniperus turbinata showed double seasonality in La Palma, being the first growing season between November-December and April-May and the second growing season between May-June and September-October. Growing season of Pinus canariensis started in September-October and ended in April-June, nevertheless a double seasonality was observed in some locations of Pinus canariensis, probably associated to the understory. Subtropical laurel forest composed by different plant species, such as Myrica Faya and Erica arborea, did not show a clear seasonality. The species-specific LSP patterns for the Canary Islands can contribute to stablishing a baseline to monitor future impacts of climate change in Macaronesian biogeographical region.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Equipped with various types of imagers, lasers and radars, dozens of satellites orbit the earth every day collecting and relaying data for weather and atmospheric analysis, communication and navigation applications and planetary studies. Earth orbiting satellites are part of the critical space infrastructures. NASA's Global Energy and Water Cycle (GEWEX) surface radiation budget (SRB) shortwave algorithm derives long-term datasets from satellite data of the distribution of the sun's energy to the surface and back to space. This paper presents an analysis framework to describe propagation of input parameter variability to output data results in algorithmic computations, and then quantify the variability in the solution sets. The SRB shortwave algorithm and design of experiments (DOE) methods are utilised to determine significant input parameters and interactions. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to determine the variability in the output data for each dependent variable varying within their range using Monte Carlo simulation.

TI  - Soil variability and quantification based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bare soil images: A comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a worldwide need for detailed spatial information to support soil mapping, mainly in the tropics, where main agricultural areas are concentrated. In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (similar to 30-50%) when compared to the single-date images (similar to 20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture.

AB  - In order to improve the situation that the ground control points cannot be obtained in overseas regions and difficult measurement areas, solve the problem of difficulty in obtaining the ground control points and meeting demand for accuracy of block adjustment without ground control points, in this paper, based on the block adjustment, ICESat/GLAS laser points are proposed as known elevation control points to participate in block adjustment, and the runway method is used to evaluate the vertical accuracy of ZY-3 DSM products produced after block adjustment of stereo images. Experimental results show that the vertical accuracy of flat terrain produced in ZY-3 DSM products after adjustment assisted by ICESat/GLAS laser points is significantly improved comparing with the DSM products produced without control condition, and the elevation accuracy was improved by 2.47m on average.

TI  - Sea Ice Concentration Estimation: Using Passive Microwave and SAR Data With a U-Net and Curriculum Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice concentration estimates are typically acquired from algorithms using passive microwave satellite data, and from image analysis charts, but these have limitations. Estimates acquired from passive microwave data have coarse spatial resolution, may have errors due to atmospheric contamination, and often perform poorly in marginal ice zones. Image analysis charts are not as precise, subject to analyst interpretation, and only available over specific geographic areas. We have implemented a U-net with synthetic aperture radar images as inputs and use ice concentration estimates retrieved from passive microwave data as training labels. The U-net, due to not being sensitive to patch size, is shown to be an improvement over previous work with convolutional neural networks that use fully connected layers at the output. Data augmentation and an L1 loss function were applied along with a novel training scheme that leverages curriculum learning. In this training scheme, the model is first trained with samples from open water and consolidated ice regions before incorporating samples from marginal ice regions. In a tenfold cross validation experiment, we achieve 3-4% mean absolute error comparing to estimates using passive microwave data and observe curriculum learning models having more stable training. Predictions on four with-held SAR scenes with difficult ice conditions were evaluated with image analysis charts. A mean absolute error of 7.18% is achieved, which is lower than errors associated with passive microwave data alone. Qualitative improvements in marginal ice zone estimates are achieved, while still preserving smooth consolidated ice regions, and openings in ice cover.
